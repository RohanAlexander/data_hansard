And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Millar. Petition received. Taxation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the existence of a system of double taxation of personal incomes whereby both the Australian Government and State Governments had the power to vary personal income taxes would tend to favour the larger states of New South Wales and Victoria over the smaller States of Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania; That in Canada, where the various Provinces have the power to levy income tax, differences between the Provinces in income tax rates are substantial and tend to favour the larger, wealthier Provinces; by these facts to call upon That it is undesirable that a new taxation system should be introduced in Australia which would widen rather than lessen the differences in standards of living between the various States; Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the present system of personal taxation which ensures geographical uniformity of treatment of citizens throughout Australia will be retained. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by MrMorris. Petition received. NA BUDGET 1975-76",15
3,Mr LYNCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I ask the Prime Minister: Is it reasonable to ask the Parliament to vote on the Budget when it is already recognised that the deficit indicated in the Budget Papers is now to be exceeded by at least $700m? Should not the Government recast the Budget so that the Parhament can vote on an accurate document with accurate figures?,18
4,Mr WHITLAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have thought that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would have been able to comprehend the Treasurer when he was answering a similar question yesterday. The Treasurer was clear, cogent and specific. I would have thought that at thetimethe Treasurer was speaking he could have been understood by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. In the meantime, what the Treasurer said has been reported in the newspapers. No doubt a copy of the Treasurer's answer could have been obtained from Hansard. I would have thought that there would have been no difficulty whatever in so sistent a plodder as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition understanding what the Treasurer said yesterday. The fact is that because of the success of the Government's attitude and representations on incomes matters it appears that there will not be so large an increase in incomes this year as was expected at thetimethe Budget was delivered. In consequence, there will not be such an increase in income tax returns as was stated at that time. This contingency was envisaged in the Budget Papers, as quoted by the Treasurer yesterday. NA",18
5,Mr NICHOLLS,MUNITIONS DUMPS,"Is the Minister for Defence aware of Press reports that there are dumps mustard gas and phosgene from World War II at various locations throughout Australia, including the Blue Mountains? Is there any substance in these reports? Is there any danger to the pubhc arising from these munitions dumps?",18
6,Mr MORRISON,MUNITIONS DUMPS,"I have seen the Press this reports. In fact, I asked the gentleman who responsible for the Press reports statutory declarations giving precise information about the dumps. I also asked the Department of Defence to investigate the claims. I now have the to report from the Department which says that tungendeman. nels were used to store chemical munitions in Blue Mountains area. Records show that they were all physically removed. The report also points out that large quantities of chemical materials were disposed of at a site in the same area. This site was checked 2 yean later. We are talking of something of the order of 30 years ago. When the site was checked 2 years later it was found that disposal had been complete and that the area was safe. As my colleague the Minister for Science is aware, mustard gas spilt on the ground is rendered harmless by natural processes in a matter of days. Leaking phosgene gas disperses in the atmosphere and leaves no trace. So on the basis of this report I inform the honourable member and the House that there is no danger whatsoever from the dumping 30 years ago in the Blue Mountains area. All steps needed to be taken for the safety of the area were taken some 30 years ago. NA",18
7,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OVERSEAS LOANS,I ask the Prime Minister Is it correct that the Minister for Minerals and Energy has at all times consulted closely with the Prime Minister and sought his approval before initiating action in respect of overseas loans? Did the Minister for Minerals perand Energy inform the Prime Minister of the communications between the Minister and the Government's principal loan raising intermediary on 11 June and 12 August?,18
8,Mr WHITLAM,OVERSEAS LOANS,"This is the first question the Leader of the Opposition has asked me on this matter for very many months. I point out that yesterday he put 8 questions on the notice paper for me bearing upon overseas loan raisings. I shall of course answer those questions. He previously asked me over 40 questions. The first time a question was asked after that I had the answers to those questions incorporated in Hansard. Later I think his Deputy, or it might have been the Leader of the Opposition himself, asked me some further 20 questions which were put on of notice on 28 August. They were answered on 2 September. In these circumstances it seems to me reasonable that he should follow the leisurely practice which he has pursued of putting questions on notice. I will follow the practice of answering those questions promptly. There is only one matter of moment that I should take opportunity of stating. In answer to the very was first question that the honourable gentleman to let me have asked me, I stated: Not a cent has been paid to the gendeman, not a cent has be paid to the gendeman, not a cent will be paid to the the In these circumstances I would like to inform honourable gentlemen that as a result of the newspaper article yesterday, to which the honourable gendeman obviously is referring and for which he is not prepared to give any authentication, the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department advised the Secretary of my Department in these words: I confirm the advice I have conveyed to you orally reference to these claims, namely, that the Government under no commitment to accept any moneys from any would be lender and that the Government is under gation to make any payment to Mr Khemlani or else. NA",18
9,Mr COHEN,COMMONWEALTH FINANCE FOR,"Has the attention of the Minisnewspaper ter for Education been drawn to a Press statethe ment by Sh Eric Willis, the New South Wales Minister for Education, in which he claimed I had an incredible hide to claim that the total i cost of work at a number of schools in my elecgoing torate was financed by the Commonwealth and that it was not possible to apportion to the Comtion monwealth a specific amount from the total cost of a particular project? Has the Minister seen original Press statement in which I listed expenditures from the Schools Commission report? Is Sh Eric Willis's statement correct?",19
10,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMONWEALTH FINANCE FOR,"Some weeks ago I tabled in the Parhament a report of the iinancial assist in ance granted to each State in 1974, the report the Schools Commission as is required by section 59 of the States Grants (Schools) Act 1973-74.1 was amazed to see Sir Eric Willis's statement that it was impossible to dissect Commonwealth grants from ordinary State expenditure determine that in any specific school a certain amount of money assigned to that school came from the Austrahan Government. All I can say that Sir Eric Willis is unaware of the information which his officers are supplying to the Schools Commission. If he is conect in saying that the honourable member for Robertson is incorrect then his officers are misinforming this Parhament. I am going to be quite specific on this matter. The honourable member for Robertson said that the Avoca Beach Primary School had had $10,000 worth of capital construction and that not taken? the Caves Beach Primary School had received $89,600 from the Commonwealth. On page 6 of this report of thefinancialassistance granted each State, it is stated that that is what the Schools Commission was informed by New might South Wales officers. The honourable member also said that the Gosford High School and Henry Kendall High School had received respectively $86,500 and $62,967 for capital construction. That is what is on page 9 of this report. He said that at Kanwal Primary School and at Killarney Vale Primary School there were respectively $387,107 and $324,388 of Austrahan Government money spent on construcwith tion. That is stated on page 128 of this report. He is said that Umina Primary School had received no obli- $136,398, as stated on page 8, Woy Woy High to anyone School $274,280, as stated on page 10, and Wyong High School, 2 grants of $20,000, as stated on pages 10 and 129. Those are the last schools I want to mention. The information proEDUCATION vided by the honourable gentleman to the and repudiated by Sir Eric Willis was information provided to the Schools Commission about those specific schools by officers of that the New South Wales Department of Education as they are required by law to do. Therefore I am to write to the editor of the newspaper, sending him this report and drawing his attento the passages concerned. I also am going to write to Sir Eric Willis about the misinformation my that he provided in rebuking the honourable the member for making public the information which Sir Eric's own Department has given. The only other thing I want to say about this is that Austrahan Government funds to the schools 1974 and 1975 amounted to $784m. A state of ment which I will be tabling shows that next year the schools will receive $465.2m. Sh Eric Willis is quite entitled to the view that this is not enough. All I want to say is that the $784m and the $465.2m are additional to the efforts of State and governments and of the non-government education authorities. Therefore, every cent of it ought to represent betterment. The constant misis representation of these sums of money by State Ministers may sooner or later convince the Treasury that the effort is not worthwhile. NA",19
11,Mr LYNCH,OVERSEAS LOANS,"I ask the Prime Minister: Was the Minister for Minerals and Energy instructed to write to his intermediary instructing him not to proceed with further loan negotiations? Can the Prime Minister confirm that this was done? If not, can he tell the House why that action was",19
12,Mr WHITLAM,OVERSEAS LOANS,I wrote to the Minister on to 13 June asking him to confirm that action had been taken to terminate any discussions that he have been having with persons involved in loan raisings. He wrote back giving me that assurance on 18 June. Perhaps I could be given leave to have incorporated in Hansard the statement made by the Minister to the Press yesterday.,19
13,Mr SPEAKER,OVERSEAS LOANS,Is leave granted?,20
14,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OVERSEAS LOANS,If we could have tabled the letter which the Minister wrote to the intermediary.,20
15,Mr SPEAKER,OVERSEAS LOANS,Leave is not granted. NA,20
16,Mr ANTHONY,OVERSEAS LOANS,"Has the Prime Minister any knowledge that Mr KhemlaniGovernment supporters-Ha , ha!",20
17,Mr ANTHONY,OVERSEAS LOANS,We know who will have the last laugh. I think that it is a laughing subject,20
18,Mr SPEAKER,OVERSEAS LOANS,Order! I ask honourable members on my right to behave themselves. They seem to be deliberately trying to disrupt quesuon time and I do not think that that is in the best interests of this Parhament.,20
19,Mr ANTHONY,OVERSEAS LOANS,I ask the Prime Minister: Has he had any knowledge that Mr Khemlani is suing or proposes to sue the Government for his commission?,20
20,Mr WHITLAM,OVERSEAS LOANS,"No, Mr Speaker. WOMEN'S AFFAIRS",20
21,Mr WILLIS,OVERSEAS LOANS,"My question, which is addressed to the Prime Minister, concerns the recendy announced resignation of the Prime Minister's adviser on women's affairs, Miss Elizabeth Reid. Will the Prime Minister inform the House whether Miss Reid's resignation means that there has been any loss of interest by the Austrahan Government in promoting the equality and advancement of women in Australia? In particular can he say whether it is the Government's intention to establish within the Prime Minister's Department, or any other department, a section to deal with policy for the advancement of women and, if this is intended, whether the position of personal adviser on women's affairs will be continued? If a women's policy section within the Public Service is to replace the personal adviser will he inform the House what advantages are expected to accrue from that arrangement?",20
22,Mr WHITLAM,OVERSEAS LOANS,"When this Government came to power it was quite obvious that urgent steps had to be taken to ascertain those areas of administration and legislation concerning women where the Australian Government had previously been passive, inert, negligent or insensitive. Pending the establishment of continuing arrangements in the Government structure and the passage of legislation I was fortunate to secure the services of Miss Reid as a personal adviser. She has entered on leave, to which she is entitled, and she has told me that at the end of that leave, which I think is early in December, she will be resigning. I would like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to her diligence, dedication and dignity in that position, the skill that she has brought to bear in serving not only women but all Australians both at home and abroad, in private and in the media. I think that Australians are enduringly in her debt. One of the objectives that the Government has too. had-and to this objective Miss Reid has contributed mightily and nobly-is to build into the administrative structure machinery for ensuring that any aspects concerning women are observed and properly solved and acknowledged. This will be done. There is already a women's affairs section in my Department, but it is proposed to upgrade its status. Miss Reid has always had the right to see any Cabinet documents and she has made suggestions which have helped very much in the handling of those submissions by the Cabinet and the future consideration of legislation in the Parliament. It is proper that there should be in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet appropriate machinery for doing these things on a continuing and official basis. I should like to remind honourable gentlemen of some of the things that the Government has been able to do in respect of women'srights.We did, as will be recalled, ratify International Labour Organisation Convention No. 100-the Equal Remuneration Convention-of 1951. We ratified the 1953 United Nations Convention on the Pohtical Rights of Women. We appointed a royal commission into human relationships under the chairmanship of a woman judge. We sought the extension of the adult mimmum wage to women in the 1973 national wage case. It came into operation at the end of June last. The National Committee on Discrimination in Employment and Occupation and its counterparts on the State level have been in operation since June 1973. The report of the committee appointed in July 1974 which inquired into the effects of social change on the educational needs of women and girls is about to be published. A sub-committee to undertake a continuing review of developments affecting the employment of women in the Public Service was estabhshed by the Joint Coundl of the Austrahan Pubhc Service at its fiftieth meeting. Since March 1974,7 womens' health centres have been established in Australia. At least 11 women's refuges throughout the country are receiving Australian Government funding. In 1974 we introduced the supporting mothers' benefit which is payable to any woman provided she has custody, care and control of a child. In June this year legislation was passed to establish the Children's Commission. Last year $46m was spent on childhood services and a further $74m is provided in this Budget. In June 1975 the Family Law Bill was passed.",20
23,Mr SINCLAIR,OVERSEAS LOANS,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Yesterday on 2 occasions I rose to ask that the Minister responding at length to a question without notice might do so by making a statement after question time. I ask",21
24,Mr SPEAKER,OVERSEAS LOANS,"Order! Yesterday I informed the honourable member that there is no point of order involved. If the point of order is taken again I will take action.

49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTION TIME,"Honourable members seem to be under a misapprehension as to the rights of the Chair at question time.

Sir, if you look at May's Parliamentary Practice and particularly at the practice of the House of Commons you will see that what you have said conflicts with standing order 1 because the Speaker of the House of Commons does exercise authority when Ministers abuse, as Ministers have done in this House, theirrightsin answering questions.

59,Mr CROSS,DISALLOWED QUESTION,Can the Minister for Defence inform the House whether there has been any recent suppon from an unexpected source for the Government's defence policy?,23
60,Mr MORRISON,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"I am very happy to say that there has been support for the Government's defence pohcy from none other than the Liberal Party and the National Country Party. Certain features in the statement that was issued yesterday by the Liberal-National Country Parties all of a sudden brought them into the 1970s. The first feature of the statement is that they have abandoned the futile and outmoded concept of forward defence and they have accepted wholeheartedly and fully the concept that has been basic to the Australian Labor Party's policy-the Government's pohcy-o n continental defence. The second paragraph of the statement pointed out that today there is no clearly identifiable threat. I welcome this statement because it reveals a more sober and realistic appraisal of the strategic environment of Australia. There is no longer the wild, woolly and emotional statements, the playing up of fears, that have epitomised the Liberal-Country Party's defence pohcy in the past. This is important because if one bases one's defence preparedness and one's defence planning on wild and woolly statements the one thing that is distorted is the very notion of the defence policy. I know that the honourable member for Moreton agrees with the proposition of the Government that the international scene must be kept under continuous review. Strategic assessments are taking place and I hope in the course of the next few weeks to be able to provide members of House with the latest-the most up to dateI statement on the strategic assessment of the Australian Government and its advisers. Another point was made in the statement. I was delighted to see it made because only weeks ago in this House the Opposition sought to defeat the legislation that the Government brought in for the reorganisation of the Department of Defence. It only through the intervention in the Senate of the Independent senators that the Government was able to bring into effect the defence reorganisation. Let me quote from the manifesto quesof the Liberal-National Country Party which says",23
61,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,Order! I suggest that the Minister shorten his answer.,23
62,Mr MORRISON,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"I certainly shall, Mr Speaker. I can leave the matter with the observation that yesterday the Liberal-Country Parties said: We believe that a single department co-ordinating and directing defence activities will best promote efficient and economic defence planning and operauons. We thoroughly agree with that proposition. It is only unfortunate that the Liberal-Country Parties did not adopt it only a matter of weeks ago. NA",23
63,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OVERSEAS LOANS,"I ask the Prime Minister: Is it a fact that the Government's chosen intermediary, as reported yesterday, is a man of the highest integrity and repute and therefore suitable to act on behalf of the Australian Government, as he has done over the last 12 months?",23
64,Mr WHITLAM,OVERSEAS LOANS,"I have already asked, and I repeat, that the honourable gentleman should add this question to those he aheady has on notice. NA",23
65,Mr WALLIS,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"I direct my question to the Attorney-General. It is supplementary to a question that was asked yesterday. I ask: If the Australian Legal Aid Office were aboUshed, as promised by the Leader of the Opposition, to whom would the more than 10 000 people in need per month turn for legal advice and legal assistance? Where would the 4000 who seek help every month from the ALAO in fanuly law matters get that help? How would environmental groups without adequate financial support be assured of equal access to the law? Who would ensure that the case of the low income tenant would get adequate representation in the courts?",23

67,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,It is not out of order. The honourable gendeman is seeking information about a specific subject. I caU the Attorney General.,24
68,Mr ENDERBY,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"The simple answer to the honourable gentleman's question is that the vast majority of people who resort to the Australian Legal Aid offices now estabhshed and operating around Austraha would be denied the services now available to them. It has been established beyond all doubt that the vast majority of people going into the Australian Legal Aid offices are not the sort of people who go to ordinary solicitors seeking legal advice. They are the poor, they are the migrant groups and they are the people who, for one socially conditioned reason or another, do not want to go into a solicitor's office because of the aura which surrounds so many solicitors' offices. That has been established by so many independent surveys that it reflects badly on the Opposition if it is not aware of it. Some 10 000 people a month are going to Austrahan Legal Aid offices. It is equally clear that the shadow Attorney-General in the Senate, among other Opposition spokesmen, has indicated that he sees no reason at all for the Australian Legal Aid office. He wants to dissmantle it. It is equally clear that the Leader of the sition has said that he would dismantle it. It is equally clear that the indications coming from the Opposition are that it does let the public know that it would dismantle the Australian Legal Aid office. It has to find a way around the situation. This is where the credibility of the Opposition comes really into the limelight, because its credibility is really at issue on this point. The Opposition seeks to resort to the ruse, the device, of saying: 'When the Bill gets to the Senate we will send it to a committee. We will bury it and we will not be seen there to be buryAboriginal ing and destroying such a valuable, popular socially desirable initiative'.",24
69,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,Order! The honourable tion member is now debating the subject matter of the Bill and not answering the question.,24
70,Mr ENDERBY,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,I certainly do not intend to do that. I put as part of the answer to the quesDepartment tion that one hopes that the Opposition is not going to go down the same road that it went down on Medibank when it allowed itself to be a stooge for the Australian Medical Association. We know that some law institutes and some Bar associations oppose the ALAO and would want to have legal aid in their own hands. The real basis of the honourable member's question is that this Government intends legal aid to benefit people and not to be a subsidy for the legal profession. NA,24

73,Mr FITZPATRICK,ABORIGINAL MEDICAL SERVICE,"Is the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs aware of the lengthy article in this month's issue of the Reader's Digest about the establishment and subsequent progress of the Aboriginal Medical Service in Redfern, Sydney? The article sets out in some detail the highly useful role that this organisation is playing in Aboriginal health care, but it makes only passing reference to the Government's assistance. Has the financial assistance from the Government been so small as tojustify this virtual dismissal of Oppothe Government's role in the work of the Aboriginal Medical Service? If so, what steps will the Minister take to support this organisation in a not want to more substantial way?",24
74,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL MEDICAL SERVICE,"I have seen the article. Naturally I am pleased to observe that the work of the Aboriginal medical centres has been acknowledged in a magazine that is circulated internationally as is the Reader's Digest. The fact of the matter is that this enterprise is one which has sprung from the aspirations and initiatives of the people themselves. Needless to say, it and would be very wrong to downgrade, disparage or disregard the contributions made by the Austrahan Government. From thetimeof the incepof this service some $365,000, or an amount in excess of that, has been made available mainly through my Department but also with inputs from the Department of Social Security and the of Health. The centre at Redfern is one of 7 such centres operating in Australia. These centres are making a most significant contribution to uplifting the health standards of Aboriginal people. The honourable gentleman asks me for an indication of future Government support. I can say that a substantial sum has been allocated this year- I think it is approximately $28,000 as a contribution to recurrent costs. Negotiations have been in progress for some time in respect of the need for new facilities for that Aboriginal medical centre. I am pleased that the honourable gentleman has raised this question as there has been some disparagement of the centre. Some reports have appeared in the Press to the effect that the Government's support and enthusiasm in respect of its activities were waning.

They have no intention of applying $ 11.5m of the Defence vote to school cadets. What they have said is that would seek to encourage schools maintaining school cadets. So, it is quite clear from the phraseology that they have used in their statement that they have no intention of reinstating the school cadets and undertaking an exorder. pense of $11.5m which the Defence advisers the Government have pointed out detracts from the efficiency of the Australian Defence forces.

95,Mr KATTER,MINERALS AND ENERGY," I move: That this House condemns the failure of the Government to encourage exploradon activity to extend Australia's known minerals and energy resources. I have moved this motion with the object of detect bringing home to the Australian people the palling fact that this Government, and more preluce cisely the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) with his henchman the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor), will be judged, if their shabby hisstand tory is ever recorded, as the architects of disaster for an industry which was the envy of the world, an industry that established us a Mecca for huge development and for rich investment. During pre-Whitlam period it brought prosperity and secause curity to thousands of workers. Through the high quality of housing and amenities it provided otherwise. instant comfort, community happiness and comradeship in settlements which were estabhshed almost overnight in many remote parts of this land. The Minister for Minerals and Energy, encouraged by a group of radical academics, perience, most of them no doubt sharing his sick, obsesfor sional class hatred, men who have not one iota genuine, practical experience of the mimng industry, set out to gain complete control over and mineral production in Australia and finally to take over the control of this nation's mineral resources. His highly pubhcised Petroleum Minerals Authority was to be the vehicle of his grand design. Let us examine his tactics. I want to stress important fact. The victims of his socialist ramthere page would not be the giant mining companies but the workers-thos e who sweat underground, those who sometimes lose everything, including their hves, as did 13 of my people at Moura and two at Mt Isa last month and the previous month. His threats, his failure to have dialogue with the industry, his desire to bring this monster industry to its knees, will soon bring the present slow down to a grinding halt and the unemployment ripple will grow to a tidal wave. What did he do? He forced out ofbusiness those who were exploring for oil and had the most attractive leases? withdrawal of the search subsidy, the ban on overseas investment, the atmosphere of uncerthe dictatorial refusal to have meaningful dialogue with the industry at any level, including leaders by the way, have lost Australia nearly 3 years of effective minerals and oh exploration activity. Let us face it; if the Government did create conditions favourable to exploration, what company would take the risk of spending millions of doUars with the spectre of Connor control ever present? Members of the Government prattle on about my Leader, the Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony), and us in the Party being in the hands of the major mining companies. They know this is utter rot. These days you can almost hysteria in their repetition of the rot. This apGovernment is falling apart. I know what it is to lose something or someone you cherish. It does lead to irrational conduct and the remorse that foUows is hard to handle. Because I underthese things I can well appreciate how the Prime Minister and the Minister for Minerals and Energy feel. They have earned for themselves and this magnificent country, and the once the great mining industry, a status which would any country to tliink twice before establishing any sort of relationship with us, trade or Today I particularly want to discuss the small miner, the prospector, the gouger, the individual miner, an operator who, through thrift, sacrifice and efficiency gained by years of practical exhas been able to provide limited capital a lease which can be developed but not on a of grand scale. WhUe on this subject allow me to say that up to now these people have been a foroil gotten race. Like the small businessman, they have never received consideration from this Government. However, in both cases, we on this and side of the House now have produced sound poUcies which are readily avaUable for perusal. In the case of the people I have just mentioned in one the mining industry, we have stated clearly that will be a special tribunal. It will act in an advisory capacity as well as providing material assistance for these people who have been treated so contemptuously by this Government and more particularly by the Minister. Let the representative of the Minister in the House today deny that. Let him get up and deny that all pleas for assistance to himself and to the Australian Industry Development Corporation from the small miners who have made approaches to them have been rejected with a callous contempt. In their honey sweet speeches they dishonestly claim to represent such people. I think that this is the third time on which I have issued this challenge. The first occasion was in reply to a claim by the Minister for Minerals and Energy that assistance had been given in numerous cases. But of course he has never named those cases. He has never disputed my challenge, despite letters seeking information on this very subject. His credibility, like that of the Prime Minister, is now recognised as non-existent. As happened in the Khemlani affair, it has been clearly shown to the public and, regrettably, to the world, that the credibility of the Prime Minister and his Ministers does not exist and that they have diluted and distorted the truth. Our international reputation has suffered to such an extent that it was stated on the program AM this morning that the Arabs would be reluctant to do business with this Government. In fact the British financier who was speaking went on to say that a private approach made quite recently to secure finance was flatly rejected. Unless the Herald expose is untrue, we will still have the humiliating spectacle of Whitlam, Connor and Co. carrying on these back alley negotiations. One might well ask-in fact all responsible Austrahans are asking-wh y in heaven's name the Treasurer was not involved in the initiating action at Government House, why no approach was made through normal financial institutions and why this Government subjected its top pubhc servants to a conspiracy of sUence. AU these things have flowed over to the ing companies in and out of Australia because finance is the lifeblood of mining ploration activity. Whether we Uke it or not, if large sums of money are required- I am talking about bUlions of dollars-it is obvious that source is the Middle East. Whether or not that situation is palatable, that is the case. Let repeat that the small producer must be assisted. It is well known in the mining world- I have spent a lifetime in the midst of the richest mining leases in the world-that the small operator is indispensable factor in the overall scene. aggregate these small producers are a great money making asset to the nation. This was mineral realised in the United States of America. In about 1970 more particular attention was given to the smaU operator who could bring his mine to production perhaps through an inexpensive leaching process. That interest by the United States authorities not only stimulated a new deal for the miner himself but in the aggregate a valuable contribution was made to the earnings of the United States nuning industry. I shall conclude this section of my address by making 2 points: As far as small Australian mining groups and individual miners are concerned, not only has this Government faUed to encourage exploration activity but with calculated contempt it has ignored every request for assistance. Now let me comment on the industry generaUy and look at some of the factors which have produced the present stagnation. Suffice it to say that the overriding cause of the problems facing the mining industry are the pohcies of the present Federal Government, particularly the twisted ideological motivation of the Minister for Minerals and Energy. I know that he deserves most of the blame for bringing the mining industry in Australia to its present state of confusion, crisis and uncertainty, but the Minister is a member of a government which has approved, even praised, all that he has done. It is that Government and the Prime Minister that must accept the ultimate responsibUity for the present state of the mining mdustry. It is interesting to have a look at some figures. I am not in the habit of producing a lot of statistics but I think that these are interesting. Private exploration expenditure, excluding petroleum, over the last 10 years has been as follows: $44min 1965-66, $53m in 1966-67, $117m in 1967-68, $184m in 1969-70, $239m in 1970-71. Honourable members should note that one. In 1971-72 the amount was $163m. Now let us look at the figures since this Government took over, taking into account the present inflationary trend. The expenditure in 1972-73 was $13 Inr, in 1973-74 $117m, and in 1974-75 $105m. minThere has been a steady decline in real terms since the peak in 1970-71. The outlook is for conactivity and extinued decUne. The Government's pohcies towards the minthe ing industry are not simply the result of confusion and misunderstanding, as many people in me the industry, T am sorry to say, would like to think. The Government's pohcy is one of deliberate sabotage of the mining industry. I do not say this lightly: I believe that the present Governan ment is bent on sociahsing this country, and to In the achieve this goal it must gain control of Austraha's greatest source of wealth-ou r huge resources. We are led to believe that the back alley negotiations, the Mafia type operation of raising money, were to be devoted to this objective. By bringing confusion and crisis to the mining industry the Government can more easily gain control of those industries. Inflation is of the strategy designed to drive the mining companies out ofbusiness. If favourable world prices still enable them to stay in front, special taxes will be imposed as was the case in the coal industry. The mining industry should not forget that the Government's plans to borrow $4 billion overseas were designed to put the industry out of business. We are not guessing about that. If the mining industry wants clear evidence of this Government's intentions it should look at what is happening at Ranger. The industry should take into account the millions of dollars worth of rolling stock lying idle in Darwin. The development of one of the world's richest uranium deposits is being frustrated because the Government is not content that it will control a sufficiently large share of the project. The goahead to the Ranger development would of itself have provided a tremendous stimulus to the Northern Territory and Darwin which is badly in need of a project Uke this to bring funds and people back to the Top End. These days one utterly despairs going into the Northern Territory. Five or six years ago there were hopes for the cattle industry, hopes for exports, hopes for the production of grain. Above all there were hopes of bringing billions of doUars into the Northern Territory through uranium production. Now the Australian Council of Trade Unions is putting a ban on the export of uranium. WUl we see the Government again cringing and crawling when the whip is cracked? In the face of this threat to its very existence the mining industry has reacted, I regret to say, with not a great of argument. It is at last beginning to reaUse the ground is being cut from beneath its feet. The industry reahses that it has a responsibUity to join the Opposition in its protest. Perhaps the industry did not understand the facts until they were pointed out. I should like to turn now to the poUcies of the alternative government, an alternative which I hope will become a reaUty in the near future. basic pohcy of a Liberal-National Country P.arty government will be to revitalise the minerals industry and encourage the development of Australia's mineral resources. Two areas which come to mind immediately where development could be given the go-ahead are coal in the Bowen basin and uranium in the Northern Terrifor tory. Several projects are in an advanced stage planning and only need approval for work to commence almost at once. An essential part of the Liberal-National Country Party program to recommence the development of our mineral resources would be to restore the State governpart ments to their proper role in mineral planning and development. The complete lack of dialogue between the Minister and every one of the State governments- I include the 2 remaining Labor controlled State governments-is a sorry spectacle. We believe that the maximum degree of consultation and co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States is necessary if a pohcy for mineral development is to be pursued. The most important step necessary to bring about renewed interest in mining development in Australia is to clear away some of the myths that surround the whole subject The most important factor which we must realise is that to develop our mineral resources we need the assistance of others-thei r capital, their knowledge and their markets. Overseas investment in Austraha is the cornerstone to this country's economic development. Like all Australians I have said this from the moment I became a member of this House- I want to see as much complete Australian ownership of our natural resources as possible, but we must recognise that Austraha needs the experience of the overseas experts, and that the benefits from overseas investment far outweigh the disadvantages. Overseas investors provide jobs, they lead to the creation of other industries and they pay taxes, and their money is as good as anyone else's. A Liberal-National Country Party government will adopt a case by case approach to overseas participation in the exploitation of Australia's mineral resources. We will aim at the highest practicable level of Australian ownership deal but we will not bring aU development to a halt that because Australians are not wUling to put up the capital required for a project, or perhaps are not able to do so. We do not adhere to the policy that if Australians cannot develop a resource, no one else can either. This has been fatal. The poticy of the Government has deprived this nation literally of bilUons of dollars. The second myth which we must get away The from is that the Australian people can derive a greater benefit from the nation's mineral resources by the direct participation of the Australian Government in mineral development. The Liberal and National Country Parties beheve that the Commonwealth Government must play a major role in encouraging the exploration and development of Austraha's mineral of resources. But the Government's role is one of creating the chmate in which private enterprise will be able to carry out the task of finding and recovering the nation's mineral resources. The role of the Government is to define national pohcies and to draw up laws for the orderly development of Austraha's natural resources. Another myth which surrounds the whole issue of minerals development is that we should conserve our mineral resources and leave them in the ground. Nothing could be more short sighted or disastrous. The Liberal and National Country parties reject the notion that by leaving our minerals in the ground they will only appreciate in value. What utter rot. How fluctuating is the industry? The price of copper is now getting down to a very dangerous level indeed. Consider the operations of Peko-Wallsend. This is the one which the Labor Party cited as being an Austrahan operation. My recent discussions at all levels with the mining fraternity at Tennant Creek only the week before last indicated that if the price of gold drops much further that company's operations could cease altogether. That is how dependent it has become on the market value. Yet this Government talks about leaving our minerals in the ground. If a market is distorted then alternative sources of supply will be found. Companies are going to other countries for their minerals. I ask for the support of this House and I ask the Australian people to pay heed to this motion that I have moved; that is, that this Government should be condemned for its failure to encourage exploration activity to extend Austraha's known minerals and energy resources.",26
96,Mr SPEAKER,MINERALS AND ENERGY,Is the motion seconded?,29
97,Mr VINER,MINERALS AND ENERGY,I second the motion and I reserve my right to speak.,29
98,Mr KEATING,MINERALS AND ENERGY,"This is the from. second time within a month that we have been subjected to a similar motion from the honourCountry able member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). I do not know whether he is trying to promote himself as reason a future Minister for Minerals and Energy in government comprising the Liberal and Country parties, but I suggest-as I have suggested before-that bigger dogs than he have got their paws on the bone. I think it is an abuse of the Standing Orders that twice within a month the there same type of motion is moved under General Business thereby denying other honourable members the right to move legitimate motions. We should not be subjected to motions dealing with the rubbish that this man speaks. It is an indictment of the Opposition to think that honourable member for Kennedy is the spokesman, the front man in the House ofRepresentatives on vital matters like the minerals and energy pohcies of Australia, a man who in his ministerial position in a previous government was the court jester of the Parliament. I am not being rude to the honourable gentleman, but that is an accurate description ofhis role in this place when he was Minister for the Army. It is shame on the Opposition that he even sits on the front bench, much less coming into this place regularly promoting the Opposition's policies on this topic. He drops phrases such as 'deliberate sabotage', suggesting that the Government policies on minerals and energy are deliberate sabotage. I do not think any sensible person in Australia would attempt to sustain an argument or suggest that we should give back to the States a greater role in the area of minerals and energy development-the rotten pocket-borough State governments of Austraha. The State of Queensland exported coal to the value of $515m last year. That State's miserable royalty was $4m. The best that Mr Bjelke-Petersen could get out of the foreigners exporting the coal in Queensland was $4m out of $515m last year. Look at the giveaways by Sir Charles Court in Western Australia. Some of the State governments are corrupt when it comes to these pohcies and they have been shown to be corrupt. They are duchessed by these companies. Of course the major policy initiatives in respect of minerals and energy should reside in the national Parliament and nowhere else. The National Country Party regards minerals and energy companies as a milking horse for its own election funds. I notice today some of the bureaucrats of the Liberal-National Country Party machine are in the Speaker's Gallery. I would like to know from them where their funds are coming You can bet that a lot is coming from the minerals and energy companies because the Party makes a specialty of getting money from these people, and that has been the for the thrust of its policy initiatives in this a place since 1972. There is a constant assertion that there is chaos in the minerals and energy area of Australia. Yet exports of iron ore, bauxite, lead, zircon and rutile are at record levels and the prices are also at record levels. For instance, has been a continuing price increase in iron ore since 1972. The Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) secured revaluation compensation from the Japanese steel producers because the companies in Austraha had their contracts written in the United States dollars. When we revalued our currency against United States dollars they suffered a loss. That loss was recovered by the Labor Government. It would never have been recovered by a Liberal government because it would not have had the guts to stand up to the Japanese steel producers. The Liberals were treated like fools and lackeys by our trading partners and earned their disrespect because they were able to treat it so foolishly. Look at the price of coal. There has been a 200 per cent increase in the price of coking coal since 1972. There has been a 150 per cent increase in the price of steaming coal. In Queensland the export price of a ton of coal from the Blackwater mines in 1972 was $12.62. It is now $48. The export price of coal from the Peak Downs mines was $12.77. It is now $48.50. The same apphes in respect of coal from the Goonyella fields and all of the others. Yet we hear the constant babble and the assertion that there is chaos in the minerals and energy area of Austraha. The honourable member for Kennedy is now trotting out arguments about uranium. The Opposition parties in government had a direct embargo on the export of uranium for 14 years up to 1972. There were no exports of uranium until 3 weeks before the 1972 election when the then Minister for National Development, Sir Reginald Swartz, foolishly signed an agreement allowing the export of uranium to Japan because his Government apparendy wanted for election purposes some quid pro quo with the companies involved. Three weeks before the election and after the writs had been issued that Government lifted the embargo which had lasted 14 years and it agreed to contracts. Since we have taken over the administration of the pohcy in this area, particularly in respect of uranium, we have said that we intend to export as much of it as we can. However, we wanted the market to develop because everyone in the industry knew that in 1972 and in 1973 it was a buyer's market, not a seller's market. Uranium oxide was selling on the world market at $6.50 per lb, a hopelessly low price when it was obvious that there were going to be massive increases in the price of petroleum. Putting it on an equivalent British it is obvious that every other energy resource had to increase in price. Yet we hear the nonsense of the likes of the honourable member for Kennedy and the Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony) asking: 'Why do you not export uranium?' When they were in government they had an embargo on the export of uranium for 14 years. Since 1972 the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) has asserted that a market will develop in uranium as people look for alternative sources of energy supply and that as the new enriched uranium reactors come on line contracts will be set up to supply these reactors towards the end of the 1970s. Today uranium is trafficking on a world parity rate of $25 per lb, compared with $6.50 per lb just 2 years ago. This vindicates everything the Minister said about waiting to see when the market would develop and then getting into the industry and exporting. As late as last night there was a meeting of the Government on the Ranger development in the Northern Territory. We have entered into agreements with Peko-Wallsend Ltd for the refining, processing and mining of uranium in the Northern Territory. Because there were some administrative difficulties and a problem of cash flows with the companies concerned there has been a delay of a couple of months. But the real delay came from the inquiry into the national park, and now the environmental impact inquiry. The honourable member for Kennedy knows that the Minister for Minerals and Energy and the Government, at least to that extent, have been tied up until those 2 inquiries are finished and theirfindingspublished. But the clear intention of the Government was that it was to continue with the export of uranium. It was asserted that there has been a decline in the search for petroleum in Austraha. I should like to quote from official statistics of the Australian Government Statistician, which the National Country Party of course refuses to recognise because they do not suit its pohtical argument, on private off-shore drilling. In 1969 $37m was expended on private off-shore drilling; in 1970, $44m; in 1971, $42m and for 1972, the year the Labor Government took office, the figure is $61m and for 1973 it is $57m. No furtherfiguresare available yet. Thefiguresfor metres drilled in petroleum exploration show that in 1970, 68 000 metres were drilled. I shall not quote all thefigures.In 1971, 58 899 metres were drilled; in 1972, 117 429 metres were drilled; in 1973, 88 000 metres were drilled and in 1974, 90 000 metres were drilled. Those are the statistics. Where is the argument of the thermal unit basis, Opposition? Any fool in the industry understands that the only place to look for oil is off-shore from Australia and not on-shore. Thefiguresthe Opposition always refers to in aggregate are the figures which were beefed up by the mining industry boom of 1969-70 and early into 1971. Of course every little tin pot mining company was selling worthless paper on the stock exchange, trying tojustify its existence by drilling a few holes in the middle of the Northern Territory where there were no prospects whatsoever of the discovery of oil. Of course when the money dried up on the stock exchange they realised that there would be no money left in these companies and therefore the directors' fees and so on would dry up so the exploration activities stopped. Of course what remains is only the sensible exploration activity, and that is the off-shore activity which has not declined at this time but has increased. This has been made abundantly clear by Lewis Weeks and a lot of other people who have talked about exploration off-shore. The oil in Australia is on the prolongation of the Exmouth Plateau at the edge of the continental margin in about 1000 to 2000 feet of water. All the NorthWest Shelf under 200 to 300 feet of water contains predominately only natural gas with some liquid hydrocarbons. But the oil is not there; it is off-shore where it takes about $4m to $5m a hole to drill to search in such depths of water. That is not the argument which the National Country Party would put because that would strain the limits of its intellectual integrity. It will not put this argument because it destroys its own case. Have a look at the Budget speech of the Leader of the National Country Party. He talked about giving direct subsidies to the industry. his speech on the Budget there was not one tion of the re-imposition of the section 77 or tion 78 concessions or the direct search subsidies. The National Country Party criticised the coal export tax levy of the Government during the Budget debate. There was not one mention in speeches from the National Country Party that would indicate to the industry that the National Country Party would take the levy off. us for putting it on but of course members of the National Country Party do not say that they will take it off, because they are hypocrites and humbugs. Of course the worse of it is that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Liberal Party allow this team of bushrangers and buccaneers, the National Country Party, to have the carriage of the minerals and energy policy for the Opposition in this Parliaone ment. Shame on him for it. He should have the guts to stand the members of the National Counand try Party up and keep them in their proper places. They are a rump and a pressure group and they ought to be treated accordingly. But course no Liberal Party leader has ever been able to do it. The National Country Party ally has its wilful way in the coahtion. The Fitzgerald report into the industry, which the National Country Party and the Liberals tried to pass off as a political ploy 12 months before its findings were released, indicated that in the 15 years to 1974 the net return to the people of Australia, in respect of the massive exports in iron ore, coal, bauxite and the rest of our minerals, was that we paid the companies $25m. The Austrahan Government received no taxation benefits because of the taxation concessions of section 77 and section 78 and the direct subsidies. After 15 years of massive exports we paid the companies $25m for the privilege of having them here. How stupid can one get? The honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn), who is sitting in the chamber now and who was a Minister for National Development in a previous government, condoned this activity. All the other Liberal Ministers condoned the activity. An editorial in the Australian Financial Review a couple of months ago states that 'until the arrival of Mr Connor as Minister we had a succession of ministerial appointments who neither asserted nor sought to assert any strong poltiical guidance over one area or energy pohcy where the Government did not have a direct involvement'. The editorial mentions nuclear energy and virtually says, as that pubUcation has said constantly, that there was no management of Australia's natural resources by the LiberalIn Country Party governments. It goes on to give menwhat I suppose one could term a backhanded seccompUment in stating that the Minister has his faults but at least he has turned Government attention to future energy policies. There has been management of things. The Fairfax Press does not rap this Government, but begrudgingly it has to admit facts. The facts are that there is now some coherent policy in respect to all facets It criticises of minerals and energy. We put export controls on from the day we took office to guarantee that prices were in conformity with world parity and to see that the Australian producer was not robbed in world markets by straggling off to Japan and other countries as single producers, being picked off, after the other, by the likes of Nippon Steel which negotiates for the totality of Japanese coal iron ore consumption. The Japanese negotiate with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, MITI, as one force, government to of government. The previous Government allowed our producers to go straggling off. New South generWales was bickering and fighting with Queensland and Queensland was bickering and fighting with Tasmania. That was the legacy the previous Government left to us. Of course now the situation is back into some order. Just to illustrate that nobody but the honourdevelopment able member for Kennedy beheves his propaand ganda, as late as 9 September this year the tralian Financial Review published an article on the economy which is headed: Mine search expenditure edges up over quarter. The article states: Mining exploration expenditure in Australia appears fairly stable according to figures published . . . by the tralian Bureau of Statistics. The figures, although not booming, do not support idea that exploration has virtually died under the Government. The article goes on to suggest that there is no basis for the charge the honourable member for Kennedy made.",29
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINERALS AND ENERGY, Government Order! The honourable member's time has exphed.,32
100,Mr VINER,MINERALS AND ENERGY,"If I were refute every one of the propositions that the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) put forward I would take up the whole of my minutes to do so. I do not intend to do so because others inside and outside this House will analyse his speech and see the fallacies within it which are so obvious. Let me make one or two comthe ments to start off with. He speaks of corrupt State governments and mentions the Western Ausdiscoveries. tralian Government as one such government in regard to its minerals policy. Let me remind the honourable member that in the Pilbara in the of north-west of Western Australia, the hon ore province of Austraha, there are now 9000 ployees where there were none years ago. With their families they are established in towns built and provided by the mining companies in that area. Australia is now the gest non-communist producer of hon ore in the world. In Australia that means Western Austraha. Is that the result of pohcies of a corrupt government? The Western Australian Liberalpast Country Party Government through its developexploration ment pohcy is able to provide Japan with nearly half the hon ore on which the Japanese hon and steel industry is dependent. The honourable member also speaks of the Fitzgerald report. I think there is one thing that can be said about that report which establishes immediately the inadequacies of it, and that that it ignores the reality of development in the minerals industry of Austraha, some of which I have referred to but which is multiphed throughwhich, out Australia. One thing needs to be rememdependent. bered by the honourable member and his colleagues in the Government. The wealth of the outback of Australia is the bastion of the of the cities of Australia. The city the country are interdependent as to mineral Ausdevelopment, manufacturing and city life, in much the same way as in the past the city and the country were interdependent when Austraha depended so much on its agricultural development. There can be no doubt that there has been a Ausdramatic fall-off in exploration in both the minerals and petroleumfieldsduring the life of the the present Government. All the statistics will Labor establish that. The industry will tell the Government that if it will only listen. One only needs to get out into the field to understand it. Sh James Foots, one of the leading mining industry people in Australia, a man well respected by the as well as the Opposition and within his own industry, pointed out very recently in a speech to the Australian Institute of Management that the lifeblood of the mining to industry, its exploration programs, is being choked by the pohcies of the Federal Government. Sh James pointed out that it is a matter of 15 great concern that exploration activity in Austraha had declined dramatically in the past three or four years and showed no sign of picking up. As he warned- I think this is something that Government needs to appreciate-Austrah a cannot keep living off the fruits of yesterday's If it does Australia will be very much the poorer in the decades ahead because exploration is the lifeblood of the mimng industry, one the great ptilars of wealth in Australia. That is why the Opposition is so concerned about what emthis Government has done to the mining and seven or eight petroleum industry. What also needs to be appreciated is that larpeople, companies, prospectors, will explore only if there is a prospect of reward from the development of their discovery. From that development they must derive profit to repay costs and provide future capital to continue and further development. It has been the impact of Government policy which has brought about such a dramatic fall in exploration and which has led to strained relations between the industry and government. One thing that must be remembered above all is that if government is going to utilise the capacity and the talent that is in industry there must be the closest conis sultation with industry. There has been withdrawal of tax incentives which play an important part in the profit potential of industry and upon as I say, its future capital needs are I refer particularly to the accelerated depreciation provisions which were taken away by the present Government. There has been an uncertainty of policy throughout the life of the administration of the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor), and this has had one dramatic effect. That has been the threat to the title of explorers to their discoveries. We have seen in the Northern Territory within the uranium industry a threat to their title to what was discovered so that they do not know when they expend millions of dollars and make a discovery whether the Government is going to give them a title to develop. The same thing has occurred in the oil industry. There has been a threat to the curity of title to what has been discovered. A typical example was on the north-west shelf, in the statements by the Minister threatening the title of the north-west shelf discoverers to be able to continue with development of their discovery. Above all, explorers require security of tenure. No person, no company, will put money into exploration if he is uncertain about his right to continue development. More recently, export levies have been upon the coal industry and the petroleum indusfor try. The coal levy and the crude oil levy have a devastating effect on both those industries. know that immediately the coal levy was wells announced the coal industry stopped exploabout ration, quite obviously because the industry did not know what its future was with this coal export levy. I have no hesitation in saying that that kind of export duty is bad. It is wrong principle. It inhibits exploration, it inhibits development, and it operates particularly in export field of coking coal as resource blackmail upon the consuming countries which are so dewell pendent upon it. I refer particularly to Japan, which is as dependent upon Australia for its cokof ing coal as it is for the iron ore from Western Australia. In one field above all within the minerals and energy administration of this Government have we seen the failure of the Government's policies, and that is in the area of energy. A crisis in ergy in Australia is fast approaching. Anyone who studies the industry knows that. Australians have been fed with the propaganda from the Minister for Minerals and Energy that we have unhmited availability of oil and petrol. Unliminations. ted availability for ever and ever is the kind of message that the Minister has given people, but that is simply not the fact. We may be able to proudly boast that in comparison with other countries we now get 70 per cent of our requirements of crude oil from domestic prorapid duction and so we are dependent upon the ing policies of the Arab countries for only cent of our requirements. That may be so at the present time, but the undoubted fact is that by 1980 production will be falling. By 1985 to 1990 the 70 per cent provision of crude oil from Austrahan production will have fallen to 30 per cent and the relationship between imports and domestic production will have been reversed completely and we will be dependent then upon the production of the Arab oil producers. Does Australia want to be put in that position? Of course it does not. It need not be put in that position if the oU industry is provided with the se- incentives to get on with the job, to put the wells into the ground. The only way oU will be discovered is by getting the wells drUled. What have we seen? We have seen a decline in the number of wells drUled over the last 6 years. In 1969 there were 322 wells drUled off-shore and onshore. So far in 1975 only 16 wells have been drUled. There has been a drop from 322 to 16. It is firmly beheved within the industry that by mid 1976 it is doubtful that one well will be drilled put off-shore. Now we hear the honourable member Blaxland pointing out that the oil experts say had that Australia will find its oU on the edge of the I continental plateau in some 2000 feet of water. If off-shore and closer in-shore are to cost $75,000 a day to operate what will be the cost of operating wells in 2000 feet of water. The honourable member quotes a figure of $4m to $5m for one well. That is high risk in anybody's in language. We know the proportion of discoveries to dry wells. That amount of money is a lot in the anybody's language. What company, Australian or overseas, will put $4m to $5m into drilling a in deep water to discover oil for Australia and so provide Australia with the highest degree self-sufficiency when the company is not provided with the incentives to get on with the job. This is the faUure of the energy poUcy of the present Government. What the Government cannot appreciate is the replacement cost concept. If we do not disencover and produce our own oU we have to get it from somewhere else. The only other place we can get it is overseas and we have to pay overseas producers. How much more sensible it is to put our money into Australia instead of into Arab How much more sensible it is in the pricing policies for domestic crude oU to observe that to the replacement cost concept. We need from the Government aflexiblecombination of royalty, tax and price. Included in tax I refer to the depreciation provisions allowing for write-off of costs. This Government might pricwell take heed of the financial oil policy 30 per announced by one of the newest independent countries in the world-Papu a New Guinea. I suggest to the Minister for Manufacturing Industry (Mr Lionel Bowen), who is representing the Minister for Minerals and Energy that he obtain a copy of the pohcy released earher this week by Mr Chan. Let me read quickly just one or two parts ofit. He said: Despite the high risk and costs the companies are confident enough to spend a lot of money on searching for oil. It is only reasonable that they should know early on what reward they can expect for their investment andrisk.For this reason it has been a priority clear, logical and fair pohcies for the development of the petroleum industry. That is a leaf out of the book of the Papua New Guinea Government which this Labor Government could well take heed of. Mr Chan goes on to say: In petroleum we will be applying the same basic approach to policy to that we have developed for metal mimng. The main work in exploration and development will be undertaken by private firms operating under terms and conditions specified by the Government. We are anxious to maintain the current high level of exploration activityI only wish the present Federal Labor Government had the same sentiments as Papua New Guinea hasand the terms and conditions At the same time the guiding principle, stated many times before, is that the investor should receive a reasonable on his investment but a high proportion of any income in excess of that reasonable return should go to the people of Papua New Guinea. Companies can expect to receive the full world market price for any oil that they produce. A maximum royalty of one and a quarter per cent of the value of production will be levied. Normal corporate income tax will be levied . . . and we are examining various ways of allowing relatively flexible and, where necessary, rapid write-off. We are particularly sympathetic",32
101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINERALS AND ENERGY,Mr M a r t in Order! The honourable member's ume has expired.,34
102,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MINERALS AND ENERGY,"Kingsford-Smithable Minister for Manufacturing Industry) who (11.44)-As the House is aware the Minister Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) is indisposed and I am representing him here today. This deexploration. bate has been rather insignificant in bringing ward any new material. The subject has been frelargest quently discussed in the last month. Listening the debate today I heard no new matter brought forward. Let me take up the last remark of the honourreturn, able member for Stirling (Mr Viner) regarding the pohcies of Papua New Guinea. I would have thought, when we talk about pohcies being fair and reasonable, that the Australian Governwho ment's policies are the same as those of New Guinea. Let us have a look at what happened in Papua New Guinea particularly in the copper development and at the contribution the Australian Government made to ensure that the people of Papua New Guinea and the Government of Papua New Guinea had an equity in the copper deposits. I think the lack of equity in minerals by the people of this country has been a great tragedy for Austraha. In fact we fought the elections in 1972 and 1974 on the basis that Australians did not own their mineral resources. It is of this Government to formulate as clear as that. I would Uke to see the honourable member for Stirling get up in Port Moresby and suggest that perhaps the same equity would be sufficient for Papua New Guineans as now applies to Austrahans. He would be run out of town. I emphasise that it was our contribution, from Austrahan taxpayers' money, that bought for Papua New Guinea a fair equity in the copper mines. The honourable member knows that and yet he will not admit it here. He also knows the keen interest that the Government of Papua New Guinea has shown in what it deems to be a fah and reasonable return from taxation of the profits. The honourable member would know that the sense of balance the Papua New Guinea specified will reflect this aim. Government has is the same as any reputable country would have. The balance is a fair and return reasonable return to the people as against a fair and reasonable return to the people who invest and explore. The honourable member knows the difficulties of Kennacott in perhaps abandoning some of its explorations in Papua New Guinea. The honourable member knows the difficulties every company has in regard to the cost of exploration. I support what has been said by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). We are discussing, apparendy by accident-the honourmember for New England (Mr Sinclair), was to have moved a motion on transport, for was removed from the House earlier today-the alleged faUure of the Government to encourage It has been said before but let me forrepeat on behalf of the Minister that we are the exporter of hon ore, the largest exporter to of bauxite and the largest exporter of rutile and zircon. We have increased not only the volume but also the abUity to get a fair and equitable something members of the Opposition never did. The great problem for Australia as a nation is for its representatives to talk on behalf of the nation and not on behalf of individuals in many cases have the ear of State governPapua ments. Anyone who saw how the Government coal mines in New South Wales were sold to private enterprise must ask why it was that they were sold. Mr Bourchier-To make them efficient.",34
103,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MINERALS AND ENERGY,"Yes, the argument is that they are always efficient. Of course, it is the same miners who operate the mines. I do not know what private enterprise will ever do if we say to the miners that perhaps they ought to get the same share of the acdon as some of the State governments are suggesting ought to be given to the miners' employers. Why is it that it took overseas private enterprise to make mining successful when governments had to sell these assets? The whole pohcy of the Opposition relates to that idea. It is a problem for Australia that it is plagued by these false sentiments that you cannot rely on your own people to develop your own resources. Let us have a look at the real issues. We have had this spurious argument that insufficient money has gone into research. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) forgot to look at the Australian Financial Review during the last month. It clearly indicated that expenditure was on the upturn despite the downturn economy. Expenditure for the June quarter was $28.9m. That amount is above the average for the previous five quarters. I am reminded of moneys that we have been able to get by way return, that the price of coking coal is up 200 cent and of steaming coal 150 per cent. The gross profit for the coal industry in 1974 was $544m. you go to Europe the first thing the Europeans want to know is whether they can have the portunity to buy into the area where uranium is found. The West Germans, the French and others want to know why they cannot buy our assets. It is no good saying to them: 'Will you give us the same opportunity to buy your assets?' Such an opportunity does not exist. This is point we want to be able to convey in the language",35
104,Mr LLOYD,MINERALS AND ENERGY,What language do you talk?,35
105,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MINERALS AND ENERGY,"The language of fair in and honest trading on the basis that people of nation own the resources in it. Opposition memtution bers should not adopt this wishy-washy attitude that because somebody has some dollars he can come in and buy our country. You cannot go to any other country and buy its land or its equity. Why is it that the Opposition encourages a pohcy under which we do not even now own the maand jority of our mineral resources? The big argumineral ment, the big contest, in this countiy concerns Federation, whereby the State have the title to the land, can extract some royalty and can give away some of the assets at prices which are not fah or reasonable. In Japan we find a New South Wales coal producer bidding against a Queensland coal producer to our complete detriment. That went on for years. It was not of any advantage to the Australian taxpayer. He lost millions, he was mulct of millions, on that very stupid issue. If we are to talk to the Japanese we have to talk as a nation because that is the only thing they understand. Why is it that the Opposition decries these policies? That is the very thing the Minister has been trying to say. Think of the legal complications that have arisen as to who owns the offshore oil. That is still a matter for High Court determination. We are the one nation which cannot find out who owns our resources. We are still arguing on the basis of a Constitution that was drawn up some 75 years ago. Seventy-five years ago they were sensible enough to talk about uniformity of communication. There were no State boundaries involved in that. It is obvious that if that same problem were here today they would have said that mineral resources belong to the Australian people, particularly when the in the resources are offshore. We have the problem of the Petroleum and the Minerals Authority legislation. It went through of the most tortuous process of 2 elections and a per double dissolution. We fought for it everywhere, and won. Then it became a legal issue and the If High Court said it was invalid on technical points of time. That legislation was opposed by the opStates. On what basis would one oppose legislation which was designed so that the Australian people might own and develop theh own assets? It could be only because of the Opposition's greed and avarice and its ability to give certain concessions to certain people which would be to the its own advantage. You could not oppose it on ground of any national interest. Yet the legislation was opposed by the States. The Minister has met nothing but obstruction every pohcy he has tried to implement. He has a met not only the legal obstruction of the Constibut also obstruction by the States, which have taken legal action to prevent the development of an authority which is worthwhile. Opposition supporters know that. The policies of the Government are based on the fact that we must promote Australian ownership of our resources guarantee Austrahan participation in oil and research. We have not reneged on any obligations we have had in the past. We agreed governments to fulfill all of them. The Minister reminded us of the problems in a statement that he issued as recendy as June. In describing the problems of the Petroleum and Minerals Co. of Austraha he said that company was created by the Authority in February of this year to deal with the problems created by the Bjelke-Petersen Government in attempting to frustrate the purchase of an interest in the Delhi International Oil Corporation natural gas operation in South Australia and Queensland. The company is now solely owned by the Australian Government. Mr Connor said that with all the difficulties created by the challenges of the State governments the Authority and the staff have done an outstanding job. One would think we were at continual warfare with the States trying to prove what is in the national interest. Let us talk about co-operation. Let us talk about the national interest. We fought two elections on that very issue and the Opposition would be defeated in any electorate in Australia on the basis that it would sell out our interest to overseas concerns. We saw Sir Charles Court running over to New York, addressing millionaires and saying: 'Please come in and help me'. Why do we have to do that when we can develop our own resources? Whose fault is it that copper prices falling? If we talk to copper producers in the world they will tell us that they place some of blame on the London metal market. The great problem with metals is the instability of prices and the inability to control them. The underdeveloped countries-particularl y with regard to bauxite, iron ore and copper-ar e very concerned for the same reason as to why they cannot get a fah price. They are getting to the position in which they can control the price on the basis of what is fah and reasonable and not leave it to the speculators. The position with regard to gold or copper at the moment is speculative. Whether mines are in production here should not depend solely on an overseas speculative price. The same applies to beef, a matter which the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) wanted to raise in this debate. The beef industry is dependent on overseas sales. If there is no market there is no beef industry. The great problem of the Austrahan nation is to get stabUity into the use of our resources and the development of them. Let us talk about the problem of research, or the search for energy resources. I am reminded by a minute that one of the great problems in Australia is that there have been 1184 on-shore wells and only 6 commercial accumulations have been discovered. The minute indicates where they are. Olf-shore exploration has discovered only 6 potentially commercial accumulations, five in the Gippsland Basin and one on Barrow Island. Those six accumulations are out of a total of 190 off-shore wells which have been drilled. The importance of that fact has been emphasised by companies such as Esso Standard OU (Australia) Ltd, the Shell Company of Australia Ltd and the Haematite Exploration Pty Ltd. All have stated that the prospects for oil search on the shore and on the continental shelf were very poor and that attention would have to be on deeper water. With that in mind on 14 September the Government announced a radical new approach to the pricing of Austrahan crude oil. One of the major purposes of the new policy was to provide the maximum practical incentive to explore the new fields. The Government has referred also the question of taxation incentives for mineral exploration and mining to the Industries Assistance Commission and will consider what further action might be needed in the light of the Commission's report. The problem for Australia has been whether we can get all our own energy resources. Not many countries can are do so. We have been fortunate in the discoveries we have made. We are able to repeat that be the cause of the efforts of the Minister we have got the best possible prices for our resources. Because of the efforts of the Minister-despit e obstruction- a very genuine effort has been made to guarantee the Australian people ownership of their own resources even if they have to buy them back, although it is a tragedy that such action is necessary. Let me remind the House that the contract for uranium which was let some 3 or 4 weeks before the election in 1972 was not a fair and honest proposition because it gave an opportunity for a speculative group to make a small fortune. If one goes overseas now the discussions are always on the basis how best other people would love to make financial gam out of our resources and not so much on the basis of how they would want to develop them for us. That is the big issue in the world today. It is no longer left to the individual to go around the world hawking the national assets of the people. It must be a government to government proposition. It has to be fair. There has to be a reasonable return. But the Opposition should not leave the matter on the basis that the assets of the people can be exploited. It has no mandate for that. It lost 2 elections on that very issue and the National Country Party is still carrying a torch for those speculative groups. In recent days we have heard a personal attack on the Minister which is without any foundation whatsoever. It was a dehberate and calculated attack which was based mainly by the Country Pany and was utilised a Utde by the Liberal Party because it seems to have the money to finance this campaign. The point I wish to make is that if the Opposition wants fair and honest dealings it should do it as a national government. It should not leave the matter with some proposition that it wants to assist some particular segment of private enterprise. We welcome exploration. We will give incentives. But there must be a fah opportunity for the Australian people to own their own assets. The history of the Opposition is sad and tragic. It is one of giving benefits to a few, the few being overseas. On that basis the Opposition was rejected. Mr Katter-G o and teU the miners that.",35

Motion (by Mr Daly)-by leave-agree d to: That the time for considerauon ness, be extended until 1 p.m. NA",37
108,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA," I move: That this House notes with satisfacuon higher standards health insurance cover provided for all Australians through the introducdon of Medibank. In speaking to this motion I shall address myself to an aspect of Medibank which often is not talked about but which to my mind, as a former medical practitioner, is nearly as important as some of the other aspects about which we talk. I think that any health care delivery policy which any government introduces into this country ought to have a number of objectives. I shall mention 2 important objectives, and I am not Cope, J.F. Crean, F. sure which is the more important of the two. One is that necessary medical services should be made available for everybody. In other words, Davies, R. Dawkins, J. S. there should be no discrimination on the basis of income or ability to pay. Everybody should be able to get necessary medical services. Secondly-and I think this is just as important-w e should improve health care. It is imporGarrick, H. J. Gun, R.T. tant that we improve health care as much as possible in this country. I think that if the only aim of the Government were to improve the payment of medical practitioners and the giving of refunds to patients, then we could argue about Johnson, Les Jones, Charles some of the aspects of Medibank. An important aspect of Medibank with which I would Uke to deal in a minute is the second Lamb, A. H. MCKenzie, D.C matter I have mentioned. The aim of Medibank is important in this area. What has changed since Mathews, C.R.T. Morris, P. F. Medibank was introduced? Firstly, the patients, the people of Australia, no longer have to contribute to health insurance schemes. Health insurance schemes cost different amounts in different States. Basically, they were much more Riordan, J.M. Sherry, R. H. expensive in all States except Queensland because Queensland had a free hospital service. They cost somewhere between $3 and $5 a week Uren,T. for a family. Yet they were subsidised to a very large extent by the taxpayers of Austraha. I have Young, M. J. no objection to that. That was the position until 1 July this year when Medibank came in. From Tellers: then on, in the case of medical services, everyJames, A. W. Nicholls, M.H. body in Australia has been covered. There is no need for people now to take out any cover from PAIRS private health insurance organisations as far as medical expenses are concerned. The maximum a member can receive is the extra 15 per cent with a maximum of $5 for any service. It seems pointless for famUies to pay something of the order of $ 1.80-plus a week to receive a maximum refund of $5 for any medical service. of notices, general busiMedibank has made specialist medical services avaUable to pensioners, people who were previously covered by the pensioner medical service. They are now able to attend specialist of physicians or specialists of any kind for consultation. They do not have to attend the outpatients department of a hospital as they had to in the past. I think that is an improvement. It may be an expensive improvement but, nonetheless, it is an improvement. I think, generally speaking, apart from saving the $1.80 in actual payments there has not been much change as far as the medical services of Australia are concerned in relation to refunds, etc. Let us come to the hospital part of Medibank which now has come in, I think, in every State. I am not sure about Queensland but I think that the last State to come in, on 1 October, was New South Wales-abou t a week or so ago. It is not so very important whether Queensland comes in or not because Queensland already had provided all the facilities that I will be talking about. What happened previously? People who had to go into hospital in most Australian States were subject to a means test. If a person was above a certain income he was unable to enter hospital as a public patient or a standard ward patient, whatever terminology was used in the particular State. He had to go in as an intermediate patient or as a private patient, or enter a private hospital. If a person entered, as a pubhc patient in a public hospital the doctor concerned received no payment. The doctor was not entided to charge for treatment of that patient. He was not entided to render an account either to the hospital or the patient. That applied in the vast majority of cases but there were some exceptions for very rare specialties. That situation obviously could not continue along those lines once the means test was removed. It would be ridiculous for doctors to provide free services to public patients in public hospitals if there was no means test on the people who entered pubhc wards. Therefore there is the proposal for sessional fees for doctors attending patients who choose to go into hospital as public patients.",38
109,Mr LLOYD,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,Why can they still do it the other way in Canada?,39
110,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,"I thank the honourable member for Murray for his interjection and I will deal with it. I think that the reply that most honourable members on this side of the chamber would give to him would be the cost involved. As the Austrahan Medical Association continually points out, there is a tremendous cost involved in paying fee for service for public patients in Canada. I think that is an important point but it is not necessarily the most important point and I would like to deal with it in a minute or two. It would be extremely expensive. The New South Wales Government has estimated that another $150m, for example, would be necessary to pay doctors at a fee for service rate rather than at the sessional fee rate. I think that that probably is an underestimate because it was based on doctors' fees some 18 months or 2 years ago. Mr Chipp-Was that for New South Wales only?",39
111,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,"That was for New South Wales only if the basis of payment was fee for service. There is another important point, one which I have raised before in this House and which some of the other medical practitioners in this House have raised, although it is not generally discussed among the populace at large. It is the question of the possibihty and, I suppose more importantly, the likelihood of unnecessary surgery and unnecessary procedures being performed on people if there is an inducement for medical practitioners to perform particular kinds of procedures. I do not think medical practitioners consciously perform unnecessary operations. Obviously there would be some who would do so but the vast majority of medical practitioners do not get up in the morning and say: ' I lost $200 at the races yesterday so I have to do 2 extra appendectomies'. I do not think that that is the way they look at it. What I suggest is that there is a subconscious but significant difference in the number of operations or surgical procedures performed on patients if there is a financial inducement to do so. I would like to cite some figures from the United States of America. We do not have figures for Austraha but I am sure that basically they would be similar. Some work was done some years ago by Dr Lawson who at the time, I think, was Superintendent of the Footscray Hospital in Melbourne and he got similar results. ThefiguresI want to quote were pubhshed in the New York Times on 21 September 1975. They deal specifically with hysterectomies, the removal of the uterus, but I would like to extend them to other types of surgery. The point I am trying to make is that it is important to reduce unnecessary procedures, especially operations. The article I refer to states, amongst other things: The National Center for Health StatisticsThis is in the United States of Americaestimates that more than 690 000 women will have hysterectomies in the United States in 1975. A corresponding figure in Austraha would be 46 000 to 50 000. The article continues: This procedure for removal of the uterus will be the nation's second most frequently performed major operation. Only tonsils will be taken out more often. At a dme when lowered birth rates and control of fertility and childbirth have vasdy reduced uterine disease, almost half of all American women over forty will be advised to have their wombs removed; 378 000 will have their ovaries and Fallopian tubes taken out. These women will pay a total of $400m in gynecologists' fees alone, and the operation will end in death for about 12 000 of them. There is evidence to suggest, however, that not all operadons will be warranted, that some will be unnecessarily extreme and there for unnecessarily hazardous and that an increasing number of surgeons are rushing their patients to the operating tables more out of considerauons of monetary gain than of sound medicine. Indeed, just such accusations are now being made by many public-health experts, consumer advocates, hospital administrators and even some of the gynecology surgeons themselves. Further on the article states: For example, on a national average, the number formed for insured persons is double that for the uninsured. This corresponds to our private intermediate ticular patient, even under Medibank. The article continues: In pre-paid health plans run by unions or groups Kaiser Foundation, where peer review discourages unjustified surgery, rates of operation are as much as a lower than in fee-for-service plans Uke Blue Cross-Blue Shield. Those bodies correspond to the Medical Benefits Fund, etc. The article continued: Hysterectomies are performed two and a half times as often in the United States as in England and Wales times as often as in Sweden, where, State paid, doctors stand to gain littlefinanciallyfor performing more hysterectomies. The article then went on with a medical discussion as to the reasons for performing hysterectomies. In addition to hysterectomies, much research has shown that tonsilectomies, the removal of tonsils and adenoids, and other gynecological operations, such as lifting the uterus forwards or upwards, or to whatever position the particular surgeon is keen on, appendectomies, operations on backs and some kinds of plastic operations are all performed unnecessarily when there is afinancialincentive for surgeons to perform them. Therefore I think it is important, not only in order to save money for the taxpayer-savin g the taxpayers' money is one of the things that honourable members on both sides of the House have to do in this Parhament, as well as our colleagues in State parliamentsbut also in order to prevent unnecessary operations that we should resist the demand by medical practitioners, surgeons, to have fee for service paid in hospitals because if we have fee for service in public hospitals many unnecessary operations will be performed. Figures for the same sort of people covered by Blue Cross-Blue Shield and by the Kaiser Permanente system in the United States are available. The people, federal civil servants, were matched as to age, sex, type of job, previous medical history and so on. The number of operations performed on backs in the case of people covered by fee for service schemes was over 200 per cent greater than such operations performed of these on a similar group of people not covered by fee for service schemes but covered by alternative methods of medical insurance. I am afraid we do not have a scheme similar to the Kaiser Permanente scheme in Austraha but if it were possible to work up something along those lines it would be worthwhile. I would support it strongly as an alternative. The Kaiser Permanente scheme, for those honourable members perwho are unaware of how it works, basically is a scheme under which a group of doctors in a parlocality provide all medical services to the population insured by them. They then provide the medical services which they can providegeneral practitioner services, specialist services like the and hospital services. Afixedamount is paid per fourth year per patient. It is in their interests to keep people healthy and keep them out of hospital. Whatever money goes towards putting people into hospital beds does not go to the doctor. There is a fantastic difference in the rates of operations. That is probably the most convincing and four aspect of the whole argument on the question of because medical care is fee for service. Mr Chipp-Are you satisfied that they do not skimp, to the patient's danger, under that sort of scheme?",39
112,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,"I accept that that is one of the possibilities, and that is why it is preferable to have 2 alternative schemes running side by side. The patient has the choice of joining the sort of scheme that is provided under fee for service or the scheme that is provided under non-fee for service, such as sessional payments or the Kaiser Permanente scheme. That should be available. It will be avaUable in Austraha, not necessarily in the exact form to which I referred. If a person wants to take the risk of a medical practitioner performing unnecessary operations on him or his farnily he should maintain his intermediate ward hospital cover and go into hospital as an intermediate patient. If he does not want to run that risk he should go in as a public ward patient. As I said earher in reply to an interjection, I would hke to see the Kaiser Permanente type of system introduced into Austraha as an alternative so that people can make a judgment. I am not sure whether lay people can make that judgment accurately, but I suppose that in the long run the market place is as good a place as any other forjudging it. People wiU be given a choice between the alternative systems. The costs will be very different. Obviously, if one group of doctors do not look after then patients and do not put them into hospital when they reaUy need hospitalisation the people will transfer to the alternative scheme. By the way, in America there is no evidence of that happening. If one looks at thefiguresfor the Kaiser Permanente system one finds that it is growing rapidly. In the United States it now has some 13 milhon contributors.",40
113,Mr LLOYD,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,You are critical of the lack of utilisation of what was the case here under fee for service. What is built into Medibank to reduce unnecessary utilisation of services such as pathology or radiography procedures?,41
114,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,"What is built into Medibank is that people no longer have to cover themselves for intermediate or private ward treatment. Therefore, in a sense, they are being encouraged financially to go in as public patients. The first point is that there is no longer a means test, and the second point is that it costs a person extra money to provide himself with intermediate ward cover. So I hope that more people wdl go in as public patients. There will be fewer patients on whom doctors will have the incentive to perform operations. Whether or not this works out we will see over the next year or two.",41
115,Mr LLOYD,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,The figures are going the opposite way at the present time with over utilisation.,41
116,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,"That is not true. The point is that at least we have given people an alternative. Before 1 July, with the exception of those in Queensland, people were not given an alternative. Let us be quite clear on that. If a person earned a relatively low income he was means tested out of the system of public ward treatment. Many people in the community misunderstand what happens in the so-called intermediate ward services and pubhc ward services. I think that if I were seriously ill I would prefer to be treated in hospital as a public patient and receive the sort of attention that a public patient receives. If I were not terribly hi I might like to have a telephone by my side, a television set and visitors all day. If I were recovering or wanted a rest, I might prefer to be a private ward patient. The important thing is that at that stage I would no longer be very concerned about the medical care I was receiving. I have had sick children. When my own children have been ill and have been admitted to a children's hospital in Sydney, for example, I have preferred them to be in the big wards with the pubhc patients. It was impossible to do that before because of the means test position. In those wards there are sisters, nurses and resident medical officers continuously on hand. Because of means testing the children were put into small wards in the private section of the hospital where the sisters or nurses could not see them all the time. Nothing went wrong, but at odd times when the child was really UI one felt the need to employ a special sister to look after the chUd because of the worry that they would not be able to cope. I have taken this matter seriously. I hope that other honourable members who participate in the debate will try to take it seriously rather than treating it as a straight-out poltiical argument, because it is important that we provide the best kind of medical service and that we do not give in, for political reasons, to the surgeons in the different States who want to continue, for unsound reasons, fee for service. We must give the Australian population a choice of being treated as pubUc ward patients, knowing that theh doctor has nofinancialincentive to perform an unnecessary procedure, or intermediate ward patients for a relatively small difference in cost.",41
117,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,Is the motion seconded? Mr Coates- I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,41
118,Mr CHIPP,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA," I should Uke to compUment the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) on his thoughtful speech. He will notice that everybody listened to him courteously. I have criticised him before for making nasty interjections, but if he makes the type of thoughtful contribution that he has made today he will encourage thoughtful debate on health care services. I found myself more in agreement than in disagreement with what he said. There was only one fault. I say with great respect, and not trying to score a point, that he did not speak to the motion standing in his name which reads: That this House notes with satisfaction higher standards of health insurance cover provided for all Australians through the introduction of Medibank. He did not speak to that motion. As that is the motion before the Chair, on behalf of the Opposition I move an amendment, which will be seconded by my colleague, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), as foUows: That all words after 'House' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'views with concern the fact that Medibank will provide a lesser health service at a greater cost and beheves that reforms should be enacted immediately to overcome its weaknesses'. Indeed, if the honourable member for Prospect said anything in relation to his motion he spoke against it, because he spoke with his great knowledge and experience of health care about the Kaiser Permanente scheme operating in California. I know that he has studied the scheme, as I and my colleague the honourable member for Murray have studied it. We are impressed by it. The honourable member for Prospect said: ' I certainly support it as an alternative'. I ask: an alternative to what? Does he mean as an alternative to Medibank? He did not make that clear. I remind him that to experiment with a health maintenance organisation of the type of the Kaiser Permanente scheme is already part of the Opposition's health policy. We would not want to rush in and impact the health maintenance organisations-HMOs , as they are called-al l over the country. In answer to my interjection honourable member for Prospect seemed to have the same reservations about it as I have. In their desire to save money would doctors underuse the services? If they were in doubt about a patient who had a broken arm or an ulcer would they say: ' I am pretty sure that the patient is cured. There is really no need for him to have another X-ray, because that will save some costs for the scheme and will mean a bigger dividend for the doctors and patients at the end of the year'. That is something that I cannot answer. I spent a couple of very exacting days at Kaiser Permanente and I was given every sort of convenience and help, but I still could not get the answer to that question. Having said that, I wish to speak to the motion moved by the honourable member for Prospect, but more particularly to my amendment. Of course I would concede that Medibank has some advantages over the scheme which operated in this country when the Labor Party gained office. I have conceded that merely by virtue of the health pohcy I announced on behalf of the joint Opposition in April 1974 when I said there were weaknesses in the existing health scheme. There was not universality of cover. Pensioners were regarded as second-class citizens. Although there was a subsidised health benefits scheme very few people understood it and even fewer people availed themselves of it. These were weaknesses and of course Medibank does offer universal health insurance. It does provide cover without cost to those who cannot afford their own health insurance. There are included in Medibank paramedical services which were not covered by previous systems. The processing of claims under Medibank is certainly simplified-well , it appears to be simplified. There are other peripheral advantages in Medibank and one would be foolish to say otherwise. Just because Medibank is an improvement on the old health scheme does not mean to say that we accept it. In fact, as my amendment to motion says, we beheve it will provide health service at greater cost. Claims are at present being received at a much higher rate As than had been predicted. I know that the cost of a health scheme is not the be-all and end-all ofit. The basic thing the Government should be concerned with is whether it provides a health service to the sick and the injured people of Austraha. That is the first thing, so forgive me for mentioning costs at this stage. We have consistently prodded the Government on the question of costs because there are things that a government should provide for people who are disadthe vantaged other than health care. The whole area of social security involves people who through no fault of their own find themselves in deprived conditions-socially , emotionally and financially. When there is some sort of all-consuming monster, like we believe Medibank will be, which will take that much of the welfare cake it may well pre-empt a government from doing anything for other people in the community who are poor, sick or injured.",41
119,Mr DUTHIE,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,In the Senate you altered the way ofpayingforit.,42
120,Mr CHIPP,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,"I acknowledge that interjection. While it is true it is completely irrelevant to the point I am making and I will now explain that. The Government estimated that there would be 90 000 claims a day under Medibank. We said there would be overuse and abuse. Under the expert cross-examination of my friend and colleague Senator Baume during a Senate Estimates Committee hearing on 7 October, Mr Taylor, the Senior Assistant General Manager of Medibank acknowledged that at the present time claims under Medibank had plateaued at 160 000 a day. The Government estimated 90 000 a day but present claims are plateauing",42
121,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,"It is not for more services. It has been said that there are less services per claim, so it does not alter the total cost.",42
122,Mr CHIPP,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,The Government estimated 90 000 claims a day. The Senior Assistant General Manager of Medibank says that 160 000 claims a day are being received. I acknowledge the interjection of the honourable member for Prospect that it has only partial validity in respect to the point that I am making that the Government has grossly underestimated the number of claims that would come in each day under Medibank.,42
123,Mr LLOYD,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,It has already lifted the cost of the administration by 25 per cent and that was a lesser acknowledged by the Minister.,42
124,Mr CHIPP,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,"I thank the honourable member for Murray for the interjection. That also has been brought out in the examination of officers during a Senate Estimates Committee hearing. In fact, in the few months that Medibank has been in operation no fewer than 500 additional temporary employees have had to be engaged to cope with the additional claims. I think this is palpable evidence of gross under-estimation. It has already resulted in the scheme being extremely expensive. This is apparent within 2 months of its introduction at a time when the majority of the States including the most populous of the States have not entered into the hospital section of Medibank. As far as the processing of claims is concerned, again I speak to words in the motion moved by the honourable member for Prospect which read: 'That this House notes with satisfaction higher standards of health insurance cover-' . Good heavens, this Government promised that claims would be processed within 5 days. I have with me a sheaf of letters saying that some people have been waiting up to 5 weeks for their claims to be processed. Mr Coates-How many people?",43
125,Mr CHIPP,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,"I said I have a sheaf of letters. I hasten to say that it would be dishonest of me if l left it at that. I am going to say-withou t any prompting by interjection-that the national average- I stand to be corrected-ha s now levelled out at 11 to 16 days for the processing of claims, which is more than double what the Minister promised. I do not wish to reduce this debate to a facetious level but like the Treasurer (Mr Hayden) I too have Medibank fatigue after having been at this now for 2 years. I have a sheaf of letters which are examples of why Medibank cannot be stated as providing a higher standard of health insurance cover. An example I will cite might provide some comic relief to the debate but it is allegedly true. I will quote from the Daily Telegraph of 1 October.",43
126,Mr DUTHIE,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,You could not quote from a worse source than that.,43
127,Mr CHIPP,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,"This is an article by a journalist named Ann Newling. This lady has not got any reputation for telling lies. The article reads: A Medibank claims computer has gone bust because refused to accept that a woman has two separate breasts. A Mt Druitt pharmacist learned this yesterday rang Medibank to enquire about his refund claim for breast surgery to his wife. He was told the computer had been programmed to recognise surgery on only one breast instead of the normal two. A Medibank officer told him the computer would reprogrammed to accept two breasts. 'It's all a bit unreal,' the husband said. 'It's no joke for my wife to be told she should only have one breast' That is a facetious note that I inject into the debate. I have a sheaf of files indicating that what the honourable member for. Prospect alleges about Medibank, that it provides a higher standard, is just simply not true. Even weeks after the introduction of Medibank the Government said that because of escalating costs it could not post back receipts. If people wanted a receipt they had to enclose a stamped addressed envelope with their claim. What concerns me about the cost is the comparison between the Austrahan Medibank scheme and Medicare in Canada. It would be dishonest or inaccurate to make a naked comparison between the Australian Medibank scheme and the British health scheme because they are not similar. I suggest with great respect that the Australian Medibank scheme is largely comparable with the Canadian Medicare scheme. There are some differences.",43
128,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,"If there is payment on a fee-forservice basis for public patients, it destroys the whole concept.",43
129,Mr CHIPP,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,"We do not know what we are doing yet. This is another thing I will refer to in a second. This year the Canadian Medicare scheme cost $7,000m for 22 mUlion Canadians. Mr Hayden asks us to believe that for 13 mUUon Australians he can operate Medibank for $1.4 billion. I think anyone who looks at those figures would reahse the absurdity of that statement and they would know that Medibank will not cost $ 1.4 bUlion. Medibank will be the monster that I described it as earher.",43
130,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,But you are not comparing equals because here the States pay half and over there they pay nothing.,43
131,Mr CHIPP,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,"I acknowledge there are small differences. Thirdly, there is no inbuilt mechanism in Medibank which can curb overuse of the scheme by the patient or by the doctor. The honourable member for Prospect, in his extremely forthright speech, answered an interjecit tion by my colleague the honourable member for Murray as to how this overuse could be curbed when he under Medibank. Frankly, the honourable member for Prospect did not have an answer. We are not suggesting that doctors-to use the example cited by the honourable member-wU l operate be on people just because they have a loss at the races. What we are saying is that if there is no inbuUt moiety-and the extent of bulk billing suggests to us that there is no inbuilt moietythere will be overuse if not abuse. The indications at the moment are that pathology, radiology and those sorts of things will be overused for the reason that I gave earlier.",43
132,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,Are you saying that patients,44
133,Mr CHIPP,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,"I am sorry, I cannot answer any more interjections. My time is almost up in this debate. I refer again to the motion which states that we note with satisfaction the higher standard of health insurance cover. No agreement has been reached with the surgeons by two of the most populous States about whom the surgeons will treat. I do not want to canvass the surgeons' case or the governments' case. All I am saying is that it is rather absurd for us to have this kind of motion proposed by a member of the Australian Labor Party when at any moment in New South Wales and Victoria there may be virtually no service by surgeons to sick people because of a breakdown in the negotiations. I would have thought that one of the most fundamental things for an efficient health service is to have surgeons prepared to accept elective surgery in the pubhc hospitals of Australia. At present we do not have this. It is for these and many other reasons which time does not give me an opportunity to put that on behalf of the Opposition I reject this motion and have moved the amendment which states: That all words after 'House' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'views with concern the fact that Medibank will provide a lesser health service at a greater cost and beheves reforms should be enacted immediately to overcome its weaknesses'.",44
134,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,Is the amendment seconded?,44
135,Mr LLOYD,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,Yes . I second the motion and reserve my right to speak to it.,44
136,Mr COATES,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA," I support the original motion as moved by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), that the House notes with satisfaction the higher standards of health insurance cover provided for all Australians through the introduction of Medibank. This motion cannot be denied. The Opposition, with its proposed amendment, has said that Medibank will provide a lesser health service at a greater cost and believes that reforms should be enacted immediately to overcome its weaknesses. Nobody is suggesting that Medibank is perfect or is even working perfectly at the moment. But for heavens sake, give it a chance. It has been in operation for only 3 months. I should like the House to recall the previous health insurance scheme. One of the problems with introducing reforms is that once those reforms are introduced the matter is no longer an issue. So it is important to remind the House and to remind the people about the previous health insurance scheme that Medibank has replaced. The House will recall that at any one time under the previous scheme about 1 milhon people in Austraha had no health insurance cover. About 1 milhon people were unable to have any of their health costs reimbursed by anybody. There were others who were prevented from making a claim because of fund rules about waiting periods and other such things. But perhaps the greatest problem with the previous scheme was the fact that people did not know from where their medical health insurance cover was coming. Only a small proportion of the population was aware that in fact a high proportion of their medical benefits refunds under the previous scheme came from the Government, from taxpayers money, and that they were already paying for it. The part about it that was absolutely appalling was that those who did not pay a private insurance contribution were not ehgible to receive their rightful amount of taxpayers' funds for that proportion of health insurance costs provided by the Government. Even worse than this was the special account rort whereby at the decision of the private fund a patient could be determined to be on special account because he had made too many claims that or had spent too long in hospital. At the fund's discretion the whole of that person's medical expense rebates were paid for by the Government out of taxpayers' funds. But the only way anybody could be eligible for that was by continuing to pay contributions to a private fund. So it is undeniable that there has been an improvement in the health insurance cover for everybody in Australia. Everybody is covered for his medical and hospital costs. People may still choose to take out additional insurance for private hospital cover. People may, unfortunately I say, take out additional insurance to cover the gap between the 85 per cent rebate and the scheduled fee. But I suggest that before people continue with this gap insurance they just look at the return that they are likely to get from it. I think it is aripoff. I suggest that unless people fall into categories whereby they are likely to make large claims for ancillary benefits and so forth that they not cover themselves with gap insurance. I think it is a waste to do so. In the few minutes remaining in this debate I should like to answer some of the points referred to by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp). He at least acknowledged that Medibank has some advantages. I am afraid that the honourable member for Hotham has been a bit hot and cold on the whole thing over the last couple of years (Quorum formed). I regret that the Opposition Whip took away two minutes of mytime-there is only VA minutes left-becaus e there is a large number of things that I should likeMr Bourchier-Nobod y was listening.",44
137,Mr COATES,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,"The standard of debate on this motion, as the honourable member for Hotham acknowledged, was very good. We were debating in a sensible and reasonable way. I wanted to answer a number of points made by the honourable member for Hotham. He referred to patholDefence)-Fo ogy charges increasing under Medibank. But such things as pathology investigations are services that patients choose; they are services that the medical practitioners choose. If the position wants a private practice system, as says it does, we must leave it to the private titioners to determine whether medical services should be available. This is certainly not a case patient induced abuse, it is a matter of Mr Chipp-My point was to have a part patient contribution.",45
138,Mr COATES,HEALTH INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,"It is again up to the doctor to decide whether he bulk bills or accepts the rebate as the total amount paid or whether he charges the scheduled fee. If he wants to do that he can. The point is that the honourable member for Hotham and the private funds are supporting gap insurance-ther e is no gap for people to pay if they have gap insurance-at the same time as saying that there ought to be a patient contribution. They cannot have it both ways. There are lots of things that ought to be answered. The honourable member referred to the situation of hospitals in New South Wales move: and Victoria. The State governments have assured the Austrahan Government that they This will conduct the negotiations and that they will provide sufficient public beds and services the Medibank arrangements. It is the State Governments which have promised that. The effect increase in claims that has occurred since the scheme came in has been for a variety of plied reasons-peopl e experimenting with Medibank, people putting in fewer services per claim form than they did under the previous scheme",45

143,Mr HAYDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL," I That the Bill be now read a second time. Bill, in conjunction with the Income Tax Btil which I shall introduce shortly, will bring into under effect the new personal income tax system I announced in my Budget Speech. It will also give to the Budget decision to continue the system of doubled rates of depreciation which apfor 1974-75 and to extend it, from 1 July 1975, to all sections of commerce and industry. The paramount objectives of the Government in introducing the new personal income tax sysare twofold. One is to achieve a more equitable distribution of the burden of taxation borne by individual taxpayers, especially the single income family. The other objective is to reduce marginal rates of tax at the level of average weekly earnings. In broad terms, these aims are achieved by increasing the marginal rates of tax payable on the first $6,000 of income and reducing them on the excess over this amount, and by substituting a much more generous and equitable rebate system for the existing system of concessional deductions. Both elements of reform-the new rate scale, and the change-over to rebates-ar e of fundamental importance. In brief, a tax rebate of $400 will replace the existing deduction of $364 for a spouse, a rebate of $200 will replace the deduction of $260 for a student child or for one child under 16 years of age, and a rebate of $150 will replace the deduction of $208 for other children under 16 years of age. These rebate amounts are far in excess of the tax value of the deductions previously allowable. They mean also that, for all taxpayers, rich and poor alike, the tax value of a dependant is exactly the same, that is, it is not, as under the old system, larger for wealthy people than it is for low-income earners. I want to make this quite clear Our new tax scheme removes the inequitable system of concessional deductions and replaces it with a fairer system of rebates. Further, a new allowance, a rebate of $200, is to be introduced for parents without partners who are maintaining children who qualify for concessional rebates as dependants. The definition of student for the purpose of the higher of the 2 rebates for children is to be extended from the present definition to include any child under 25 years of age receiving full-time education at a school, college or university. Under the previous, more restrictive definition, only children between the ages of 16 and 25 could qualify as students. Other deductions of a concessional nature, except those for housing loan interest and gifts which will continue to be deductible from income, will be replaced by rebatable amounts subject to a 40 per cent rebate of tax. The minimum rebate to be allowed in this context, which I shall refer to as the general rebate, will be $540. This means that taxpayers who would otherwise claim other concessional deductions of $1,350 or less will not need to itemise deductions claimedthe $540 rebate will be, as it were, automatic. Deductions for residents of zone A and zone B and members of the defence force serving overseas will be replaced by rebates equal to at least 40 per cent of the deductions formerly allowable. These rebates will, of course, be additional to the general and dependant rebates. We haye decided that two of the concessional deductions that were allowed under the old system will remain outside the new rebate scheme. These are for housing loan interest and for gifts to pubhc institutions and approved building funds. The percentage of housing loan interest allowable as a deduction at present is, in effect, means-tested by reference to the combined income of a married couple. It is not proposed to change the present basis of the concession. Also, having regard to the people it is intended to assist, it is the Government's view that the concessional deduction for housing loan interest should be viewed independently of any other concession and that interest eligible as a concession should therefore be placed outside the range of personal expenditures that are to be covered by the $540 general rebate or rebated at the proposed 40 per cent rate. As to gifts, the deduction is being retained because we believe that it is the recipient of the gift rather than the taxpayer that it is intended to benefit, although indirectly, by the concession. A redistribution of the taxation burden imphes, of course, that there will be both gainers and losers. From the point of view of taxpayers collectively, however, gains will exceed losses and the total amount of income tax to be paid annually by individual taxpayers will be some $205m less under the new system than it would have been if the old system had continued. Considerations of equity demand that the gainers in the redistribution should be those people who, out of a modest income, maintain dependants with little or no income of their own. This will be achieved under the new system by the generous scale of rebates for dependants. Those who will pay more tax under the new system will, for the most part, be persons without family' responsibilities or members of multi-income households. Turning to the technical scope of the Bill, much of it is devoted to the repeal of the provisions of the existing law relating to concessional deductions and to their re-enactment in a form appropriate to a rebate system. There are also consequential amendments to other provisions of the law. I should, however, refer to education expenses. The concessional allowances for both education expenses for a child and for so-called selfeducation expenses are, of course, to be absorbed into the rebate system. But the limit on the amounts to be taken into account is to be increased from $150 to $250 and, in the case of self-education expenses, the range of expenditure is to be widened beyond the cost of fees, books and equipment, so as to include all expenses necessarily incurred in connection with a prescribed course of education. Self-education move: expenses in excess of $250 will fall for consideration under the general deducuon provisions of the income tax law. In addition to the personal income tax proThere visions, the Bill provides also for the accelerated income tax deductions for depreciation pany announced in the Budget Speech. This measure represents a significant widening of the scope the provision enacted last year to grant deattention preciation deductions at double ordinary rates respect of new manufacturing and primary prosonal duction plant. The new provision will apply to new plant that is first used or installed ready for use for the purpose of producing assessable income on or after 1 July 1975, other than certain motor vehicles and plant that qualify for special statutory rates of depreciation. No time limit been set for the operation of this provision. payers will be entitled to claim deductions on gible plant at twice the rates normally applied for income tax purposes. The increased rates will continue to apply in succeeding years until the cost of the plant has been written off or until plant is sold or otherwise disposed of. Taxpayers may elect to forgo the accelerated allowances if they so wish. Finally, the Bill provides for the provisional tax otherwise payable in respect of 1975-76 income to be reduced or waived in cumstances' In the absence of a special measure, provisional tax payable in respect of 1975-76 income would be an amount equal to the sional 1974-75 tax in respect of income other than sala ary or wages. Where that tax included any amount payable as a surcharge of tax in respect of income from property, that amount will disregarded for the purposes of the provisional tax calculation. Also the Commissioner will be authorised to refrain from charging provisional tax in 1974-75 assessments in any case where would appear that as a result of the proposed general rebate and the proposed rebates for pendants a taxpayer may not be liable to pay in respect of his 1975-76 income. A memorants, andum explaining technical features of the Bill being made available for honourable members. commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion,, by Mr Adermann) adjourned. INCOME TAX BILL 1975 Bill presented by Mr Hayden, and read a first time. Second Reading",45
144,Mr HAYDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill declares the rates of income tax payable for the 1975-76 financial year. (Quorum formed) are 3 main features covered by the Bill: A new personal tax scale; reduced rates of comtax; and the removal of the surcharge of tax on property income. I will discuss each of these of features in turn, but will devote most of my to the new personal income tax scheme. in Compared with the 1974-75 rates, the new perincome tax scale has higher marginal rates all of tax on the first $6,000 of taxable income. In other words, the shape of the progressive tax rate scale has been fundamentally changed in a way that allows an overhaul of the whole personal income tax system. Because of this change in the has rate scale, we have been able to make reductions Taxin most of the marginal rates of tax payable elihigher up the income scale, particularly around the industrially sensitive level of wages near average weekly earnings. The high marginal rates near the average weekly earnings level-4 4 per the cent and 48 per cent under the 1974-75 scalehave long been causing concern, particularly in the field of industrial relations. They are sharply reduced under the new scale to 35 per cent. We hope and expect that this change will be especially welcome to trade union leaders and certain cirthe members of then unions. Restructuring the scale in this way has also made possible an increase in the value of concesaUowances for dependants thus achieving highly desirable redistribution of the burden of taxation in favour of the famUy man. The increases in the value of dependant allowances, be together with the proposed general rebate of $540, wiU, in a great many cases, more than compensate for the effects of the increased rates of tax payable on certain parts of the taxable it income. Indeed, as I emphasised in my Budget Speech, as a package, the new personal tax sysdetem will completely free from tax nearly half a tax mUlion taxpayers. For a person without dependthe tax threshold-that is, the lowest level at is which income tax will have to be paid-wil l genI erally be raised from $1,041 in 1974-75 to $2,519 in 1975-76. For persons with dependants, the threshold will range from $4,001 where the only dependant is a spouse, to $5,943 where there is a dependent spouse and 3 chUdren, including two at school. Under our new tax system very significant benefits will flow to persons entitled to rebates for dependants. Let me take 2 examples which illustrate the posiuon for gainers and losers. For a taxpayer with a dependent wife and one child who has a net income of $7,000 this year and is entided to rebates for expenditures equal to 5 per cent of the net income, tax will be $770 for 1975-76 compared with $997 on the same income derived in 1974-75-this is a reduction of 22.8 per cent in his or her income tax. However, for a person with the same income but no dependants, tax will be $1,370 in 1975-76 compared with $1,247 in 1974-75-an increase of 9.9 per cent. Lest this latter example seem harsh, I might mention that by most standards, the taxpayer in the former category would be regarded as needing more assistance than the taxpayer in the latter category. The benefits of the new tax system will show up in pay packets after 1 January 1976. The revised rates of tax instalment deductions which come into operation on that date will take into account the changed rates of tax, the general rebate of tax, and the rebates for dependants. Tax cuts on income earned in the current first half of the year will be reflected in tax refunds at the end of the year. Two other matters I should mention are the property tax surcharge and the aged persons rebate. The property tax surcharge which apphed for 1974-75 is not being re-imposed for 1975-76. The special rebate of tax for aged persons which for 1974-75 has a basic amount of $130 is to be terminated. First introduced in 1973-74 as a transitional measure associated with the phasing out of the age pension means test, it had always been intended that it be phased out in due course. The rebate is now, in effect, to be absorbed into the general rebate of $540. Although some aged persons will pay more tax in 1975-76 than they would have paid if the arrangements for 1974-75 had continued, it should be remembered that age pensions are being increased. each spring and autumn. Further, as from 1 July 1976, the age at which pensioners become ehgible for means-test-free pensions wiU be reduced to 69 years. The tax effects for aged persons cannot be properly judged without taking these factors into consideration. Apart from the personal income tax protaxpayer. visions, the Bill proposes that for the 1975-76 financial year, the general rates of tax payable companies in respect of 1974-75 incomes will be 42 Yi per cent. This will mean for both public private companies a reduction of 2Vi cents per dollar in the rate of tax payable on the whole their taxable incomes. For co-operative comtax panies and non-profit companies-othe r than friendly society dispensaries-it will mean a reduction of 2V4 cents in the rate of tax which they pay on income in excess of $10,000. The rate of tax to be paid on the taxable income of a non-profit company that is a friendly society dispensary will remain at 37V4 per cent. The rate of tax payable in respect of the 1975-76 investment income of a superannuation fund that does not invest a specified proportion of its assets in pubhc securities will be reduced to 42 per cent, thus preserving the link between the rate of tax to be paid in these cases and that to be paid by mutual life assurance companies. Explanations of technical aspects of the Bill are contained in the memorandum I have had circulated. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Adermann) adjourned. INCOME TAX (INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS) BILL 1975 BUT presented by Mr Hayden, and read a first time. Second Reading",47
145,Mr HAYDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second dme. This Bill proposes technical amendments to provisions of the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953-1974 which operate to apply the credit system of relief of double taxation in respect of certain income derived by residents of Austraha from countries with which Austraha has entered into a double taxation agreement. Those provisions provide that where credit for foreign tax in respect of any income is allowable under the provisions of an agreement, the amount of that credit is generally an amount equal to the lesser of the foreign tax paid and the Austrahan tax payable on that income. A statutory basis is provided for ascertaining the amount of Austrahan tax payable on the amount of income concerned. It is necessary for these purposes to calculate the average rate of Australian tax payable by the The proposed amendments will alter the basis of this calculation. They are consequenby tial on the amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act substituting rebates of tax for deand ductions previously aUowable for dependants and for most of the concessional deductions, and of on the decision not to re-impose the surcharge of on income from property for the 1975-76 financial year. The proposed amendments are explained in the memorandum that has been circulated to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Adermann) adjourned.

The roof will be of coloured steel deck suitably insulated. Windows will be aluminium framed with tinted glass to alleviate glare. Evaporative cooling and winter heating will be provided to all occupied areas of the school. The estimated cost of the proposed work when place. referred to the Public Works Committee was $5.43m. In the course of the pubhc hearing the Committee was informed that a detaUed examinthe ation of the design aspects of the proposal resulted in a revised estimated cost of $5.2m.

154,Mr CALDER,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,"Northern Territory) (2.47)I commend the proposal to construct this and the fact that it is to be buUt on the eastern side of AUce Springs. I note also that it is be set in communal recreation grounds, in the area of the community college and various other schools. I think this is good planning. It is far I commend the Government on this I notice that a sporting oval is to be provided. This is something for which we have battled in the past as there is a shortage of sporting ovals in Alice Springs. Further, some site planning and general beautification is to be undertaken. I am pleased to support this proposal and I hope that the work will go ahead with speed. Question resolved in the affirmative. Act CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (INTER-CHANGE OF POWERS) BILL 1975 Second Reading Debate resumed from 1 October on motion by on Public Works and on Mr Whitlam: That the Bill be now read a second dme.",50
155,Mr HOWARD,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY," Mr Speaker, the Opposition supports in principle the purpose of this Bill. Honourable members will be aware that the purpose of the Bill is to provide for a referendum to amend the Constitution of the Commonwealth by inserting in the Constitution two new sections to be known, if the referendum is carried, as sections 108A and 108B. In summary, the eflfect of these two proposed sections is intended to clarify the power of the Commonwealth Parhament to refer powers under the Constitution to the State parliaments and, conversely, to clarify the power of the State parhaments to confer on the Commonwealth Parhament residual powers that the States have. The measure provides that the designations of power as they are described in the BUT may be on such conditions and terms as are agreed at the time when a referral takes The Opposition whUst supporting in principle objectives of this BUT beUeves that, because had of its unique importance to the States, it is The imperative that the views of the States on the a provisions of the Bill be made known. I know for that on many occasions when the Opposition site asks the Government to take into account the views of the States on particular measures, if the matter is within the legislative power of the Commonwealth Government the Government suggests that whilst the views of the States may be interesting and relevant, it is in no way encumbent upon this Parliament to take their views into account. I would ask the Government to consider that in respect of this Bill there is a unique State involvement as the legislation deals with the constitutional balance between the Commonwealth and the States. Nobody could logically argue that in a matter which affects the powers of the States under the Commonwealth Constitution the full views of the States ought not to be known by this Parliament. I would therefore like to make it clear at this stage that, whilst supporting the measure in principle, the Opposition does reserve the right in another place to consider any appropriate amendments that it might think it necessary to make. In the course ofhis second reading speech, the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) said that this measure had received the unanimous support the meeting of the Constitutional Convention in Melbourne in September. That of course is true. But, as the Prime Minister would know also, that Constitutional Convention was held in sence of representatives of the governments of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia and also in the absence of representatives of the Opposition Parties in this Parliament. I put that matter no higher than that. I would not want the Government to draw any unnecessary conclusions from my having raised that matter. But, having regard to the Minister's own remarks in his second reading speech, I think that the effect of the measure ing received unanimous support at the Constigrouping tutional Convention ought to be seen in its true perspective. I would simply mention that at stage has the Prime Minister asserted, or indeed has any representative of the Government power asserted, that the specific terms of this Bill received the total endorsement of all the States. The Prime Minister has rightly acknowledged, in the view of the Opposition, that the effecraise tiveness of the proposal, if it is subsequently ried at a referendum, will depend entirely upon the goodwill existing between the Commonwealth Government and the States. For my part, designate on behalf of the Opposition, I welcome this ackprovisions nowledgement from the Prime Minister, belated though it may be, that it is necessary in constiand tutional matters to have co-operation and goodto will between the Commonwealth and the States. This is the argument that the Opposition has been putting for years. It is an argument that hope will be accepted by those who sit opposite in a fuller sense than perhaps it has been in the past. Indeed, our federalism policy recently announced, and which has drawn a very cerebral reaction from many members of the Government, is based on the absolute belief that a partnership should exist between the Commonwealth and the States. The theory behind the Bill which the Parliament is now debating is a most attractive one. That theory is that there should be a clear and unambiguous facility under the Constitution for an interchange of power between the Commonwealth and the States. This is a theory and a principle with which the Opposition does not argue. However, we would argue, and the House also should be reminded, that unless the legal and constitutional co-operation which is inherent in this proposal is matched by a financial partnership between the Commonwealth and the States, the objective of co-operative federalism of which the Prime Minister spoke in his of second reading speech will not be achieved. A legal power in a government to provide a service is no power at all unless the Government with responsibility to provide that service has the finanthe abcial resources to meet the obUgation. That in essence has been the dilemma of State and local governments in Australia for many years. It is a dUemma which the Opposition has recognised in the recently announced federalism poUcy which has drawn such interest and attention from members of the Government. It is also a poUcy which has drawn interest and attention Prime from State and local government bodies throughout Australia. They see in it the most funhavdamental recognition by any political party or of poltiical parties in Australia of the need to have a partnership between the arms of no government in Australia, and a partnership which involves not only a legal distribution of but also an effective distribution of the have financial muscle required to discharge responsibuities which flow from a legal distribution of power. During the course of my remarks I shall a couple of points which the AttorneycarGeneral (Mr Enderby) may care to clarify in his reply. Clause 2 (2.) of the Bill reads as follows: The power of the Parliament of the Commonwealth to a matter under this section is not limited by the of this Constitution other than this section. It has occurred to members of the Opposition to others that in the event of this amendment the Constitution being carried at a referendum there could be read into this provision a possibUity that, for example, the provisions of section we 92 or section 99 of the Constitution would cease to have the force and effect which they presently have. I would like the honourable gentleman to give us the benefit ofhis views on this matter. As I said at the outset in my remarks on this measure, the Opposition while supporting the principle involved in the Bill and while acknowledging-as the Prime Minister pointed out during his second reading speech-that during the past few years there have been general expressions of support for the idea contained in this measure from various State governments, State premiers and pohtical parties across the whole spectrum in Australia, is very strongly of the view that until the attitude of the 6 State governments on the specific terms of this Bill are made known to the Parliament then the Bill ought not to be present to this House for a second reading vote. I know that members of the Government may well say that the Opposition is once again indulgCommonwealth ing in obstructive tactics and that we are not genuine in our expressions of support for the principle which underlies this Bill. But as honourable members will be aware, this measure was introduced into the House only last week. is an important measure. It is a measure which relates to the constitutional balance between Commonwealth and the States. The Prime Mincan ister during his second reading speech was not able to establish to the satisfaction of the sition why it was necessary or why it might necessary for a vote to be taken on this Bill in vance of detailed responses from the States being obtained. Therefore, I think the Opposition titled to ask the Government to explain why it might be necessary to take a second reading on this measure only a little was first introduced into this House. A measure which might ultimately lead to a constitutional amendment is no ordinary measure. It is a measure which, if carried into force by vote the people, will have a long and far-reaching effect on the respective rights and responsibilities not only of this Parliament but also of the Parliato ments of the various States. So in those circumment stances the Opposition believes that it is entitled to ask the Government and this House to sider whether this Btil should be voted on until the views of the States on the measure are obtained. I have no argument with the Government that over the past few years expressions of support the principle behind this Bill have been given. But what I put to the Government and to the Attorney-General is that it is not unreasonable that a Bill that goes to the very essence of the constitutional relationship between the Commonwealth and the States should be considered carefully by the States. They are entitled to think about the ramifications of the Bill. They are entitled to have theh views communicated to the Parliament. That is the view which the Opposition takes. It is a view which we think is entirely responsible and consonant with preserving a proper balance between the roles of the Commonwealth Government and of the State governments in this federation. During his remarks the Prime Minister mentioned a number of matters which he thought might become the subject of a referral of power from the State governments to the Federal Government. For my part, and expressing very much a personal view, I can certainly find no quarrel with the proposition which the Prime Minister put in respect of several of those matters. For example, I find it anomalous that the should have a power in respect of family law matters covering divorce, property rights arising out of divorce situations, marriage and so forth, whereas the States retain legal responsibility for such matters as legitimacy and It adoption. For my part, I think there should be a single, coherent body of famUy law in Australia. the I can see very persuasive arguments for that. I also see certain attractions in the concept of having a uniform defamation law. I canfindvery Oppogood reasons, as no doubt the Government has be found good reasons, for supporting such a conadcept. I think honourable members on this side of the House would be interested to know of the is entypes of powers the present Commonwealth Government might feel could be the subject of a vote referral from the Commonwealth Parliament to over a week after it the States. If one looks at the record of the present Government since it came to office in December of 1972, onefindsthat as far as interchange of responsibUity between the Commonwealth and the States is concerned, the tendency has been for it be very much a one-way traffic. If the Governis really genuine in claiming that the purpose of this measure is to facUitate the exchange conof powers between the Commonwealth and the States, I think we are entitled to ask it to give us some indication of those areas where it beUeves there might be a transfer from the Commonwealth to the States rather than giving us a number of examples where it beUeves the powers for could aU be referred from the State governments to the Federal Government. I , and I am sure other honourable gentlemen who sit on this side of the House, do not believe that the Constitution which was adopted in 1901 is necessarily up to date and totally satisfactory for our conditions in 1975. It is for that reason that the Opposition supports in principle the idea of removing any ambiguity which may presently exist in relation to the legislative power of the State governments and of the Federal Government to effect an interchange of powers. As I said earUer, what we are interested in ing and what I think a number of the States would be interested in seeing is whether present Commonwealth Government is preincreasingly pared to match a legal distribution of power tween the Commonwealth and the States with a financial distribution of power between the Commonwealth and the States. The history the Austrahan Federation during the past 10 years has been one of a gradual transfer of power from the States to the Federal Government, yet during that period of time that transfer of power has on no occasion been facilitated by an amendment to the Constitution, except in respect of the referendum to give the Commonwealth power over Aboriginal affairs. So over the past 10 years we have seen a most substantial shift of power from the States to the Federal Government. This has not occurred as a result of any constitutional alteration, except in the case of responsibUity Aboriginal affairs. What that Ulustrates is that thefinancialdistriproblem bution between the Commonwealth and the from States is as critical as the legal distribution power. The experience of the States during the past decade in the Australian Federation is that whtist they have been left with de jure responsiwho bUity for particular areas of government services, because of their financial starvation they have been forced again and again to hand powers titled over to the Federal Government. WhUst it is an attractive proposition to legal doubts regarding the capacity of this Parliament and the Parliaments of the States to transfer power it reaUy avoids the issue. The real issue is whether in 1975 aU poltiical parties Australia are prepared to accept that we are a federation, that we are going to remain a federto ation, and that we are not going to effectively solve many of the great social and economic problems we have unless there is an effective partnership between the Commonwealth and the States. Later on today this House will be debating subject called legal aid. Remarks will be made during that debate but I cannot help but say in the area of legal aid, as in many other areas, unless all poltiical parties in Australia are prepared to accept the need for co-operative federalism, the need for a partnership between the Federal Government and the State governments, we simply wtil not be able to deliver to the Australian people the sort of services they are entitled to receive and there will be increasing dissatisfaction and discontent in the Australian seecommunity about the inabUity or incapacity of Federal and State governments to co-operate. I the believe that the community is growing unhappy about friction between the beFederal Government and the State governments and local government. Unless we can create a climate of partnership, a chmate of co-operative of effort between the 3 arms of government in Australia, we are not going to match the aspirations and expectations of the Australian people. If a person Uving in any part of Australia has a problem, be it a housing problem, be it a legal aid problem, be he a consumer who needs protection, be he a person who is in need of social services, whatever the problem may be, he is not interested in whether it is the responsibiUty of the Commonwealth Government or the State for governments to provide the necessary services; he is interested in receiving those services. How many of us in our capacity as members of this House have had constituents come to us with a and give us a saga of being shunted State office to another State office, and then of from a State office to a Federal office, and then when they got to thefirstFederal office they had been sent to another Federal office? Constituents have had to go through that sort of experience are entitled to be cranky about governmental arrangements in Austraha. They are ento say to pohticians on both sides of politics in Australia: 'Why do"" you not sort out a sensible co-operative balance between the Commonremove wealth, the States and local government?' Unless pohtical parties and governments in in Australia are prepared at many levels to pool their legislative powers, unless they are prepared co-operate in providing services on a one stop basis to the people of Austraha, there is going to be continuing and growing cynicism in Australia. It is the recognition of the need for that type of approach which has prompted the Opposition-it finds expression in our policy on federalism-to declare quite affirmatively and a without ambiguity that we stand for an effective partnership in government in Australia. We that stand for an arrangement whereby all arms of government in Austraha have a share of income tax revenue. We stand for an arrangement tween the Federal Government, State governfrom ments and local government whereby each of them has sufficient financial resources to distransfer charge their respecuve responsibilities. Our polto icy is designed to end much of the confrontation and friction which has existed in Australia with increasing intensity since the end of the Second World War. It is a policy which is designed not to entrench for all time the division of powers responsibihty between the Federal Government, State governments and local government. There is nothing inconsistent in our approach to inter-governmental relationships with the of transfer and referral of powers envisaged the measure we are debating now. Above all our pohcy towards federalism is this: It is all very well legally to divide power and responsibihty a federation but unless you give to each of the ements of government in a federation nnancial power to discharge their responsibilities the legal division will be ilhisionary and a fiction in cases. So the Opposition again says that it suphave ports in principle the idea behind the Bill. Its ports in principle the removal of any doubt regarding the constitutional capacity of the governments and the Federal Government to exchange powers. We believe that this is a measure which uniquely affects the rights of States and therefore the States have a right communicate their views not only on the prinwhich ciple involved but also on the means by which the Government has chosen to principle. We do not assert that there is necessarily anything wrong with the method the Government has chosen for implementing principle. What we do assert is that because it goes so fundamentally to the rights of the States they are entitled to express their views to this Parhament before the measure is passed. We support the measure in principle but we reserve therightin another place to modify it when the views of the States on its detailed provisions made known to us and to this Parhament.",50
156,Mr JACOBI,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY," I rise to supconstitutional port the constitutional amendment. Firstly I want to make 2 or 3 observations about the speech of the honourable member for Bennelong to be done. (Mr Howard). He, hke his coUeagues on the OpIdeally, position side of the chamber, believes in a conknows, federation, not a federation. His phUosophy puts me in mind of what was said once about an Anglo-Saxon elected in South Africa: He talks Progressive, is a Liberal and prays to God that the Conservative policies will carry the day. It is, of course, one of the quirks of the stitution that while it makes provision for the betransfer of powers to the central government the State governments, there is no reciprocity. In effect there is no provision for the of powers from the central government the States. Candidly, I think that the founding fathers overlooked the necessity to provide a two wayflowfor the transfer of powers. I go so far as to suggest that this lopsided power has given rise to the justifiable suspicion by the States that any and exercise of power automatically reduces their sphere of authority. (Quorum formed) There is nothing even Uke the compact clause in the United States Constitution which enables sort agreements between State governments in that by federation to be given formal, legal supportlimited as this provision may be. The nearest we have come to recognising formally a need to give in additional constitutional sanction to power shareling between governments has been through the Commonwealth-State Financial Agreement and the subsequent inclusion of section 105A in the many Constitution. Aside from this, for 75 years we operated in an essentially ad hoc fashion in supattempting to create orderly arrangements between the governments of the federation. SomeState times arrangements have been made through formalised agreements, leading sometimes to the backing of legislation from the parUaments of the the governments involved. However, there are to many other intergovernmental arrangements have not received formal backing like this, and even those approved by parUaments may implement that not be enforceable. Bodies such as the Australian Agricultural the Council have been founded and have maintained marketing authorities, at least at the top level, but only by the continued wUlingness of governments to remain in active participation. The very existence of these bodies demonstrates the incapacity of the present division of power under the Constitution to cope with the evolving are needs and demands of our society. The ad hoc nature of many of these arrangements, the legal uncertainties arising from their lack of formal backing, the unnecessary and costly dupUcation of effort and the compUcations which may flow from this cry out for something of course, there are, as this House well a number of areas where it is clear that there is an overwhelming need for a reordering of the powers of the central government and the States. It is tragic and irresponsible to conceive today that corporations, for example, might still be regulated by 7 sets of laws. We have 4 tory Congovernments in this so-called federation which choose to continue to compound the situation by their hotchpotch of interstate corporate affairs comrnissions. We have 7 defamation laws and 10 workers compensation Acts. This is a monstrous situation which honourable members opposite wish to continue to compound. Whatever might be done in reordering and restructuring the division of power between the national goverament and the States, in my opinion it would be wrong to leave open still the question of recognising in the Constitution the need for giving formal constitutional authority to the interchange of powers between the Federal government and the States. As we all know, in practice the Australian Constitution has proved to be extremely difficult to change. As Professor Geoffrey Sawer has said so cogently, beyond any doubt constitutionally Australia is a frozen continent. As a consequence, we have been obUged to get around the Constitution in many ways, and this has become the name of the game. As I have already suggested, the results of this can lead, and have led, to cumbersome machinarising ery, uncertainties and duplication in the workmove ings of government. If the experience of the 75 years is any guide at all, the continuing change in our social, economic and political can make a constitutional provision, previously thought to be inviolable, not only obsolete but also detrimental to the workings of good governalmost ment. The Industrial Revolution forced upon that country, as it forced upon this country, many changes in the working of governmental institutions, including the courts and the law, in a period when the rates of change were shorter than we experience today. In Australia the twentieth century we have already witnessed faces how many changes have made parts of our Connot stitution quite unfitted for deahng with many aspects of our life-in the fields of trade, comBeyond merce, corporations and industry. In 1901 the provisions of the Constitution on these and related matters were probably a reasonable reflection of the needs of the time. But today, viously, the corporate and economic facts of hfe in Austraha have far outstripped the Constithey tution. Companies, trade and commerce are no longer carried on in the style of the nineteenth century. This is a fact of life. Our founding fathers cannot be blamed for not foreseeing such changes but certainly we will be blamed if, on seeing them, we do nothing about them. There are many other ways, too, in which the rate of change has made the Constitution obsolinterpretation ete. The result has been that whatever the econthe omic and social reaUties have been at a particular time, in terms of the allocation of constitutional powers, change can and may soon make them outmoded. Grey areas appear clouding the once clear distinctions which might have been made, for example, between intrastate and interstate trade and commerce. Let us take the recent example of the important moves made by the Government to establish regional growth centres. The Constitution makes no provision for developments hke that. If the complex legislation for Albury-Wodonga is a good guide, with the required interaction between the central government and the States, in order to achieve a development like this we need better and more efficient machinery. What was satisfactory yesterday or even today as a means of regulating government power might, because of some completely unforeseen circumstance, be manifestly unsuitable tomorrow. But the matter goes further than that. What may be acceptable now may be downright damaging in 10 or even 15 years time. FlexibUity and interdependence ought to be the basis from which we work-no t fragmentation and divisiveness. A very great risk to our society, out of the inability of the Constitution to with thetimes,is that the nature of change past and the speed of change may be such that all governments in our system may lose control of life evolving situations unless our constitutional mechanisms have the adaptabUity and flexibUity to meet them. Once such control is lost it seems impossible for it ever to be restored in Britain finally completely. I want to make some further observations on the speech of the honourable member for Benin nelong. One of the difficulties which Australia today in relation to its constitutional crisis is that we need to review the Constitution but rather that we need the mechanism to change it. any doubt the Australian electorate, over the last decade at least and particularly in 1974, has been subjected to a barrage of deceit and deception about referendums from the political obdemagogues-the tories-whethe r they be from the States or from the Opposition here. Jointly did theh best to torpedo any constructive or effective attempt to carry the much needed constitutional amendments. However, section 128 of the Constitution-the referendum provision-ha s proved that this device has faUed to meet the need to update our Constitution. As the honourable member for Bennelong said, certainly the Constitution has been amended but, with a few notable exceptions, largely as a result of judicial by the High Court rather than at ballot box. It is an indictment of the current system that perhaps the most important express powers which over recent years have been conferred on the national government have flowed from judicial interpretations rather than from the ballot box. I refer to powers over restrictive trade practices, which the Opposition opposed; monopolies, which the Opposition opposed; the national Companies Act, which no doubt the Opposition will oppose; safety, efficiency and regularity in civil aviation; television and broadchanges casting; and the legitimation of children by subsequent marriage, which powers were vahd. These powers and others have been vested in this Parhament and despite rejection at the ballot box or at referendum, or confirmation if you like, the High Court has placed its imprimatur on the recommendations of the constitutional committees as set out in the 1929 and 1959 reports and in respect of which the Opposition in government over 23 years failed to act upon. All the powers have been given to the Federal Parliament by the High Court in terms of judicial interpretation. We as a nation ought to study and contrast, if you like, the people's track record, that is, the ballot box, and that of the High Court in the field of meaningful, constructive, progressive and much needed constitutional change. If one looks at that and assesses it constructively one will find that it is a deplorable record. Let me wrap this up by indicating that I firmly believe that section 128 must be the most serious issue facing this country and is without question the major stumbhng block in constitutional effective change. Clearly, as I said before, the problem really is not how to review the Constitution but change it. The nation has 4 options. It can choose to change section 128. It can reject a proposal change it. It can do nothing, or it can leave meaningful changes to be made by the Court. What is needed is for the intergovernmental arrangements to be given suitable recognition in the Constitution to enable interchanges of conearher, stitutional authority to be achieved without the trauma of referenda or backdoor dealings bethis tween the Federal Government and the State governments. Given this power the Federal State governments would be in a position to mote their own best interests without reducing the totality of theh powers. The States would, by House. this amendment, be placed on an equal footing with the Federal Government in relation to the transfer of powers. Furthermore, such a change more clearly opens up possibilities for power sharing, backed by formal constitutional means, hopefully enabling us at least to minimise the dupUcation of effort which is now sometimes required. Of equal significance, it would serve minimise therisksof legal compUcations and the so often empty but nevertheless potent catch cries on Commonwealth-State relations which in the past have been so destructive to attempts to obtain reasonable arrangements to meet changing situations. The proposed amendment would also be a more practical and certainly less explosive way than many involving necessary and important in the use of government power to meet the need for changes as they develop from time to time. Our present Constitution is short on the machinery necessary to keep the working of government at the formal level in touch with the evolving needs of our society. It is heavUy weighted on the other hand with sections which lack the flexibUity to achieve what is in the best interests of the country as a whole. What an amendment like this proposes is to present to the Austrahan people a realistic and hopefully acceptable means of ensuring that the poUtics of confrontation can be minimised in working to meet the contemporary and future needs of government in this country. There is of course no sanction requiring either the Austrahan Parliament or the State parliaments under section 51 (xxxvh) to act to share theh powers effectively, nor can or should there be anything like it. But by making reciprocal what is now essentiaUy one-sided as far as the States are often concerned, this should go some way at least in developing more meaningful and efforts by the governments of this country to deal with our most pressing problems. To to think otherwise would be to ignore the history of the past 75 years and would leave us in a situto ation which no one in this House who knows any anything about constitutional law can deal with High with any degree of equanimity. I conclude by reiterating what I claimed that the real problem is not to review the Constitution, but to change it. Difficult as this is, Bill at least which proposes to amend the Constitution is one constructive avenue by which and we can make the Constitution work with some prosemblance of efficiency and perhaps some semblance of success. I commend the Bill to the",54
157,Mr SNEDDEN,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,"I support this proposal. I think it is deshable that we put the proposal in the context of constitutional development and the need for reform of the Constitution in Australia. Quite clearly a constitution which has had its form for 90 years, although it has been operative for only 75 years, needs some to amendments to bring it up to contemporary requirements. What we need to think about first is the reaction of people to government. People see the Commonwealth Government, State government and local government bodies. What people are concerned about is that they get services as they require them from the best area of government to provide the particular form of service. The ordinary citizen is not concerned whether the service comes from the Commonwealth, State or local government provided it is given in the best form and provided it is given in the most economical form; that it is value for money. It was out of these sorts of considerations that the original impetus for a convention on the Constitution commenced in Victoria and it was in Victoria that the call for a convention came. It was picked up by all the States and by the Commonwealth. In due course a convention was put together in Sydney in 1973. At that convention there was a very great deal of goodwill from all pohtical parties from all the State parliaments and from the Commonwealth Parliament. Added to it there was, of course, local government representation. The purpose of the convention was to find a rationale for the necessary amendments which could make the Constitution respond to contemporary needs. What was seen at thattimewas that there should be a whole package of constitutional amendments which would be put to the Austrahan people by referendum. That has not been done. There has been a piecemeal approach to amendments to the Constitution and those that have been put up over the last 2 h years have all failed. I believe that some of those constitutional amendments could have been successful if they had been separated and yet been put as part of a whole refurbishing of the Constitution. Under the terms of this constitutional proposal it will be put separately again and for that I think criticism can be levelled at the Government and perhaps the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) directly, but there is no point in engaging in that sort of criticism. It wtil serve no purpose. What we need to do is to look at this Bill and to ask: 'Should this legislation be passed so that a referendum can be conducted of the Australian people?' What the outcome of that referendum will be one cannot know. Certainly if this had been approached in a different way there could have been almost a certainty of the referendum being successful. I doubt now that there can be ascribed to it that certainty. For my part I would like to see the Bill passed in this House, passed in the Senate, the proposal put to a referendum and succeed because I beheve it is a very worthwhile referendum proposal. The Constitution, as it binds the Commonwealth and the States, can be altered in 3 ways. It can be altered by referendum. It can be altered by the reference of powers from the States. It can be altered de facto by decisions of the High Court on constitutional cases. For my own part I do not like to leave to judicial decision the interpretation of the Constitution into a contemporary document. It is a difficult task to impose upon the judiciary and it does not enable consultation with the Parliaments by way of reference or consultation with the people of Australia by way of referendum. This is not to be taken as criticism of the High Court. On the contrary, I have the highest respect and regard for it. But it is not proper that constitutional development in Australia should de facto rely upon judicial interpretation of the Constitution by the High Court. When the Constitution was being drawn up a provision was put in section 51-it is in section 51 that the great majority of the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament are to be found-at placitum (xxxvii), which provides that matters can be referred to the Parliament of the Commonwealth by the parliaments of the States. Very httle use has been made of that provision. Basically, one can say that the 2 major references have been in regard to air transport in Queensland and Tasmania, as I remember it, and Tasmania also referred power in respect of trade practices to the Commonwealth. There were some other l references which are now defunct. One of the reasons for the lack of use of this provision was that the State parhaments did not know, because there was no sufficient judicial interpretation, whether they could refer powers for a limited period, whether they could revoke the powers once given or whether if they gave them, they forever rested with the Commonwealth. There were also some doubts as to whether if there was a reference of power it would be a power which remained with the States to pass legislation which would then be effected only by section 109 which would give the pre-eminence of legislative authority to the Commonwealth. Against those doubts the States did not use the provision. Also, there was a very serious shortcoming in that although the States could refer power to the Commonwealth there was absolutely no provision which enabled the Commonwealth to refer power to the States. So when the Constitutional Convention met in Sydney one of the first items that was listed was this very question. The report of the Australian Constitutional Convention in 1973 shows that the list of topics for discussion included as the very first item: The uncertainties concerning the power of State parliaments to refer power to the Parliament of the Commonwealth tion S1, placitum (xxxvii).] Indeed it was this very question of the interchange of powers which had largely led to the movement for a convention. A case had been decided by the High Court in which it was held that the exercise of the States applying a receipt duty tax was an excise power and it was therefore unconstitutional for the States to do it. The States asked the Commonwealth to impose the tax, or the excise as it ought properly to be referred to, and the Commonwealth agreed to impose the State receipts duty tax as a Commonwealth excise. But the legislation, introduced in the 1970 Budget, was rejected by the Senate. It is an interesting echo from the past in today's context as to the power of the Senate in relation to money Bills. In fact in 1970, because it was politically advantageous at the time, the Labor Opposition in the Senate rejected that Bill. That meant a restructuring of the Budget of the day. The amount of money involved, if my memory serves me correctly, was of the order of $300m. The Commonwealth therefore had to provide the money out of revenues not collected from the citizens. In any event, in order to get rational financial relationships with the States, the Commonwealth seriously contemplated the possiblity of giving the States excise powers to impose taxes. Equally, the States were anxious to have that power so that they could exercise what they regarded as responsible government in raising taxes and being answerable for them. At the same time there are many other powers which would be better exercised by the Commonwealth than by the States. So there was mutuality between the Commonwealth and the States for a refurbishing of the Constitution to put powers in the appropriate parliaments where they would be exercised better. That is the origin of this piece of legislation. The proposal was put to the meeting of the Constitutional Convention in Sydney. Outside the Convention a dinner was held by the Prime Minister at which 5 of the Premiers attended. After the dinner it was announced that there was agreement in principle to such a constitutional amendment to enable the transfer of powers both from the States to the Commonwealth and vice versa from the Commonwealth to the States. That was in 1973. In the 2 years since there has been a great deal of consideration of the matter by the Constitutional Convention Committees. There has been a great deal of discussion by parliamentary counsel as to the proper wording of this legislation which in turn will become tion to put to the people in a referendum. It very complicated piece of legislation. I see the [SecFirst ParUamentary Counsel, Mr Comans, sitting in the gaUery of the chamber. I am sure that he has had some part in the drafting of this Bill. I do not want him or anybody else to understand that this is an accusation of inelegance in drafting when I say this: When one looks at this Bill it is perfectly clear that a great number of people will not understand it and they will rely heavUy upon their confidence and trust in lawyers and politicians who do understand it to be satisfied, as people voting, which is the correct course of action to take. The Bill proposes to insert in the Constitution 2 new sections, section 108A and section 108B. For my own part I do not see any problems whatever with the proposed new section 108B. In fact its provisions are drafted in a straightforward manner and I have no difficulty with them at all. However, some of the States must have some difficulties in relation to proposed new section 108A. Proposed new section 108A (1) is quite clear as to what it means on its wording, but 108A (2) would present a great deal of problems to some people who are concerned that the Constitution is not changed from its basic federal concept to render it a more centralist constitutional document. Proposed new section 108A (2) reads: The power of the Parliament of the Commonwealth to designate a matter under this secuon is not limited by the provisions of this Constitution other than this section. That will raise great fears on the part of many people that the Bill is proposing to alter the Constitution quite dramatically by allowing the Commonwealth to pick up a piece of power, which it now does not have, and give it to the States. I think 2 things can be said about it. One is that it is very unlikely that the Commonwealth would attempt to give the States a power which it does not itself possess. The second thing is that I beheve, on the meaning of the words, that the Commonwealth cannot designate more power than the remainder of the Constitution itself in fact gives to it. In any event, there will be argument as to the meaning of it. There may also be argument as to the meaning of proposed new sub-clause (3.), which I will not bother to read but which needs to be put hi the context of proposed new sub-sections (2.) and (4.). The three of those need a great deal of examination before we will satisfy people's minds that they can readUy and properly vote in a referendum for this change to the Constitution. My colleague, the honourable member for a quesBennelong (Mr Howard), the shadow Minister is a for consumer affairs, has already said that the Opposition side of the House supports this Bill in principle. I very strongly support it in principle but we are confronted with the problem of what happens today in relation to this Bill. We could, if there were the numbers on the Government side, just push it through the House. We could use the power of numbers to push it through this House. Then it would go to the Senate. If it faUed in the Senate it could nevertheless be brought into this House a second time. The numbers could be used to push it through again and it could become a referendum proposal to be put to the people. Under those circumstances I feel that the possibUity of its passing would be very seriously damaged. As I am in support of the principle of the Bill and, subject to more consideration of sub-section (2.) of proposed new section 108A, in support of the legislation as it stands, I do not welcome the prospect of the referendum being damaged by that sort of procedure. I would therefore suggest that the proper course for us today is to consider the matter of principle as we are now doing at the second reading stage and the matter should then be put to a vote on the second reading. I would expect that in those circumstances there would be no voice in this House opposing the second reading of the Bill. If it received unanimous support in this House then the prospects of it being accepted in the referendum would be improved. It would also not have the effect of binding anybody at this stage to the exact words of the Bill. I pointed out that there will be doubts about three of the proposed new sub-sections. I thmk they can be resolved. I want to make that clear. But there is no point in my being satisfied and the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) being satisfied. It is the voters who need to be satisfied because they have to make the decision and they will have to put their trust, as I said before, in people whom they respect for integrity. The support and the trust they have will be so much the greater if there is a unanimous decision. I would therefore suggest that we put aside the Committee stage of tms Bill for a sufficient period to allow the States to respond specificaUy on the issues of drafting. The parUamentary counsel are well advanced in their consideration so governments can respond, and respond quite quickly. FinaUy, I draw attention to section 128 of the Constitution, which is the section which deals with referendum changes to the Constitution. It will be seen on looking at that section that the process of caUing for referendum is such that if the necessary legislation passes this House but does not pass the Senate and is passed by this House a second time it can still go to referendum. But there is another provision that even if that course is taken it will still be open to both Houses to agree to amendments to the proposal that is actually put to referendum. So with a spirit of cooperation in which this should be resolved it is up to both sides of the House to adopt the course I have suggested, wait for advice from the States and then consider our position. I would hope that the outcome of such a course will be co-operative unanimity for the passing of this important referendum. I thmk that if it is passed it will make a giant contribution to the future constitutional government of Australia.",56
158,Mr MCKENZIE,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,"Thos e of us who have taken an interest in the Australian Constitution over recent years, I believe, have come to the point of view that there is a great need for reform, and the referendums which have been put to the Austrahan people recently are an example of the desire of this Government to effect reforms to the Constitution. This Bill, which deals with the reference of powers from the Commonwealth to the States and the reference of powers from the States to the Commonwealth, has the support of the Opposition. I listened with interest to the remarks of the right honourable member for Bruce (Mr Snedden) and his suggestion that the Parliament ought to make sure that proposed new subsection 108A (2.) receives the complete support of the Senate. I think this is important. How long we delay it, however, is another matter, and of course it is not up to me to decide that. I take the right honourable member's point that in putting a referendum proposal-and I believe this is an important one-a U poltiical parties and all States should support it, because lack of such support makes it very difficult to have a referendum proposal accepted. We Uve in a very much different Australia from the Australia in which the founders of the Constitution Uved. They worked on the Constitution for a considerable number of years before it was finally carried as an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament and became the Constitution of this country. It was very much a compromise even in those days. If honourable members study the Constitution Act they will see that in the initial stages it was not necessarily intended that Western Australia should become a member of the Federation in the first instance. As it turned out, Western Australia did become a member of the Federation, and I think that was very much to the advantage of this country as a whole. However, that just indicates that at that stage some of the States and very many people in Australia did have reservations about whether we should join together in a federation of the various colonies. These problems have continued, of course, time has gone on. In fact, the problems that associated with the forming of the Federation have in many cases become worse with the passing of the years. So we find inherent in our Conplacitum stitution provisions which would not be included operates. in a constitution which was written today. Howdoubt ever, we all reahse the great difficulty in changing specific provisions of the Constitution to uncertainties allow for the need for change. The Constitution that Alteration (Inter-change of Powers) Bill is one monwealth way in which we can overcome some of these Commonwealth difficulties. The honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) mentioned some of the powers which remove could be referred. I will not cover that ground referenceagain but I shall refer to one matter which is of considerable interest to me, and that is the question of road safety and the interchange of powers between the States and the Commonwealth in It this matter - The first report of the House Representatives Select Committee on Road letters Safety, of which I was a member, made a recomrepresentatives mendation to the Parhament that the constihas tutional position so far as road safety is conthere cerned ought to be carefully examined. The Committee did this because we reahsed that there-is considerable difficulty. I do not know whether honourable members understand that in every State there is a different accident report form and that the people who concerned with the forms, representatives of the pohce forces in the various States, for instance, argue that theh form is the most suitable one them. This situation raises very serious problems in arriving at rehable statistics when.it comes consideration of matters affectingroad safety. These constitutional problems would, I beheve, be largely overcome if this referendum and the States can refer powers. It is not a matter on which a great deal of heat is engendered by either side-the Austrahan Government or the governments of the various States. The fact that the Road Safety and Standards Authority is tutional being estabhshed at Albury-Wodonga is a good indication of the co-operation which is coming forward even at this stage. But I beheve that is not sufficient. We need something written into our Constitution to enable a formahsation of agreements which may be arrived at in coconsiders. operation between the Commonwealth and the States. An important matter-this has been discussed before both at the Constitutional Convention and here-is whether the powers should be able to be revoked by either the Commonwealth or the States. I think that I should read the letters as which were presented at thefirstConstitutional were Convention in Sydney in September 1973. The New South Wales submission read: At present, uncertainties exist as to the manner in which (xxxvii) of secuon 51-the 'reference power'The limited use made of the power in the past is no attributable in large measure to such uncertainties. It is considered that, by constitutional amendment, these should be removed by providing, for example, references of legislative power by States to the Commay be made for limited terms and that repeal of a reference act has constitutional efficacy, and also that the Parliament might refer to the States any legislative power of the Commonwealth. The Victorian submission read: It is submitted that this provision should be amended to uncertainties that presendy exist-to ensure that a (i) is not irrevocable; (ii) may be for a fixed or determinable period; and (iii) may be subject to terms and conditions. is quite clear from both these letters from New of South Wales and Victoria and also from other written and remarks made by other State that this Bill in principle at least very general agreement. I would hope that if are any difficulties as mentioned by the right honourable member for Bruce they can be quickly honed out so that we can put to the Australian people a very clear and decisive referendum proposal which will be carried overwhelmingly. I beheve that this would be very much for the better government ofhis country. The way in are which the referendum is worded of course is important. The States in referring powers to the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth in for referring powers to the States must have an understanding. that if the situation alters the to a reference can be reversed. As I understand from reading the Bill the States still will have control because they can revoke any of the powers which is carried have been given at any stage. Before concluding I would hke to say something about the role of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) in pushing forward with these constireforms. I think constitutional reform is long overdue and the Prime Minister will be remembered intimeto come for it. No doubt the that lead which he has given will be taken up in the future. For a longtimethere has been a need to any do something about the matters which this Bill Until the referendum in 1967 deaUng with the breaking of the nexus and the changing of the powers as they applied to Aboriginal people in Australia was carried a referendum had not been put to the Austrahan people for many years. It is a matter of record and a matter of fact that in many other countries which require constitutions to be changed the constitutional amendments have been carried much more frequently than they have here. The remarks made by members of the Opposition parties lead me to believe that there is a very good chance that this referendum, once put to the people, will be carried. I hope that members in another place adopt a similar attitude because without that sort of general support I , together with the right honourable member for Bruce, am rather afraid that a referendum would not be carried. I see a very pressing need to do something about this matter. I think that such powers would be very much to the advantage of the people of Austraha. I commend the Bill to the House.",59
159,Mr LUCOCK,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,"With other members of the Opposition who have spoken on this legislation this afternoon I support it with perhaps the reservation that we want to hear a httle further from the States on theh consideration and theh opinion of this matter. I was interested to hear the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) the other day when he introduced the legislation. It can be said that some of the points that he made emphasise one of the difficulties and one of the problems of constitutional referenda. Perhaps there is a fear in the minds of many people when it comes to changing the Constitution. I think this fear comes from all quarters and not merely from one section. I think the fear arises because people do not know what might develop or what might happen after the alteration. That is why, as already mentioned on 2 occasions by the right honourable member for Bruce (Mr Snedden) and the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr MCKenzie), there is a difficulty in having constitutional alterations passed and in fact in having any referenda passed by the people. I was interested in the remarks of the Prime Minister when he mentioned that the reference of powers by the States to the Australian Parhament is already allowed for in the Constitution. He went on to say: This provision has been little used, largely because of the doubts that have been held by the States as to whether a reference once given could be revoked and whether a reference could be given for a term of years only or on conditions. The proposed Constitution alteradon before the House will remedy this posidon by making it quite clear that a reference given by the States will be revocable, that be given subject to conditions, ing the kinds of laws that may be passed in pursuance ofit, and may be made for a limited period oftime.It will also make it clear that the reference of a matter by a State will not prevent the State from passing laws with respect to that matter. A great deal has been said over a period in regard to the problems confronting Austraha with its 6 States and its Federal Government. Reference has been made to education, transport, health and matters in the international field. They all sometimes requhe a greater degree of co-operation from the States and the Federal Government than has been shown in the past. I agree with that. I think there is a necessity in this country for greater co-operation between the States and the Federal Government. However, I do not feel that perhaps the only way of overcoming this problem is by giving more and more control to a central government. I have said that for many years irrespective of what political party may be in control of the central government. One of the ways that difficulties could be overcome would be by greater cooperation between the Ministers in the States and the Ministers in the Federal Government. I realise that in that regard there are political difficulties. The political situation being what it is there is a very grave danger of the States trying to take an advantage and saying: 'The Federal Minister would not let us do this'. I agree that there is an element of difficulty in regard to this matter, but I feel that advances have been made, for example in thefieldsof education, health and agriculture. I think the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) would agree that in discussions between the Attorneys-General there has been on many occasions a great deal of co-operation between the Attorneys-General of the States and of the Commonwealth. In my opinion this is something that could be explored and committees comprising those gentlemen and their permanent heads could be set up so that consultation could be carried out with a minimum of delay. I think one of the problems relating to progress in Australia is the set-up that we have at the moment. Perhaps lack of co-operation is not quite the right phrase to use but in the set-up there is not co-operation to the degree to which there should be co-operation. I have stated on a number of occasions that I am not in favour of growth centres and yet in that regard we have seen a degree of co-operation between the Federal and State governments. I have an objection to growth centres because in my opinion it is a forced growth. You tend to discourage areas it may which are trying to make efforts on their own and including conditions regulatbecause both State and Federal governments make special and significant concessions to a growth centre there is a danger that other areas will say: 'Why should we worry? Let's wait and see. We might be picked as a growth centre later on'. I would rather see development along the lines of decentralisation by encouragement being given to all local governments so that they in turn, within theh own administrative framework, may be able to work in the sphere of decentralisation. As has happened in many areas in my electorate, I should like to see work which is of advantage not only to the people of a particular district but also to the people of many other and many other districts surrounding it. I think this is one sphere in which we could have a greater degree of co-operation between the Federal and States governments and local governments without having enforced control in enforced growth areas. I mentioned earlier that one of the problems confronting the acceptance of constitutional alterations is the fear in the States, and sometimes even within the Federal sphere, of greater powers in one area reducing the powers and the capacity in another. In his remarks the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) mentioned that the inference of conservatism from the Opposition was blocking the progress of more control for the Federal Government. I refer to the report of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review which was presented in 1958. The House may recall that that Committee met in 1956 and 1957. There were some very distinguished gentlemen from both sides of the Parhament on that committee. Mr Hewson-Can you name them?",61
160,Mr LUCOCK,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,"I will name them with a great deal of pleasure, because I think they were gentlemen who made a pretty valuable contribution. I think theh report shows the value of a joint committee discussing matters which concern both Houses. Senator Neil O'Sullivan was the Chairman. Senator Kennelly and Senator Reg Wright were members, as was Senator MCKenna. Other members were Mr Downer, Mr  Drummond, Mr Joske, Mr Ward and the present Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam. I tliink that report can be accepted as a very valuable report which achieved a great deal. I would make only one comment following what was said by the honourable member for Hawker which shows possibly one of the problems and difficulties confronting constitutional alteration. One comment in the report was: The Labor members of the Committee considered that full legislative powers should be vested in the Commonwealth Parliament with the duty and authority to create States possessing delegated constitutional powers . . . The next comment would be obvious. It continued: . . . but since it was not possible to gain agreement to this effect the Committee was concerned to ascertain what measure of agreement was possible between members from both sides of the Parliament. I think that that report expresses one of the difficulties and one of the variances of opinion between members of the present Opposition and members of the present Government. I do not areas take away from members of the Labor Party theh right to have that opinion. Many of them have that opinion and they are entitled to it. But there is a difference. They beheve in greater control for a central government. I believe that the members of the Opposition are not happy about that and we strongly oppose that particular thinking. I believe that if one increases the power of a central government one increases the dangers of bureaucracy in this country. No matter what happens, Ministers of the Crown and the Prime Minister are responsible to the people, and every so often they have to face the electors. Public servants are not in that category. In saying that, I am not in any way being critical of the Pubhc Service. It does a tremendous job and we are dependent upon it. We are dependent upon its advice and assistance and I believe in most cases that advice and assistance is given to the respective parties, irrespective of political views, to the advantage of the progress and development of this country. I come back to the point I made that too much centralised power means inevitably that decisions would be made by bureaucrats, in many instances without the abUity of the Minister to be able really to give the full study and consideration that he should give to the decisions. I am sure everybody will agree that the work of a parliamentarian, be he a back bencher or a Minister, in these days is increasing. The amount of paper work and the amount of administrative work have increased. As honourable members know, I have been a member of this House now for nearly 24 years. I would say that the amount of administrative work which I have now, compared with when I was first elected, is at least double, the amount of paper work has more than doubled. If there is too much centralised power there is the danger that we will take away power and authority from the States. They will be brought under the centralised control in Canberra. Ministers would not have time to meet deputations and to have discussions with the leaders of the community. Honourable members should consider that if we took away the responsibilities, the work and the tasks of State Ministers and placed them under a central control by Federal ministers, what would be the possibility of those Federal ministers being able to give the attendon that would be needed to matters of decision? I believe for that very important reason that very strong considerauon must be given to the continuation of the Federal system and the authority and the responsibility of the State governments. That brings me to the point that there is a great deal of value in this legislation which is being presented for the alteration of the Constitution by the insertion of proposed new sections 108A and 108B. Having said that, I believe that we must give attention to what the States have in mind in relation to this proposal. Consideration must be given to theh opinions and to their points of view. So, it is for that reason that, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Bennelong, we in the Opposition support the constitutional proposals involved in the change which the legislation presented by the Prime Minister seeks to achieve. But we beheve also that further consideration must be given to the suggestion and that the opinion of the States must be sought and considered beforefinalityis reached on this matter.",62
161,Mr ENDERBY,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,"It has been indeed pleasing to listen to the various contributions that have been made to this debate. I appreciate the great degree of unanimity that exists on this subject. It is all too rare in this House to find honourable members expressing such agreement on a subject. It is a pity that there was not the same degree of unanimity when the Government introduced this measure in March 1974. The House divided most vigorously on the issue when it was presented at that time. I do not wish to take up too much of the time of the House as the proposal is really a quite simple one and it has been dealt with by many of the speakers. The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) who has just resumed his seat in a wide ranging speech went beyond the bare bones of the proposal which is, as we all now know, to permit the exchange of powers from the Australian Parliament to the State parliaments and the return of powers on other matters from the State parhaments to the Australian Parhament, consequential on agreement. That is the basic of the Bill. The honourable member talked about philosophical matters. I will indulge myself, if I may, to answer him briefly. The honourable member directed some remarks to Government thinking or what he called Labor thinking on the subject of greater control in the central Government. If those are not the words the honourable member used, they are the words that I wrote down. Without conceding that that is a correct way of putting the proposition, I say that the honourable member should appreciate that the Government tries to face up to this problem of power just as indeed the honourable member for Lyne tries to face up to that problem. This is a concept which is often avoided in Austrahan politics, and we run away from it. The position of the Government is different from that of the honourable member for Lyne and the Opposition Parties in the sense that the Government recognises that power exists in the community. If political power is fragmented and weakened, far from achieving the results that those on the Opposition side want to achieve, when the excesses of power are avoided, we beheve that in turn excesses of power are created which are not accountable to anyone. As the honourable member for Lyne put it, the Prime Minister and Ministers of the Government are accountable to the people. They are accountable to the Parhament. They must stand up here at questiontimeand answer questions. Insofar as there is any power associated with them, it is responsible power for which they are accountable in a democratic way. But if a political power is fragmented in some form or another, in some constitutional or federal system, a confederate system or in some other system, so that pohtical power is watered down to such an extent that we will find a concentration of that power of a different kind in a difierent area-say , the private sector-w e will get for example enormous economic power, corporate power, which is not accountable to anyone. That basically presents a different ideological or phUosophical point of view that members of the Liberal and National Country Parties would take from that adopted by members of the Labor Party. We beheve that that type of power does not serve the interests of anyone. We believe in a democratic accountabUity of power. That is what often divides us. I do not want to take any moretimeon that subject. I see the honourable gentleman recognising that we have differences. May I return to the Bill? It is, as the House knows, a Bill which proposes that a referendum be held to alter the Constitution with respect to the interchanging of powers between the Commonwealth Parliament and the State parliaments. The honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) in a speech that was equally as wide ranging as that of the honourable member for Lyne drew attention to the remarks attributed to Professor Sawer of the Austrahan Nauonai University in which he described the Australian Constitution as perhaps a frozen Constitution. With respect to its Constitution, Austraha is a frozen continent. That is the way that Professor Sawer has put it. It was the right honourable member for Bruce (Mr Snedden) who said that our Constitution is not only 75 years old but really finds its roots or its basis in an earlier period. It goes back some 90 years. We know that attempts to change our Constishould tution have failed lamentably. There are really only 3 instruments of change provided for or built into the Constitution. One is the system of referenda referred to in section 128 of the Constistitution tution. That is the section which provides the tem whereby subject to laws of this sort being passed by the Parliament or in the event of those laws in some circumstances not even being passed by the Senate a proposal can be put to people by way of referendum and that is thereStates fore democratic action. The difficulty with system in practice has been that our founding fathers saw fit, because they represented State colonies at the time-in many ways still colonies of the imperial crown-to build in what they thought were safeguards to make change not easy.",63
162,Mr HOWARD,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,Ver y good.,64
163,Mr ENDERBY,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,"I would say very bad. In any ever been done. event, section 128 provides that there must be not only a majority of Australians vote for a proposal- I would have thought that that was enough; perhaps one could want a majority each State or something of that sort-bu t that there must be a majority in a majority of the ditions States in support of a proposal. Australia has States. A majority of six is four. The system not turn out to be exactly what it appears to paper. For a referendum proposal to be carried a majority not only of all Austrahans throughout the continent but also a majority of two-thirds of the States is required. We know that in practice it has proved almost impossible to obtain those majorities on quite number of occasions. This Government would dearly like be able to relax that rule. But it knows that it would run headlong into the opposition the Opposition parties. Then we would be driven back again to what the honourable member for Lyne, who is not a member of my Party, referred to when he talked about fear because camchange paigners in referenda, people who oppose proposed changes, certainly rely on fear. Section 128 has largely failed. It is a notorious factperhaps 'notorious' is the wrong word, but it is certainly a fact-that Labor Party governments want to change the Constitution by referenda. Liberal-National Country Party coalition governments rarely do as they are more prepared to accept the status quo. This is again a philosophical and a fundamental difference, between us.",64
164,Mr HOWARD,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,We can get the odd one through.,64
165,Mr ENDERBY,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,"Yes. The only one you got through was one which said that Aborigines be regarded as people. There are fundamental differences between us on these points. The second method of change which the Conprovides is to be found in section 51 sysplacitum (xxxvii) which enables referrals of power by the States. That is the one to which we are trying to begin to attend in this legislation today. We know that the Founding Fathers the thought that it might be appropriate for the to give one of the powers that they have to this the Austrahan Government. We know that the States have hardly ever done that because nobody likes to give up power. I suppose it is part of human nature. Also I think they have argued on the other hand that they might not be able to get back the referred power, as the language is unclear, and they might want to attach conditions to the exercise of power by the Australian Parliament. It is not clear whether conditions can be attached. So, that referral of power has hardly This measure seeks to overcome that situation by changing the Constitution to permit the States into have returned the power that they have referred if they want it back and to attach conif they wish to do so. In turn it will allow 6 us to give to the States some powers that it might does be more proper that they should have than we be on should have here in the Austrahan Parliament. The final instrument of change is the High Court itself. It is a lamentable fact or a pity that it has turned out to be the greatest instrument of change. There is no measure of criticism of the High Court in that comment. I refer to the fact a that the other systems of change have so dismally failed that the High Court which interprets the Constitution and which I heard the Chief Justice of say the other day was actually an arm of government-that is something with which I might not necessarily agree-ha s turned out to be the instrument of change. It is the only instrument of with respect to interpretation. More change, for example, came from the decision of the High Court in the concrete pipes case in terms of a transference of power from the States to the Austrahan Parhament than has ever come from any reference of power or referendum which has been put forward-certainl y if not now then in the future. It is to overcome the rigidity or inflexibility which is such a feature of our Constitution and which results in our country being described by prominent academics as the frozen land that this change is put forward on this occasion. It seems that the Bill receives support from the Opposition parties. We are very pleased about that. If the relationship between the States and the Australian Parliament is ever to change it is surely a matter for the States to decide whether it should change and the way in which it should change. I know of no way in which the States will suddenly disappear overnight, be swallowed up, evaporate or something of that sort, and I have no doubt that they will continue into the foreseeable future. This being so, then surely if the relationship between the States and the Australian Parhament is to change we must allow the States to change that relationship with us. This is not necessarily called striking a bargain-althoug h there is nothing wrong with that expression-o r horse dealing or anything of that sort. One certainly assumes that if this change ever becomes part of the law of the land, the Governments of the States and the Austrahan Government will at some stage in the future be able to sit down as rational men notwithstanding the difficulties which the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) described. I think he understated the position. One hopes that notwithstanding those pohtical difficulties the States will be able to say: 'We do not really want this power of defamation'-to take an example in the case of the States-'and you perhaps do not really want that exclusive power over Commonwealth places'. Other examples could be given. In those circumstances why can we not just put the matter right as sensible men should do? We would get an instrument of change. I agree with one of the earlier speakers who said that if this can be brought about it will be one of the most momentous changes for good in the future- I am not talking about next week or in 6 months time, I am talking of 10 years, 20 years, 50 years or 100 years-that will have been brought about in the Australian Constitution, because it will introduce an element offlexibtiitywhich, at the moment, is completely lacking. The relationship between the States and the Australian Parliament at the moment is nbt what they want it to be at all. what people back in 1870, who are long dead, said it should be. I cannot think of any State government which would say: 'The relationship is ideal; let it continue.' I cannot think of any Australian government, whether it be ofan Australian Labor Party or of a Liberal-Country Party coalition persuasion which would say: 'The relationship is ideal; let it continue.' Yet there it is, written in black and white, almost unalterable except by the interpretation of the High Court which from time to time is able to give new meaning to old words. If this Bill becomes law the relationship will be what the parties want it to be. Surely that is civilised; that is progress. We regard ordinary, natural persons as being entitled to determine their own relationships when they want to. Surely the States and the Australian Parliament should be able to do the same thing. Some questions were directed to me, I think by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) about sub-section (2) of proposed new section 108A. I put the situation to him this way: If he compares the present Bill with the earlier Bill which was dealt with last time he will find some differences. My recollection of the Bill which was before the Parhament in 1974 is that the exchange could be done on a State for State basis. In other words, State A could transfer a power on subject X to the Australian Parliament in return for some power. It could be done on that basis. Now, of course, the honourable member will note, if he reads sub-section (1) of proposed new section 108A that the power relates to all States. The States do not have to exercise the power but they do have that requirement. When one looks at sub-section (2) of proposed new section 108A I suppose the principal point I can put to him is, as he appreciates, that it provides that the power of the Australian Parliament to designate a matter is not limited by the general provisions of the Constitution. This will make it clear, for example, that the Australian Parliament could designate the matter of a State tax even though its own power with respect to taxation relates to Commonwealth taxation only. The Bill should also make it clear that the power to designate matters is not restricted by the requirement, for example, that Commonwealth laws with respect to taxation and bounties must not discriminate between States but must be uniform throughout the Commonwealth. I suppose one could argue that subsection (2) of proposed new section 108A need not be there. Mr Ellicott-That is a good point.",64
166,Mr ENDERBY,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,"It could be argued. On the It is other hand, we would argue that it should be there for vahd reasons. I put the view which I hold to honourable members hstening opposite - I do not know whether they hold this view; they may-that the question of intra-State shipping is a problem which the States, or someone in Austraha, might want to put right. They might want to make a better law. As I said a little while ago, at the moment the States are still, in many ways, colonies of the British Crown. The law on this subject is to be found largely in the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act of 1894. Mr Jacobi-That is a very modern Act.",65
167,Mr ENDERBY,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,"My friend the honourable member for Hawker who interjects from behind says that it is a very modern Act. I do not think anyone would argue that it is the latest word on the subject. The States are still bound by the onial Laws Validity Act because the Statute of Westminster did not pick them up. The Imperial Merchant Shipping Act cannot be repealed by the States. On the other hand, we of the Australian Parliament have no constitutional power to make a law on the subject. Mr Ellicott-Do not make that admission.",66
168,Mr ENDERBY,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,"My friend the honourable member for Wentworth warns me not to make too many admissions. The fact remains that one searches section 51 and looks in vain for a reference to shipping of that sort. One might find support for the proposition from some other part of the Constitution but that might be a matter where a reference of power might help overcome the problem in the way in which sub-section (2) of proposed new section 108A contemplates. That is just one example. The future may well produce other examples. The situation we come back to is that sub-section (3) of proposed new section 108A makes it clear that provisions hke section 92 of the Constitution - are apphcable to State laws made under a designation. Sub-section (2) is concerned principally with the designation by the Austrahan Parhament and not with exercises of power under the designation. Of course section 99 would have no application to a State law made under a designation. A designation must be made to all States by reason of the terms of sub-section (1) of proposed new section 108A. That is the matter I was putting a few moments ago. States could not be made subject to section 99 which is concerned with the Austrahan Parhament giving preferences between States. They would be free to legislate as they wished, subject to any conditions, etc., which might be found in the designation. I hope that my view on the subject in response to the request put to me by the honourable gentleman may be of some assistance. I do not think there is anything further I want to say on the matter. It is my understanding that discussions have taken place between the Prime Minister and, I think, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on the subject. I hope that we wtil pass the second reading of the Bill when it is put to a vote, that we will go into Committee and then, perhaps, move that progress be reported. I conclude with these final words: I am not sure whether the germ of this idea of a mutual exchange of powers can be traced back to the 1957 Joint Committee on Constitutional Review of this Parhament. I have a recollection that it can, although I have not had the opportunity to check it recently. I know that the Prime Minister has been very much attached Colto the idea of constitutional change for a great period oftime.He was active on that Committee as long ago as 1957. Certainly this Government, his Government, has tried very hard to upgrade and to modernise the Constitution. To date, we have had success which is not yet fully appreciated. When the High Court hands down its decisions we will know whether the success is greater or less than it has been to date. We all await those decisions with great interest. The initiative in bringing this measure forward is largely a tribute to the Prime Minister's persistent interest in constitutional reform and constitutional change and a recognition that this frozen, rigid Constitution of ours must somehow in 1975, and in 1985 and in 1995, be made capable of adapting itself to the changing world that it is intended to serve. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and committed pro forma; progress reported. LEGAL AID BILL 1975 Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 June on motion by Mr Enderby: That the Bill be now read a second dme.",66
169,Mr HOWARD,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,"The House now turns its mind to the Legal Aid Bill which was introduced by the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) some three to four months ago. I very much regret having to say at the outset of the debate that the measure of unanimity of opinion reached on the Bill we have just disposed of may not be present in the debate on this Bill. This is due, in the view of the Opposition, to the Attorney-General having embarked in the past few days on an irresponsible campaign to deliberately misrepresent the Opposition's atdtude to legal aid. Let me make it crystal clear at the outset of this debate that the Opposition is not opposed to the provision of adequate legal aid facilities in Austraha. For the Attorney-General or any other member of the Government to represent to this House or to the Austrahan people that we are opposed to it is completely irresponsible. Further, for the Attorney-General to threaten to treat a referral of this Bill to a select committee of both Houses or to a Senate committee as a faUure to pass within the terms of section 57 of the Constitution is to treat an important social service, legal aid, as a simple tactical poltiical tool. It is a device which I think all honourable members of this House ought to deplore. The Attorney-General's campaign of misrepresentation reached its irresponsible heights yesterday during questiontimewhen in response to a question, no doubt a Dorothy Dixer, a term well known to all honourable members, the Attorney-General said: The fact is that the Opposition parties do not believe in legal aid. There it is in black and white. That is the extent of the Attorney-General's misrepresentation. He then went on to say: The Opposition spokesman on matters affecting the Department of the Attorney-General, Senator Greenwood, is on record as having said that he opposes in principle the Australian Legal Aid Office. That means he opposes legal aid. That is what the Attorney-General said. What is inviting this House to accept is that because somebody may have expressed opposition in the principle to a particular method of providing legal aid-and I do not concede for a moment what Senator Greenwood's views may be on this matter-it follows automatically that he is opposed to the concept of providing legal That is the level of the misrepresentation that has occurred already and no doubt that misrepresentation wtil be continued during the course of this debate. The fact is that the Government is giving the indications of using legal aid as part of its tical ploys. It is bringing legal aid very much the pohtical arena. The Opposition hopes that debate in this chamber on the provision of aid services-w e would hope that there is unaNational nimity of agreement in principle that there ought to be adequate legal aid services in Australiain will be a sensible one and a debate which takes account of quite significantly different attitudes as to the manner in which legal aid can be provided. We support legal aid and we have made that clear before. We make it clear again and nothing that we wtil do during the course of the debate can be honestly represented as being other than total support for the provision of adequate legal aid services. But the Government apparently intends to argue that, just because doubts may be expressed about the method it has chosen to implement legal aid, those who have expressed the doubts are therefore against legal aid. Does the Attorney-General therefore argue that his 3 Senate colleagues, Senator Button, Senator Everett and Senator Grimes, are opposed in principle to national compensation? Has the Attorney-General forgotten that when the National Compensation Bill was brought before this House and gagged through it with not even a semblance of a decent Committee debate, that Bill, by resolution of the Senate, was then referred to a Senate committee? Has he forgotten that that Senate committee, after a lengthy examination, produced a repon to the Senate in which it recommended massive changes to the National Compensation Bill? Has he forgotten that the 3 Labor members of that Senate committee joined in the recommendations? Does he argue that because they did not like the method the Government had chosen for the provision of national compensation they are against the principle of national compensation? I wonder whether the Attorney-General really does believe that? That is the type of argument that the Attorneyhe General invites the House and the Australian people to accept in respect of legal aid. As far as Opposition is concerned he is not going to be able to get away with that; he is not going to be able to misrepresent our position on legal aid and he is not going to be able to tell the Australian people that we are opposed to the proaid. vision of adequate legal aid services. Why is the Attorney-General so concerned at the prospect of the Legal Aid Bill being referred to a committee of both Houses of this ParliaaU ment? Does he not want the Bill scrutinised? Is tache scared that the same embarrassing result into might come out of a Senate or joint committee examination of the Legal Aid Bill as came out of legal the Senate committee examination of the Compensation Bill? It is well known in this place that the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), particular, was very unhappy with some of the conclusions reached by the Senate committee which dealt with the National Compensation Bill. He was very unhappy at the fact that three of the people who shared those conclusions were members of his own Party. Is the Attorney General concerned that the same situation may arise out of the Legal Aid Bill? What the Opposition proposes-it will be the subject of a formal amendment which I will move in a moment-is that the Bill be referred to a joint select committee of both Houses of the Parliament for inquiry into and report upon a number of matters. Having said that we immediately hear a vitriolic and cerebral response from honourable members on the Government side. They do not want the Bill carefuUy examined. Of course not. They regard the Government's proposals on legal aid as sacrosanct. A few moments ago the Attorney General was extolling, in the constitutional context, the virtues of flexibUity and of having an open mind on change. We invite the Government to have an open mind on changes to this Legal Aid Bill because its proposals already have come under attack from a number of people whose respectabUity in and knowledge of the field of legal aid cannot seriously be caUed in question. Therefore the Opposition wants the provisions of this Bill to be scrutinised by a committee of both Houses of Parhament. For once we would hope that the Government would give members of this chamber, members of the House of Representatives, members of what in recent days has so often been described as the popular House and the people's House, an opportunity of sitting on that committee. We hope that the Government wtil adopt a flexible attitude to our proposals and establish a joint committee of both Houses. It is the Opposition's intention to move accordingly. We hope that the Government wtil see the wisdom of submitting its legal aid proposals to an examination by a joint committee of both Houses. Let me state at the outset that the proposal of the Opposition, if adopted by this Parliament, will in no way prejudice the current operation of the Australian Legal Aid Office. The Attorney-General knows that. He knows that nothing we propose to do wiU upset the present operation of the Australian Legal Aid Office or the provision of facUities that that Legal Aid Office is presently providing. For any Government speakers to argue otherwise would be to continue the pattern of misrepresentation that the Attorney-General has already commenced in respect of this measure. I think it is appropriate at the outset of this bate for me to state a few principles of the Opposition's attitude towards legal aid because, I believe, the Opposition shares with the Government a commitment to the provision of adequate legal aid facUities in Australia. Obviously, a commitment of this nature must be based on an approach of principle. I beheve that a number of principles are involved. I do not regard them as exhaustive and I do not regard them as totally definitive of the Opposition's attitude, but they give some indication of our thinking on the type and the nature of the provision of legal aid facilities in Australia. Firstly, we believe that no person should be denied the benefit of legal advice or assistance through lack of financial resources. Secondly, we believe that the existence of legal aid facUities should be made known to persons who might need assistance from those facUities. Thirdly, we believe that the administration of legal aid facUities should as far as possible be independent of government control. Fourthly, we believe that the provision of legal aid should take proper account of a person's right to have individual and confidential legal advice. The lawyer-client relationship should be precisely the same whether or not the cUent is in receipt of legal aid. The provision of legal aid facUities should not create a situation of first and second-class legal advice. Because a person has to receive legal aid the relationship that he might otherwise enjoy with his solicitor or barrister should in no way be diminished by the fact that he does not have the financial resources on his own account to engage a solicitor or counsel. Fifthly, we believe that there should be clear eligibility criteria for the provision of legal aid services in Australia. We do not believe in an open ended commitment to legal aid any more than the Government at the present time believes in an open ended commitment to other social services in Austraha. For anybody to suggest that there should be an open ended commitment to legal aid is to embark upon a path offinancialirresponsibility. We also believe that there must be a proper acknowledgement, in the provision of legal aid services, of the role of the private legal profession in deUvering those services. The Opposition beUeves that the Commonwealth Government has a legitimate and proper role in the provision of legal aid services. We do not believe that the problems of providing an effective legal aid service will be solved simply by leaving the matter to the States-no t because we believe that the attempts made by the States over the years have not contained a great deal of merit and have not decontributed a great deal to the provision of legal aid services, but the fact is that the Commonwealth has a direct constitutional legal responsibUity in a number of areas. Therefore it has a responsibUity to provide legal assistance to those persons who need assistance in respect of the operation of Federal law. Perhaps most imortantly of all, the Commonwealth is in a position to support financially the provision of legal aid services. It follows from that that it must have a very direct interest and responsibility in the provision of legal aid services throughout Austraha. The Legal Aid Btil which we are now debating represents, as I understand it, the end result of the Government's deUberations on the best method by which it can give legislative effect to the establishment of the Australian Legal Aid Office. Honourable members wtil be aware that under the Legal Aid Bill provision is made for a board of management for the Legal Aid Office and the estabhshment of a legal aid commission. Provision is also made for legal consultative committees to advise and be responsible for the provision of legal aid services at a local level. There are a number of general criticisms and doubts that may be expressed about the Bill. These are the sorts of doubts that the Opposition hopes that a joint committee of the 2 Houses will have an apportunity of examining. Firstly- I invite honourable gentlemen opposite to examine this-ther e must be serious doubts as to the constitutionahty of the functions conferred by the Bill on the Austrahan Legal Aid Office. The Attorney-General knows that the Commonwealth Government has no express power to make laws with respect to legal aid and advice. Certainly the incidental power under the Constitution would be some help in providing a constitutional basis base for the provisions of clause 6 of the Bill. I invite honourable members to examine the terms of clause 6, which is the clause setting out that the functions of the Office are to vide legal assistance in accordance with the Act. Then it goes on to spell out the matters in respect of which legal assistance will be provided. It speUs out a number of circumstances and concludes with the words 'where it is within the power of the Parliament to provide for the giving of the legal assistance'. Those words in themselves acknowledge the tenuous constitutional base on which this Bill rests. Ii is also true, in the view of the Opposition and also in the view of other persons interested legal aid facUities, that the scheme proposed the Bill duplicates existing services. It duphcates in many respects the existing State legal aid mittees. It duplicates voluntary legal aid schemes, in many cases operated by younger members of the legal profession who provide legal duty and after hours services for persons in need of general legal advice. In the Austrahan Capital Territory it certainly duplicates the exceUent legal aid scheme operated by the private profession in conjunction with the Attorney General's Department It duphcates specific provision which is already made under Commonwealth Acts in respect of the provision of legal aid where Federal law operates. I draw the attention of the House to the provisions contained in the FamUy Law Act, the Trade Practices Act and the concUiation and arbitration legislation where provision is already made for the granting of legal aid. These are matters of duplication. These are matters perhaps of overlapping bureaucracy. These are matters of additional cost which ought to be taken mto account in determining whether the Parliament supports this Bill. These are matters that can be investigated if the Bill goes to a committee. They are matters that wtil not be investigated if the Bill does not go to a committee. Once this Bill passes into law the deficiencies of it will be entrenched in the facUities which it sets up to provide legal aid, and much of the duplication, much of the additional costs, much of the lack of independence from bureaucratic control which concerns the Opposition will then be allowed to go on unhindered. One aspect of this Bill that concerns us greatly is the question of cost. One cannot talk about the provision of legal aid services or in fact the provision of any other services by government without being concerned about cost. Under the scheme proposed in the Bill the cost of legal aid could become unlimited. This Parliament must concern itself with the costs of legal aid. This Government must be concerned that people who need legal aid receive it. EquaUy, this Parhament pro- must be concerned that people who are not entitled to legal aid and who can afford to pay for theh own lawyers do not receive legal aid. There are certain passages and provisions in this Bill which concern the Opposition and which lead us to believe that in some respects there could be an open ended commitment to the provision of legal aid support. Overseas and domestic experience have shown that the cost of legal aid can grow very quickly. For example, in the United Kingdom for thefinancialyear 1969-70 in the total cost of legal aid was £Stg8,171,000. By by 1974-75 it had grown to f Stg30,076,000 which is almost a four-fold increase between 1970 and com1975. Aheady the Government's allocation for legal aid totals $16m. It may well be that the commitment that this Parliament should make to aid is a very, very substantial sum, but Opposition wants clear criteria as to eUgibtiity to receive legal aid. The Opposition also wants a system in the provision of legal aid in which there is no unnecessary duplication and no unnecessary administrative and bureaucratic expense. A number of more specific criticisms have been made about this Bill, not by the Opposition but by persons both in the practising and demic legal profession who are vitally concerned in and very experienced with the provision of legal aid services. This Bill has been described one legal correspondent in an Australian newspaper as one which pleases only the bureauare crats. There has been criticism of the lack independence of the Australian Legal Aid Office from the Government. If one looks at clause which is the operative clause so far as the deteras mination of pohcy is concerned, onefindsin clause (1) and in sub-clause (2) that a lot of erence is paid to consultation between the Board of Management and the Attorney-General, but of when one looks at sub-clause (3) onefindsthe following: If the Attorney-General and agreement, the Governor General may, by order, determine the policy to be followed by the Board in relation to that matter. What of course that means is that if there is disagreement between the Board of Management and the Government the Government will prevail. This, of course, follows a pattern that the Government has imposed in other legislation. I have already referred in this House to the power that the Attorney-General has under the Trade Practices Act to override decisions of the Trade Practices Commission when it pleases him and I refer honourable members again to that type of provision which is to be found in this Bill. The Government's own law and poverty commissioner, Professor Ronald Sackville, recommended that there should be established an independent legal aid commission. I refer honourable members to page 170 of Professor SackviUe's report on Legal Aid in Australia under the heading Legal Services Commission. It reads: The implementation of a nadonal program of legal aid should be the responsibility of a Commission established by statute and enjoymg independence from Government. Certainly the Legal Aid Bill we are debating establishes a legal aid commission. It estabhshes the Commission under clause 17 but then it confers upon that Commission only advisory power. If one looks at the various sub-clauses of clause 17 one wUlfindagain and again references to the Legal Aid Commission giving advice to the Attorney-General, but of course the real power will stUl rest with the Government. The independent commission having executive control over provision of legal aid services in Australia, recommended by Professor SackviUe and supported by the Law Council of Australia in its comments on this Bill, is certainly not to be the pohcy of the Government because the Governacament having established an apparatus to dispense legal aid, having established the bureaucracy, having said that the Legal Aid Office by shall be controlled by the Board of Management then is not prepared to give to the people who to run legal aid services in Australia the final of power to determine matters of policy. No member on this side of the House would dispute that 13, the Government should retainfinancialcontrol far as the provision of legal aid services is consubcerned. Only this Parhament should decide how defmuch money is to be provided for legal aid, but what we argue is that having made an allocation funds for legal aid it ought to be the responsibUity of the people who are administering the legal aid services to decide the manner in which that money is to be dispensed. the Board are unable to reach Mr Enderby-The lawyers.",66
170,Mr HOWARD,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,"We are certainly very concerned, as others are, at the lack of independence of the ALAO from the Government and also the lack of real power and teeth which has been given to the Legal Aid Commission. I think the Government ought to take very much into account the remarks of Professor SackvUle on this subject. If one looks at overseas experience onefindsthat only last year in the United States of America the Legal Services Corporation Act was passed setting up an independent corporation to take over responsibUity for legal aid. It had been found in the United States that the fragmented system of the provision of legal aid in which goverament interference occurred on many occasions was unsatisfactory and that it was desirable to estabhsh an independent corporation to take over the administration of legal aid services in the United States. I would like to make a few concluding remarks about the role of the legal profession in the provision of legal aid services. It is, of course, very fashionable when talking about legal aid services to take a lot of sideswipes at the legal profession. The Attorney-General himself did it a moment ago by interjection. Of course the legal profession should not have all the say in the provision of legal aid services. Of course there should be non-lawyers-and pleifty of them-involved in decisions both at a government level and at a local level so far as legal aid is concerned. However, I think the House ought to remember that the legal profession does have experience in the provision of legal aid services and must play a very substantial role in any system devised for the provision of legal aid, because however much people may take sideswipes at the legal profession the fact is that an independent legal profession is an important safeguard of individual rights in a democracy. The Opposidon certainly would not like to see any scheme which did not pay not overdue but proper regard to the maintenance and integrity of an independent legal profession so far as providing legal aid is concerned. Perhaps I should quote from a Press release issued by Mr O'Leary, the President of the Law Council of Austraha. It was issued in August this year in conjunction with detailed submissions made by the Council to the Government on the provisions of the Legal Aid Bill. It reads: 'It is easy to characterise interested', said Mr O'Leary, 'but that entirely overlooks the fact that the services being deUvered are legal which the legal profession is the skUled body within munity.' 'Legal aid was not invented recently,' he said. 'Since 1966 the Law Council has been pressing successive Attorneys-General to expand legal aid services by avaUable federal funds. The multiplicity of voluntary aid services started and administered by members of the legal profession is adequate testimony to the pubUc of the legal profession.' Having quoted from Mr O'Leary's remarks I and remind the House that the submissions of the Law Coundl of Austraha on the detaUed proment visions of this Bill ought not to be construed the Government as an uncritical acceptance of the concept of an Australian Legal Aid Office betary cause the submissions of the Council were made within the parameters of the BUT and the Attorney-General would be aware that back in May the Law Council accepted that the Governand ment had made a political dedsion to estabUsh the Legal Aid Office. Therefore any submissions it had made on the provisions of the Legal Aid Bill ought to be looked at on the basis of assumption by the Council and ought not taken as an automatic and uncritical acceptance that the Council, in fact the legal profession, reserve totaUy supports the concept of an Australian Legal Aid Office. Therefore, I move: That all words after 'That' stituting the following words: 'the Bill be referred to a joint select committee Houses to inquire into and report upon: (a) the adequacy of existing legal aid services Australia; (b) whether the provision made in the Bill is the effective, efficient ing legal advice and assistance; (c) which persons should be entitled to legal what should be the ance is provided; (d) whether proper protection of the individual's right to obtain independent and confidential legal advice and assistance is provided for in existing legal aid arrangements and under the Bill; (e) the extent of dupUcation in the provision of legal advice and assistance throughout Australia and the means by which unnecessary dupUcation can be avoided; (0 the Ukely cost of providing legal aid services in Australia over the next five years and subsequently; and (g) the clauses of the Bill'. In moving that amendment I ask honourable members opposite to treat it for what it is, that is, a serious attempt to take an inteUigent look at the provision of legal aid services in Australia. It is not designed to obstruct, delay or dismantle",70
171,Mr DUTHIE,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,It is humbug. the legal professions views as self,71
172,Mr HOWARD,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,"The Attorney-General and services in honourable members who sit behind him know the comthat this proposal of the Opposition will not affect the current operation.of the Australian making Legal Aid Office. They know that nothing we are legal proposing in this amendment will interfere with concern the provision of legal aid services which are presently available. We want an inquiry which wtil enable State governments, welfare agencies the legal profession to put their views to a committee, preferably of both houses of Parliafor once. I appeal to Government supby porters in this place to give members of the House of Representatives seats on a parliamencommittee. Let us not leave all of these parliamentary inquiries to members of another place. Let us give the members of the House of Representatives an opportunity to take a long serious look at the provision of legal aid services, which the Opposition fuUy supports.",71
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,Mr Lucock)that Order! The honourable member's time has to be exphed. Is the amendment seconded? Mr Ellicott- I second the amendment and my right to speak.,71
174,Mr INNES,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY," I rise to supbe omitted with a view to subport the Legal Aid Bill in its original form and anticipating the amendments to be moved by the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby). I oppose the of both amendment moved by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) which is clearly an in exercise in deception and an indictment of the attitude of the Opposition to legal aid in most Austraha. If we have a look at the Opposition's and economical method of providtrack record we see that the amount of money that was spent on legal aid in thefinalyear of the aid and Opposition's reign in this House was something basis on which advice and assisthke $290,000. That was a great effort! We had a great dissertation by the honourable member for Bennelong. The only intelligent thing he said was that he recognised the fact that there was a cerebral response from the Government-of course that means a brainy response. I hope that is acknowledged and the content of the Bill is treated accordingly. As the honourable member for Bennelong is leaving the chamber I would exhort him, if he is serious about providing proper and adequate legal aid, to ensure the passage of the Bill, with the proposed amendments of the Attorney-General, through another place. The philosophy running through the major programs of reform introduced by our GovernGeneral. ment in the areas of health, education social curity and others is a necessity to provide services to the people of Australia on the basis of needs. Priorities have been established on this fundasomething mental notion of providing access to community facilities to those people who are urgently requirlegislation ing our attention and protection. Once again, establishment of the Australian Legal Aid Office by the provisions of the Legal Aid Bill 1975 is in line with the Labor Government's pohcy of all citizens being equal before the law- a genuine declaration which is in sharp contrast to the tude of the people who sit opposite who believe that there should continue to be an open slather for imposters, crooks, shysters, local land sharks and phony lawyers who act on behalf of viding insurance companies, employers and others, to exploit the people who cannot protect themlegal selves simply because they cannot meet the exor5000 bitant fees charged by the mixed bag of legal advisers available to them. It is necessary to point out that the ALAO be complementary to the private lawyer and other bodies which are concerned with the prothis tection of individuals in need. Our learned friend at the table, the honourable member for Wentthe worth (Mr Ellicott), and all his offsiders have had a bonanza and no doubt will continue to so until we can provide an adequate service the basis of need to people who cannot afford it otherwise. It is all right for the honourable member for Wentworth and the other gentry around Victoria, has the chamber to protect the blue bloods. The system needs to go a lot further than that. So far as the involvement of other bodies, this is the key to the ALAO. It is in direct contact with the various service bodies in and around the area which know the problems of the people in the electortotally ate of Melbourne in particular and the poorer Opposition? areas of Sydney and other places. They can relate to them. They do not run up against a wall because the people who go to them do not have to get into their pockets before they are even talked to by some smart solicitor. A great deal of debate has taken place within the community by representatives of law societies, legal referral services and interested groups. This has enabled the Attorney-General and his Department to frame a Bill that can guarantee a service practical in application that will be of benefit to the people of my electorate of Melbourne and others who are in a screaming need of assistance. The suggestions of the people to whom I have made reference and the debates which have taken place have resulted in the amendments to be moved by the AttorneyWhy go on with the humbug of the Opseposition amendment referring the Bill to a committee? Anybody who has been in this business long knows that the easiest way of disposing of or shelving it is to refer it to a committee. That has happened time and again to in another place. It has been referred the to a committee and there it has died. It would be remiss of me if I did not make mention of one of the existing facilities that has provided much of the information born out of its attiexperience which has served as the base for the introduction of this legislation. I refer to the Fitzroy Legal Service situated in the heart of my electorate. It has done a magnificent job in prothe type of legal aid at shop front facilities for a multitude of people over a wide range of problems. The service deals with about cases a year. It has not operated simply as a pilot scheme in the first instance and then faded into a minor role in the scheme of things; it has developed a highly respected service. It is actuwill ally providing another ALAO office on the cheap. I stress to the Minister the importance of service to the people of Melbourne and other areas and ask him to recognise the role played by Fitzroy Legal Service and like organisations and to ensure theh survival, at least until proper do and adequate service can be provided by his Deon partment through the structure of the ALAO. The role of the Opposition in general, and in particular the lord of the western districts in been an absolute disgrace. In the fact of pubhc demand for the establishment of this type of legal facility, rejection of this Btil, the non-acceptance of it the shelving of it or whatever the Opposition might want to do with it, is irresponsible. Just how fah dinkum is the As usual the honourable member for Wannon brick (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has opened his mouth and let the wind blow his tongue around. He has said that the Opposition will reject or dismantle the program, and in so doing has compromised some of the learned gendemen opposite who have always genuinely supported the introduction of the ALAO and recognised the fact that if the service is discontinued it will have the same effect as cutting the widow's pension or the invahd pension. It is now recognised as part of the whole structure. Mr Hewson-That is not relevant.",71
175,Mr INNES,NAVY SUPPLY CENTRE AND ARMY,"The only thing that is not relevant here is you. If we are to provide a service to protect people against the individuals to whom I have referred, then we have to be clear and unequivocal in what we want to do. We have had debate in the community. We have talked to individuals concerned. We have carried out surveys. We know clearly from all the information-by God, we have plenty of it-that over a number of years the previous Government totally disregarded the provision of facilities to protect individuals against the scoundrels in the community. People are sent to me from lawyers- halfment of smart lawyers, probably in the Liberal Partywith letters of introduction so that they can ask me to make representations to the Department ofLabor and Immigration to have their visas extended. I said to one of them: 'How much did it cost you for that advice?' The fee was $120, would you mind. A letter was sent to the right honourable member for Bruce (Mr Snedden) asking the same sort of advice. The person involved should simply say: 'You go along and see your member of Parhament. He can fix that up as a matter of course'. The guy finished up in my office. I do not know what the service was like. I do not know what the charge was. He was not terribly satisfied with the service. I have letters which show how fair dinkum some honourable members opposite are. The Leader of the Opposition has compromised these honourable members. Letters have been sent to the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) by Ralph Hunt, John Gorton, Don Cameron and William MCMahon, would you believe. I wish to refer to a couple of them. Ralph Hunt states: I would firmly recommend that the City of Dubbo be selected at the earliest opportunity for a branch of the ALAO. As you will know, Dubbo serves a very extensive region, and a branch of ALAO in Dubbo would provide legal assistance to those in need from as far west as Bourke, and as far east as Mudgee. A letter written by John Gorton states, amongst other things: Malvern has a large elderly population, whose insubstantial means frequently prevents them from seeking legal justice. The people of Prahran, either that pan which comes into my electorate or that pan which comes into Melbourne Ports, do not always attain legal justice because of lack of means and/or lack of knowledge and fear of the legal system. Both areas have a large Greek population and communication difficulties leave them at a handicap as far as legal justice is concerned. Malvern is well served with a tram service and a location in Prahran would probably cater well for both areas. Don Cameron writes: I acknowledge receipt of your circular letter dated 1 April 1975 and in response to your request for suggestions as to desirable areas in which to establish an Australian Legal Aid Office I suggest the Brisbane suburbs of Sones Corner and Cannon Hill. William MCMahon writes: As you know, Burwood is the main business and commercial centre in the mid-western suburbs of Sydney and is extremely well served by public transpon from all points of the compass. These factors, combined with its central geographical location, make Burwood eminently suitable for a Regional Legal Aid Office to serve more than 200 000 people in Burwood itself and surrounding areas. I would be pleased if you would consider the establishsuch an office at this centre, and look forward to receiving your funher advice as soon as possible. These letters demonstrate the recognition of the ALAO by those honourable members. Their leader, tins great fuhrer has compromised them. If they have got any courage they should stand up and be counted and force the Bill through in another place to ensure that the facilities are provided. We listened to the humbug of the honourable member for Bennelong talking about his own",73

The honourable member talks ridiculous nonsense about the solicitor-client relationship being taken away. If the honourable member can read, if he was taught to read at law school, he should read the documentation that was put out on the Legal Aid Office.

179,Mr INNES,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"The number of interviews taking place is growing daily. Much more effective assistance can now be given by the adoption of the shopfront approach and by social workers and others welding together all the facilities available. The Opposition meeting on Tuesday morning resolved to seek to have the Legal Aid Bill referred to a committee of this Parliament, as is indicated in the amendment. This of course is an old trick designed to kill off a Bill. It could be held up for months, even years, without the Opposition actually being seen to be voting against it on the floor of the Senate. That is a courageous stand! In other words, honourable members opposite have not got the guts to stand up and say, as they clearly beheve, that the Liberal and Country Parties are opposed to the provision of legal aid. They seek to disguise their contempt for the underprivileged, migrants, people on social security and the inarticulate by the shoddy, back-door device of sending the Legal Aid Bill into oblivion. The Austrahan Legal Aid Office was a creature of the Austrahan Labor Party. It was set up to fill the vast gap between the claim that all zens are equal before the law and the reality that only those citizens who could afford the services of lawyers were equal before the law. As with the inequitable system of taxation deductions, subsidies and the like built up over the years by the conservatives, so equality before the law became a very sick joke. Now, just as they have threatened to abolish and dismantle Medibank, the same defenders of privilege are threatening to dismantle and abandon the provision of legal aid services to the needy or to send the Btil to a place where it wtil never be heard of again. They have put up a lot of rubbish and nonsense about inquiries. The Bill would be in and out of the Senate like a fiddler's elbow. By the time it came back to this place, if it did come back to this place, the Government could not accept the amendments. The Bill would be only a shadow of its former self. We would see the honourable member for Bennelong ringing his hands with glee because the bonanza that he and his Total to Quaner ended Month ended Month ended Total to 31.3.75 30.6.75 1.8.75 31.8.75 31.8.75 3 528 740 447 412 5 127 153 no staff 153 740 447 412 5 280 3681 32 628 14 648 12 523 126 419 66 620 counterparts have enjoyed over a number of years would survive and continue. I can understand, however, the inability of someone like the squire of Wannon to understand why the Austrahan Legal Aid Oflice is conducting a socially necessary role in Austraha. Most ofhis friends would have Queen's Counsel on the payroll. They would not have to worry about going along to the shopfront facility. They could go down to Queen Street or to whatever street lawyers hide in in Sydney. They could go anywhere. They could use either theh personal staff or any of the individuals that are available to them-pai d for probably by the National Country Party or the Liberal Party. Those people would not have to worry about legal aid. None of the friends of the Leader of the Opposition would earn less than probably $20,000 or $30,000 a year. They would not want help in the area of consumer protection or shonky hire purchase contracts. His friends would be the ones perpetrating the rorts not the ones suffering from them. If Malcolm Fraser's friends want help they would simply pick up the telephone and contact one of the Queen's Counsel which the Melbourne Club estabhshment has on tap. The citi- blue bloods are protected all right but they do not worry at all about the individualsMr King- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House. (The bells being rung)Mr Innes- I take a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.",75
180,Mr HOWARD,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,What is your point? Mr Innes-You were just about outside the door.,75
181,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,Mr Lucock)Order! In the strict sense an honourable member should not move in the chamber while the bells are ringing. I assumed that the honourable member for Bennelong was going to speak to the Whip. I was watching closely that he did not go any further. (Quorum formed),75
182,Mr INNES,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"As I said it is not the blue bloods we are catering for in this legislation. If it feated or amended in another place the wrath of the people will be concentrated on the guilty men opposite. They will have to stand up and justify the total disregard, as will the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King) who is walking out the door, that they have for the people who need the service.",76
183,Mr ELLICOTT,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"It is a great pity that this debate which could be on an elevated plane has tended to be reduced by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) to a mud stinging match. I do not intend to indulge in that except to say that I note that the legal aid offices that have been established first are all in Labor electorates. Let me say at the outset and reiterate that the Opposition is not opposed to legal aid, never has been and never will be. I hope that we can have a sensible and responsible debate about a very serious subject that affects this country. The Opposition takes the view that legal aid services should be provided in the most efficient, accountable and accessible form to those in need of it. For this purpose the Opposition believes that a joint committee of both Houses should consider the important legal, social and constitutional issues involved. It is time, as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said, that we acted as a Parliament on a matter hke this. It istimethat we legislated on the basis of an inquiry into the important issues involved. We already have had an inquiry into the National Compensation Bill. That Bill was dealt with in the same way as this Bill is being dealt with in this House. We saw what happened to it. I suggest that the same thing will happen to this Bill if it is not at this stage dealt with on a proper basis. It will not help the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) to treat the referral of this Bill to a committee by the Senate as a failure to pass. It is not a failure to may as well wake up to that, take the advice and get on with the job of getting a proper and effective legal aid Act for the Commonwealth. There are a number of reasons why it is both desirable and convenient to take this course. First of all the question of the extent of the of this Parliament to provide funds for legal is presently before the High Court. In those cirParhament cumstances I suggest to honourable members that it is stupid to legislate until we know what the High Court has to say. Those who have dared to to challenge the power have been berated by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) and the Attorneyaccess General. These days if people attack legislation the Government attempts to shame them beis decause they have dared to exercise theh undoubted power to challenge unconstitutional legislation. If the legislation before theHigh Court is declared invalid it is probably the Government's fault for not putting it in proper legislative form. Obviously there is no power in the Constitution to legislate with respect to legal aid as a subject matter. On the other hand it is very likely that this Parliament has power to legislate so as to provide legal aid to citizens who are exercising theh Federalrightsbefore Federal courts. It is foolish, I suggest, for this Parliament to proceed with this measure while the matter is before the High Court. The second thing I wish to bring before the House is this: The fact that a committee is set up will not prevent legal aid being dispensed through offices already estabhshed. Quite obviously this can continue. As we understand it the Attorney-General is engaged in the act of setting up another 30 regional offices. The setting up of these offices will go ahead. The Attorney General will go on his merry way whether this legislation goes through or not. If a committee is set up that wtil not prevent the Attorney-General from setting up these regional offices. Whether he is wise in doing so is another matter, but the setting up of a committee wtil not prevent his doing so. Thirdly there is no need for a lengthy delay. The committee should be able to deal with the matter by early next year-that is to say before the High Court hears the proceeding before it and is able to give its decision. Another matter is this: Already there are several other comprehensive reports into the subject of legal aid in Austraha, and these do not agree about the manner in which legal aid can best be provided. There is the report of the Australian Legal Aid Review Committee of March 1975, the Sackvtile report on legal aid in Austraha and the Tomasic report issued by the Law Founpass. He dation of New South Wales. There are many helpful articles including an article by Messrs Ross and Mossman on legal aid in New South Wales in the Australian Quarterly, Volume 47, of March 1975. These raise numbers of legal, social and constitutional questions and the power recommendations differ. They deserve study, aid consideration and report by a committee of the in order to find the best solution. For instance, the Sackvtile report stated: A significant expansion of legal aid in Australia is required meet legal needs within the community and to guarantee that all individuals and groups, regardless of means, have to the full range of legal services. The second recommendation is this: This expansion should be based primarily on the establishment and development of a network of neighbourhood or local legal centres employing salaried lawyersThat is a matter of great debate. The Sackville report has brought forward that recommendauon, but the extent of the use of a salaried legal service in the provision of legal aid should be looked into. Submissions have been made to the Attorney-General by the Law Council of Austraha. So far as I am aware, having had a look at the amendments that the Attorney General proposes, he is not prepared to adopt some of the basic submissions the Council has made. For instance, the Law Council has suggested that the Law Commission should be independent of government. The Attorney General, so far as his proposed amendments indicate, has refused to adopt that submission. It is suggested that the composition of the Board of the Commission and the consultative committees be amended to give further representation to the independent legal profession. So far as I read the Attorney-General's proposed amendments they do not embrace that matter. There are other matters that the Law Council mentioned. They are submissions which are made by the main representative legal body in Australia and they are worthy of consideration by this Parliament. The legal profession has an obvious interest in legal aid and its role in legal aid requires effective and absolute assessment. I have already referred to what the Sackvtile report said about the use of salaried lawyers in legal aid. Another matter which is of vital importance the question of independence, which I have already mentioned. Unfortunately the Labor Government tends not to work with people or involve people. It likes to tell people what to do. With legal aid it is doing exactly the same thingcarried telling people what to do. It wants to bureaucrastrate, tise legal aid. It wtil not trust social legal profession or the people involved, who are the recipients of legal aid, to run theh own legal aid system. In other words, it will not trust community that knows most about the question efficient of legal aid. I suggest that here is another issue which needs very careful consideration before Bill such as this goes into law. The role of existing legal aid schemes needs be considered. For instance, in New South Wales, as honourable members wtil know, we ensuring have the PubUc Solicitor associated with the that Pubhc Defender. We have the Law Society's scheme which has been set up and approved by statute and the role which the Law Society is perate forming in relation to legal aid. In yesterday's Press there was a report of what it is doing. The report stated in part: The New South Wales law society expects its legal aid system for juveniles will cost $500,000 next year. The scheme, which provides the services of an experienced solicitor at all children's courts, is probably the most extensive in Australia. SoUcitors workmg on a duty roster made more than 1100 court appearances for juvenues in May and June. In other words, there is in New South Wales a very effective legal aid system which has been at work since the early 1940s.",76
184,Mr COHEN,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,They wtil go to the ALAO.,77
185,Mr ELLICOTT,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"Of course they wtil go the ALAO as well. All I am talking about is the absolute need to work out the role of those other bodies of legal aid in relation to the Australian Legal Aid Office. These considerations strongly support the setting up of a committee, preferably a joint committee. If the Government refuses to do so I suggest that it is clearly playing politics with legal aid because I can assure Government supporters that it wtil not do them any good to treat a referral by the Senate to a committee as a refusal to pass. That is a vain hope. It would be far better for the Parliament of the Commonwealth to look at the various issues involved and to come up with a good, effective and efficient scheme of legal aidforthis country. That is why we have put forward this motion. The Opposition is not opposed to legal aid. Tp say that it is is absolutely false. The Opposition's concern is to ensure that Australia has the most efficient, effective, economic and just system of legal aid that is can be provided. It was in that context that the statement was made in the alternative Budget that we wtil aboUsh the Austrahan Legal Aid to Office. We made that statement hi the context that we believe that legal aid in Australia can be out more effectively, as I hope to demonthrough the State systems and not through workers, the a Commonwealth system. I wish to set out what I beheve to be some the basic principles to be applied in devising an legal aid service in this country. Firstly, the legal aid service adopted should represent a co-operative involvement between governments at State and Federal levels, the legal profession, other professionals who are involved, such as to social workers, and the assisted public. Secondly, the Federal Government has a definite role in the provision of legal aid. Let it be clear this is not a matter, and is not being put forward as a matter, of State rights. Obviously a Federal Parliament which passes laws which crerights, duties and obligations has a real consideration in relation to those citizens who are enforcing those rights. The Houses of this Parliament are entitled to pass laws which effectively provide legal aid for people enforcing federal rights. So a Federal government has a clear involvement in legal aid. The third principle is that in a federation an effective system cannot be worked out without co-operation between State and Federal governments. Let me explain. It appears that in this ticular measure there is a limitation on the legal assistance or legal representation which can be aided by a federal legal aid office. There is a stitutional limitation. Most of the individual rights which people have in this country spring out of State law and not out of Federal law. Therefore, if one goes into a Federal legal aid office there is a hmitation upon the nature of the advice and the extent of the assistance which one can get. On the other hand, a State legal aid office can provide assistance right across the board on Federal and State matters for constiprofession tutional reasons. Obviously from the point of view of the pubhc the most effective legal aid office will be one which enables the officers to give legal aid to people, whatever the source of their rights, be Federal or State. It is rather stupid to have verse and dupUcated system whereby we have Federal legal aid offices deahng with Federal cannot matters and State legal aid offices, State agencies or law societies which are giving legal aid another basis. Here we find not co-operative eralism; we find instead a confrontation between the State and Federal systems. For that reason believe we need a rationalised system of legal in this country operating through the States with Federal involvement and Federal support bothfinanciallyand, if necessary, legislatively. For instance, we could have in each State legal aid commission which would have within the necessary salaried service to the extent to which that was thought prudent. Within that legal aid commission, which independent commission supported by and set up under State statute and supported by State and Federal money, offices could be set up in which members of the pubhc-ou r constituents as well as State constituents-coul d get the legal aid they want without any reference to the conafford stitutional difficulties. It would be a co-operative system of legal aid. A committee would go into this question and would ask what was the most effective way in which to do it. Fourthly, the legal profession must play leading role in any legal aid service. I believe that the only way of getting the maximum confidential and independent advice is by the involvement of the independent legal profession. That is a basic element in our democracy. Once the independence of the legal profession is dealt a blow, that wtil deal a blow to this country and to our basic rights. Whatever one says about lawyers and their fees, say nothing about the independence of the legal profession. I can par- assure the House that once the legal profession comes under the control of the State, that will be the beginning of the end of Uberty in this councontry. Have no doubt about it. If we bureaucratise legal aid and keep out the legal profession we will find not only wtil a blow have been struck at the independence of the profession but also the community wtil be deprived of the practice and expertise of the profession. What is more, one aspect that is tremendously important is the voluntary contribution of the itself. May I say that I have never found very many barristers or solicitors who were not prepared to make a contribution. They do already make significant contributions to legal aid in this country and have been doing so for many years, as have other professions. Unless it the voluntary contribution of the legal profession a diis harnessed for the benefit of the community, legal aid wtil not mean very much, because we afford it. That is the point. It is a bottomless pit. For instance, last year in the Australian on Legal Aid Office approximately $6m of work fedwas promoted. That work had not yet been paid for. The appropriation of $7m in this year's I Budget represents money that has already been aid spent in the sense that the work has been underbut taken. That money is for fees that the Government must pay to the legal profession for work which is in train. This year, of course, more work will be undertaken. The bottomless pit of legal a aid which must be watched is this problem of it keeping a rein on expenditure, keeping it there through the legal aid system and through the exercise of proper principles and these have to be could be an adopted aU the time. I think, because of the cost of litigation, that a contributory scheme is deshable. There are some people who are supposedly affluent who are deprived of theh legal rights because they cannot to go into litigation. That is a fact. It is not only poor people who are in need of legal aid. Some supposedly affluent people share this need. In order to ensure maximum accountability and community involvement the legal aid scheme should be administered by a body or bodies a which are independent of government. I have already dealt with that. There is a distinct role for a salaried service in areas of need. Again, legal aid should be administered as close to those needing it as possible by duty soUcitors and the Uke.",77
186,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,Dr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,79
187,Mr MULDER,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE," Mr Deputy Speaker, this BUT when passed will, among other things, estabUsh the Australian Legal Aid Office as an independent statutory body. Since this is one of the Bill's most important functions, I would like to spend sometimeon this issue. The second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) on 5 June this year told us that on 23 July 1973 the former Attorney-General, the then Senator Lionel Murphy, announced the estabhshment of the Austrahan Legal Aid Office. Individual offices soon began operating. These offices were and are still under the Attorney General's direct responsibiUty. At that same time a Legal Aid Review Committee was also formed. Again the second reading speech informs us that the reports of that Committee, together with a discussion paper by Professor R. SackvUle on legal aid in Australia, and submissions from and discussions with representatives of various Federal, State and private legal organisations give this Bill a firm basis on which to operate. So it would appear that the consulted organisations are in agreement with the provisions of the Bill. Indeed the law societies of Austraha and the States have co-operated at all levels and for this we must indeed be grateful. Private legal practitioners are in fact essential to the every day as well as theoretical and administrative functioning of the office. Without forgetting our discussion of the Legal Aid Office being an independent statutory office, I would like to outUne a few of the ways in which the office now works and, it must be presumed, will work in the future. There are two sources for the office's chentel. One of these is where lawyers refer cases that they are deahng with to the Legal Aid Office for assistance in paying for theh fees. The people will have these cases for legal assistance dealt with in the same manner as those who come the office personally. The second is the general public, members of whom come into the office for an interview concerning theh particular probset lem, which may or may not turn out to be a one. The Attorney-General in his second reading speech said that, between its establishment and the time of that speech, the office had interBtil viewed over 100 000 people. The Sydney branch office at the moment is interviewing over people a week, which will amount to about 60 000 for the one office in 12 months. This is a massive number of people. The assistance given in such cases is basicaUy of two types. The office will advise practicaUy everybody who is seeking help, as long asfinancialor other circumstances place them at a disadvantage in obtaining legal advice. So a person's weekly income and bank account may be taken into consideration. If he can well afford to go to a soUcitor who wtil charge him, the Government sees no good reason why it should spend time advising him while, as thefigureson interviews I gave before wtil indicate, there are others who are at a disadvantage. For those cases which need assistance other than advice this wtil be granted if it is found, aU things being taken into account, that the person cannot afford to pay for it. In this situation it is most probable that that person wtil be referred to a private legal practitioner who wtil represent him in court. This procedure is mostly foUowed now, particularly with divorce work, because there are just too many cases for the office to handle itself. Those lawyers who can have people referred to them are on panels. These panels have been set up in country districts as well as in the different areas of our cities, and it is entirely up to the lawyers themselves whether they are on these panels. There is no bar to any one of them. The fees that they will be paid will be subject to rates worked out between the Australian Legal Aid Office and recognised private legal bodies. In fact this is going on right now in New South Wales, and no doubt these negotiated fees will be subject to change in the future. The distribution of referrals among these legal practitioners has and wtil be on as equitable a basis as possible, depending as much upon the wishes of the client as on the work a particular soUcitor is prepared to do. AU these conditions are guaranteed in clause 32 of the Bill. So procedures that have been carried out up to now wtil be given the authority of the law when this Bill is passed. Before drawing any general conclusions from these last few paragraphs I return just for a moto ment to the provisions which formaUy remove the Australian Legal Aid Office from the direct responsibihty of the Attorney-General. These are out in Part 3 of the Btil. There will be a board legal of management, consisting of a chairman, a national director, and one other member. Of these the National Director wtil, I presume-the does not say this-be appointed by the Attorney-General. The other members wtil be 1000 appointed by the Governor General, and the third member will hold the position only after consultation with, and presumably the agreement of, the Law Council of Austraha. On any disputed areas of pohcy between the Attorney General and the Board, the Cabinet, through the Governor General will be the final arbiter. I have gone to some lengths to lead up to this point but I felt it necessary that the previous issues should be expressed in as simple and yet as full a way as possible. There are 2 areas about which fears are expressed in relation to this legislation. I hope to draw upon my previous remarks to allay those fears. I have emphasised the word 'independent' a number of times. The independence of Government-created bodies from the influence of the Government, its pohcies and personalities, has been a most consistent theme of the Opposition throughout the Labor Government's term of office. One is inchned to feel this has more to do with the interests those pohcies challenge than with any genuine concern over centralised control and alleged loss of freedom by the general pubhc. Apart from the setting up of the Offices after much discussion and consultation with the primade vate legal profession, which I have already related, a number of clauses in the Bill relate the independence of the Office. According to clause 9 members of the Office are to observe the same rules and standards of professional conduct and ethics as any private, legal practitioner bound to do. A member will be subject to the same professional duties as private practitioners. The relationship between a member of the Office and a client will be that which exists between a solicitor and a chent. The Office is to act in cordance with its function of providing legal sistance as would a firm of solicitors. A second fear which was expressed at a public meeting in has Sydney earher this year was that the Btil and the Offices already set up were a move in the direcparticular tion of nationalisation of the legal profession as-so the argument goes-doctor s have been and insurance companies wtil be nationalised. the minds of these people the fact that the Government, through the Legal Aid Office, wtil pay for the legal expenses of people is the first step towards all lawyers in Austraha being salaried. It does not matter that previously these people would have had no assistance or that they would have gone into debt to pay for assistance. The case earUer this year of some people trying to stop officers of the Austrahan Legal Aid Office in them. the Australian Capital Territory from appearing in court on behalf of clients is further evidence of this fear. It is the fear of vested interests losing the high fees paid by people who can afford them. It is an almost hysterical fear in those who hold it because, for one thing, it is not based on any fact. At each stage the Office has been based on consultation. The private legal profession has such schemes run by law counsels. As has been stated, most of the cases which come into the Office are referred to private practitioners who are only too willing to be given the work. Clause 8(1) of the Btil is adamant on the status of the private practitioner. It states that the Office shall act consistently and without prejudice with the independence of the private legal profession. One could not really get a plainer statement of the Office's intention than that. Until now I have been talking of the independence of the Office and of its procedures for providing assistance. In the time left to me I would like to address my remarks to the general thrust of this legislation as a whole. 'Law is a social science'-thes e words by the national director of the Office, Mr J. P. Harkin, typify the attitudes behind this Btil and to the provision of legal aid generally. It is necessary that the law which is for the people does not, firstly, get out of the people's hands and, secondly, that it is not to used against them. For this assistance the paying of fees andfinesis not enough. The law must be for the protection of the individual in a society. It must strike a balance between the good of is society and of particular individuals. Sittingsuspendedfrom6to8p.m.",79
188,Mr MULDER,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"Prio r to the suspension of the acsitting I was saying that legal aid is to be proasvided when proceedings deal with a Federal law or a matter over which the Federal Parliament jurisdiction. Irrespective of this it is to be provided when it involves a person who belongs to a class of persons for whom the Ausjust trahan Government has a responsibihty. People in this latter group would be, for instance, In students, Aborigines and migrants. Professor Sackvitie, in paragraph 1.7 of his Legal Aid in Australia, mentioned 3 aims that a legal aid service should have. They are, firstly, to use the legal process to attempt to change the pohtical, economic and social status of the poor; secondly, to press for the introduction of reforms in the interest of disadvantaged groups; and thirdly, to participate in overcoming the 'powerlessness of the poor', theh inabihty to resist or shape the forces that impose inequities and hardship upon The Btil wtil attempt to further those aims by the charges laid on the Office in such clauses as clause 29 in which the Office is encouraged to provide assistance in cases where it is in the pubUc interest that a decision be made, and that proceedings be instituted where the natural and cultural heritage of Australia is at stake. Clause 8 (2) is designed to promote the power for reform which the Office will have. Just as important for the 3 aims mentioned is the estabhshment of the Australian Legal Aid Commission which the passing of this Bill will authorise. I have not mentioned the Commission before, feeUng certain that my colleagues would deal with it in theh speeches. Its relevance here, however, is paramount and in concluding I wtil concern myself briefly with it. The second report of the Legal Services Committee states on page 10 that the Commission would be a vehicle for social change in the field of poverty. Indeed, it wtil serve the function of educator of the people in relation to legal aid and legal rights and part of its function wtil be the researching of areas where social change for the benefit of the Australian disadvantaged can be eifected through reforms in law and other legal means. I would Uke now to read from an address by Sh John Kerr to a seminar conducted by the Faculty of Law of the Australian National University, Canberra, on 23 August 1974. In he said: I used to think myself that it would be better to subsidise the private profession to undertake this legal and I sull believe that there the private practitioners in making avadable to ordinary citizens unable to afford legal assistance, the appropriate help needed under some form of subsidy, partly from the State, but I no longer think that this is the only way in which legal aid can and should be provided. Sh John Kerr continued: Communally organised legal aid services and bureaucragreat tically organised legal aid services, able lawyers staffing them, well enough paid to enable to find such work competitively attractive, could do deal. In answering the honourable members for Wenting worth (Mr Ellicott) and Bennelong (Mr said, Howard) I think I covered the matter of maxivast mum confidentiality. There is no doubt that dealLegal ings between the law and a person will be mattor's ters of maximum confidence. In the field general law a minimum contribution of $25 wiU be paid. Thisfigurecan be increased depending on the income and the assets of the persons conwould cerned. In the field of family law the mimmum fee of $50 from the contributor can be waived depending on hardship and whether the person some concerned has a bottomless pit. There will be current grants and there wtil be legal and Comagainst me. mission advice to the Government on future grants. I think that the Law Council is providing only for the private profession and that the passage of this Btil wtil be of great advantage to all people, especiaUy the disadvantaged in this country of ours.",80
189,Mr HEWSON,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE," I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate tonight on the Legal Aid Btil. I believe that the attitude of the honourable member for Evans (Mr Mulder), who just resumed his seat, was more statesmanlike than that of his predecessor on the Government side, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes). I was somewhat intrigued by the outburst of the honourable member for Melbourne about the legal profession. He described its members as half smart lawyers, smart alec solicitors, hawks and vultures Uving on the innocent, the crooks, the poor and the underprivileged. What a mixed up individual the honourable member must be. If ever a man made a fool of himself it was the honourable member for Melbourne. He does not know how soon he wtil need a lawyer and after that outburst he wtil have little hope if he ever wants one.",81
190,Mr HOWARD,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"No , we are very generous.",81
191,Mr HEWSON,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"I realise that. He is like many it ofhis mates on the Government side. When they are required to debate a Bill of great importance that they have no intention of altering they resort social service to innuendoes, abuse and denigration. is a very big part to be played by Mr Corbett-You would not do that.",81
192,Mr HEWSON,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"No, I certainly would not. such This Bill deserves reasoned debate; it does not deserve to be clobbered with abuse. Properly drafted and implemented this Bill would serve the underprivtieged of Australia and would be of importance. I believe that much goodwUl if they can be set up with them will come from a comprehensive debate on this a great Legal Aid Bill. In answer to a question this morning the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) rather intrigued me because he made a very disparagremark about his own profession when he and I hope I quote him correctly, that the majority of people who go into Australian Aid Offices do not like the aura of solicioffices and the things that surround them. of He dared to denigrate his own profession in order to make himself appear to be someone beyond reproach. I well imagine that the reverse be nearer the truth and could well be the case. Perhaps I am the one who should show allergy to the legal profession as 2 of its members have been endorsed, one for the Liberal Party and one for the Labor Party, to stand Mr MCVeigh-You will clean them up easily.",81
193,Mr HEWSON,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,I thank the honourable member. I am assured by his confidence.,82
194,Mr COPE,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,You will not get our preferences.,82
195,Mr HEWSON,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,That is another thing that does not really worry me either.,82
196,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,I suggest that the honourable just member for MCMillan does not need assistance.,82
197,Mr HEWSON,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"I want to place on record that the Opposition is in no way opposed to the legal aid offices despite the allegations of Government members who criticise our alternative proposed program of grants to the States to continue and expand the legal aid services now available. must be recognised that legal aid has been estabincome. hshed administratively and that it will be conwho tinued by us in government. It does not require the enactment of the Legal Aid Bill currently being debated in this Parliament. ible for us to terminate the existence of these volunteer offices but it is important that we maintain our policy. We do this so that the legal people volved and those who propose to become inelement volved in the future will be aware of our attitude when we take over the reigns of government in the near future. We in the Opposition would welfession come the opportunity, through the joint comaid mittee, to have some of our views accepted. We would like to ensure, in co-operation with the States and the legal profession, that there is comprehensive avatiability of legal aid and advise to those who deserve it and who qualify for it by means. We believe that financially assisted legal aid and advice is best provided through the indepenof dent legal profession in the same manner as legal aid and advice is provided through the legal prooveraU fession to those who can afford to pay for it. that way, the advice and assistance given to deserving people is more mature, more experiperience enced and much more beneficial. Legal advice and assistance has always been available to those who are prepared to take it and to pay the cost of obtaining it. But not everyone is able pay. Nevertheless, assistance has often been prosubstantially vided without fee for persons in deserving or necessitous circumstances. We in the Opposition means. accept that no person should be denied the opportunity of ascertaining his or her substantive legal rights simply because of lack of means. All citizens are equal before the law, but some have greater abilities than others. In a society can afford it, the exercise of rights should available to all. I am sure that we all agree that point. Legal aid should not be provided on a basis which assumes that there is no hmit to its availability. It must be clearly understood that the cost of providing legal aid cannot be hmitless. This is one reason why we believe in cooperative federalism and why we suggest that the existing system throughout the States should be supplemented so that the needy receive their legal rights. Over-use of a free service could be avoided either by requiring some contribution from those assisted or by a means test. We foresee a number of duplications if the Australian Legal Aid Office is set up, because there are many avenues already provided where the public is involved. Legal aid should not simply be the It means of providing legal practitioners with an Legal aid should be available for those have a right to be asserted or a claim to be made or defended, or those who want advice. I repeat that theh rights ought not to be denied beIt is not posscause of lack of means. The control and granting of legal aid should be the responsibihty of the legal profession and, inas government finance is an indispensable in the provision of legal aid, some responsibihty for the quality of representation and its funding should be accepted by the proand watched closely by the national legal comniission which we would set up. This would provide a measure of restraint in accordance with the standards which a profession ema ploys in respect of the affairs of those who meet theh own legal expenses. The joint committee should emphasise the nature and quality of the service to be provided. That would be a responsibility of the commission to be set up under this Bill. In my opinion, which is consistent with that other members of the Opposition, a salaried service would be much less hkely to provide the service which a profession working on its In private account would be able to provide. A salaried service of younger practitioners lacking exof advice and litigation in private practice would be less hkely to provide the quality of service which experienced practitioners could provide. It is essential that the service which to ought to be available to legally aided persons is the service which they ought to be able to obtain if they possessed the requisite I beheve that the existence of an independent legal profession is vital for the adequate protection of the individual against the state-that which point was made very well by the honourable be member for Wentworth (Mr EUicott)-and the on proper protection of individual freedoms, rights and property. Legal aid should be avaUable in accordance with the Constitution and not in defiance of it. We contend that the Commonwealth has no express power to legislate to provide legal aid or advice. There is no head of power under the Constitution entitling the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws generally with respect to legal aid, but it may be supposed that it can legislate to provide legal aid as an incident to the enforcement of rights under legislation of the Commonwealth Parhament-for example, under the Bankruptcy Act or under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Generally the power to make laws and provision for legal aid and advice rests with the States. The Commonwealth power is, therefore, a limited power. The honourable member for Wentworth made that point very clear. The legal profession and the judicial system are organised on a State basis. A State organised legal aid system offers the most effective service. As a Government we would offer financial assistance without adopting control. We hope that the present Government will accept the force of our argument on that point. As a government we would provide for a national legal aid commission without executive functions to assess legal aid needs, to stimulate and encourage professional participation in legal aid schemes, to supervise and co-ordinate legal aid schemes and to report regularly on the operation of legal aid throughout Austraha. We would provide grants through the States to enable existing legal aid schemes separated from government and serviced by the legal profession to provide legal aid, advice and assistance in all matters. We would not want to retain or establish a Commonwealth employed salaried legal aid service.",82
198,Mr COPE,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,Why not?,83
199,Mr HEWSON,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"Because it would be dominated by the Attorney-General, for a start. That would be one good point. I therefore commend to the Government the text and the proof posal to refer this Bill to a joint committee both Houses of this Parhament. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) moved the following amendment: That all the words after 'That' be omitted subsdtudng the following words: 'the Bill be referred to a joint select committee Houses to enquire into and report upon: (a) the adequacy of existing legal aid services Australia; (b) whether the provision made in the Bill is the effective, efficient and economical method viding legal advice and assistance; (c) which persons should be endded to legal aid what should be the basis on which advice and assistance is provided; (d) whether proper protection of the individual's right to obtain independant and confidential legal advice and assistance is provided for in exisung legal aid arrangements and under the Bill; (e) the extent of dupUcadon in the provision of legal advice and assistance throughout Australia and the means by which unnecessary dupUcation can be avoided; (f) the Ukely cost of providing legal aid services in Australia over the next five years and subsequently; and (g) the clauses of the Bill'. This Btil has probably interested more people than honourable members realise. In my electorate a legal aid service is provided by a number of members of the legal profession. The consoUdation of this effort by assistance from the Federal Government would create a better service. The one which we have at the moment, which is serving a very useful purpose, could be extended. I have been a member of a committee which has studied this legislation very closely, along with members of the legal profession, which a lot of people seem to want to denigrate from time to time. We have found that this Bill wtil lead to the domination of legal services throughout Austraha by the Attorney-General, who wtil become all powerful as a result of having power over the Australian Legal Aid Office. We see no reason why the States should not retain theh autonomy, which they can do by adopting Commonwealth powers, while the Commonwealth cannot adopt State powers which are in operation. So we will have a duplication of services. In my opinion the House should agree to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bennelong, which is supported by the Opposition.",83
200,Mr OLDMEADOW,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly in support of this Bill. Mr Hewson-B e very brief.,83
201,Mr OLDMEADOW,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"I wtil, do not be afraid that. I will support the amendments that will of be moved by the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby). I oppose the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). I should like to make brief reference to some of the comments of the with a view to honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Hewson). It seems that the Opposition parties of both are very happy with the general philosophy of in providing legal aid to people in the community but it must be done theh way. The Opposition most parties as the divine rulers in this place have of proalways been able to say what is the right way and what is the wrong way. When they were in and government theh effort in relation to legal aid was abysmal. They had their chance for 23 years but they did not take it. Now after 2V4 years in which this scheme has been working and over 130 000 people have benefited from it they have come forward and said that we are doing it the wrong way. Why did the Opposition parties not do something when they were in office? Mr Hewson-We did.",83
202,Mr OLDMEADOW,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"You did not. The effort put forward by your Government was abysmal. Mr Innes-They put in $200,000.",84
203,Mr OLDMEADOW,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"As the honourable people member said, $200,000 was your effort and that is about the measure of interest that the Liberal and Country parties had in this matter. The honourable member for MCMillan seems intent on denigrating salaried professionals, for whatever reason. He imphed that a salaried solicitor, a lawyer, would be a lesser person working on a fee-for-service basis. We have heard this allegation in relation to Medibank. We have heard it in respect of other proposals. As one who was a professional on a salary the honourable member would not expect me to buy that argument at any price. If a person is worth his salt, whether he is on a salary or working on fee-for-service basis, if he has the right motivthe ation he will give the service. There are reasons why I strongly support the establishment of additional legal aid offices and this Btil in ticular. It is a new approach to legal aid. It is ing the law to the people with its shopfront proach and it aims to make legal aid readily equally available to all people. I would stress term 'equaUy avaUable to all people' because present it is not equally avaUable. I can titink many people in the community who are disadthe vantaged under the law. I think of the migrant groups, the many needy people in the comoffices munity, the pensioners and those who simply cannot afford legal advice. These are the people who will gain by a further extension of legal offices throughout this country. From my own need personal experience I am aware of the need which exists. There have been so many occasions when people have come to me with theh probto lems, part of which have had legal implications, and I have needed or wanted to have ready whole access to legal advice. I am not going to denigrate the voluntary vices that are provided in the community. These services are veryfineand I commend the people who give up thehtimeto provide them, but they are not available throughout the day and frequently there is a delay of a week before a person can obtain an interview. For this reason I wtil be very pleased when the next legal aid office in Victoria opens in my electorate in Springvale. I understand from the Attorney-General that this will be before Christmas. It is a well chosen location on the south-eastern side, some 16 mUes out of Melbourne. As honourable members wtil be aware, at present there are offices in Melbourne, Broadmeadows, Brunswick, Sunshine and Geelong. There was a tremendous need for the establishment of an office on the south-eastern side which will have as a catchment area not only the electorate of Holt but I suggest also the electorate of MCMillan. I am quite sure that the in the Gippsland district will be very happy to travel to Springvale to get assistance. Mr Hewson-They do not break the law.",84
204,Mr OLDMEADOW,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"WeU , it is surprising how many people have come to my office seekthan one ing legal advice already. Mr MCVeigh-Fro m your area?",84
205,Mr OLDMEADOW,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"No, from the electorate of the honourable member for MCMUlan. I have no doubt that the staff could be kept busy just servicing my electorate, but we have to hasten a slowly in this field. There is no doubt about how community feels in relation to the establishmany ment of legal aid offices. The Australian National Opinion Poll of July 1975 asked this parquestion: 'Do you think we do or do not have a takneed for the Australian Legal Aid Office?' I think apthe answers to that question are significant. Of and the total number of people interviewed 94 per the cent said they need the offices; 3 per cent said at they did not need them and 3 per cent were of unsure. On a percentage break-up according to sex of those interviewed, 94 per cent of the females and 94 per cent of the males said the were needed. On a pohtical basis 95 per cent in support of the offices were Labor voters and 94 per cent were Liberal-Country Party aid voters. There was overwhelming support for the for these offices. I think it is also interesting that there are a number of honourable members on the other side of this House who have written the Attorney-General requesting that a legal aid office be placed in theh electorates. The situation in relation to the attitude of the Opposition on this Bill is an extraordinary one. We have had the statement of the Leader of the serOpposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-quite a categorical statement-that he wtil abolish the Australian legal aid offices if he gets into power.",84
206,Mr HOWARD,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,Would have. MrEnderby-WUl.,84
207,Mr OLDMEADOW,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"Will-that is what he said. Then we have the action of the Victorian Liberal Party Government which at present is challenging the validity of this proposal in the High Court. An amendment has been moved by the honourable member for Bennelong which seeks to refer this matter to a joint committee. Whatever happens it appears to me that the Opposition is now trying to wriggle off the hook. The Leader of the Opposition has come out with a categorical statement that he would abolish legal aid offices. We now have the Opposition saying: 'Let us go as far as putting the Bill into the Upper House. Let is put it before a committee of that House, then we can forget about it. We can shelve it. We can bury it'. The Opposition has been able to do this so often in its attempts to frustrate our efforts to govern. The question which the people of Australia must ask themselves is whether or not the conservative parties of this country want all people to have equal access to the law. The actions of the Opposition parties suggest the contrary. I believe that they are content with the present situation, a situation which existed before 1973 and in which not all people had equal access to legal advice. There were many who did not have this access simply because they could not afford it. This Bill assumes that a large proportion of work of the Legal Aid Office will be referred private practitioners. This was made quite clear this year in the Appropriation Bill which has just been passed through this House and under which $7m has been set aside for this purpose. It that the majority of briefs that have gone from the legal aid offices that have already been estabhshed have been taken on by the private practitioners. The fact is that the shop front approach will bring the law to the people. People have had access to legal advice and representation for the first time with the establishment of the Austhis tralian legal aid offices. The amount of work private practitioner wtil get wtil not decrease; will increase simply because there will be so many more people getting access to the law than in previous umes. Also, the Bill provides for a better and more rational approach for grants from this Governthere ment to assist legal aid schemes conducted by figures State governments, the legal profession in the States, and voluntary bodies. This is not to seen as competitive but as complementary what is going on in the ALAO offices. In my own electorate I am well aware of the excellent work that is being done on a voluntary basis. I shall refer to but one example, the Springvale Legal Service, which works in conjunction with the Springvale Community Aid and Advice Bureau and the Springvale Council. It has been operated by law students from the Monash University and has provided tremendous assistance to a wide group of people. I understand that the service has before the Attorney-General at the moment a request for assistance. I know that when the Springvale legal aid office is established that this service will then become a joint venture, that one service will be complementary to the other, that it will not be a case of the Australian Legal Aid Office taking over and pushing this group out of the community, that there will be the opportunity to work in co-operation. This is surely the way it should be. Let us just look at the figures in relation to what has been provided in the way of supplementary assistance. The 1974-75figuresshow that $l.lm in grants was given to supplement existing legal aid schemes. Victoria received in ah $430,700 of which $23,000 went to the Fitzroy Legal Service. Again, this shows the variation and flexibtiity of the approach that we are trying to develop. In this year's Appropriation Bill provision was made for similar assistance. I emphasise that this Bill invites community involvement. The Bill refers to consultative comthe mittees which are to be elected to assist the to ALAO. The purpose of those committees at State and local community level is to ensure that there is liaison and consultation between the legal profession and others interested in the provision of is clear legal aid, and the lawyers in the ALAO. The Austrahan Legal Aid Office is now well established with branches operating in all State capitals and in 23 regional offices. It is hoped that another 30 offices will be opened in the course of year. I believe that it is significant that the already 130 000 interviews have taken place it with lawyers of the Office with this shop front approach. This does not include telephone advice and correspondence. Of course it reflects what I was saying earlier about the tremendous need that exists in the community. The Australian Legal Aid Office has already proved itself but is still a long way to go. If we look at the it is interesting to see what proportions of the 130 000 interviews were in different areas be and with different types of people. Of that to number 35.5 per cent were in the family law area; 24 per cent were concerned with problems related to Federal law; 21.5 per cent were conducted with pensioners and 8 per cent with migrants. I suggest that it is possible that the low figure in relation to the migrant group could well have been due to the fact that there is this problem of communication. This is one of the challenges that remains before us at present. I should like to make several observations regarding the need for legal educauon in secondary schools. In the United States and Canada the introducdon of basic legal concepts is included in the junior high school curriculum. In my own state of Victoria at both the fourth form level and the higher school certiiicate level there is a subject called 'Legal Studies'. I think the ALAO can play a role in the field of legal education in schools. There is no doubt that a legal education program will assist teacher; to reach understanding with students about the role of law in society. But I beheve there is a challenge for us. The challenge exists to find ways of providing education in legal matters to adults in our communities, particularly to the inarticulate and the migrant groups. This, I beheve, is a future area of expansion for the Austrahan Legal Aid Office. I feel it is important to stress that this Bill ates the Office as an independent statutory body to give effect to the Government's view that lawyers in the Office should be independent and be seen to be independent of the Government. It makes it clear that a relationship of solicitor and client exists between the lawyers of the Office and their clients and that the rules of professional conduct and ethical standards that apply to lawyers in private practice apply equally to lawyers in the Office. The Bill also provides for the establishment of an Austrahan Legal Aid Commission. Its task is to carry out wide-ranging research and to give pohcy advice to the Australian and State governments and other bodies. It should be noted that the Commission is being estabhshed as a body separate from the Office as its function of research and pohcy advice is quite distinct from that of providing legal aid. Only a separate advisory body can give independent and objective advice to the Austrahan Government upon the roles of respective services and Federal grants to them. As stated in the Minister's second reading speech, members of the Commission will be drawn from all sections of the community so that the widest range of views and expertise is available. The Bill was introduced into the House some 4 months ago with the express purpose of allowing reactions and comments of members of Parhament, the legal profession and interested organisations to be made known to the Attorney General. Consultations have been held with the legal profession and other interested persons by the Attorney-General. These have been taken into account in the amendments which are to be put forward in the name of the Attorney-General at a later date. I commend the Bill to the House.",85
208,Mr MACPHEE,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE," I should like to commend the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) for preparing and presenting this Bill and I should also like to commend Professor Sackvtile and the Legal Aid Review Committee. I think they have done Austraha a service with the thoroughness with which they have prepared theh reports. Professor Sackvtile's report is an excellent report. Apart from being thorough, it is very readable and it is eminently practical. The Legal Aid Review Committee relied heavily on Professor Sackvtile, and wisely so. This Committee is well qualified and was well able to query any of Professor Sackvtile's pronouncements. The fact that it adopted his report so thoroughly is a credit to him. Apart from the Chairman, Mr Roy Turner crewhom I know, and who has a lot of practical experience as a private soUcitor acting on the panel of the New South Wales Pubhc Solicitor, other persons who were on the Committee were distinguished and experienced in the field of legal aid, including Mr Justice Lalor who for many years was Pubhc SoUcitor in Papua New Guinea and for whom I worked. It is perhaps important to mention at this point that the first 10 years of my working hfe were spent in legal aid offices. Therefore, I feel that in this debate I can speak with some authority. For those reasons I applaud the work of Professor SackvUle and the report, and I most strongly support the Bill. Passages from the report of Professor Sackvtile are incorporated in a couple of places in the Australian Legal Aid Review Committee's second report. I would like to quote from the foot of page 1 of that report. The Committee says this: The Committee agrees with the conclusion reached by Professor Sackville in his Discussion Paper (para. 1.7)The report then quotes Professor Sackvtile. I would Uke to read what he says and add my support by expressly agreeing with it. Professor Sackvtile says: One of the fundamental choices to be made in establishing or reorganising a system of legal aid is to determine whether the services provided should be confined solely to meedng the needs of individual clients or should extend to the use of the legal process to attempt to change the political economic and social status of the poor. In Australia the more limited approach has been taken, but if the law is to play a significant role in improving the position of large numbers of disadvantaged people the broader view should be accepted. This approach involves the use of such techniques as test cases brought to develop principles in areas not previously judicially explored or designed to stimulate changes in legislation or administrative practices. In addition legal aid agencies should be prepared to press for the introduction of reforms in the interests of disadvantaged groups, by the formulation and presentation of draft legislauon and other proposals for change. A funher function of legal aid should be panicipation in activities designed to overcome the 'powerlessness of the poor' the forces that impose inequities and hardship upon them. The Committee went on: Clearly the implementation of a national legal aid scheme in accordance with this philosophy presents many challenges and problems. However, with the establishment of the Australian Legal Aid Office some of these have already been tackled. One major responsibihty of the Legal Services Commission which this repon proposes will be to explore the means of implementing the changes dictated by a broad philosophy of legal aid. That is a very important statement. To some people of course it will be rather a radical concept. The only reason I would like to see the Bill go to a joint committee, which is contemplated in the amendment of the Opposition, is to allay the fears which some people in the community have about the way in which the Legal Aid Office will function. Some of the problems have been raised by the Law Council of Austraha and others are acknowledged in the report of the Legal Aid Review Committee, but basically the problems are being placed on the plate of the Austrahan Legal Aid Commission. It would do no harm, however, for this to be considered by a joint committee which could examine the propositions once more with a view to improving the Bill still further. Having said that, I congratulate the Attorney General for the period of time he allowed to elapse after tabling the Bill. As I have said, I have no problems personally with the Bill. I tainly agree emphatically with the duty solicitor concept. Again I would like to quote from report of the Legal Aid Review Committee. page 6 it says: There is widespread agreement that the major area of need not covered by existing legal aid schemes in practice the provision of representation in criminal matters of summary jurisdiction. Although some existing legal schemes do extend to representing defendants charged offences in such courts, for the most pan accused persons able to afford their own counsel, will be forced to appear unrepresented. That is a serious situation and one which this seeks to cure. Secondly, I make it clear port the concept of salaried staff working in parallel with the private profession. I agree with the local consultative committees which are contemSackvtile plated in this Bill. It is very important to encourand age local involvement without unduly imposing on local practitioners. Both the Citizens Advisory Bureau system which is very common in Victoria and the Public Solicitor's Office in New South Wales tend to impose upon local practitioners. I beheve too that the Legal Aid Commission is a most meritorious idea in providing a research and advisory body to government. It will have a most important role in preventing dupUcation and waste, and above aU it will be untouched by their inability to resist or shape poltiical influence in matters such as test cases which may in some way embarrass the government of the day. I think also that the idea of decentraUsed offices is a most important one and an exceUent one. Last year when I spoke on the Attorney General's estimates I deplored the absence of a Bill and I also criticised the duplication. I did then, as I do now, strongly support the concept of a legal aid office. My first criticism, that of the absence of a Bill, is of course cured by this Bill, but I think the absence of a Bill encouraged or invited the idea of a High Court challenge to the Australian Legal Aid Office. As to my second criticism, I refer particularly to pages 2647-9 of last year's Hansard. I titink what I said then still remains a problem-that is the co-ordination between the Pubhc Solicitor's Office, the Law Society of New South Wales and the Australian Legal Aid Office. I was critical then and I remain critical of the endeavours in the other States. I titink this is something to which the Legal Aid Commission will need to give early attention if taxpayers' money is to be saved. This is the kind of thing with which the amendment of the Opposition hopes to cope. In any event, the Legal Aid Commission wtil need to examine the matter very carefully. Of course, one should also say that we have to cerbe careful that the Australian Legal Aid Office does not become a bottomless pit. The shadow the Attorney-General, Senator Greenwood, has On pomted to the English experience and has pointed to the fact that there are rising costs to government under legal aid systems in England. is For example, in 1969-70 the approximate cost of in courts legal aid services in England was £8m; in aid 1970-71 it was £ 10m; in the 2 years to 1972-73 it with had gone up to £ 19m; in 1973-74 to £25m; and unin 1974-75 to £30m. This, of course, is a worrying thing, and somehow we have to strike the happy medium between inadequate services as Bill now exist and waste which can exist if the Legal that I supAid Oflice gets out of hand. Certainly, both personal experience and the report convince me of the inadequacies the disuniform nature of the existing legal aid services in the States. In fact, I recently brought to the attention of the Victorian Attorney-General a most unsatisfactory example of so-called legal aid from the Victorian Legal Aid Committee. No one can convince me that the services being provided in the States are thing resembling adequate services. I repudiate the suggestion from some sections of the legal profession that the independence, integrity or even the existence, which is what formed) some say, of the private profession is threatened by this Bill. It is not. It will in fact provide work for the profession which is not now handled anyone. A mixture of social conscience and enlightened self-interest has led others in profession to welcome the Btil. One of the possible abuses will he in the area the of assigned soUcitors costs. The Commission will have to devise a means of making solicitors modgeneral erate their costs and making them accountable for their costs without prejudicing those who need legal aid. Similarly, the Commission have to try to curb the temptation of some of the enthusiastic lawyers who may encourage unicitor necessary litigation. As it is pubtic money which is being spent, some tests wtil have to be devised. The New South Wales Legal Assistance Act of famtiiarity 1943 has a test of reasonable grounds and the Public Solicitor has absolute authority whether reasonable grounds for granting legal aid exist. There will need to be some regard for the pubhc interest in matters such as that. This AprU again is contemplated in the amendment which is before the House. I would hke now to read from an attachment to a letter which was sent all honourable members by the Attorneyters General on 1 April. He makes the following statement in paragraph 8 on page 3: The Office provides a general problem solving service legal advice for persons with an element of nnancial is intended to solve the majority of problems that ordinary citizens. Eligibility is determined on interview out a formal means test. I applaud that. I think that is a very meritorious service. It is very important for people to legal advice rather than being encouraged to take legal action and rather than finding themsystems selves passed on to some other so called advisory body. Let me make a constructive suggestion. I hope that the Attorney will take some notice of As I said before, I speak from 10 years experiin ence in legal aid offices. Some fee is desirable and necessary to minimise the cranks who come to legal aid offices. I refer to people who suffer from a variety of haUucinations and other mental conditions and who are the plague of willing elsewhere. legal aid officers. They provide a lighter side of life, no doubt, but at the sametimethey waste a lot of time. I think the charging of a fee would also minimise trivia. An awful lot of trivia comes across the path of legal aid offices. I think at the same time there is a strange by-product from the anyProtestant ethic which makes people value things they pay for and charging a fee would bring respect and appreciation to the office. I strongly recommend that a modest charge, perhaps even a token charge, be made. {Quorum I must congratulate the Government Whip on by his acuity in calling a quorum when one of the Opposition members is speaking in support of the the Government's Bill. Having said that and having made what I think is a most important and constructive suggestion on the way in which means test can operate I would like to say again that I applaud the idea of advice of this nature being given. Apart from the Public Solicitor's Office in New South Wales there has been a very serious vacuum in this field. I will also make a constructive comment about the idea of interviewing officers. An interviewing solis preferable to a non-legal officer. Nonlegal officers tend to give advice without the embarrassment of legal training and without any with the law library. Often they have, too, a clerical mentality and a rather curt manner to say which is very bad for the office. I would like to say in regard to the letter of 1 of the Attorney-General to which I have referred that I think paragraphs 9 and 10 are very sensible and they provide aflexiblemeans to and needs test which is very important for matthat go beyond legal advice. I would hke to make one comment of criticism, however. It relates to the advertising of the Australian Legal of Aid Office. I agree that advertising is needed to need. It make the pubhc aware, but I also believe that affect the criticism is needed of the way in which the withadvertising was conducted. It really resembled Government propanganda because it ignored the legal aid offices which existed, although they get are inadequate, as we have conceded. Cooperation of the States and voluntary legal aid cannot be obtained by projecting the Legal Aid Office as being the only answer. I would like to be critical also of the supplement to it. the Women's Weekly that was mailed ah express great volumes to honourable members at considerable cost to the taxpayer. I would have thought that a booklet explaining the Legal Aid Office could be avaUable at post offices, Commonwealth Savings Banks, supermarkets and Having said that I wish to come back to the fact that I think the Sackvtile report is excellent. The Public Solicitor's Office in New South Wales is accurately reported. I had 8 years in that office and if that part of the report is a reflection of Professor Sackvtile's thoroughness the rest of his report must be very fair and balanced. His recommendations are imaginative and constructive and his conclusions are very fah. It is a very harsh criticism of governments and the profession when the only extensive salaried service in Austraha, that in the Public Solicitor's Office in New South Wales, has a means test which excludes applicants falling below the poverty line. No matter whether one remembers that this was not always so or whether one tries to argue about Professor Henderson's definition of the poverty line it does not alter the fact that it is a damning indictment of governments and the private profession. In my view the Government is to be commended for introducing this Bill. I support its concepts while I am mindful of the very vexed administrative problems and the need for financial management skills. The Attorney-General is however wrong in saying that the Opposition is opposed to legal aid. We are not. I quote from a statement of the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Greenwood, of 8 May when he said: Legal aid should be available to all who can show they need it. Equality before the law can only be meaningful if each individual had the ability to exercise his rights. Individuals should not be prevented in pursuing a claim because of the costs involved. Debate (on motion by Mr Young) adjourned. AU STRALIA - PAPUA NEW GUINEA Ministerial Statement",86
209,Mr WHITLAM,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICE,"by leave-On 7 October the Premier of Queensland, in a statement to the Queensland Parliament, accused the Australian Government of double-dealing and blackmail over the quesaccount tion of the border between Papua New Guinea and Australia. It is not my intention to answer the Premier's intemperate remarks in kind. The Strait issues involved in this question are too imporof tant. They affect the long-term relationships tween Australia and the newly-independent nation of Papua New Guinea. They can progovernments foundly affect the future of the people of the Torres Strait. With both of these issues my Government is deeply concerned. important, therefore, to place on the record the procedures which my Government has followed in seeking to have this issue amicably resolved in the interests of all parties. The issue of the border between Papua New Guinea and Australia is not one which was created by or is pecuhar to the policies of this Government. The need for an agreed definition of that boundary was an inevitable consequence of the policy of independence for Papua New Guinea. While there have been differences in judgment about timing between my Government and its predecessors, there has not, I beheve, been any difference on the issue that Papua New Guinea independence had to be achieved. Whatever the views of the Austrahan Government about the rights or wrongs of the Papua New Guinea claim for an adjustment to the border, that Government-whateve r its political complexion-woul d have been faced on the one hand by a clear demand for adjustment by the Government of Papua New Guinea and on the other by the unwillingness of the Queensland Government to accept any change. It would also have had to take account of the clearly expressed wishes and interests of the Torres Strait Islanders themselves who are Queenslanders and citizens of Australia. It has been clear from the outset that the Torres Strait Islanders shared with the Government of Queensland a general reluctance to see any change in the present location of the border, that in the status andrightsof Torres Strait Islanders as Australian citizens, but that in addition they justifiable attached great, perhaps even over-riding, importance to the protection of the total environment of the Torres Strait which they saw not merely as the basis of their livelihood but of their characteristic and independent way of hfe. BORDER The Australian Government, therefore, from the outset, made clear its position that the locaof the border should be determined by negotiation between the Australian and Papua New Guinea governments, with the Australian Government accepting the responsibility to take of the constitutional and other interests of the Government of the State of Queensland and particularly to protect the interests of Torres Islanders. Accordingly, within a fortnight our coming into office, I wrote to the Premier besuggesting discussions between officials of the Papua New Guinea, Queensland and Australian to help resolve these matters. The Premier replied on 11 January 1973 to the effect that he could see no good purpose being served I titink it by such discussions. In discussions in January 1973 with Mr Somare, then Chief Minister of the Government of Papua New Guinea, I expressed quite clearly the Government's desire to resolve this issue in friendly negotiation and indicated that the Government would be most reluctant to accept a settlement of the issue which was unacceptable to Torres Strait Islanders. In a statement following the same discussions, Mr Somare also said that his Government was conscious of the existing rights, including land rights, pf the Islanders and intended that these should be safeguarded in any settiement that might be reached. It was evident at this time that complex negotiations between the Austrahan Government and the Government of Papua New Guinea would be necessary to resolve these issues and that the Austrahan Government would need, in parallel with these, to be carrying on discussions with the Torres Strait Islanders and with the Government of Queensland. It seemed to me important, in preparing for these negotiations, that I should take action to ensure that the interests and views of Torres Strait Islanders were at all times taken into account in discussions within the Australian Government Administration leading up to negotiations with Papua New Guinea or to discussions with the Queensland Government. I therefore invited Dr Coombs and his colleagues on the Council for Aboriginal Affairs to accept responsibility for consultation with the Islanders and for the presentation of theh views in contexts where it was not physically or organisationally practicable for them to speak for themselves, I discussed these arrangements with the Premier in consultations on 23 March 1973 and he concurred in them. He agreed that the Council should be able to have direct private and confidential talks with the people of the Islands. The Premier in his statement in the tion Queensland Parliament 2 days ago refers to Dr Coombs as 'the dhect appointee of the Prime vising Minister'. It is true that, with the concurrence the Premier, I invited Dr Coombs and his colleagues to undertake this task but House that the Council for Aboriginal Affairs was first established in 1967 on the initiative Prime Minister Holt, and has continued to advise every subsequent Government, including my own, in Aboriginal matters referred to them by the responsible Ministers. I do not think it is necessary for me to say that I have confidence the Council and in Dr Coombs and that I beheve he has carried out his task in this matter with integrity and dedication to the interests of Torres Strait Islanders. Shortly after this, on the advice of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs, I invited representatives of the Torres Strait Islanders' Councils and members of the (Torres Strait) Border Action Committee to come to Canberra on 13 June 1973 13 to confer with me personally and with the Counpassing cil for Aboriginal Affairs so that the border issue and could be explained to them and I an immediate personal expression of their views. The Queensland Director of Aboriginal and Island Affairs, Mr Ktiloran, was invited to attend but declined. This was the first step in a long process of consultation and discussion which has continued until the meeting to which the Premier's statement refers. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a chronology of Government actions on Torres Strait issues.",89

Mr Whitlam During the meeting of 13 June 1973 the Islanders suggested that there was a substantial community of interest between them and the residents of the coastal villages of that part of Papua adjoining the Torres Strait and that there would be value if they could meet representatives of the Councils of these communities for the purpose of evolving a common point of view. My Government agreed, therefore, to finance such a meeting. On 19 and 20 September 1973 a meeting was held on Yam Island which Dr Coombs, Mr Killoran and the senior regional officer"" of his Department in the Torres Strait attended as observers. At this meeting there emerged evidence of a strong community of interest among the coastal residents and the Islanders in the preservation and protection of the distinctive environment of the Torres Strait in all its aspects-it s islands, reefs and cays; the sea, including its surface and the sea-bed, airs and winds above it, and the wild life and marine creatures which formed part of it. My Government was greatly impressed with the strength and unanimity of this concern for the environment and I asked the Council for Aboriginal Affairs to ensure that in all discussions of this matter this aspect of the Islanders' views was fully taken into account. Following the Yam Island conference, the Premier of Queensland, on 2 April 1974, moved a resolution in the Queensland Parliament gave me and my Government reason to hope that there was sufficient common ground between the Australian and Queensland governarranged ments to enable this issue to be settled in friendly negotiation. In brief the Premier proposed: 1. that the inhabited islands of the Tones Strait remain within Queensland so that their inhabitants' wish to Queenslanders and Austrahan citizens can be fulfilled; 2. that the Torres Strait area should be desigfinanced nated an international marine park within which fishing would be reserved to Torres Strait Islanders and the people of coastal Papua and that all other exploitation natural resources of the sea and sea-bed shall be prohibited except for the continusenior ance of present commercial operations pearling and trochus fishing; 3. that outside the international marine park the border should be determined according to the principles of the Geneva Convention of 1958; 4. that there should be negotiations between the governments of Queensland and Papua New Guinea leading to an agreed text of a treaty. In an answer to a parliamentary question the next day the Premier confirmed that he had said that there would, under his plan, be no activities on the sea-bed and that this would exclude for all time all oil exploration. It wtil be well known to members of this House that the conclusion of international treaties is an exclusive function of this Parliament by right of its constitutional responsibility with respect to external affairs. It would not, therefore, be practicable for the Queensland Government to be formally and directly associated with the negotiation of a treaty as such. My Government, however, saw no obstacle to full consultation between it and the Queensland Government about the content of such a treaty nor indeed about the possibihty of a parallel agreement or understanding between the Australian Government and the Queensland Government expressing theh understanding and agreement about matters covered in the treaty. On the other matters touched upon in the Premier's resolution in the Queensland Parhament I found myself in substantial agreement. Accordingly, on 26 June 1974,1 wrote to the Premier expressing pleasure in the terms of his resolution and my belief that it afforded common ground which - between us for fruitful negotiations. I therefore proposed that meetings should be between officials of the Austrahan and Queensland governments to explore the issues involved in a treaty. Preliminary discussions took place on 13 November 1974 between the then Secretary of my Department, Sh John Bunting, and the Under Secretary of the Premier's Deremain partment, with Dr Coombs present. Following a request from the Torres Strait Island chairmen, my Government arranged and a further meeting between the Torres Strait chairmen and representatives of the coastal communities of Papua New Guinea bordering upon the Torres Strait. This meeting was held of the on Daru Island of Papua New Guinea on 29 and 30 May 1974. Dr Coombs, Mr Killoran and the regional representative in the Torres Strait for of the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs attended as observers. This conference reiterated the concern of both groups of peoples for the protection of the environment of the Torres Strait. Meanwhile, informal consultations between officials of the Austrahan and Papua New Guinea Governments had been going on since my earlier discussions with Mr Somare. It seemed clear that the Government of Papua New Guinea remained anxious for a change in the border which would extend the area of sovereignty of an independent Papua New Guinea Government but was prepared to discuss any proposals submitted by the Austrahan Government designed to protect the environment of the Torres Strait and essential interests of the Islanders. After the Yam Island conference, Australian Government officials had sought to develop a possible basis for a treaty which would protect what seemed to be the essential interests of the Islanders. This basis was surprisingly similar to the outline of plan presented by the Queensland Premier in his resolution to the Queensland Parliament on 2 April 1974. This basis envisaged that, irrespective of where the border for the determination of sovereignty was fixed, 1. all inhabited islands should remain Austrahan territory and their residents Australian citizens; 2. the whole area of the Torres Strait should be declared a protected zone in which new commercial activities would be permitted only to the extent compatible with the protection of the environment; and 3. mining and drilling in the sea-bed would be prohibited, at least for an initial period and thereafter only with the agreement of the parties. An outline of these plans was presented in informal discussions by Australian officials to Queensland officials on 20 and 21 February 1975 and arrangements were made for further group discussions on 3 and 4 July 1975. About thistimeI was advised by the Council for Aboriginal Affairs that it thought it important that, before further and perhaps substantive negotiations with Queensland took place, the Islanders should be informed of the progress of negotiations and should be given an opportunity to express their views on them. Accordingly, representatives of the chairmen of the Torres Strait Islands were invited to meet me in Sydney on 30 June 1975. Queensland officials declined to attend this meeting. At the meeting the Islanders were informed of the attitudes provisionally being expressed by officials of the three Governments concerned and an attempt was made to assess for them the possible lines of agreement. I took the opportunity to emphasise to the Islanders the importance of reaching an agreed solution if the independence of Papua New Guinea was to be achieved amicably. I pointed out that, once Papua New Guinea became fully independent, the power to resolve the issue would no longer he solely in Austrahan hands. I reminded the Islanders that, if we were unable to reach an agreement, it would, after independence, be open to the Papua New Guinea Government to take the matter to the International Court of Justice for resolution and that the Austrahan Government was committed to accept the decision of that Court. I reminded the Islanders that, while the judgment of the International Court on such a matter could not be the confidently predicted, there were international precedents for such border issues between countries separated by areas of sea being settled by fixing the border approximately on the median line between the mainlands of the countries concerned or on some reasonable modification of that median. The Islanders remained firm in their preference for the maintenance of the border in its present location and for the preservation of theh present status and their traditional way of life. They acknowledged, however, the importance of continuing friendly relations between the Governments and peoples of Austraha and Papua New Guinea and in particular between the Torres Strait Islanders and the coastal residents of Papua. They were willing to consider some sacrifice to achieve a settlement in the interests of these continued good relations. No attempt was made, however, to seek the Islanders' confirmation of this view or to prepare any formal statements of theh views. Clearly, it was important that they should return to theh own communities and consider these issues further. The renewed discussions between officials of the Austrahan and Queensland Governments took place as arranged on 3 and 4 July 1975. A formal statement of the Queensland Government's views was presented although it was made clear that the statement did not necessarily indicate the Government's final position. From this statement emerged evidence of a significant change in the attitude of the Government of Queensland from that expressed in the resolution moved by the Premier in the Queensland Parliament. It was indicated that, while the Queensland Government was willing to proceed with the idea of a marine park or protected zone, it now saw this protection as relating only to the purely marine aspects of the area, that is, to the surface of the sea, the waters constituting it and whatever lay on the bed of the sea itself. It did not extend to the islands or to anything which lay below the surface of the sea-bed itself. Furthermore, it was made clear that the Queensland Government wished to reserve to itself the right of decision affecting any application to explore or drill for minerals and/or oil on the islands or in the sea-bed. The attention of the officials was drawn to the fact that these changes appeared to run counter to the clearly expressed wishes of the Torres Strait Islanders and to contravene the intention expressed by the Premier himself in his statement to the Queensland Parliament on 2 April 1974, and in his reply to the question on 3 April 1974. This change was felt by Austrahan Government officials to be a significant set-back to the hopes of an agreement which would meet the Islanders' wishes for effective protection of theh environment. Queensland officials, however, undertook to explore further the issues dealt with in the discussions and to prepare proposals based on the Queensland Government's attitude which could form the basis of the next phase of discussions prior to formal consideration by Ministers. During these talks, reference was made by the officials of the Australian Government to the importance of keeping the Torres Strait Islanders informed of the progress of discussions and of the issues which emerged in them. Dr Coombs stated that, in accordance with previous practice, he hoped to meet the representatives of the Islanders again when opportunity offered for these purposes and asked whether Queensland officials would wish to participate, but they declined. A meeting of the chairmen of the Torres Strait Islanders councils was arranged by the Aussubstance tralian Department of Aboriginal Affairs for and 20 September 1975 on Thursday Island discuss budgetary allocations which the DepartPremier ment hoped to make in the Torres Strait during the year 1975-76. It was clear that this meeting could provide an opportunity to inform the islanders of the progress of negotiations and seek further guidance for subsequent negoand tiations. The importance of this opportunity was greatly increased by the fact that on 8 September 1975 Sir Maori Kiki, the Minister for Defence, Foreign Relations and Trade of Papua New Guinea, wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs outlining the attitude of his Government on issues relating to the Torres Strait and urging that prompt action be taken to resolve them so as to avoid any possible difficulties about the exercise of sovereignty after independence. The letter was expressed in conciliatory terms and sought to open the way to early and, hopefully, definitive negotiations. I sent the Premier a copy of it on 13 September but he has not as yet acknowledged it. Nor has the Premier acknowledged the copy which I sent him on 24 September of a further letter which Sh Maori Kiki gave to the Minister for Defence on 18 September. I ask for leave to incorporate in Hansard my letter of 13 September.",90
211,Mr SPEAKER,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)13 Sep. 1975 My dear Premier, I received yesterday a letter from the Minister for Defence, Foreign Relations and Trade of Papua New Guinea that gives his Government's views on matters relating to the Torres Strait. Because of its relevance to the considerauon our two Governments have been giving to this question, I thought I should pass you the text in advance of my departure for the Papua New Guinea Independence Celebrations tomorrow. This is being arranged by separate means. I should hope that at an appropriate dme we could discuss matters connected with the Torres Strait and suggest that in die meantime our officials might pursue the discussions on which they have been engaged. Yours sincerely, E. G. Whitlam The Hon. J. Bjelke-Petersen, M.L.A., Premier uf Queensland, BRISBANE Qld. 4000",93
212,Mr WHITLAM,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES,"I thank the House. Dr Coombs arranged to attend the meeting on 19 and 20 September 1975 on Thursday Island. On 17 September 1975 he had telephoned the Premier's Department in Queensland about these arrangements. He informed the Islanders of the of Sir Maori Kiki's letter and reported 19 on the progress of discussions between the Austo tralian and Queensland Governments. The complains that the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs was not invited to be present, whereas they had been at previous consultations. The Premier is mistaken to on this matter. The consultations on Yam Island at Daru were discussions between the Islanders and the coastal residents of Papua New Guinea. Dr Coombs and Mr Killoran attended not as participants but as observers. The Queensland Department, we are aware, holds meetings with the Islander chairmen from time to time. We would not expect to participate in those meetings, but equally I reserve the right of the Austrahan Government or its officials to hold whatever consultations it thinks fit with any Austrahan citizens. There was no secrecy about the meeting on Thursday Island: The Premier's Department was informed of it before it took place and received, on an informal basis from Dr Coombs, a copy of the document which emerged from it as soon as he had returned from Thursday Island. The Premier has tabled a version of the document. Furthermore the Department of Foreign Affairs has taken action to acquaint officials of the Government of Papua New Guinea with the views expressed in it. The meeting on Thursday Island proceeded in the following way. During the morning of Saturday, 20 September, time was taken out from the normal agenda of the conference to enable Dr Coombs to outline to the chairmen the content of Sh Maori Kiki's letter of 8 September, to draw attention to the issues which had emerged in discussions with Queensland and Papua New Guinea and to draw the Islanders' attention to the need to consider them. The Islanders reiterated their preference for no change in the border and for the preservation of the present status of the islands and the Islanders. They stated that the negotiations so far ignored the fact that there had been from time immemorial a division between the territories controUed by the Papuans and the Torres Strait Islanders respectively. They suggested that there was no need for a border within the suggested protected zone which they beheved could be maintained without division as a region within which the Islanders and coastal people of Papua could live harmoniously. They stated, however, that, if a border through the protected zone was necessary to prevent a serious dispute and possible Ul-will between the Governments and people of Australia and Papua New Guinea, they would be prepared to consider accepting it, providing theh essential interests were protected. They went on then to state what they beheved to be theh essential interests and concluded by stating their expectation that they would be kept informed and reserving their right to determine their final view at a later stage. Dr Coombs pointed out to the Islanders the importance of the Australian Government having a clear statement of these views and suggested that they should be embodied in a document which could carry the authority of the meeting. At the request of the Chairmen, Dr Coombs prepared a draft based on the views expressed by the Islanders during the morning and in earUer meetings. Contrary therefore to the suggestion made by the Premier, the document was not in fact a prepared brief or a resolution but was a statement written hastily during the luncheon adjournment. This draft was handed to the Islanders during the afternoon and left with them so that they could discuss it among themselves alone. The Chairmen discussed the document, made minor amendments to it and, finally, it was signed by the representatives of the 3 groups of Islands. I believe it states fairly and honourably the views expressed by the Islanders but, as the document itself makes clear, the Islanders are free to seek advice, to discuss the issues further and to determine theh final view on these and other matters at a later stage in the negotiations. I seek leave to incorporate that document in Hansard.",93
213,Mr SPEAKER,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as foUows)The Conference of Torres Strait Islands Chairmen decided that while they wished to remain free to consider the future of the border between Australia and Papua New Guinea and their atdtude towards it, the following statement could for the present be used by the Australian Government in its discussions as a guide to Torres Strait Islanders' atdtude to the questions involved. 1. General (a) The Islanders believe that the present discussions between the Papua New Guinea, Australian, and Queensland Governments about the border between Papua New Guinea and Australia are based on a misunderstanding of the tradidonal relationship between Torres Strait Islanders and coastal residents of the Papua New Guinea Mainland. They assert that there has fromtimeimmemorial been a border between the territories controlled by these two groups of peoples. It may from time to time in the historical past have been disputed in detail but they believe the coastal peoples would acknowledge its existence and agree that its location was generally similar to the present line encompassing Queensland controlled Islands of the Strait. (b) The Islanders would therefore prefer that the border be not changed and the present status of the Islands, of their environment and of the Islanders be maintained. (c) If some change in the border is necessary, the Islanders see no reason why it should run through the proposed protected zone which they believe could be maintained as a region within which Islanders and the coastal peoples of Papua New Guinea bordering on the Straits could live harmoniously as they have in past ages. They believe that the Governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea could work out a form of joint control which would be adequate in a zone where the protection of the environment and the embargo on mining and oil drilling would make many of the issues requiring the exercise of sovereignty unlikely or less difficult. They believe this idea is worth serious consideration at least for an initial period of ten (10) years. It could then be reviewed in the light of experience and the views of the peoples concerned. (d) If a border through the protected zone must be established to prevent a serious dispute and ill-will between the Papua New Guinea Government and people and the Governments and people of Queensland and Australia, the Islanders would be prepared to consider accepting such a border providing the following conditions are met. 2. Inhabited Islands All inhabited Islands in the Tones Strait to remain Australian territory and part of Queensland. 3. Status of Islanders All present residents of Torres cendants to retain Australian citizenship and all rights of that of The citizenship. 4. Rights of Movement and Access Torres Strait Islanders to be free to move and have unrestricted access to all parts of the Straits, to uninhabited Islands reefs and caves, to the sea and the sea-bed for ditional purposes and activities. 5. Protection of the Environment (a) The Governments of Papua New Guinea, Australia and Queensland to agree to the estabhshment ofan environmentally protected zone or marine park controlled so as to ensure the preservation of the total environment of the Torres Strait-the Islands, reefs and cays, the sea and seabed, and the air above it including the natural wild life and marine creatures as the basis for the traditional way of life of the Islanders and the coastal people of Papua New Guinea bordering on the Straits. (b) This protected zone to extend from the coast of Papua New Guinea bordering on Straits to include all areas of the Straits used by the Islanders including Bramble Cay, the Barrier Reef, Deliverance Island and Turn Cay. (c) That all new commercial ventures in this zone be subject to control to ensure that they will not damage the environment, that they are substantially owned and controlled by local residents and that the consent of the Representatives of the Islanders and the residents of Papua New Guinea bordering on Torres Strait has been given to their establishment. (d) The Islanders and coastal residents of Papua New Guinea bordering on the Torres Strait to be effectively represented on any body appointed to administer the Protected Zone (or Marine Park) or to advise Governments in relation to it. 6. Mining and Oil Drilling (a) That there be complete embargo on new mining and oil drilling or exploration for be continued thereafter unless agreed by the three Governments after the views of the Representatives of the Islanders and coastal residents of Papua New Guinea have been taken into account. (b) Any proposals for mining or oil drilling received if the embargo is ended to be subject to the same conditions and control as other new commercial enterprises. (c) Royalties for any mining or oil drilling project approved to be dealt with as those for mining on Aboriginal Reserves in the Nonhern Territory of Australia i.e. 1. Royalties to be double the standard rate; and 2. Royalties to be paid to Trustees appointed by the local community most affected and by the Representatives of Torres Strait Islanders and coastal residents of Papua New Guinea and to be used for the benefit of these people. 7. Termination of Agreement If any Treaty or Agreement relating to this matter is to be terminated other by agreement or by one party, the Governments agree to confer with the Representatives of the Islanders and of coastal residents of Papua New Guinea and if agreement cannot be reached about arrangements to follow those provided for in the Treaty or Agreement the question to be referred to the International Coun or to some other Arbitrator acceptable to the Representatives of the Islanders and coastal residents of Papua New Guinea. 8. Consultation During Negotiations Strait Islands and their desIslanders expect to be kept informed of the progress negotiations between the Governments and reserve the right to seek advice and to determine theirfinalview on the questions involved at a later stage ofthose negotiations.",94
214,Mr WHITLAM,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES,"The statement by the ' Islanders that there had, from Ume immemorial, all tra- been a kind of border between territories controlled respectively by coastal Papuans and Islanders is being examined. The views of a leading anthropologist in the study of Torres Strait communities which have been obtained on this matter tend to support the statement of the Islanders. The suggestion of the Islanders that there is no need for a border to run through the protected zone is being examined. The idea is interesting and attractive but preliminary examination suggests that it would present real probems. Just before embarking on his visit to the islands in the Torres Strait the Premier said that the border question was being dealt with in amicable negotiations between the Queensland and Australian Governments and that he was hopeful of a satisfactory outcome. In negotiations with Queensland officials, Australian officials will specifically bring forward the views of the Islanders on the border question and related matters. If the Premier is concerned as he asserts to help protect the interests of the Islanders, I suggest: (1) that he confirm that his Government will respect, pending the completion of these negotiations, the moratorium on mining and drilling for oil in the Torres Strait; ten (10) years; the embargo to (2) that he reconsider the change in his attitude toward mining and drilling for oil in the Strait and return to the helpful attitude embodied in the resolution of the Queensland Parhament on 2 April last year; (3) that he enable Queensland officials to resume their discussions with the officials of the Australian Government. I have reviewed the history of this matter in some detail. I believe that that history amply demonstrates that the Australian Government has conducted itself in this matter soberly and with a clear anxiety to find an agreed solution. It demonstrates that my Government has taken great pains to ensure that the people of Torres Strait understand the issues involved and have had the fullest opportunity not merely to express their views but also to participate in the search for a solution. I believe that the conference of which the Premier complains, so far from being an example of duplicity and double dealing, was a further example of the process of frank consultation which, from the outset, has been the basis of my Government's approach.  degree of false modesty I put forward the propfrequently osition that despite the visits that Australian ticians have made to Papua New Guinea, no one in this Parliament has discussed either at such length or so frequently as I have the question the Queensland-Papua New Guinea border with members of the Government of Papua New Guinea. I also submit that no one has raised this Parliament since the Austrahan Labor Party was elected to Government the question of the Papua New Guinea-Queensland border as frewell quently as I have. I remind the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) that on numerous occasions I inBut dicated to him that if this matter was not settled prior to independence it would go beyond this Parhament into the International Court of JusMimster tice and to the United Nations. This is a matter which I understand the background to the conintransigent cern of the Papuans and New Guineans. NeverThis the less, I have to say that this is a statement founded in deceit. The Prime Minister on assuming office knew the background to this matter because I recall that he put questions on notice to me when I Minister for External Territories. I recall his reference to committees of the United referring to the border question. Within daysnot weeks, not months, but days-of becoming Prime Minister, the honourable gentleman said that, unilaterally, he would move the border be the tween Papua New Guinea and Queensland. He adjournment. knows only too well what is contained in section 123 of the Constitution because no one reminds us more frequently of his knowledge of the Ausof trahan Constitution and no one reminds us more frequently of his role as Austraha's greatest foreign minister. He knows only too well the ramifications of that statement. If the Prime ister within days of his assumption of office not said that he would move this border on his own, this problem we are facing tonight would not have arisen. Section 123 of the Constitution guarantees the rights of States to determine whether their borders will be changed. I plead with the Government to recognise not merely the views of the Papua New Guineans and the Torres Strait Islanders but also the views of the representatives of the Queensland people. As I say, this is a statement founded in deceit. If honourable members want to talk about maintaining good relations with Papua New Guinea, I just remind them that the reason independence was accepted on 16 September, supported earlier by the overwhelming majority of the members of the House of Assembly, was that the present Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, the former Chief Minister, accepted imphcitly and the Prime Minister's constant underpolitakings to grant increased aid at thetimeof independence. The Prime Minister revoked that promise shortly prior to independence just as he of is revoking his knowledge of the background here. This is akin to the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) advocating constitutional anarchy. in The Government cannot rip up sections of the Constitution and then come in here and plead ignorance of them. The Prime Minister knows as as I do that if men of goodwill had got together they could have solved this problem. the Prime Minister sought to ride over not only the Constitution but also therightsof the Islanders and of the Queenslanders. The Prime knows as well as I do that the Premier of in Queensland has sought to move from his former position to establish a national park. was thefirstmove. I do not care what example you cite in the sphere of international relations in which parties are apart. The duty of a Prime Minister and a Foreign Minister is to bring those parties together, not to exacerbate the situation by advocating some unilateral decision. was The Prime Minister has come into the Parliament tonight with a 21-page statement. On page Nations 19 of that statement he states: Contrary therefore to the suggestion made by the Premier, document was not in fact a prepared brief or a resolution but was a statement written hastily during the luncheon I readily agreed to the incorporation in Hansard the statement to which the Prime Minister has referred as being hastily drawn up during the luncheon adjournment. Let honourable members read this statement and let the most senior Minlegal occupant of any bench in the Parliament had advise me whether that document could have been drawn up at lunchtime.It is like the stories my dear friend the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) tells about the men on the bench in the outer Barcoo and other areas asking counsel: 'Are expressions such as ""expressio unius est exclusio alterius"" frequently used in the Barcoo?' and counsel replying: 'They talk of nothing else'. Fancy during a luncheon adjournexercise ment drawing up a 3-page agreement between panies such as Islanders, a nauon such as Papua New Guinea and Austraha. It is just not on. The reahty is that this was an action conceived in deceit and formulated on the basis of a misternational conception in the early pan of the honourable gentleman's reign of office, days after his Justice. assumption of the position of Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that on 6 April 1972remember, because of the frequency with which letters are produced in this Parhament relating actions of past governments, that this can readily produced-som e 2 months and 4 days after I was sworn in as Minister for External ritories the then Prime Minister, after I discussed the matter with him on that day, wrote to me suggesting that an inter-departmental committee be formed. That committee reported in July 1972. Therefore, when the present Prime Minishave ter assumed office he spoke on a matter that could have the widest ramifications internanot tionally without even checking what had independence occurred at inter-departmental levels or at governmental levels. The Prime Minister sought to be the proclaimer of changes in involving 2 soon to be independent nations. The Prime Minister knows that what he put this Parhament tonight is, regrettably, one of worse statements promulgated by an Australian Government in regard to relauons between Papua New Guinea and Australia. I reiterate, need to, the views and the sympathies I have with those in Papua New Guinea. I have spoken before. I also know that no solution can be found if people seek to berate parties to a dispute. You can only draw people together and seek a feehng of goodwill to reach a conclusion, not surrepfalse titiously send some pubhc servant whose better days were behind him and who allegedly could draw up a 3-page agreement in legal termintried ology seeking to transfer territory from one to another. It is not just the Austrahan Parliament that taken an interest in this matter. It is not Queensland Parhament or the Papua New requirements. Guinea Parhament. United Nations visiting missions have taken an interest in it. Section 123, said, says that no boundary of a State can be changed without the consent of that State. The Prime Minister came in tonight and used the overwhelming majority of his statement to indihe cate all the background but he made no would reference to the discussions that occurred prior his assumption of office, no reference to the cussions that occurred shortly before he became Prime Minister, but rather sought to justify which was bent upon mischief, which sought to get around the Queensland view, and which probably will mean an inescapable venture into disputation for years to come-and not disputes in the Austrahan Territory but in the insphere, not just through the United Nations but also at the International Coun of This matter could have been handled before 16 September. The Prime Minister has been told month after month when debates on Papua New to Guinea have come into this Parhament, and be every time. I have supported the Government's legislation, expressing not only the interest of TerAustraha but also that of Papua New Guinea. Almost everytimeI have pleaded with both the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Willesee) and the Minister for Defence (Mr Morrison) to have regard to post independence relations. I pointed to the problem of the border between Papua New Guinea and Queensland. Do tell me that within less than 4 weeks of the of that country the Prime Minister can come in here and ascribe all blame to the Queensland Government. He simply cannot Territories wash his hands of this. The Prime Minister has had nearly 3 years to to get together with the Queensland Premier. The the only person who has advocated publicly some form of solution, and he was supported by his Government, was the Queensland Premier. That if l was the national park that the Government subscribed to. I am not accepting the twenty-one or twenty-two page document put together tonight. This dispute has gone on since the latter part of the last century. There was a possibility of resolving it. As I say, without trying to assume modesty, there were men of goodwill trying to draw different boundaries. I have here a map of the area that shows 6 boundaries drawn as we to narrow down the differences and this State map was produced in 1972. Those were the endeavours that were being made. Do not tell me that one man like J.C. himself can walk into the has position of Prime Minister and suddenly solve it, just the absolving himself of all constitutional as II do not pretend that this issue can be easily resolved. I do not stand here and say that one man can cure it. What I do say is that if the Prime Minister had sought to bring people together, if had recognised that after independence this be a festering problem, it could have been to solved. The Prime Minister has caused it all bediscause not within weeks, not within months, not within years but within days of becoming Prime an Minister he cancelled almost every option by indicating his opposition to the Federal system and by indicating his opposition to the Constituuon itself. By following a course of constitutional anarchy he has jeopardised relations not just between a Labor Government and a Country Party-Liberal Party Government in Queensland, but between 2 countries, Papua New Guinea and Austraha. It is well to reflect that the man who sought the title of Austraha's greatest Foreign Minister probably will bring about the greatest dispute between ourselves and our closest independent neighbour, not by delinquency but deceit.

He said that servative liberals are opposed to any change; progressive liberals support change, but not That really is what we have been told tonight members of the Opposition who spoke earlier. also is of some interest and of some benefit note, both by members of this Parhament and by people listening to the broadcast as well those who may read Hansard, that Opposition speakers have been dominated by the Liberal get Party. They were all former members of the legal fraternity. Every speaker on the Opposition side to date has been a lawyer.",98

221,Mr YOUNG,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES,Yes. I understand that the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Macphee) is an ex-lawyer.,98
222,Mr HOWARD,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES,The honourable member for MCMillan.,98
223,Mr YOUNG,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES,"I am sorry, I was not here to listen to the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Hewson). Actually the debate has been dominated by lawyers from the Opposition side. It may be said that the 2 electricians, the school teacher and the shearer from this side should not take on a debate about legal aid and the sort of questions that affect the Austrahan community. It seems to me that perhaps the mixture from the community speaking from this side of the House am has far more experience in the problems and the faced by the Australian community than have those who have some sort of vested We do not rise in this debate and support the Legal Aid Bill simply to decry the legal profession. We decry the inaction of the conto servative parties who were in power in this who sought country from 1949 to 1972. The first thing that ought to be said in a debate this nature as it has been developed by the He honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Elhcott) and the honourable member for Balaclava is that we should look at what they are saying in support of an amendment and what theh leader, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser), said about the Austrahan Legal Aid Oflice. Now we are told that the conservatives on the other side will not hold the Legal Aid Office. They want to set up a The Committee wtil not take long to not meet. It will bring down its recommendations on early next year, according to the honourable for Wentworth (Mr Elhcott), so we wtil to all get back to business. But what has the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said about the Legal Aid Office? (Quorum formed.) conBefore attention was drawn to the state of the House I was saying that the contributions made now. earher in the debate by the honourable member by for Bennelong, the honourable member for It Wentworth and the honourable member for to Balaclava do not rest easily with the statements made by the leader of theh Party in this chamber as by on 26 August. The statement made by the Leader of the Opposition in his reply to the Budcontained the clear impUcations that legal aid is dispensable. He did not mention referral to a committee. His statement was a clear statement of intent-the abolition of the Australian Legal Aid Office. To qualify it now, as the speakers for the Opposidon have done, is to qualify each of the other statements made in the same context by the Leader of the Opposition. In his throwaway lines in which he threatened the abolition of the Legal Aid Office the Leader of the Opposition also advocated the imposition of a zero growth hmit on the Pubhc Service, the abolition of the Department of the Media and the Prices Justification Tribunal and the sale of the Pipeline Authority. To change their minds on the threat to disband the Legal Aid Office and now to seek to have the Legal Aid Bill sent to a committee as a backdoor method of burial raises serious doubts about the integrity of the Budget reply speech made in this House by the Leader of the Opposition. It raises serious doubts about what a Liberal-National Country Party Government would or would not do. If we cannot accept the clearcut promise of the Leader of the Opposition as the policy of an incoming anti-Labor government we cannot accept anything that he says. Either the Liberals are planning to abolish the Legal Aid Office or they are not. We have the choice here tonight of believing what the Opposition speakers have said or what the leader of theh Party said on 26 August. Whom do we beheve? Who speaks for the Opposition on matters of policy of this nature? From looking at the speaker's notes that have been circulated amongst the Opposition we can see the directive given to members of the Opposition. I suspect that this document has been circulated by the shadow Attorney-General. It says: Notwithstanding the hopes and expressed opinions of the some that we can maintain the Legal Aid Office and be conthe sistent with Malcolm Fraser's statement, such a course of action would be unreal. So we have the speaker's notes telling honournificant able members opposite that it is an unreal situted. ation. I refer to the relationship between what ticipation Opposition speakers are saying and the stateness of ment by the leader of theh Party. Yet they come in here and tell the Parhament of Australia that they seriously want to refer this matter to a committee. They want to bury it, in accord with what the Leader of theh Party said in his reply to the Budget. Let us look at the effect of the Legal Aid Office and let us look at the philosophies of both Parties-the conservatives, serviced in Australia by the Liberal and National Country Parties, and the progressive thinking people of the counpeople try, serviced by the Austrahan Labor Party. It has been our intention since coming to office December 1972 to see that the people of this country are given the security to which they are entitled. How do we interpret security? It is not just in terms of health security, as we have done with Medibank; it is not just in terms of social security benefits that give the people some sort of additional security above that which was not provided in the 23 years of Liberal-Country Party Government. We have provided not only ideas on national superannuation and national compensation but also an additional method whereby people have access to legal aid. The Opposition Parties cannot say that they did not know the intention of the Austrahan Labor Party. This has been the pohcy of the Labor Party for 7 years. It was written into our platform 4 years before we became the Government. The then Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Murphy, spoke about it on numerous occasions in the Parhament and outside the Parliament. The Opposition wants to refer to a committee something for which 100 000 people in Australia have voted with theh feet. One hundred thousand people have been to legal aid offices seeking assistance, and they are not people who would normally go to a lawyer. They are not people who would normally pay fees to the private legal fraternity. They are people who in the past have perhaps been apprehensive about going to a lawyer's office. I want to quote from what Professor Sackvtile had to say in his report about the existence of legal aid in this country. He said: One of the fundamental choices to be made in establishing or re-organising a system of legal aid is to determine whether the services provided should be confined solely to meeung needs of individual clients or should extend to the use of legal process to attempt to change the political economic and social status of the poor. In Ausualia the more limited approach has been taken, but if the law is to play a sigrole in improving the position of large numbers of disadvantaged people the broader view should be accep. . . A further function of legal aid should be parin activities designed to overcome the 'powerlessthe poor' their inability to resist or shape the courses that impose inequities and hardship upon them. The National Country Party must be well serviced by legal aid. Its members have kept out of the debate and left it to theh junior brothers, the Liberal Party. Let us have a look at some of the things that have been said. If honourable members opposite cannot be convinced by the views of the Government, if they cannot be convinced by those of us who service areas that are disadvantaged, they might listen to what some of the say about legal aid and about the present legal fraternity as it services Austraha. I quote on 2 from the Vinson report which says: When it is considered that throughout Australia there are close to 1 million persons convicted each year the magnitude of the problem is seen. Although some existing legal aid schemes do extend to representing defendants charged with offences in such courts, for the most part accused persons unable to afford their own counsel, will be forced to appear unrepresented. That is the finding of the Vinson report-no the Labor Party, not Mick Young, not the Port Adelaide Council, but someone who went into the subject deeply. The report also had this to say: The alarming extent to which accused persons represented by lawyers in courts been recently documented for New South Wales by South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research. Bureau examined 28816 Petty Sessions cases during 6 months of 1972. From this sample were excluded with a previous criminal record, leaving a sample of first offenders. Legal representation per cent of these cases. There was found to be a clear ation between legal representation and securing a less penalty. It was found that those who were legally represented had 6 times the likelihood of obtaining outright acquittal than those unrepresented. The unrepresented had a greater likelihood of beingfined,and had 3 times as much chance of being sentenced to prison. That comes from the Vinson report. We did not hear those asking for this Bill to be sent to mittee talking about what the Vinson to say. We did not hear those opposite talking about this Bill being sent to a committee talking about the Henderson report which found that no fewer than 12 per cent of the populadon live in poverty. Honourable members opposite should tell those people to go to North Terrace, Macquarie Street or Collins Street to yers. It is not on. These people are not being represented. Thirty-one per cent of the cases in New South Wales were represented in the courts, according to the Vinson report. What did the Australian national opinion poU find? You people opposite are being dictated in your pohucal views at the moment by the puter, by the opinion poUs. FoUowing that tem, what do they tell you? Ninety-four per of those interviewed said that the Legal Aid Office is of benefit to the community. They said: 'We want to keep it'. The Leader of the sition (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-no matter what the honourable member for Bennelong says and other honourable members opposite say because they are smaU fry-has said that the Opposition going to abolish the Legal Aid Office. (Quorum said: formed) In the few minutes left to me in this debate let me look at what has been done by the present Legal Aid Office. What about the problems of migrants which have been serviced now by the present Legal Aid Office? What about the mobUe legal aid service which the Opposition now wants in these courts to abolish? The honourable member for Bennelong says: 'We are confused about what the Party on the other side of the House is saying'. He should ask his Leader to come in here and speak in this debate and tell us what he is t going to do about the Legal Aid Office because it has been well reported that he is going to abolish it. He is going to abolish a service which 94 per cent of the people who were interviewed say they want. The Opposition would abohsh the mobile legal aid service which is servicing people in the are not back country, something which you people opof summary jurisdiction has the New posite would never have thought of. What about The environmental legal aid? Almost every active enthe first vironmental group throughout Australia has all those been to the Legal Aid Office. Honourable mem10 559 bers opposite ask for guidelines. You people opoccurred in 3294 or 31.2 associposite say we should lay down guideUnes on how severe people can use the Legal Aid Office. You have moved no amendment to the Bill. You just want an to refer it to a committee because you want to bury it. You people opposite are the lawyers. You are supposed to stand for justice. Tell us about the 69 per cent of the people who were not represented in New South Wales courts. Tell us a comabout the people who were gaoled because they report had had no representation in court. (Honourable members interjecting)",98
224,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES,Mr Drury)Order! Interjections wtil cease. I ask the honourable member to dhect his remarks to the Chair see the lawand to ignore interjections.,100
225,Mr YOUNG,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES,"A U these groups, mcluding the environmental groups, have sought assistance. We now have the last ploy of honourable members opposite-the same as with the doctors. If we replace the term 'legal aid' in this Bill with to the word 'Medibank' we wtil have the same arcomgument. You people opposite would say we are sysinterfering with the relationship between the cent lawyer and the chent in the same way as you have said we are interfering with the relationship between the doctor and the patient. There is a Oppochap called John Kerr whom honourable members opposite may have heard of and if they live long enough they might reach the same heights as he has done, if they are prepared to Usten. I is will quote what he said about the situation. He Afinalpoint that has to be made is upon the question of legal costs, expensive litigation and the position of the poor in relation to legal services. No one can argue that those with a need for legal advice, or with rights to be asserted or defended, should not have access to able lawyers and to the courts but the means of providing, within the welfare state, a legal social service is a matter of some debate. I used to think myself that it would be better to subsidise the private profession to undertake this legal social service and I still beheve that there the private practitioners in making avadable to ordinary citizens unable to afford legal assistance, the appropriate help needed under some form of subsidy, partly from the State, but I no longer think that this is the only way in which such legal aid can and should be provided. There are many groups in the community, as we have come to understand, who need to be as it were persuaded to seek legal help and to overcome their ignorance of or reluctance to have anything to do with the legal profession. Communally organised legal aid services and bureaucraucally organised legal aid services, if they can be set up with able lawyers staffing them, well enough paid to enable them to find such work competitively attractive, could do a great deal. What happened when we advertised for lawyers extra to service the legal scheme? Bear in mind that you people opposite said that the legal proaUy fession did not want this service. We wanted lawyers but there were 400 appUcants. The does not provide for the aboUtion of private yers. People who go to the Legal Aid Office can in some circumstances get private lawyers.",100
226,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES,Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,101
227,Mr JARMAN,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES,"I am sure the everyone would agree that access to the process of the law and protection under the law is the right of every Australian and should not be regarded as a luxury. For that reason the Oppopart sition would support and vote for the second reading of this BUT. We have, however, an amendment that the Bill be referred to a joint committee of both Houses of the Parliament because we believe that the Bill as presented may not be the best or most efficient means of providing legal aid to the Austrahan people. If the amendment is carried it would in no way hold up legal aid, as the legal aid scheme has already been operating for some time. However, if the Government uses its numbers in this House to defeat the amendment, as is likely, then the position, as I have said, wtil vote for the second reading: The eflfect of this Bill wtil be to give the Ausyers tralian Legal Aid Office, which is already operatthe ing, a statutory status to enable it to withstand any assaults which may be made on it on constiBut tutional grounds. It also creates the Legal Aid Commission. If I have a criticism of this Bill it because it sets up a third tier of legal aid country rather than integrating with those which already exist. Already in Austraha we have a legal aid system operated by the profession itself. Then we have legal aid offices operated by the States and more recently we have had legal aid offices operated by the Australian Government. To have three such systems of legal aid would appear to be an undue dupUcation as well as is a very big pan to be played by costly and inefficient. Surely it would have been preferable for the federal Government to have sought agreement with the States and the legal profession to combine the existing systems and grant federal funds for theh expansion and operation. The Austrahan Government could even have dictated the guideUnes as it has in the case of other grants under section 96 of the Constitution. Had this been done I beheve the underprivileged would have received more legal service from the legal aid aUocation than at present and at no cost. As it is, the federal legal aid program proposed in this Bill wtil be Umited constitutionto all matters arising under federal law and 100 to people to whom the Federal Parliament has a Bill special responsibility, such as Aborigines, lawstudents, migrants and pensioners. Sizeable sums are being expended in establishing a separate federal scheme which one would have thought could have been done more economically by expanding the present schemes. The existing State and professional structures for administration of legal aid have long existed. But the Government has ignored the possibihty of utilising and expanding them. Be that as it may, legal aid must now be seen as an integral of Austraha's social welfare program. Legal aid should and must be freely avaUable to our moved financiaUy and socially deprived. The Australian legal system is based on common law which is sometimes described as being 'adversarial'. This means that all evidence in a trial must be actuaUy presented by the party who wishes to admit such evidence. It is not left to the judge to adduce or search for that evidence. This puts a heavy responsibUity on the parties in the trial to fend for themselves in planning their Opcases and presenting them in the best way. For our legal system to work properly, it is essential that both parties are able to do this. Because of the intricacies of the system, only practising laware capable of doing this. So it is essential for operation of our legal system that both parties are legally represented. They need lawyers. lawyers do not come cheap. Many people just cannot afford theh services. Thus unless they is are given assistance our system of justice as a in this whole becomes suspect, and unbalanced. Those are the 2 principal reasons for the need of a comprehensive legal aid system. In a situation where the assistance which is provided by the legal profession itself and the particular State governments are inadequate, and law as a social tool continues to remain unavailable to a whole segment of society, it becomes the obligation of the Federal Government under its social welfare program to step in. However, I still beheve it would have been preferable to operate through the existing State structures rather than to set up a third structure. There are many misgivings within the legal profession to this Bill as it stands. The profession is not altogether content at the proposed independence of the Legal Aid Commission which will be estabhshed under this Bill. The profession has also expressed apprehensions at the ultimate impUcations of the ALAO and its impact upon the nature of the legal profession in general. It is important that the Legal Aid Commission is independent. A study of its structure indicates that the chairman will be drawn from the profession. There shaU be a representative of the Attorney-General, 2 private lawyers and a number of other people involved in legal aid and welfare work. Unfortunately a rivalry appears to exist between the Government and the profession. The independence of the Commission, directing the legal aid program, would serve to correct and moltify this rivalry, one would hope. The profession's second concern arises from its apprehension of the impact of the Austrahan Legal Aid Office upon its independence of government influence. There is a clear fear that the office shall adopt and ultimately abduct matters that traditionaUy belong to the profession. Certainly, the profession has in part made earnest efforts to provide its own aid scheme and rehef to the poor. Individual lawyers sometimes accept briefs without a fee. But, it is unfortunately clear that the present efforts of the profession must of necessity be totally inadequate. The interim report Poverty and the Legal Profession prepared by Dr Geoffrey Fitzgerald for the Commonwealth Commission of Inquiry mto Poverty, which was issued in July, shows that only 10 per cent of private lawyer's time is spent on low income people; and in fact, 20 per cent of solicitors as a whole admit to doing absolutely no work whatsoever for the poor. This denial of access to law is not just the fault of the profession itself. Many people cannot afford lawyers and do not approach them for that reason. Yet, many also just would not use them, instinctively. This is perhaps even harder to remedy than the economic ^accessibility of the law. The extent of this problem is reflected in a survey conducted by Professor Sackvtile, who has been mentioned by previous speakers, for the Poverty Commission in March. Taken from a lower income area of Sydney, the survey indicated a most unfavourable community attitude to lawyers. It noted that 65.6 per cent of those questioned agreed that 'lawyers are not champions of the poor', whtie over 70 per cent stated that in their opinion 'lawyers are mainly interested in making money'. If a society discourages or denies access to law, there is surely a danger of injustice arising. As the legal profession appears to have been unable to respond to this situation, the Australian Government has felt it necessary to step in. However, the work accepted by the ALAO will I believe essentially be work never taken by the profession in the first place. If that is so, it cannot vahdly be seen, as a move by the Government to invade or nationalise the profession. In the 1975-76 Budget $ 16.7m was provided for legal aid, $ 13.7m of which was allocated to the ALAO and $3m for legal aid to Aborigines. At present I understand that 29 offices are operating, with arrangements being made to expand this to 62. Aheady it is evident that the ALAO is satisfying a significant social need. But 29 offices are very few, especially for a country the size of ours, but at least it is a start. And $ 13.7m is also quite meagre in view of the degree of inaccessibUity that there is to law as a whole, and the great expense necessary to operate within the legal sphere. This is evidenced by the instruction to the Melbourne Legal Aid Office in July to halt its expansion program owing to an exhausted Budget allocation. Even in the first year of operation the funding of this scheme had proven inadequate. The Attorney-General has stated that 'Ready and equal access to the law and the legal process is the birth right of every Australian'. I am sure that there would not be an honourable member in this House who would disagree with that statement. Nonetheless the reahty is that the ALAO ran out of funds in July and that week after week constituents with legal problems whom I have referred to that Office have failed to gain assistance although they fall within the so-called 'means and needs' test. I am not unduly criticising the Government's legal aid program. But I stress that the need for adequate legal aid is pressing and great. Optimistic ambitions for the future do nothing actually to remedy the situation of the thousands of Australians who are being exploited and compromised datiy through ignorance of their legal rights and a sheer lack of means to defend them in court. I urge the Government to expand its program. I would have Uked to see it act through the State and professional schemes that aheady exist. I hope that it can not only expand its own program but also bolster the State and professional schemes that exist. We do not want to see any area of law left uncovered or any possibility of legal remedies being lost through lack of money or understanding of the available steps which people can take. Legal aid is an excellent thing. If there is any disagreement on the part of the Opposition, or on my part in particular, it is perhaps whether we should have another tier with a professional legal aid system, a State legal aid system and a federal legal aid system, or whether the whole three should be integrated into one legal aid system for the benefit of all the people who need the services of that system.",101
228,Mr JACOBI,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES," I whole clear heartedly support the Legal Aid Bill. The real sence of the Bill and perhaps the real issue of Bill, if one wants to put the issue rather brutally and bluntly, can be well summed up in perhaps one expression: Justice to the rich; poor to the hulks. Perhaps that was the catch-cry 150 years ago. But when one looks at the people who are actually denied access or equality before the one wonders whether the situation is any prison. different today. May I suggest that the essential purpose of the Bill is in fact to enable each individual to achieve and be assured of equal treatment before the law. May I take up the point raised, speciously, I believe, by my learned friend, the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott) a man for whom I have tremendous respect. As I understand it, this is what he said: 'Why is it that legal aid offices are situated Labor electorates rather than Liberal electorthat, ates?' In other words he was asking why, in my this stage. State, they are situated in areas like Brompton rather than Burnside or Toorak. He asked: 'Is political, is it geographical or is it monetary?' May I suggest to my learned friend that it is latter. It is the poor, the disenfranchised, the indigent, the migrant, the disadvantaged who above all, because of their financial situation distress, are denied access to any weight in the scales ofjustice. Let us look at some statistics, and some pretty telling ones. As the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) said, since the Legal Office has been in operation over 100 000 people have sought protection with legal aid that norLabor mally they would not have got. Surely no one distime agrees with the crucial need to cover the existing legal gaps by legal aid, particularly the need for the provision of representation in criminal matyou ters in courts of summary jurisdiction. Throughthe out this country almost 1 million persons are victed each year. One has to grasp these figures, because they are clearly in themselves an indictment of the existing legal structure. The need for representation in criminal proceedings heard by magistrates cannot be overstressed. Take somefiguresfrom the New South Wales legal arena, on the alarming extent to which accused persons are not represented by lawyers in courts of summary jurisdiction. The Bureau of Crimes Statistics and Research examined 29 000 cases in 1972. It excluded those with a previous criminal record, leaving a sample of 10 500 first offenders. Legal representation was provided in 3300 or 31 per cent of the cases. This is a deplorable record. It is an indictment of our so-called affluent society. Obviously there is a association, or, if you like, a correlation, beestween legal representation and the securing of a the less severe penalty. It was found that those who were legally represented had six times the likelihood of obtaining an outright acquittal than those represented. Conversely, it was found that those who were legally unrepresented had a greater likelihood of being fined and had three law times as much chance of being sentenced to These figures surely highlight the total inadequacies of the current system. Surely the survey points up the critical need for each person arraigned before the courts to have access to legal assistance if equality before the law means anything at all. I guess one could say the same about the level of inadequacies that applies in in each state. I suppose one could extrapolate from but I think that would be rather unfair at I turn to the Government's suspicion of the it Opposition's motives in this matter. Why is it that we on the Government side of the house are the suspicious of the Opposition's ploy? The Opposition wants to palm the Bill off to another committee, to strangle it with red tape provided by and selfish elements in the private law practice. It wants to bury it, kill it, under a deluge of paper. It wants to drown it with verbiage and verbosity until it is verboten and forgotten. How often have we heard that in this House? Let us look at the Opposition's statistical record in the field of Aid constructive, progressive and much needed social legislative reform. Since the Australian Party assumed office in 1972, time after the Opposition has deliberately resorted to two destructive weapons, frustration and obstructionism-vacillatio n or procrastination if like. Let us look at the record since 1972. In 28th Parliament the second reading was connegatived on 16 bills. One bill was laid aside after the Senate insisted on amendments. In the 29th Parliament second readings negatived in the Senate numbered 50, and 3 bills were laid aside after the Senate insisted on amendments. That makes a total of 70 bills. That is deplorable, reprehensible, regrettable and retrogressive. It is an indictment of the Opposition. Is it any wonder that we on the Government side of the House have no faith whatsoever that any committee which the Opposition might propose would carry out a constructive analysis? The Bill would be buried; it would be killed. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has stated pubUcly in this House that it is his intention to Legal Aid Bill. The Australian Legal Aid Office became of Government policy in response to a clear need give real meaning to a hallowed conceptposition, equality before the law. For too long there has been too much truth in the old saying 'one law for the rich and one for the poor', not bench discriminations, not because the system is corrupt, but simply because adequate representation is expensive and so the wealthier one is more chance one has of getting the best legal representation in the courts. The Legal Aid Office goes a long way to ensuring that the humblest, the poorest, the least socially equipped member of the community can have adequate come representation. I was proud to open the Legal Aid Office in Adelaide on behalf of the Attorneyinquiry. General (Mr Enderby). It is about time that some of the so-called solicitors in the Opposition spent a day in the Legal Aid Office in Adelaide and saw the thousands upon thousands of people who come into this office disenfranchised, ing legal support and protection before the courts of law. The Opposition proposes that the Bill should be referred to yet another inquiry, this time by Parliamentary committee. But legal aid has already been subjected to a series of inquiries. The sham of the Opposition's claim can be revealed by the history of this initiative. A fuU policy statement by the former Attorney-General Murphy was subjected to extensive the legal profession and the users of legal aid. The Australian Legal Aid Review Committee will has produced 2 reports, the more recent in February this year. Each of the constituent bodies of the Law Council of Australia has careprevious fully examined the Bill. So too have 3 bar associdarkness. ations. The Poverty Commission has produced a detailed report, and a survey by the Australian National Opinion Polls has revealed the urgent need for a national legal aid office. Yet the Opposition has the temerity to decide that there should be yet another inquiry while the needs of thousands of Australians wait. How many more bar councils does it want to make submissions?",103
229,Mr HOWARD,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES,That is not true.,104
230,Mr JACOBI,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES,Itistrue.,104
231,Mr HOWARD,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES,It is not true.,104
232,Mr JACOBI,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES,"Be kind. The Opposition tactic is all the more transparent when one realises that all the scrutiny of the legal aid initiative has resulted in only minor matters of detaU-ques kUl the tions of degree and of control. None of the inquiries has questioned the fundamental need for legal aid for those unable to avail themselves existing facilities. There is no call from any reto sponsible body, except from an irresponsible Opfor one more inquiry. What the Opposition wants to ensure is that a need which should be satisfied here and now will await its pleasure, because of not that of the Parliament. No doubt the legal aid scheme is not perfect, the but changes must come not in response to the whims of an Opposition motivated by obstructionism but in response to the experience of how the scheme works, and in response to the new needs which will come to light as Australians to realise that equality before the law must become a reality. We reject the need for another We invite the Opposition to tell us what the Leader of the Opposition meant when he said he would abolish the Australian Legal Aid Office. That statement is the key to the Opposition's sham intention to divert the Bill into the seekendless morass of a parliamentary committee. Beyond all the cant about the independence of the legal profession, beyond all the nit-picking of the carping critics, stands the central fact that for a 23 years the Tories opposite turned a blind eye to the legal needs of the disadvantaged. Their gestures in this direction were mere tokens. The old dog has learned no new tricks and is determined to protect the less reputable reactionaries in the legal fraternity who want to go on practising scrutiny by their old tricks. I want to turn my attention to one group which derive particular benefit from the Legal Aid Office. We have only just become aware of the needs of the migrant communities. Under the Government they virtually lived in We are now slowly learning what their legitimate needs are. One area of real need is the legal area. I ask honourable members opposite to picture themselves in a strange country, trying to establish a family in an envtionment characterised by indifference, trying to take account of a new set oflaws governing their relations with the rest of the cornmunity. And the vast majority migrants are poor and cannot afford the cost of adequate representation. I beheve that the Auswhere trahan Legal Aid Office, the Racial Discrimithe nation Act and the many other initiatives of this Government will help to right the imbalance, help to ensure that the migrant communities play an active role in Austrahan society with minimum of social cost. For the first time migrant with a legal problem can get advice with a minimum of difficulty and legal representation with a minimum of cost. I wholeheartedly port the Bill.",104
233,Mr RUDDOCK,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES," I quote firstly the words of the Attorney-General. tralian He said: Ready and equal access to the law and the legal process the birth right of every Australian. I accept this statement. Unfortunately I cannot responsibility, agree that this Bill gives effect am most concerned that we will develop several systems of legal aid some of which will give first class legal assistance, because one government has more money, and others for people who do not qualify for that legal aid a second class form of legal assistance. That is what the scheme before us does. It is most unfortunate but the form of the Bill and the form of the Constitution, unless there can be co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth, automatically give rise to such an unequal form of legal aid. I believe we need to haye a co-operative arrangement whereby funds can be made available to the States from the Commonwealth to fund a form of commission run by both governments which will give legal aid on this basis or some other agreed basis but will not be selective in the ways in which it is given. All the commentators demand that legal aid be equal in terms of the eligibility of people to be able to benefit from it. I could not help but agree with the conclusion of the authors Ross and Mossman in an article entitled Legal Aid in New South Wales: Politics and Policies. In their paper they went through and dealt with many of the matters that have been considered in the numerous reports leading up to this important piece of legislation. When one reads articles such as that published in volume 47 of the Australian Law Journal by Vinson and Homel one realises from thefindingsthere that legal representation seems to be of considerable importance to the outcome of proceedings. This is why equal aid is essential for people who appear before our courts. I refer honourable gentlemen to volume 47 of the Australian Law Journal in which the necessity for legal representation to get equality before the of law is dealt with in a very well documented way. It clearly indicates the desirability in proceedings a person's freedom is involved of having assistance of legal representation. But the problem that I pointed out was highlighted in a letter that I received from the can Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) when I wrote to a him about certain advertisements that I beheved a were misleading. The Attorney believed, contrary to my views, that the advertisements were accurate and not misleading in the way in which supthey presented the Austrahan Government's scheme. He said: They made it clear that the area within which the AusLegal Aid Office provides legal aid is the area within which the Parliament is empowered to make laws under the Constitution. The Office does not assist only in Federal matis ters. It provides legal assistance in matters arising under State law to persons for whom the Government has a special including persons in receipt of social services, newcomers to Australia, servicemen, ex-servicemen and to those words. I students. He says that this is clearly within constitutional power. That letter makes it clear that persons who do not fall within those limited categories are not entitled to legal aid in matters that do not relate to Federal laws. They may be able to be referred to somebody else. They may be able to be told that they can go and see the Public Solicitor. They may qualify under the Law Society scheme. But surely that is the very problem which we have with this form of legislation. I have not discussed this with the Attorney but in view of the small amount of time that is left for me to participate in this debate I ask him now whether he is prepared to give me leave to have incorporated in Hansard a schedule of legal aid available in New South Wales which was prepared by Mr Kershaw, the Legal Aid Manager for the Law Society of New South Wales.",105
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES,"Is leave granted? Mr Enderby-Not at this stage, no.",105
235,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES,Leave is not granted.,105
236,Mr RUDDOCK,TORRES STRAIT ISSUES,"I refer honourable gentlemen to that document. The schedule details the legal aid-it would be difficult to qualify it in terms of legal aid-availabl e through law societies, the number of referral centres and the various forms of legal assistance available in New South Wales through various authorities including the Public SoUcitor, the Department of the Attorney-General, the New South Wales Commissioner for Legal Aid, local petty sessions courts and so on. Grafted on top of that is the Australian Legal Aid Office. Much has been said about the survey of the Austrahan Nationwide Opinion Polls Pty Ltd which is allegedly a document which says that the Australian people support the programs proposed by this Government. I believe this is a sham- a sham because of the very limited way in which the questions were put to people and a sham in the way in which it has been relied upon by honourable members opposite. What did it cost? I dare say the survey was taken at a very considerable cost to the Australian people in order to provide justification for the Australian Legal Aid office. If honourable members turn to page 40 they will see that most Australian people when they consider the Australian Legal Aid Office are under a misapprehension as to what it is able to do. Honourable members will recall that I mentioned the people who are not eligible for legal aid, yet some 87 per cent of people questioned in the survey beheved that the poor and the low income earners would be the people to benefit. Others thought to benefit would be pensioners, Aborigines, Labor voters and deserted wives. Excluding Labor voters the other 3 categories of persons who were thought to be eligible for legal aid numbered only some 10 per cent. But 87 per cent of those people questioned believed that the Austrahan Legal Aid Office would be able to offer universal aid. The document clearly demonstrates that if the Australian people understood the purpose of this Bill they would not support it. This is clearly a reason why all honourable members ought to support the amendment proposed by the Opposition. It would lead to an inquiry which might give us the sort of scheme that would lead to a legal system which gives genuine equality. I plead with honourable members to agree to the proposal put by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) because it is only in this way that we will get what members are asking for. I believe it is important to the totality Australian people and to the respect of the legal system which we all uphold for the legal aid tem that we implement to be one which will genuinely give this quahty. I believe, as was set out in the report on legal aid by the Law Founthe dation of New South Wales, that the reason have this legal aid system is that it was proposed and in operation, quite unconstitutionally, before any of the substantial inquiries were initiated. Debate interrupted. NA Political Prisoners in Indonesia-Schoo l Cadet Corps-Defence",105
237,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"It being half past ten p.m., in accordance with the order of the House of 11 July 19741 propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",106
238,Mr LAMB,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I wish to speak not as a supporter of the Government but as an individual member of Parhament. I wish to speak on the matter of political rights around the world and in Indonesia in particular. It is a tragedy that around the world most countries which are members of the United Nations are bound by the Declaration of Human Rights, yet there are violations of those rights to various degrees of incidence in more than a hundred of the member countries. There are many allegations, proofs and admissions of persecution and torture of political prisoners and the detention of prisoners without trial. Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union, Spain, South Korea, Uganda, Argentina and Brazil are among the countries with long records of violations of human rights. The world looks with hope, some countries with suspicion, at the mass release of pohtical prisoners in South Vietnam, Greece, Portugal and Mozambique. Those countries, as are all countries, are under watch to see that those freed are not replaced by the imprisonment of others. I wish to use my time tonight to direct an appeal to President Suharto on behalf of the victims of mass arrests, many of whom continue to languish in gaols and camps throughout Indonesia. The first of October 1975 will mark the tenth anniversary of the dramatic events which brought the present Government of Indonesia to power and triggered off one of the most terrible massacres of this century. It will also mark the tenth anniversary of the associated mass arrests, many of whose victims continue to languish in gaols and camps throughout of the Indonesia. President Suharto's 'new order' government, which succeeded the government of sysPresident Sukarno in the aftermath of the coup and counter-coup, has some important achievements to its credit. It ended the raging inflation of late Sukarno years and wound up Sukarno's we trouble making confrontation with Malaysia. It negotiated Indonesia's return to membership of the United Nations and re-established cordiality with its neighbour states. It has been consistently concerned for stable relations with this country and it has achieved an impressive rate of economic growth in recent years although there is much argument about the advantage of that for the great mass of Indonesian people, for fast growth has been accompanied by a sharp aggravation of inequalities. But the Suharto Government continues to bear the legacies of its birth, in particular the shame of a large number of untried political prisoners. It is difficult to know the exact number of pohtical prisoners or Tapols, as they are known, in Indonesia. On 16 July 1974 an editorial in the Jakarta newspaper Sihar Harapan stated that according to officialfiguresthere were more than 35 000 pohtical prisoners in Indonesia. On the basis of information available in all parts of the Repubhc, in Sumatra, Java, Bah, Sulawesi, the Malaccas and Irian Jaya, Amnesty International claim that more than 55 000 untried pohtical prisoners remain currently in detention. I seek leave to incorporated in Hansard 2 tables, the first indicating the yearly release of Tapols since 1966, which gives a guide to the number of Tapols originally taken, and the second indicating the numbers admitted by the Indonesian authorities as still under detention and showing the 3 classifications of Tapols.",106

The trend to increasingly harsh repression reached a chmax after the riots which took President place when the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Tanaka, visited Jakarta in January 1974. riots provided the Government with a pretext gaohng dozens of Indonesia's most prominent lawyers, academics and student leaders-peopl who had spoken out critically in the previous months-and for closing down 11 of the counrefused try's most independent newspapers. those critics remain in gaol and all of those newspapers remain banned. Thus, many of the civilian intellectuals who were vigorous supporters of the Suharto Government in its early years are now silenced critics. Independent trade unions are non-existent and the courageous voices of those who spoke up in those early years to remind theh countrymen of the plight of tens of thousands of political prisoners and theh families are scarcely ever heard in public. One of those gaoled last year was Buyung Nasution, a lawyer and the director of the legal aid bureau, who had sought to advise and deof fend the civtirightsof so many Indonesians who were victims of the purges. I must congratulate the Indonesian Government and express my mandants thanks that that gentleman has just been in released after. 18 months of detention without trial. It is hoped that that is a sign of progress the Indonesian Government, and I hope that Buyung Nasution will be able to practise quite years ago. freely after his release, without restriction, to assist people to exercise their human rights.

In today's world of atrocities people too easily become accustomed to continuing reports of cruel and inhuman treatment to human beings of whom they know little.

243,Mr HUNT,ADJOURNMENT,"On behalf of the great number of parents and boys in the electorate of Gwydir, I want to make a special plea to the Government to reconsider the reintroduction of cadet training in schools. I have received a great number of letters from parents. I have conveyed those letters to the Minister of Defence (Mr Morrison). I personally support the review of the decision that was taken by the Government, apparently on the advice of the Chiefs of Staff but against the advice of a further report that was made available to the Government. A large number of young boys at high schools, private schools and elsewhere have expressed a great concern that the Government has taken this decision. No doubt it was taken against a background of economic difficulties and of shortage offinanceto provide a continuation of this training. But clearly the cadet system has provided a tremendous discipline of training. It has given very many boys at schools an opportunity to learn something of the basics of military training. Those of us who can remember the last war wtil recall that a great number ofthose boys who had gone through cadet training were advantaged when they enlisted to serve theh country and saw service in the last war. At least they had basic training. When they went into formal mUitary training, they had an advantage over those who had not had cadet training. I wish to read to the House a letter I received from the headmaster at the Moree High School. It is dated 9 September 1975 and is addressed to me. The letter reads: Dear Mr Hunt, I would be grateful if you could forward this letter test andregretto the Minister of Defence at the phasing out of the Cadet Corps. Moree High School has only had a unit for the past two years but the participating has been excellent indeed. Unimagined leadership qualities have been revealed in some of the boys and the school has been particularly behaviour as a unit; as Lt Cl Tilley the CO of 2 Cadet Bde would confirm. Parents of boys in the Cadet Corps here at Moree High have expressed their dismay at the prospect of having the unit disbanded and have expressed their gratitude for what the Cadet life has done for their boys. We nave all been particularly pleased about the change in emphasis from the military to the adventure-type training for boys and were looking forward to the added experience such uaining would give them. In an isolated country town such as Moree there is no alternative to a Cadet unit to give the boys the experience to engage in bushcraft, canoeing, cliff-climbing and the like when you are situated on the plains, as you well know. The argument that defence moneys could better be spent elsewhere is probably very vahd-bu t why must the moneys be part of the defence vote? As a High School Principal who believes he has the welfare of our youth at heart, permit me to say that the value to the country of such an organisation as the Cadet Corps cannot be measured in terms of a relatively paltry sum of Slum compared with Budget deficit of $2,800m. Surely the interested youth of Australia should be considered. In the case of our school, there have been quite a few Aboriginal boys members of our Cadet Unit-and that is still the case-wh o have gained considerable stature amongst their peers and this has more than assisted in their being accepted as 'boys' instead of being known as 'aboriginals'. Here in Moree that sort of thing is what the school is trying desperately to achieve. I could go on, but I feel the school's point has been made, and I would ask that you, Mr Minister, might consider alternative methods of ensuring that such a worthwhile youth organisation may be permitted to continue-if even in a different form such as the Australian Government financing the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme. The letter is signed by Mr I. R. Hodge who is the principal of the Moree High School. The letter is an unemotional plea to the Minister for Defence and to the Government. It is a considered plea. I know that it is supported by very many parents in the Moree district and in other parts of my electorate. If the Government is not prepared to re-establish and to support the cadet corps, as we have known it, I would like to know what it is going to provide in its place. We have a wonderful youth in this country. We have the energy of youth. Young people are looking for opportunities for training, for comradeship, in service. The cadet corps and its camps have provided an outlet for them. These are outlets which they otherwise would never have achieved. In some cases, it has provided boys from underprivileged homes the opportunity to travel to other parts of the State, to go into camps, to see other parts of New South Wales if not of Australia, to train together and to feel as though they are playing a worthwhUe part. They of pro- know that in the event of an attack on this country they at least wtil have some basic training to enable them to try to defend it. effect it has had on the boys I suppose that it is true to say that we are not facing imminent attack. But who would be bold proud of their efforts and their enough to say and to predict that Australia, with all its riches, its space, and everything that it has to offer, will remain and will go into history unchallenged. I would not predict that. If it did happen, it would be the firsttimein the history of mankind that a country with such attributes would not have had its shores a battleground. Let us hope that that never happens. Perhaps one of the ways to ensure that we are secure is to make sure that we have defence preparedness and that we have a body of young people who have been encouraged to train and to prepare themselves for service, should that service be required. So often we debate issues regarding social welfare and a whole range of other matters in this Parhament. But I wonder whether we give enough consideration to the security of Australia as such. I have always beUeved that the cadet corps provided a very sound foundation for the security of this country because at least it gave a lot of young boys going school the opportunity to learn something about mUitary training. It gave them some inspiration to serve this country, if ever they were called upon to do so. The decision with respect to cadet training was a tragic one. I would hope that the Government would reconsider this decision. If it will not, if there is no alternative, I think that this will be disaster for Australia. I make that special plea in the least emotional tones that I can make it. I would hope that the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) wtil take the plea of the principal of the Moree High School into account in his reply.",109
244,Mr STEWART,ADJOURNMENT," I respond, I hope, to the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) in the same way in which he made his speech, unemotionaUy. As Minister for Tourism and Recreation I happen to be charged with the responsibUity for youth affairs. I believe that the $10m to $1 lm which we have been spending on the cadet units can be better spent throughout the community in training our youth- I mean both boys and girls-in leadership, discipline, adventure. We can get better value out of our $10m to $1 lm by perhaps helping such organisations as Outward Bound, the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, the Surf Life Saving Association of Austraha and Youth Hostels Association of Austraha. We can offer this money to the whole of the youth of the community, not just to 5 per cent of the ehgible youth in Austraha and not only to 16 per cent of the schools in Austraha. UnemotionaUy, I believe that the cadet system in Austraha did offer something to those young men who participated. Surprisingly enough, $10m to $ 11m was not giving us value. Something like 33 000 out of 630 000 youths of the age group involved were participating in the cadet units. I agree entirely that young people of this day, of yesteryear, or even further back, need some sort of direction, training and discipline. Above aU, I believe that they still Uke to be led. But from where I stand now I see a better investment of $ 10m or $ 1 lm than we were getting out of the army cadets in the schools throughout Ausualia. I listened to the letter which was written by the principal of the Moree Boys High School. I feel that his attitude is one that should be followed by a lot of principals of boys' high schools. I titink that if the honourable member for Gwydir reads that letter again he will find that the principal of that High School is saying what I am trying to say now. We cannot aim at only a segment of the young to people of Australia. If we want a good Australian I firmly beheve that the young people in our schools should be given the opportunity to see, to search, to know and to learn how to be Austrahans. They should take their chance in Austraha. At all times they should be under some type of discipline and control, but particularly be under good leadership from our school teachers, parents and adults.",110
245,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"I had not planned to take part in this adjournment debate but I feel that some of the things which have been said tonight requhe following up. Some of the impUcations are not pleasant. In a way, the Government and the Opposition have changed theh stance on defence. They are both talking now not in terms of forward defence which was better whtie we could envisage it, but which has been abandoned not through our choice but through force of circumstances. They talk now rather in terms of continental defence. This imphes that we may have to fight in Austraha. If it does not imply this, then our whole defence system is meaningless. Sure, it wtil be nice to have ah forces, naval forces and rocket forces which can keep an enemy at some distance. But aU of us know in our hearts that without the assistance of powerful aUies overseas we cannot hope to do that. It may be that we would have tofightin Austraha. One hopes that we will not, but to guarantee that we will not would be irresponsible. In those circumstances we need disciplined manpower and we need it in big numbers. It is quite reasonable for our forces to concentrate on fire power and the things which it hopes wtil prevent a disaster in Austraha. But we need more than that. If this is so we have to be thinking in terms of 20 or 30 years. If we mobilise for defence the population up to the age of 50 yearsthat would be a minimum-the n we may have to train them 30 years in advance. What the Government should be doing now is preparing forces for an emergency which could be 30 years ahead. If we do not do that now we will never do it because the opportunity is irretrievable. I put it that if we have changed our fundamental concepts of defence-and we have changed themthen we should also be changing our fundamental concepts of manpower. What is needed is not so much fighting skills, because lighting skills change, but the human skills of being able to live in discipline, of being able to live away from habitation, of being able to hve in the field and of being able to move in accordance with a disciplined and set plan. These are unpleasant things, but a government which does not face up to an unpleasant reahty will, I think, be betraying Australia. I am not trying to put this forward as a pohcy from our side of the House. I am not in a position to do so. I am not trying to blame the Government. That would not be the right thing to do at the present moment in this context. In my view, the changed concept of continental defence which we have now adopted makes necessary, as a corollary, universal training from the age of 18 or 20 for a couple of years. In my view, it is not so much a training in anything more than elementary marksmanship and in the use of small arms as far asfightingis concerned; what is needed is the training to hve in the field and in accordance with disciplines. I am not putting this forward as something on behalf of my Party- I am not empowered or entitled to do that-bu t I think the best solution may well be 2 years in a labour force in the field and away from home for all Austrahan youth from now on until we get some kind of better international security. Unless we do this we willfindourselves irretrievably",110

249,Mr UREN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the right honourable pubUc member's question is as follows: Under the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act 1974 I may, in consultation with an appropriate Minister of a State, approve programs relating to: Urban Expansion and Redevelopment; Area Improvement, being urban and regional improvement and rehabilitation; Sewerage; Water Supply; and Restoradon, preservation and improvement of landscapes and buildings of special significance. Financial assistance by way of loan or otherwise may be provided on this basis to: an authority of a state; a local governing body; or any body corporate constituted for purposes other than the acquisition of gain by its individual members. Grants have been made to individual groups who satisfy these legislative requirements under one program only-the National Estate Program. Financial assistance under all other programs I administer are made to authorities of a state or local governing bodies. The National Estate Program commenced in 1973-74 under the legislative authority Then as now advertisements calling for applications for these grants are placed in the national press. These grants were also advertised in the handbook entitled 'Australian Government Assistance to Local Government Projects' published by my Department. They have again been advertised in the subsequent pubUcation of my Department entitled 'Australian Government Assistance to Local Projects'. Apart from this direct advertising the National Estate Program receives much general publicity in the media. In 1974-75 alone in excess of 1100 appUcations for grants under this program were received and processed. All applications received are considered the National Estate, who make recommendation to my colleague the Minister for Environment and myself. Agreement of the appropriate State Minister is also obtained before the final projects to be funded are selected. As with all of the programs administered by my Department the monies involved are transferred from the Australian Treasury to the appropriate State Treasury who control the flow of funds to the recipient in accordance with normal Treasury principles. The total amount spent under this program in 1973-74 and 1974-75 respectively was $2,226,900 and $7,207,850. South Australian Land Commission Mr Wilson asked the Minister for Urban and Salisbury Regional Development, upon notice: (1) Has the Australian Government made funds avaUable Port Adelaide to the South Australian Government for use by the South Stirling/Meadows Australian Land Commission for the purchase of land. (2) If so, how much land has been purchased or acquired Willunga by the Commission. (3) Where is the land so purchased or acquired situated. (4) What price was paid for the land. (5) How much other land has the Commission decided to purchase or acquire: (6) Where is that land situated. (7) Did the Commission obtain an impact statement as to the consequences of the likely change in use of the land so purchased or acquired or intended to be purchased or together, may be acquired; if not, why not (8) If an impact statement was obtained, wtil it be made before any further land is purchased or acquired; if not, why not",119
250,Mr UREN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is: (1) Yes. Under the Land Commissions (Fmaneial Assistance) Act 1973 for the 1973-74 program and the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act for the 1974-75 program, loans have been made to the South Australian Government in respea of the purchase and development by the South Australian Land Commission ofland for urban use. Under the same Acts grants have been made for the purchase ofland for regional open space. (2) In 1973-74 the South Australian Land Commission acquired 1226 hectares ofland for urban use. In 1974-75 the South Australian Land Commission incurred expenditures which are subject to financial assistance in respect of the following acquisitions: 1711 hectares ofland for urban use; 1022 hectares ofland for regional open space. (3) Land acquisitions during the 1973-74 financial year were located in the following local government areas: of Appropriation Act No. 2. Land Land for for urban open L.G.A. use space ha ha Meadows 166 Nil Noarlunga 526 NU Tea Tree GuUy 400 Nil Salisbury 34 Nil MunnoPara 100 NU by the Interim Committee on The 1711 hectares ofland acquired for urban purposes and the 1022 hectares acquired for open space in 1974-75 were distributed as foUows: Land Land for for urban open L.G.A. use space ha ha Marion 117 NU Meadows 20 NU MunnoPara 507 5 (Question No. 1882) Noarlunga 246 436 Tea Tree GuUy 673 NU 146 57 West Torrens 1 Nil 1 NU NU 143 CampbeUtown/East Torrens . . . . NU 166 NU 194 Mitcham NU 21 (4) The average price per hectare paid by the South Australian Land Commission in respect of 1973-74 acquisitions was $8,456.50. As at 30 June, expenditures incurred by the South Australian Land Commission involved land acquisitions at die following average costs for the 1974-75 financial year $7,717 per hectare for urban use; $2,807 per hectare for land forregionalopen space. (5) Under the Urban and Regional Development (Finanwhere cial Assistance) Act I approve programs before financial asdo sistance under the Act is made available. However, proplanning grams are approved on a year by year basis and while future projections are available in relation to the expected activities of the South Australian Land Commission, I not yet approved a firm program.for 1975-76. Discussions are taking place between Australian and South Australian Government officers in regard to future land acquisitions and the location andtimingof development. In these circumstances it much land the South Australian Land Commission has decided to acquire. (6) Because of the strict control Zoning and the limited prescribed living areas within the Adelaide Hills, the bulk of future acquisitions and development is likely to take place in the areas designated 'residenwhich tial development' by the MetropoUtan Adelaide Develop1974. ment Plan. These areas include the Southern Region, Northern Corridor and the North East. Development in each of these regions will be imponandy determined by strategic and environmental planning considerations which mission is investigating. (7) The development of environmental impact assessment in the planning process for programs such as the Land mission's Program is a common responsibUity for both the Australian and State Governments. Environmental impact assessment must be seen as pan of the total planning process and it should be recognised that environmental considerations are taken mto account in assessing the impact of Australian Government programs and projects environmental impact statement may not specificaUy be required by the Minister for Environment in particular instances. An important goal in the Land Commission program exert a beneficial influence on the urban environment suring, through pubUc ownership ofland, that development proposals take full cognisance of all social costs Programs of Land Commissions pose peculiar problems in relation to ^environmental protection, confidentiality, need to reduce speculative activity in the land market, and the frequent necessity for expediency in decisions on acquisitions. For these reasons, Land Commissions will be expected to ensure that environmental assessments are integrated into planning decisions but they may not be required to prepare impact statements on acquisitions. Discussions have also been held with Land Commissions and Urban Land CouncUs on environmental aspects proposed programs, and with the Department of Environment on the environmental assessment requirements clearance of, these programs. The development of a generalised two stage approach to assessment of the environmental impUcations of urban land development proposals, firstly at the acquisition phase in relation to broader strategies and secondly at the more localised development phase, is a significant objective. In South Australia, lands acquired by the Land Commission have been in areas zoned for urban or future use under the Development Plan for MetropoUtan Adelaide. Decisions regarding land use in this Plan have been ate and careful, and I understand that environmental issues were considered in the formulation of the Plan. (8) See answer to 7. Generally, I would expect would be opportunities for public participation in environmentaUy sound planning within the context of overall metroIt politan strategic planning and that comprehensive planning assessments incorporating detaUed environmental considerCommittee ations would be made avaUable for public consideration and comment. The honourable member wtil appreciate that land acquisition is involved, it is not always possible to this. However, I would point out that, in terms of strategic acquisitions for urban purposes being undenaken some by the South Australian Land Commission are in areas which are zoned for development under the existing Metrohave poUtan Adelaide Development Plan which the pubUc has had opportunity to consider for a number of years.
