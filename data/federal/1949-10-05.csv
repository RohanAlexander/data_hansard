1,Mr DEPUTY SFBAKSB,Unknown,"Mr J. J. Clark) took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. MB. A. A. OALWELL, M.P.",10
2,Mr RUSSELL,Unknown,"I am confident that all members regret the temporary indisposition of the Minister for Information. Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to a statement in the Melbourne Herald of yesterday that the Minister for Information, who went into the Canberra Community Hospital suffering from strain, was "" very well"" ? Is there anything sinister in the reported statement of the Hospital Superintendent, Dr L. W. Nott, who, I understand, will be a candidate at the next general election, that the Minister was merely resting for a couple of days, but that he would like to keep him in hospital longer?",10
3,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The Minister for Information is, as the honourable for Grey has said, in hospital. On Monday, the Minister left Melbourne when he was suffering from a cold or incipient influenza. He developed a very high temperature on board the aircraft and, on arrival at Canto berra, he was sent to hospital for and examination. Dr Nott told me that Minister had a very high temperature and I gathered that he thought an attack of influenza was likely. Nott expected that, with a couple of rest, the Minister would be all right. Dr scheme ? Nott later told me that the Minister was much better and that his temperature was down. I saw the Minister yesterday morning. He showed very great improvecivilian ment. I am afraid that the Opposition cannot expect to enjoy his absence from the House for long. He will be back soon fighting fit again. I do not think there is anything sinister about the matter. in my announcement. I am sure that Dr Nott, despite his present political opinions, will see that the ter is well cared for. GERMANY.",11
4,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"Is the Minister for External Affairs in a position to give the House any information regarding reports stated to have come from sources outside Germany which indicate that Russia is about to form an East German - Communist-controlled government as a - counter to the new ""West German federal 'government at Bonn?",11
5,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"It has been clear for some time that such a move was brewing. The protest by the. Soviet Union against the formation of the federation of Western - Germany, which was made two or three days ago, is regarded as a preliminary to such a move in Eastern Germany. There is no news later than the press >news this morning, but it looks quite - probable that such a move will be made. EDUCATION . NA SCHEME.",11
6,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH SCHOLARSHIP,"Following the recent announcement by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction of the Government's intention to establish a permanent Commonwealth scholarship scheme at university level to commence in 1951, member fears have arisen in the minds of some students who are at present attending universities under the Government's civilian assistance scheme. They are wondering what their position will be under the new scheme. Will they be able continue their studies at the university continue to receive assistance, or will the the present scheme be terminated upon the introduction of the new scheme? Can the Minister clear up that matter and so Dr allay the fears of students who are days receiving benefits under the present",11
7,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH SCHOLARSHIP,"Student s who are at present receiving benefits under the assistance scheme need have no fears whatever regarding their future. The purpose of the new scheme is to enlarge the existing civilian assistance scheme in the directions that I indicated Students at receiving benefits will, after 1951, Minisreceive somewhat more liberal benefits under the new scheme. ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY. PRIZE MONEY: PARTICIPANTS.",11
8,Mr HAMILTON,COMMONWEALTH SCHOLARSHIP,"Some time ago the Minister for Defence informed the House that he intended to set up a committee to inquire into the payment of prize money to members and ex-members of the Royal Australian Navy. Has that committee been set up? If so, can the Minister inform the House of the progress of any inquiries that have been made up to date?",11
9,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH SCHOLARSHIP,"The matter that the honourable member has mentioned was raised on a previous occasion by another - honourable member. The position is that the amount of prize money that will be available has not yet been finally determined. That decision will be made in London, and until such time as the Government receives detailed information of the amount of money that will be available the distribution of prize money cannot be proceeded with in this country. NA INDUSTRY.",11
10,Dr GAHA,DECENTRALIZATIO N OF,"Is the Prime Minister aware tha* the British Overnment is expending the sum of £225,00©,#®0 on the establishment of five mew cities for the purpose of giving effect to its policy of decentralizatioia of industries, particularly industries associated with defence? Does the Australian Government contemplate applying a similar policy either .by direct subsidizaitiom iof imdmstiry <ov im co-operation with the States? If not, will the right homwrahile gentleman oomsider setting up suitable machinery for the selection - of 'towtas as sites for new industrial a-neas away from ibhe coast, and subsidize the establishment of such areas? Will he consider .the advisability ©f commenting .upon schemes of that kind in his policy speech ?",12
11,Mr CHIFLEY,DECENTRALIZATIO N OF,"I am aware of - the plans prepared 'by the British GovernUMursued meirt IPOT the d«ce*mtrali«atioii of industry .jment. in ""fce United Estgdcwn and tihe seMaaag np of in'dusiferial .cities away from lesristimg industrial oentres.

That principle was recognized by the Ausservmoes. tralian iGovernment .some years ago when it set up the Secondary Industries Comso mission, of which Mr I . K. Jensen chairman. Our objective in that instance was noi only to encourage existing indusveraimeai't tries to (extend <their activities to oountry .areas to (the greatest possible degree also to encourage the leaders of industry to establish industries away from the cities. Some measure of success has been achieved in that regard. I refer in this eonnexiioit to the BuafingtoaiL Mails .and also to the spintming lOiEganizatLora that moved ©Tit to iRiitherford in .tifane heavy industry ainea - around Nteweastie .and Mainland.

We have succeeded in encouraging some decentralization of industry. The secondary industries division of the Divisioaa of Industrial Development has pursued that policy on behalf of the Government, but there is no power to compel .anybody to do anything. We can only - offer such assistance and advice as is possible. Where possible, Commonwealth owned buildings have been leased to private enterprise .and in some cases an optiora to purchase at a reasonable price has been granted. In addition to that .the Government through the new organization that has heen establislied in association with the Department of Immigration, is asking a mumber of leaders of industry .to be represented on au immi.gratMin coramcilfso .as to enable .an examination to be made of the possibilities of fau'itbier .decentr.alizatioin of industry.

' MT. CHIFLEY - The Australian Goat jwesent has ino ipower -.over the - dastrdtafeion iof petrol to essenitia'l or hut other services. The Go^errameoait has power to determine how - much petrol shall he imported, ibut :such petrol, oace it has - entered the country, - comes nm-der tthe tooaubro'l of .oil 'companies, which - may 'dteeide to 'whom it shall !be provided, aoxl - as® iof ithe garage pTiOjprietors, who may dieeide to whom it shall be sold. I very ranch regret that cir-cumstances hawe arisen - which a'lcrw ithe ipreseasrt inequit.dma'Me distribution iof petnol to take place. In addition to the essential services meni t tioned by the honourable member for Biaeh - services as 'auxiliary power popuplants in Western Australia are also effected. .The .generat-ors in iRerth ibroke down, and although a great - deal <of .petrol is being used for non-essential purposes, it has not been possible to obtain sumcient petrol to enable the' auxiliary power plants in that city to produce power for industrial! purposes. That position shows how inequitable the present situation can be. There should be a definite scheme of distribution!. In addition to such essential services as auxiliary power plants there are also the need's of many primary producers to be considered. - Under' the law, however, owing to the Interpretation of the Constitution by the High Court of Australia, the Australian Government at present has no poweT to control the distribution of petrol. The High Court has held that the States have complete power to control petrol distribution, and the Australian Government ha'"" put. the position very clearly to the States', aud has surpp'liedi them with all the infoimation available on the subject. The States reached a decision last week. Certain States are prepared to ref er the necessary power to the Commonwealth, whilst others are prepared to pass certaiin legislation, as they recognize at last that the present system is inequitable. I shall examine the matter that the honourable gentlem-aii' has raised, but I must emphasize that under present conditions' the distribution of petrol rests entirely with the dastrihutors and tlti companies themselves, who alone have the power to decide whether ambulances, auxiliary power plants, primary producers or other essential users shall receive petrol or not. I hope to be able to mwkt! a further statement on this matter, probably later this week. SOCIAL SERVICES..",12
12,Mrs BLACKBURN,DECENTRALIZATIO N OF,"I ask the Minisform ter representing the Minister for Social Services what provision is made for - care of widows and children of hntmiperience grants' who have died since enteringAuscattle traEa? If there are young children mother cannot go to work, and she is - eligible' to receive the widow's pension. She must apply for a pension from her native land. WilT the Government arrange to have an interim widow's pension paid in swell' cases soasto provide for the - of the widows andchi Mren until help - arrives' from overseas",13
13,Mr HOLLOWAY,DECENTRALIZATIO N OF,"The Department of Social Services, co-operates with the Department of Immigration i u connection with the matter raised by the honourable member. If,, after leaving the reception camps,, the women mentioned, should suffer the. disaster of losing their husbands, they would be eligible not only for widows' pensions but also for other social services benefits, that are enjoyed by the people of this country. I poiut out that some of the migrants now in reception, canips will be released and placed in industry this week. Eor the period they are in reception camps migrants are provided with' food, shelter, medical attention and other care, and the Department, of Immigration defrays expenses associated with the death aud burial of migrants whilst in those camps. Presumably the honourable member is concerned about how quickly women migrants may obtain the widows' pension if their husbands should 1 die aud they are left destitute. Under existing provisions, if the husband of a migrant was killed while working, in industry,, the widow would immediately become eligible for social services benefits similarly to native-born Australians in such circumstances. 1 NORTHERN TERRITORY. 1 MEANS OBTBAJTSFOBT.",13
14,Mr BLAIN,DECENTRALIZATIO N OF,"The question that I direct to the Prime Minister relates to the proposed expenditure of large sums of money in the construction of longdistaaiceroads in the Northern Territory for the transport of cattle. I do not now referto the already successful transport of eattEe over distances of 250 to SOO miles ini the Alice Springsdisirict. Willthe right honourable' geatlemam in the Bouse who were his advisers m this matter ? What is their status in the the cattleIndustry, aind what actual exhave they haidi of theearrtaige of hy road for long distances in the the Northern Territory? If they have not not in faet the statusof western cattlemen, wi-H the Prime Minister confer with Mr Fletcher, of western Queensland, who made a factual examination of the situation' in 1930 with M i . Payne-, amd care also' with the owners aind managers of cattle stations who have had' the experience of the faolTHre' of road! trainsto carry cattle successfully for lengthy distances and do not intend to again use that means of transportation?",13
15,Mr CHIFLEY,DECENTRALIZATIO N OF,"I know that the honourable member for the Northern Territory has previously advocated the extension of the railway system in the Northern Territory. There is a very wide difference of opinion on this subject. Whilst some people contend that additional roads should be constructed in the Northern Territory to provide for the cartage of cattle for long distances hy road vehicles, others contend that the position would best be met by the extension of the railway facilities. Another school of thought favours a combination of both rail and road transport of cattle in the Northern Territory. I can understand why previous governments during the past 25 years have not made a decision about this matter. When I presided over a large conference of people who were supposed to know something about these matters, particularly with relation to the Northern Territory, I found that there was a very wide diversity of opinion about the best method of transportation of cattle. In the light of the advice of the Cabinet snb-committee which is dealing with this matter the Government realized that, quite apart from the merits or demerits of the respective means of transportation, it would take a long period of time to lay down long stretches of railways in the Northern Territory, because the materials necessary would not be available for many years. This Government is anxious to develop that area as quickly as possible. I have discussed this matter with two men in high positions, closely associated with the cattle industry and meat production generally. I discussed the matter with one of them whilst T. was in London, and with the other in Australia. They both agreed that, in view of the physical difficulties involved, the Government should proceed with the construction of long-distance roads in the Northern Territory if it desired to further its plan for the developfer ment of that area for cattle production. Opinions have been expressed that certain roads may be built, but to construct very long stretches of road would be physically impossible. If we waited for such roads to be conr structed, the development of the Northerns Territory would proceed very slowly indeed. Some people agree with the honourable member's contention regardring the construction of railways, but others disagree with him. Many expertsbelieve that some railway constructionshould be undertaken and that otherareas should be catered for by road transport. Differing opinions have been expressed about the desirability of sealing such roads a3 are constructed. TheCabinet sub-committee includes the Minister for Works and Housing and the Minister for the Interior, both of whom know the Northern Territory very well.",14
16,Mr MCEWEN,DECENTRALIZATIO N OF,Is not the Minister for Transport also a member?,14
17,Mr CHIFLEY,DECENTRALIZATIO N OF,"Yes . The sub-committee also includes the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and myself.. In addition, a departmental committee has been established under the chairmanship of the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, Mr MCLaren, to assist the Government in this matter. That, committee has sought the advice of per sons who are closely associated with thecattle raising industry. I want to make it clear to the honourable member that the construction of long stretches-of railw.""within a reasonable time is physicallyimpossible, and that, havingregard toall the circumstances, we must adopt the most rapid form of development available to us. HOSPITALS: STAFF SHORTAGES.",14
18,Mr DALY,DECENTRALIZATIO N OF,"Will the Minister for Labour and National Service statewhether it is true that the work of thealready over-taxed staffs of our infectious diseases hospitals has been increased astho result of the infantile paralysis epidemic? If so, will the Minister ascertain whether it is possible for the Commonwealth Employment Service to transsome of the new Australian women-, migrants to those hospitals to assist the staffs during this very trying period?'",14
19,Mr HOLLOWAY,DECENTRALIZATIO N OF,"Yes. . It is a well known fact that the staffs of our hospitals are over-worked.. Indeed, they. were over-worked before the outbreak of the recent epidemic of infantile paralysis. It is also true that something has already been done and that a good deal more can and will be done to help them. Recently, an investigation was made to ascertain how many women migrants in reception camps had had hospital nursing or medical orderly experience, either in their own country or in the camps in which they have been living. Some have already been selected and sent to hospitals. An urgent call was made for assistance to meet the extraordinary circumstances brought about by the infantile paralysis epidemic which is now raging and during the week before last, twelve migrant women were sent to the infectious diseases hospital at Fairfield, Melbourne. The matron of that hospital was very grateful for their assistance. We have notified the branches of the Commonwealth Employment Service in all States where such hospitals are established of the possibility ing assistance in this way and we shall send additional women migrants from the various camps, if it is possible to do so. INTERNATIONA L AFFAIRS. SOVIET-YUGOSLAV TENSION.",14
20,Mr WHITE,DECENTRALIZATIO N OF,"Has the Minister for External Affairs been officially advised of the denunciation of the pacts of friendship between Russia and Yugoslavia, and also tliose between Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia? Has he any information relative to reports about the massing of Russian armoured divisions and bomber and fighter squadrons on the Yugoslav border? Will he shortly make a statement from the advices that he has received from British other sources about what all those moves portend? Is the House likely to have opportunity to discuss international affairs before the Parliament rises for forthcoming general election ?",15
21,Dr EVATT,DECENTRALIZATIO N OF,The honourable member for Fawkner asked a similar question last Friday.,15
22,Mr WHITE,DECENTRALIZATIO N OF,Muc h has happened since then.,15
23,Dr EVATT,DECENTRALIZATIO N OF,"What the.moves portend is quite clear. A state of acute tension exists between Russia and the countries which are accurately called the satellites of Russia in eastern Europe on the one hand, and Yugoslavia on the other hand. Pressure tactics are being adopted in relation to Yugoslavia, including the denunciation of one treaty and alliance and friendship after another, first by Russia, and then by the other members of the eastern group. The position is quite clear, and it has been shown at the meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations at Lake Success, that there is a definite state of tension between the countries to which I have referred. Wliether it is likely to go further is just a question of calculation. It does not seem likely that it will lead to war. The General Assembly of the United Nations is now meeting, and if there is any. further development, I have no doubt that the whole matter will come before that body. Nothing will please me more than a debate on international affairs either of securto-day or any other day. TRUSTEESHIP TERRITORIES. NEW GUINEA-NAURU . MT. DUTHIE - Can the Minister for External Affairs indicate the substance of the complaint by China against Australia before the General Assembly of the United Nations at Lake Success in relation to the trusteeship territories of New Guinea, and Nauru and the treatment of Chinese in those areas? Has the Minister auy information about the attitude of the Church towards Australia's policy in the handling of the affairs of New Guinea since the war?",15
24,Dr EVATT,DECENTRALIZATIO N OF,"-The existing Nationalist and Government of China has repeated in the General Assembly of the United an Nations the same kind of charge or complaint as that which was made before the the Trusteeship Council several months ago. One complaint seems to be about the law of New Guinea which does not permit the unrestricted immigration of Chinese to that territory. Another complaint is about the curfew which the Administrator of Nauru has found it necessary to introduce. The territories of New Guinea and Nauru come under the administration of my colleague, the Minister for External Territories. The view of Australia on those matters has been stated clearly and explicitly. It is that the dominating purpose of the administration of New Guinea and Nauru is the welfare of the native inhabitants of those territories. All administrations in New Guinea and Nauru .have considered that the unrestricted additions of ""Chinese or other foreigners would destroy the tribal >and village life. The Chinese are in Nauru by agreement with the Nationalist Government of China, and the conditions under which they went to that territory for the purpose of producing phosphate - were approved by the very government that has made the complaint to the United Nations. The honourable member for Wilmot has referred to the views of church leaders about our administration of New Guinea. I noticed a few days ago that a bishop of the Church of England has emphasized the same principle as that upon which the policy of the Australian Government has been based in administering the territories. That principle is the welfare of the native inhabitants, and the introduction of Chinese must be subservient to it. That is the policy which the Minister for External Territories has applied, and I have no doubt that when the Australian answer is given to the Chinese complaint, it will be eonVmcing. The difficulty about these international gatherings is that only the complaints that are made against Australia are given publicity. For every complaint there are a dozen statements which express approval of what Australia has done. MAIZE A ND SORGHUM.",15
25,Mr DAVIDSON,DECENTRALIZATIO N OF,"Is it true Ihat the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has advised maize and grain sorghum growers that export licences' wiill he granted for quantities up to 50 per cent, of the production for the 1949-50 season as was done in respect of the 1948-49 crop, which is now being disposed of? If so, what conditions will govern the issue of the export licences and will such licences be issued to co-operative organizations which sell in the interests of the growers?  has indicated that export licences will be granted for up to 50 per cent, of the sorghum crop and that licences will be available to growers' co-operative groups. TRADE WITH RUSSIA.",16
26,Mr BEAZLEY,DECENTRALIZATIO N OF,"I direct a question to the Treasurer concerning trade with Russia and the balance of payments between Australia and Russia. In 1947-48 Australia imported from Russia goods worth only £59,0S9 and exported to that country goods worth £2,858,0S8, or about 50 times the value of what we received. In 1948-49 the unbalance was even greater. Imports from Russia in that year were worth only £189 707, and exr ports to Russia were worth £12,360,186, or about 60 times the value of goods that we received. As Russia obviously does not pay for goods with goods, does Australia hold a large .and accumulating rouble balance? If not, is Russia paying in sterling and, in view of the rumours that Russia had a dollar surplus and was able to sell surplus dollars to the United Kingdom, would it be possible for the Soviet to pay some of the unbalanced trade debt in dollars? If Australia has a rouble balance, is there any immediate likelihood that it will be honoured with goods ?",16
27,Mr CHIFLEY,DECENTRALIZATIO N OF,"It is true, as the honourable member has iudicated, that Australia has had a very favourable trade balance with Russia, particularly during the last two years. That has been due to the fact that Russian commercial interests, or perhaps the Soviet Government, have been buying, wool extensively in Australia. I notice that there has .been no very great objection to receiving Russian money for our wool. Australia does not hold a special rouble balance, although Russia is, in effect, a semi-hard currency country. Russia has been able to earn considerable dollar balances in the United States of America. It has accumulated more dollars than it has been able to spend because, although the Americans had been buying considerable quantities of manganese ore and chrome from Russia, they recently denied certain capital goods to Russia. The Soviet Government then reduced the volume of manganese exports to the United States of America. However, I understand 'Chat America recently came to some arrangement with the Soviet 'Government by which considerably increased quantities of capital goods are now being exported to Russia. As a result, America is receiving once more fairly large quantities of Russian manganese ore. Australia, of course, has imported about 10,000 tons of manganese ore, which was purchased by the Broken ffill Proprietary Oompany Limited. Australia does not hold a special rouble balance. The Russian payments finally appear in our sterling balances. bave not seen any official statement on the su'bject, and I understand that Russia at one time sold surplus American dollars to the Bank of England for sterling so that it could obtain capital goods - from the United Kingdom. That is an example of the anomalies that arise out of the present currency situation. With the sterling obtained by the sale of surplus dollars, Russia was able to buy capital goods from easy currency countries. We have not .asked the Russians to pay for our wool in dollars. I cannot see that the overall positiou would be relieved if they did pay in dollars. If Russia has surplus dollars, and sells them to the Bank of England, those dollars finally get into the sterlingberra, dollar pool, so that, in the long run, we are just as well off hy getting the dollars in that way as if we received them in direct payment for our wool. I shall have a statement prepared explaining our trade relations with Russia. NA EUND.",16
28,Mr FALKINDER,SERVICES CANTEENS TRUST,"In view of the fact that grave dissatisfaction has been expressed by several ex-servicemen's organizations regarding the allocation of money from the Services Canteens Trust Fund, will the Minister for the Army prepare a statement indicating on what principle the. money is distributed, aud explaining why several recognized organizations of ex-servicemen have not yet received anything from the fund?",17
29,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES CANTEENS TRUST,"I have received no complaints from organizations of ex-servicemen, either in my capacity as Minister for the Army or as the person who administers the Services Canteens Trust Fund. I shall hawe a .statement prepared showing how the fund is .organized, and 'indicating to 'what bodies grants have been made. ELECTORAL. GENERAL ELECTION: POLITICAL BROADCASTS.",17
30,Mr LANG,SERVICES CANTEENS TRUST,"Can the Prime Minister say whether the Australian Broadcasting Control Board has finished redrafting its order on political broadcasts ? I Did the board visit Canberra to refer the order to the Government before announcing its terms? What Ministers did the board interview? Has the Government instructed the board to re-draft the order in such a way as to discriminate against any group or groups ?. ""Will the Government consider amending the act so as to exclude specifically the Communist party from access to the air on the ground of its revolutionary and unconstitutional objectives ?",17
31,Mr CHIFLEY,SERVICES CANTEENS TRUST,"I have no knowledge of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board having visited Canberra to submit anything to Ministers. I understand fhat two members of the board live in Canor have homes here, and they may have come - to Canberra to visit them. However, so far as I know, no submissions were made by the board to Ministers, unless they were made to the Postmaster General, who administers hroadcasting. When the first order was issued, the honourable member for Reid, or some other honourable member, asked a question in which the matter of Communists being given free radio time, or of radio stations being compelled to accept business from the Communist party was discussed. Before the matter was raised in this House, the Postmaster-General discussed the proposed order with me and, after consultation, it was decided that it should be referred hack to the board with a request that it be re-examined. The Postmaster General expressed his view of what he felt to be the difficulty contained in the original order. When the Postmaster General referred the order baek to the board, he may have intimated that the order in its original form might be disallowed. He asked the board to re-draft the order in terms that would he likely to meet with the approval of the Parliament. I have not had time to deal with the matter thia morning, but I understand that the board has re-drafted the order. I hope that tomorrow the Postmaster General or I will be able to indicate to the Parliament the terms of the order that the board now proposes to make. No thought has been given to amending the legislation under which the board has been set up. It is most unlikely that t.he legislation will be altered. NATIONALIZATION .",17
32,Mr TURNBULL,SERVICES CANTEENS TRUST,"Did the Attorney General say during the 1943 general election campaign that the Australian Constitution gave no general power to nationalize industry? Nothwithstanding that firm understanding, did the Minister for Air, less than two .years later, introduce legislation which, he said, was for the nationalization of the airlines? Did banking bills designed to further the Government's socialization objectives become law? Have further socialistic moves since been made ? In view of these reported. broken no-nationalization pledges of the Attorney^General, how can the right honourable gentleman give any assurance that there will be no further attempts at socialization next year?",18
33,Dr EVATT,SERVICES CANTEENS TRUST,"The honourable member for Wimmera has asked a very important question. I treat it as important. What I said is perfectly correct, and I said it again yesterday. The Australian Constitution gives no general power-and those are the important words-to the Australian Parliament to nationalize industry. There is no single legislative power to nationalize - possessed by the Parliament, unless one can point to a specific placitum of section 51 of the Constitution which deals with the subject-matter. the honourable member for Wilmot asked me a number of questions about the nationalization of businesses, the iron and steel industry and rural industries. In view of very misleading statements by bodies called constitutional leagues, which ought to know something or pretend to know something about the Constitution the sooner the trutn is known on this matter and understood generally hy the public, the better it will be. As every honourable member of this House knows, the fact is that the Commonwealth's power of nationalization must be found within section 51 of the Constitution. It is quite consistent with that section that legislation was introduced to deal with a specific subject like banking, because that is one of the specific subjects referred to in section 51. The limitation on the constitutional power in relation to banking, as determinded by the High Court, was found in another section of the Constitution. I refer to section 92. Therefore the answer that I gave is indubitably correct. The fact that specific legislation has been passed on a specific subject only proves the truth of my assertion that there must be in section 51 of the Constitution some specific head of power before the Parliament can legislate; otherwise the legislation is invalid. NA (No. 2) 1949. Message recommending appropriation In ' committee (Consideration of Governor General' s message): Motion (by Mr Chifley ) agreed toThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund sums for the purposes of financial assistance to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. Ordered'I'hat Mr Chifley and Mr Dedman do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoiiis; resolution. Bill presented by Mr Chifley, ancl Yesterday, read a first time. SECOND READING.",18
34,Mr CHIFLEY,STATES GRANTS BIL L,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.8] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to provide for the payment during the current financial year of special grants aggregating £11,054,000 to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. The payment of these grants has heen recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its sixteenth report which was tabled in Parliament yesterday. In arriving at its recommendations the commission has adopted, as it has done in past years, the principle of financial needs which, in practical terms, means that the special grants are intended to enable the recipient States, by reasonable effort, to function at standards not appreciably below those of the other States. details of the commission's calculations are set out in the sixteenth report, which I commend to the attention of honourable members. It will be noted that, in assessyear ing the grants, the commission has made a searching examination of the finances of the claimant and non-claimant States in 1947-48-the latest year for which audited figures are available-and it has derived certain standards based on the financial position and practices of the non-claimant States in that year. As in the last eight years, the commission has adopted a balanced budget standard in arriving at the initial approximation to the assessed grants. The commission has then made adjustments to these initial amounts to take account of differences as between the claimant and non-claimant States in standards of social services expenditure and in the rates of taxation and the charges of State business undertakings. The latter item is the subject of adjustment by the commission for the first time this year. The net amounts arrived at after making these adjustments aggregate £7,396,000 and represent the assessed grants for the year of review 1947-48. Tn recent years the finances of the States have deteriorated substantially between the year of review and the year of payment and the commission has, therefore, followed the practice of recommending, in addition to the grants assessed on the year of review, advance payments designed to bring the grants into line with the indispensable needs of States in the year of payment. Because of the extent . of the deterioration recent years, however, grants recomadopted. mended for payment each year have cates tended to be less than the grants subseprinciples quently assessed on that year. This has L30] left the claimant States with fairly substantial deficits. In order to meet this situation the grants recommended by.the commission this year consist of two parts. The first part represents the difference between the grants now assessed for 1947-48 and the grants actually paid in that year. The amount involved is £1,354,000 and payment of this amount is intended to recoup the States concerned for the deficiency in the grants actually paid in 1947-48. The second Full part of the grants, which amounts to £9,700,000, represents the commission's estimate of the indispensable needs of the claimant Status in the current financial 1949-50. This second part of the grants will be treated by the commission as advance payments to be finally adjusted two years hence when, in accordance with the procedure that I have described, the grants for this year will be assessed on the basis of the final audited results. Last year the special grants to the claimant States amounted to £7,450,000. The grants now recommended to meet the indispensable needs of the States, therefore, involve an increase of £2,250,000, whilst the total grants recommended involve an increase of £3,604,000 over last year of which South Australia will receive an additional £1,324,000, Western Australia an additional £2,018,000 and Tasmania an additional £262,000. In arriving at the grants recommended, the commission has taken account of the prospective shares of the claimant States in the coal strike emergency grant and the tax reimbursement grant which together should give the claimant States amounts aggregating about £3,315,000 above last year. As the special grants now proposed involve an increase this year of £3,604,000, it will he appreciated that, the total increase arising from these three payments to the claimant States in 1949-50 will be very substantial, and will amount in all to nearly £7,000,000. The Government has carefully considered the sixteenth report of the Comthe monwealth Grants Commission and has decided that the commission's recomin mendations should, as in past years, be The commission's report indithat, while adhering to the general which have been proved over the years, the commission has preserved due flexibility in its methods in order to meet changing circumstances and to further the objective of maintaining a proper relationship between the financial positions of the claimant and non-claimant States, so ensuring that all members of the federation shall be in a position to operate for the greatest benefit of the whole.

37,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Balaclava) [11.30] When progress was reported last - night the committee was discussing item Division 8 "" Other Printing and Binding"". I consider that there should be some control over the printing carried - out in connection with this Parliahonorable ment. All kinds of publications which extol the activities of Ministhere ters are being produced. They point out that some member or other is a genius and that the Government is the most wonderful that we have ever had. These productions do not give the facts, but they give half-truths and fiction. There should be some control over the expenditure of money for such purposes, because after all it is the people's money not the Labour party's that is heing spent. I read in the press this morning that there is to be a comic strip in colour produced by the Government showing Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) and, hope, some other members of his Cabinet. Is that strip to be produced at the the taxpayer or of the Labour party? shall not specify any other printing oroject, but Ministers know full well buting it that there are many hooks of the kind to which I have referred. One of the worse offenders is the Department of ceed in that strain. Labour and National Service which has produced publications that do not bear the name of the printer.",21
38,The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE, The honourable member will have to leave that matter until the - committee discusses the Estimates ing the Department of Labour and as National Service.,21
39,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,But we should know the identity of the printers of that bookThis and other productions put asbesout by the Government have no imprint. It is an offence in any of the States to produce a publication without an imprint. Why should it not he an offence when the Commonwealth does it? If I were permitted to do so under this item I could refer to other offences by the Government in that respect. An example is the booklet entitled Ten Years,21
40,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable gentleman's remarks do not relate to the proposed vote under discussion, and therefore must be made at the appropriate time in connection with the proposed votes for the departments 3 of to which he desires to refer.",21
41,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"- I concede that point, Mr Deputy Chairman. Last night the member for Reid (Mr Lang) was endeavouring to point out that, while was a great expenditure on various parliamentary committees, he desired the appointment of committees to deal with customs matters and foreign affairs. He was not permitted to proceed. 1 submit, however, that there should be a more thorough auditing of the Government's actions in respect of publications. The Government should not use the taxpayers' money to print its propaganda, which is what it is now doing in many instances. Last week I asked a question concerning a certain publication that was the produced by another department which, I under your ruling, Mr Deputy Chairman, I am not allowed to specify.

42,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Order ! The honourable gentleman must not pro,21
43,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Then I shall leave my remarks at that.,21
44,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Fawkner) [11.34] - This the last occasion during the life of this Parliament on which honourable members will have an opportunity coverto examine the vote for Parliament an institution, and I consider therefore that it is the appropriate time for us to examine the course of the Parliament during the period of its life, particularly to see whether the funds estimated to he necessary for its continuance next year are justified. I also consider it appropriate, so that the puhlic shall he fully formed on these matters, to examine whether the funds proposed are adequate for the purposes for which they are intended,- and whether the Parliament, as aa institution, is carrying out the purposes for which it is designed. At the end of the Seventeenth Parliament I considered it necessary to point to a serious decline of this Parliament as an institution, a decline that indicated that parliamentary government, as understood by the British people down through the centuries of its development, had reached a stage in Australia where its importance, influence and practice had considerably decreased. I pointed out then that the Parliament traditionally had been the allpowerful instrument. The Executive had been drawn from the Parliament in the course of the development of British parliamentary practice, was responsible to the Parliament and eventually, and from time to time, had to acknowledge the authority of the Parliament over it. 1 went on to say that such had been the decline in the conduct of this Parliament, as an institution, in the course of the Seventeenth Parliament that the Parliament itself had become a mere rubber stamp for recording the decisions of the Executive. I said that it had voluntarily surrendered a great deal of its traditional authority and control over national expenditure, and that its power had weakened as the power of the Executive had strengthened. If these criticisms were well-founded, as I believe they were in the course of the Seventeenth Parliament, we must ask ourselves whether this Eighteenth Parliament represents any improvement on that state of affairs. I say that the unhealthy trends that were evident in the course of the Seventeenth Parliament have continued so that the Parliament has degenerated, and that not merely has it forfeited a great deal of its proper authority to the Executive, but that the Executive in turn has become merely a recording instrument for one man who dominates it, the present Prime Minister (Mr Chifley). Without Mr Holt. elaborating this matter, I believe that my own conclusions will be confirmed by other honourable members. There was a time when the Parliament as an institution was able, by means of amendments to legislaintion, to give expression to the views of minorities among the people who made their views known to their parliamentary representatives, and were able to have them adopted, if the reasoning behind them was compelling and if the facts were adequate. But what has been our experience in the course of this Eighteenth Parliament? Erom time to time bills have been presented to us with the intimation that no amendments would be considered or accepted by the Government. Those bills had first been presented by the Government to the Labour party caucus and had been adopted by the caucus tn to to. It is not the function of a government, merely by virtue of its Parliamentary majority, to adopt only the legislation of which its parliamentary majority has approved at a caucus meeting. A government should not represent only a section of the people but should represent all sections of the country. The views of minorities should not merely be heard but, where they are soundly based, they should also be reflected in suitable amendments to legislation. But what has happened during the lifetime of this Parliament? What opportunity has been given to members on the Opposition side or to independent members of the Parliament to have any useful suggestion adopted by a government which has merely presented its legislation to its own party caucus and refuses to adopt any alteration to it? Therefore I consider that the Eighteenth Parliament has failed the people as a true democratic instrument, and it is my conviction that that has not been an accidental development. I believe that this decline in the prestige, authority and the usefulness of the functioning of the Parliament has been a definite plan which was set in motion many years ago. There has been a good deal of discussion in this chamber recently about the objectives of the Socialist party, as outlined at the 1921 Labour party conference at Brisbane.",21
45,Mr THOMPSON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I rise to order! My point of order is that we are dealing, in committee, with a certain proposed vote, and that the honourable member is making his speech as a second-reading speech. He is not referring to any of the items before us. I contend therefore that he should confine his remarks to matters connected with the proposed vote before the committee.",22
46,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE, It appears to the Chair that the lionorable member for Fawkner (Mr. Holt) is dealing with the Parliament as a whole. He is entitled to proceed along that line.,23
47,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I hope to establish a very clear link between my opening remarks, which were of a general character, and the observations that I shall now make with relation to the institution of Parliament. My point is that we are here as the guardians of the Parliament. We have been entrusted by the people of Australia with the responsibility for continuing this democratic institution, which has been developed by the British people for the free expression of their rights and independence against the authority of the State, whether the State of a monarch, the power and authority of a d ietator, or an Executive entrusted with the functions of an administration. All of these things should bow to the authority of the Parliament. I understand that that is what we, the representatives of the people, have been entrusted to maintain. I was about to develop the point that the socialist objective of Labour that was set out in specific terms at the 1921 conference had been watered down to some extent by explanations given in this Parliament during recent weeks by Government members. To my knowledge no attempt has been made at any time to water down, either in this Parliament or outside it, other proposals that were adopted at that conference and which relate directly and categorically to this institution of Parliament. I refer to the proposal that was brought foward at that time to take important financial functions and to place them under the control of a supreme economic council. No one could allege that that is not a matter of direct concern to the Parliament and one that should not properly be considered wheni we are dealing with the institution of Parliament. If it can be established, as I believe it can, that the Government is pledged to support not merely the socialist objective of 1921, but also the other proposals that were adopted by the conference of the Australian Labour party held in that year, and that in doing so it will take from the Parliament a great deal of its authority, it is very proper that we should consider the implications of such a policy and its effect on the future of democratic government in this ' country. Honourable members opposite will need very little reminder by me that at the time the socialist objective was adopted, there were also adopted proposals for the formation of a supreme economic council, which coincides very closely with the presidium that has been established in Soviet Russia.",23
48,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable member can develop this line of argument only insofar as it relates to the diminution of the authority of the Parliament.,23
49,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Some of the members of the conference that reached this decision are at present in this chamber. I propose to show by specific reference that they dealt with the effect of the formation of this supreme economic council on the functions of Parliament.,23
50,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE," Although that may be proved, if we were to go from one conference to another the debate would be endless.",23
51,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,At the time it was stated that this supreme economic council would take the place of the political Parliament in all matters relating to industry. Surely the Chair will agree that that is not irrelevant.,23
52,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable member for Eawkner may develop his line of argument only to that extent.,23
53,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I shall cite the words of the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), who has not been in his accustomed place for a considerable time owing to ill health, expressed when he was a leading member of the Australian Labour party, and which were endorsed by other members of that party at the time who also are now members of this Parliament. Mr Scui.r.Y - I rise to order. In dealing with the proposed vote before the Chair, I claim that the honourable member should by specific reference relate his remarks to the parliamentary estimates. That honourable member's line of argument is not directly concerned with the Parliament. I submit that the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt ) is entirely out of order.",23
54,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It appears to the Chair that the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt ) has covered his point with relation to the diminution of the power of the Parliament as shown in the increased power of the Executive, and now seeks to strengthen his case by reference to an earlier decision. It is not permissible him to have resort to previous conferences other than for that purpose.",24
55,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Althoug h I do uot intend to canvass the general proceedings of the conference I shall refer to the language that was used hy the right honourable member for Yarra at the time that he referred to the effect of that development on the machinery of Parliament. Surely that is in order? If this Parliament, as an institution, is under attack either by members of the Parliament or by people outside the Parliament, and proposals to reduce the authority of the Parliament are advanced by responsible public men, surely we, as members of Parliament, have a right to refer to the impact of those decisions upon us as an institution. I have some knowledge of relevance in these matters, and I assure the Chair that I am not trying to abuse or circumvent the ruling of the Chair. I shall confine my remarks strictly to matters having a direct bearing on the power of Parliament. On the occasion to which I have referred, the right honourable member for Yarra, in moving the establishment of an elective supreme economic council by all nationalized industries, saidThis was one of the immediate things to be done under the scheme. The first step was to employ Parliamentary machinery to nationalize the industry to give the community and the workers control of that industry. Then they would have government by the workers in the industry. That industry would then become a group, and each group would elect representatives to the Supreme Economic Council, which it would have to do with the chain of workers of the whole workers in industry. So far as the industry itself was concerned under the socialized State, it would really take the place of the political Parliament for all questions of industry. The Council would come only after the initial stages had been reached after nationalization.  at the conference, the right honourable member for Y a r r a saidThe objectives rendered it necessary to have a Supreme Economic Council. It was not further away than the objective. The proposal then was to appoint a council of action to function as well.",24
56,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The Chair has listened to the honourable member's remarks very carefully. It appears to the Chair that they have no relation for whatever to the Parliament. The honourable member himself quite clearly cited an extract about an industrial matter. I cannot permit that line of argument to be followed any further beyond the right honourable gentleman's statement and the development of it.',24
57,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I shall therefore present to the Parliament a statement by Mr . Power, who askedIf you control industry by the Supreme Economic Council under a state of socialization, what are the functions remaining for the other Parliaments? The right honourable member for Y a r r a said that there would he quite a lot of things they could sum up as social that did not come under industry, and international matters which the industries could not control. Although I do not wish to transgress the rulin g of the Chair, I desire to point out that the proposal that was adopted at that time, by the conference, many members of which are also members of this Parliament, envisaged the Parliament as an institution that would deal with some international matters, and certain social matters, hut not with the great range of problems that come under the heading of commerce and industry. They were to be taken out of the hands of the Parliament and placed in the hands of this extra parliamentary body. This proposal, which has never been rescinded and still remains part of the programme of the socialists, is directed at the very heart of the Parliament as an effective instrument for carrying out democratic authority. It is intended that the council, which is not to be elected by the people of Australia as a whole, should have full authority to deal with matters of industry and commerce, leaving to the shrunken Parliament merely some attenuated authority to deal with social and international problems. Gone is to .be the historic responsibility of the Parliament for controlling the nation's purse strings. That is the objective which the socialists are pledged to carry out. That is the proposal which they adopted in 1921 and have never to this day rescinded. Hand in hand with the objective to which they are pledged is the formation of a supreme economic council which is to rule with all the authority of parliament leaving in its stead this shrunken shell. During the eight years of Labour rule, there has been a steady diminution of the authority and prestige of the Parliament. The Parliament has become an instrument which merely rubber stamps the decisions taken in the caucus, which in turn, takes its orders from the Cabinet as the result of direct pressure from outside",24
58,The DEPUTY CHAIBMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Order ! The honourable member is getting very wide of the proposed vote before the Chair. He has been given very wide scope to discuss the authority of the Parliament, but he must not continue along those lines.",25
59,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"You , Mr Deputy Chairman, and other honourable members opposite, may not share my view. I leave it to fair-minded observers of the institution of the Parliament to make up their minds about this matter.",25
60,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Order I The Chair has no view on the matter. It is merely confining the honourable member to a discussion of the proposed vote before the Chair in accordance with the Standing Orders. That vote has no relation to decisions made by the caucus.,25
61,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I leave it at that. Fairminded observers will have to make up their minds on this matter,25
62,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Order ! If the honourable member persists in pursuing that line of argument, I shall ask hini to resume his seat.",25
63,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"That is the very note upon which I began my speech. If there has been a diminution of the authority of the Parliament, it is due either to the dominant personality of the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley), who has been able to force through caucus measures which are never permitted to he amended by the minorities in this Parliament either in the Opposition ranks or among honourable members who support the Government, or to the carefully considered plan that was adopted by the Australian Labour party in 1921 which had for its objective the almost complete usurpation by some extra-parliamentary body of the function of the Parliament as the controller of the nation's finances and of commerce and industry in this country.",25
64,Mr THOMPSON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Hindmarsh) [11.55]. - It is rather astonishing that the honourable member for Eawkner (Mr Holt) should have occupied the whole of his time in considering matters that have no relation to the proposed vote now before the chair.,25
65,Mr MCDONALD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I rise to order. I regard that remark as a definite reflection on the Chair.,25
66,Mr THOMPSON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I intended it as a reflection not on the Chair but on the honourable member for Eawkner, who poses as an authority onfinanceand takes up the whole of his time in dealing with matters which are outside the ambit of the proposed vote.",25

70,Mr ARCHIE CAMEEON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Who was it?,25
71,Mr BERNARD CORSER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It was the honourable member for Hume (Mr. Fuller), who is Government Whip.",25
72,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The Chair did not observe 'his departure. [Quorum formed.'],25
73,Mr THOMPSON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I thank the right honourable member for North Sydney for bringing a few more honourable members into the chamber. Very often when attention is directed to the fact that a quorum is not present only a few Opposition members are present in the chamber. Usually, when I rise to draw attention to the fact that an honourable member opposite is in the wrong, the honourable member for Fawkner endeavours to draw a herring across the trail by calling for a quorum. On this occasion I note that he got one of his ofTsiders to do this for him. The right honourable member for North Sydney called attention to the state of the committee just after the honourable member for Fawkner, who poses as a custodian of the rights and privileges of this Parliament, had concluded a speech in which he ranted about subjects that have no relation to the proposed vote now under consideration. The honourable member for Fawkner, who resumed his seat with the satisfied air of a man who had nobly discharged his duty as a member of the Opposition, must realise that during the detailed discussion of the Estistaff. mates honourable members are obliged by the Standing Orders to confine their remarks to the proposed vote under discussion. The committee is now dealing cvith the remainder of the proposed vote for the Parliament. Under Division 1, provision is made for financing the cost of administration of the Senate. The honourable member did not deal with that subject. Division 2 provides for the salaries of staff and expenses of administration of the House of Representatives. As the honourable member did not question that provision I assume that he is satisfied that there is good reason for the crease in the vote from £33,400 to £41,000. The proposed vote for the Parliamentary Reporting Staff is £21,000, but the honourable member did not refer to that item. Does he criticize the proposed vote of £28,000 for the Library? He has not endeavoured to show that the proposed vote of £57,000 for the Joint House Department is excessive. He has not criticized the provision of £2,400 for the Public Works Committee, and of £2,600 for the Broadcasting Committee. I admit that last night the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) referred to the proposed vote for the Broadcasting Committee, but the honourable member for Fawkner has not done so. Mr Thompson. The honourable member for Richmond endeavoured to convince his listeners that the Government was wrongfully expending public funds on parliamentary printing for party political purposes against the interests of the people. References have been made to the cost of publishing a booklet which contains general information about social services benefits. Numbers of people have asked me for copies of the booklet in order that they mayascertain whether they are entitled to receive benefits. Because the Labour Government provides that service for the people, honourable members opposite seize the opportunity to query the cost. They do not seem to realise that expenditure is incurred in giving that information. The last division of the Parliament relates to provision for the conveyance of members of the Parliament and others, and the maintenance of Ministers' and members' rooms, including the salary of Discussion of the estimates for the Parliament should be restricted to the items that are included in those nine divisions. Honourable members opposite frequently claim that they have a profound knowledge of parliamentary procedure and the Standing Orders, but 1 challenge them to show that their references to decisions that were made at a conference of the Labour party in 192.1 are in the slightest degree relevant to the proposed vote for the Parliament. Indeed, the mass of irrelevancies which honourable members opposite have spoken prove that they have found no legitimate in- grounds on which to criticize the budget. Instead of submitting constructive suggestions for curtailing expenditure, they have made wild rambling statements that are completely unrelated to the proposed vote for the Parliament. However, their statements call for a reply, because the absence of a refutation may lead some people to think that those assertions are accurate. The honourable member for Fawkner remarked that the manner in which the Government treated the Parliament reduced its importance and authority as the supreme legislative body in the land. Other honourable members opposite voice a similar opinion from time to time, but there is no substance in their contention. The honourable member for Fawkner bas complained that when the Opposition submits a proposal, the Government ov the Parliament does not adopt it - I should like to hear the honourable gentleman explain his conception of a democratic institution. Does he consider that when a minority group submits a proposal, the majority group should say, "" We are opposed to it, but, in order to please you, we-shall adopt your view""? The people liave given the Labour party an absolute majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, but the honorablo gentleman complains because the Labour Government decides what the legislative programme shall be. The lionorable member referred somewhat scathingly to caucus. I invite him to recall whether the Opposition parties, when they occupied the treasury bench, took heed of the submissions of the Labour party in this chamber. The honourable member spoke feelingly about the fact that the Labour Government seeks the approval of caucus before it introduces legislation. I recall that when the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) was Premier of New South Wales, even his closest supporters did not know what he intended to do until he actually introduced a bill. I am. certain that rank and file members of the Opposition parties when they were in power were not given such a preview of legislation as rank and file members of the Labour party receive. All the assertions to the effect that the Parliament is an instrument which rubber-stamps the decisions of caucus, which, in turn, is dominated by Cabinet, are so much cant and humbug. The Liberal party and the Australian Country party may truly be likened to rubber stamps, because they blindly supported in the Parliament legislation about which they had not been consulted. No honourable member will begrudge the amount that has been provided in the estimates for the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Library and the other departments that are associated with the official control and functioning of the Parliament. If honourable members desire to discuss their own parliamentary allowances, they will have an opportunity later to do so.",25
74,Mr HARRISON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"If what the honourable member for Fawkner says is correct, the parliamentary institution would not have an opportunity to consider the Estimates. Expenditure would be determined by a supreme economic council.",27
75,Mr THOMPSON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Some of the old tory die-hards in the past were hardly in favour of the parliamentary institution as we know it. They preferred that a hand-picked bank board should determine the financial policy of the country.,27
76,Mr TURNBULL,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,When does the honourable member propose to deal with the budget ?,27
77,Mr THOMPSON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"When we began to consider the Estimates, I was prepared to confine my remarks strictly to the items under consideration. Had I been in the chair, I should have asked the honourable member for Fawkner to indicate the item in the proposed vote for the Parliament upon which he was speaking, and requested him to relate his remarks to it. However, the honourable member departed considerably from the subject matter of the items under consideration, and I desire to reply to some of the statements that he made.",27
78,Mr HARRISON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Is the honourable member reflecting on the Chair ?,27
79,Mr THOMPSON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Instea d of discussing the proposed vote for Parliament, honourable members opposite have opened up a wide field for debate. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) has referred to a suggestion that was made at the conference of the Labour party in 1921 for the appointment of a supreme economic council. I remind the honourable gentleman that there are visionaries on both sides of the chamber. At various conferences held by the Opposition parties, delegates have made suggestions that have been adopted, but honourable members opposite have not attempted to give effect to them. Although the Labour Government has been in ofilce for eight years, it has not attempted to put into operation the policy that was adopted hy the Labour conference in 1921.",27
80,Mr HARRISON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The Government has tried hard to do so.,27
81,Mr THOMPSON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The return of the .Labour Government to office is evidence that the majority of the people endorse the policy of the Labour party. One of the planks of the political platform of the example. Labour party is nationalization of industry, production, distribution and exchange. When the Labour Government attempted to nationalize banking, its opponents appealed to the High Court and subsequently to the Privy Council, io have the legislation declared unconstitutional. Membera of the Labour movement and the Australian people generally are aware of the objectives that vere laid down at the Labour Conference in 192-1, but they are not alarmed, at the ""prospect. Honourable members opposite ire not likely to succeed with that bogy. C regret very much that the honourable gentleman took advantage of the discussion on the proposed vote for the Parliament to raise matters that I consider ihould have been dealt with in a different ivay altogether. I admit that honourable ""Uembers opposite have a difficult job. L'hey have been unable to find any just >;ause for complaint in the budget, and fthe task of trying to gain the support of the people for their cause is too much cor them. Therefore, they raise irrelevant matters in the hope that they can livert attention from the fact that they lave been unable to produce any valid triticism of the budget. They have tried n work off old scores, but they have been msuccessf ul. The people know very well hat the Parliament has not been funcioning in any improper way, and they mow that the present Parliament has lone more for them than any previous jarliament did. Honourable members who leery this institution and say that it merely serves the purpose of a rubber itamp should read the history of the Mother of Parliaments, upon which we ilaim that this Parliament has been' modelled. If they do so, they will read about great men like Disraeli and Gladstone, not about less important men such as, perhaps, the honourable member /or Fawkner and I may be. History tells of the great men who controlled the des:.tnies of their country from positions of leadership in the Parliament. The names -)f such men are the only ones that survive in our memories. Our parliamentary institution has gained its place in his democracy as the result of great men n the past Mr Thompson.",27

83,Mr THOMPSON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am sure that the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) must be in agreement with me. He basks today is the warmth of public respect that was created by the great acts that he performed in the"" past, chiefly when he was a member of the Labour party.",28
84,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Is that why the Labour party kicked him out?,28
85,Mr THOMPSON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The Labour party did not kick him out. I still have a great deal of sympathy for the right honourable member. Nobody has heard me gibe at him for holding to his views at the time when he left the Labour party, and I do not gibe at him now. The right honourable member knows that. But I repeat that he is judged, not on what he has done during the last ten years, but principally upon what he did when he was a member of the Labour party. He will retain his place in history for that reason, and will be remembered when most of his contemporaries are forgotten. To belittle this parliamentary institution, as the honourable member for Fawkner endeavoured to belittle it, is to belittle the Australian people. When the people place a government in power in order to do a certain job and that government honours its obligation and is returned to power again with a handsome majority, it ill behoves the honourable member and others like him to gibe at the achievements of the leader of the Government and his Ministers. The bogy of a supreme economic council is something like the New Guard.' The honourable member for Wentworth will remember the New Guard, although I was not in Sydney when it existed and have little knowledge of it. The honourable gentleman no doubt recallsthe occasion when the present honourable member for Reid, as Premier Of New South Wales, was about to perform an historic ceremony and a member of the New Guard came along and spoiled things for him by cutting a ribbon prematurely. The New Guard is almost forgotten now, and the idea of a supreme economic council has been placed in the same category in the minds of most people. I , for one. believe in the' nresent system of representation of the people, and all of the influence that I can exert within the ranks of the Lahour party, in this Parliament or anywhere else, wili be used to defend the rights of the people. When the chosen candidates assemble in this chamber after the general election preparatory to electing a new Speaker, the Olerk of the House of Representatives will see gathered before him men and women elected in the democratic fashion that all true Australians know and depend upon. I am sorry that I have digressed as I have done, but I believe that I was entitled to do so because of the way in which the honourable member for Fawkner digressed. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN"" - I call the honourable member for Richmond, but before he rises to speak I wish to state my views concerning the latitude that should be allowed to honourable members in discussing the proposed vote now before the Chair. I have given a great deal of consideration to the matter, and it is - clear to me that a wide discussion would extend beyond the limits contemplated in the Standing Ordei's. I intend to confine discussion to the items in the proposed vote and, if necessary, will allow references to the Executive as opposed to the Parliament as a whole. I shall not allow references - to conferences and other such matters to be made. Such a restriction is necessary, because otherwise the discussion could range over all phases of parliamentary and non-parliamentary history.",28
86,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I wish to raise a point that i& not limited merely to the proposed vote now before the committee. I point out that the practice of this Parliament, when sitting in committee to consider the Estimates, has been to permit discussion of the proposed vote for any department to relate to the activities of that department generally, not merely to the items set out in the proposed vote.",29
87,Mr SCULLY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,That has not been the practice.,29
88,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The practice has been to permit a general debate on each department. Discussion has not been confined to the individual items.,29
89,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The discussion may revolve around the subject of the Parliament, but I will not allow it to extend, back over the years because, in that event, there would be no limit to it.",29
90,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Richmond) [12.17]. - I am glad that you have given that ruling, Mr Deputy Chairman, because the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Thompson), whose remarks went back to Gladstone and Disraeli, did not go far enough back into history. The honourable gentleman should have referred! to Magna Carta hecause that was the basis, of our parliamentary institution, and it. is in order to preserve the freedom that: was bequeathed to us",29
91,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Order I have very clearly ruled that references, of that nature will not be permitted.",29
92,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am not going to develop that line of thought, Mr Deputy Chairman. I merely say that the Parliamentary institution is based upon the freedom of the individual to express himself without constraint. I propose to discuss a number of items in the proposed vote. Divisions 1 and 2 refer to the Senate and the House of Representatives, and I direct the attention of the committee to the Government's lack of sincerity in implementing its policy in relation to the Parliament. I shall not refer to the Labour party conference in 1921, but I think that I may reasonably be permitted to refer to the triennial Labour party conference that was held at Canberra in 1948.",29
93,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable member's remarks must be confined to the proposed vote that the committee is considering.,29
94,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I refer to decisions that were made at that conference concerning the institution of Parliament, and to nothing else.",29
95,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,For practical purposes I have ruled out of order all reference to such matters.,29
96,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Ver y well, I shall not refer even to the 1948 conference. The proposed vote includes an amount of £25,000 for the provision of facilities for the Senate. If the Labour party's platform is to be relied upon",29
97,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Order ! The eommittee is not interested in the Labour party's platform. It is interested in the question whether the amount of the proposed vote is adequate or not.,30
98,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The estimate includes an amount of £25,000 for the Senate. According to the platform of the Labour party, it should be reduced to nil, because the Labour party's platform provides for the abolition of the Senate. Ear from that being done, however, the proposed vote is to be increased, because the Senate is to be increased from 36 members to 60. Can there be any sincerity in a party which proclaims that, if returned to office, it will abolish the Senate, and then",30
99,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,There were opportunities during earlier debates for. the honourable member to make such points. The Chair has given a clear ruling on this matter. The debate could be endless if honourable members were allowed to proceed as the honourable member is attempting to do.,30
100,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I assume that, since we are discussing a proposed vote of £25,000 for the Senate, we ought to he entitled to consider whether the Senate is necessary. According to the Labour party's own platform, the Senate ought to be abolished. However, the party has shown its insincerity by not abolishing the Senate when it has the power to do so. The Labour party has a majority in this chamber and in the Senate, but it has introduced no legislation to abolish the Senate. Ear from doing so, it has increased the number of senators from 36 to 60. A party that proclaims one thing and does another",30
101,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member is defying the ruling of the Chair. It is proposed to appropriate an amount for the Senate, and the committee may consider whether that amount is sufficient for the purpose. The committee is not considering party constitutions, or party conferences from which such constitutions emanate.",30
102,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I have no wish to evade your ruling. I merely point out that if this Governinent, which has the support of the Labour party, really believes, in accordance with the platform of the Labour party, that the Senate ought not to exist, then the item of £25,000 which appears in these Estimates for the Senate ought not to be there. The Estimates provide £41,000 for the House of Representatives. A considerable part of that money will be spent on maintaining the prestige of Mr Speaker, and the other occupants of the Chair. We know that the Speaker of the House is the chief executive officer of the Parliament and controls the staff. Perhaps, on this item, I may be permitted to discuss the qualifications of Mr Speaker for his job. If I am not permitted to do so, you will check mc, Mr Deputy Chairman. Mr. Speaker is the custodian of the privileges of members of the Parliament, and he controls the various employees of the Parliament. Therefore, it is proper, I suggest, for us to consider the personality of Mr Speaker, and of Mr. Deputy Speaker, also. Honourable members on this side of the chamber are by no means satisfied with the treatment they have received",30
103,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member is out of order. The conduct of Mr Speaker may be challenged only on a substantive motion in the House itself. It may not be done in committee. Not only is the honourable member out of order, but it is manifestly unfair for him to proceed as he is doing.",30
104,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Ver y well, I shall have to abandon that line. I should like now to refer to item 3 on the Estimates of the Parliament-the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, which is Hansard. The cost of parliamentary printing is shown as £36,000, which is expended on the printing of Hansard, and of parliamentary papers. Hansard, as we know, issues the bound numbers a considerable time' after the debates to which they refer have taken place, and it also issues day-by-day records of the debates in proof form. It has been the custom for honourable members to revise their proofs in order to correct anything that they did not mean, or which might be ambiguous, and to put it in a more readable form, or in a more correct, form. I wish to refer to the use recently made of Tlans'ird proofs by members on the Government side of the chamber, or by somebody interested in damaging t i e Opposition, some one who sent to the Sunday Times in Western Australia, a proof copy of che report of a speech by the honourable member for Swan (Mr . Hamilton). The copy was deliberately to damage a member of the Opposition, contrary to the intentions of the House, contrary to the practices of Hansard, and in breach of the confidential nature of the document itself. As I have said, it was done to damage a member of the Opposition, to put into his mouth words that he never uttered or intended, and fco hold him up to ridicule and contempt. Mx. DALY -'Somebody has been pulling the honourable member's leg.",30
105,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member for M a r t in (Mr Daly) says somebody has been pulling my leg. If somebody had done to the honourable memin ber for M a r t in what was done to the honourable member for Swan, the GovernHansard ment would have instituted an inquiry at once. However, there is one rule f o the Opposition and another for supporters of the Government, as has been demonEstimates strated from time to time. This matter was raised by the honourable member for Swan during question time a few days ago, but, so far as I know, the Government has given no indication that an inquiry is being held. I do not think that the honourable member for been informed what remedy he has, or what action the Government is taking. Apparently, so long as it is a member of the Opposition who has heen injured, matter oan rest there, but if a Government supporter complains, every effort is made to trace the offender.",31
106,Mr DALY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Does the honourable memable ber kuow that the newspaper in question has refused to acknowledge the truth of the statement of the honourable member for Swan? Mx. ANTHONY - I am not concerned with what the newspaper does. I am concerned with the rigbts of honourable members, and with the Hansard staff, which is under the direction of Mr Speaker. I insist that there ought to be respect of it . an impartial investigation by Mr . Speaker, whether the person offended on this side of the chamber or the other. surely ? I wish to criticize some matters in connection with Hansard. I do not want to criticize Hansard unduly, because the matter to which I refer is not entirely the fault of Hansard. The staff does a used very good job under extremely onerous conditions, but if we are to spend £20,000 or £30,000 on the production of Hansard, it has to provide a useful and efficient service. One of the things that I complain about is that it takes Hansard two years to produce an index of members' speeches. Without an index what is the use of countless volumes of Hansard to an ordinary member who wants to look up something said some time before and there is no clue to where it is to be found ? One has to go through thousands of pages to find what one is seeking. The purpose of Hansard is to make readily available to that members, for their convenience, the speeches and events that have taken place the chamber. The last index published is two years old. I do not entirely blame for that. Hansard probably wishes to provide an up-to-date and r efficient service. It is up to the Government either to put more money on the so that Hansard shall be able to provide an efficient service, or to reduce the service of Hansard altogether, because a partial service is of little use.",31
107,Mr DALY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Honourable gentlemen opposite customarily advocate a reduction of Swan has governmental expenditure.,31
108,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am not debating that point at all. If the Government is the going to spend £23,000 ou Hansard, most of the money will be thrown away, unless it provides means of using the services of Hansard. A reasonably up-to-date index ought to be available. No honormember, unless he has the time of Methuselah to spend, can go through many volumes in order to find the reference that he is seeking. It is up to the Government to assist the Hansard staff in that direction. I have spoken before about the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting and have not had a great deal of . satisfaction from the Government in",31
109,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable sits member did not expect any satisfaction,",31
110,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I did not, but I repeat that the government broadcasting services of Australia are one edifice superimposed upon another until we do not know whether we are at the bottom or the top. We have the Broadcasting Committee under the chairmanship of Senator Amour. Where does it stand in relation to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board? Which is supreme-the board or the committee? What is the function of the one and what is the function of the other? One, at least, is superfluous. I say that both are superfluous. But one at least is superfluous. There is no justification for the Government's placing £2,600 on the Estimates for the purpose of providing jaunts for members of the Broadcasting Committee. When I said that last night, the Minister for Defence (Mr Dedman) said that when I criticized the committee I was criticizing members of the Opposition who were also members of the committee. But I remind the Minister that when the committee was reconstituted at the beginning of this Parliament, the Australian Country party would have so little to do with it that not one member of the party would accept nomination for appointment to the committee. Members of the party considered that to be a member of the committee would be wasting equivalent to condoning the public money. Not one member of the Australian Country party would accept appointment to the committee, although the party was invited to nominate a member.",32
111,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The Liberals are represented on the committee.,32
112,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am not talking about the Liberals, and I refuse to be diverted On to sidelines by the Minister for Defence. I am stating the opinion of our party. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden), who is a member of the Australian Country party, was on the committee in the previous Parliament, but he resigned, and not one member of the party would consent to take his place, even though members of the committee are paid an allowance of two guineas or so a day to go around the country with it. The committee is only a nuisance to the Australian Broadcasting Commission and to every one else. It is merely a vehicle to enable Senator Amour to ""get things over "". I should have liked to say more about the institution of the Parliament itself, but, in view of your ruling, Mr Deputy Chairman, I shall have to curtail my remarks, although, to be quite frank, I have read every page of the Estimates and examined the proposed vote for every department and can see no other proposed vote on which one could talk about the parliamentary institution than the proposed vote for the Parliament itself. Apparently we can talk about everything but the one thing that matters.",32
113,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"If the honourable member disagrees with my ruling, he has means of showing his disagreement. He must not canvass my ruling.",32
114,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I am not going to disagree. I regard you as one of our fairest chairmen. I want to keep completely within your ruling. The institution of the Parliament will soon come under review.,32
115,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable member is once again trying to get around my ruling. The purpose for which I gave the ruling was to confine the debate. The honourable member cannot get around the ruling indirectly.,32
116,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Ver y soon the Senate and the House of Representatives - ma y I say that ?,32
117,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,It depends on what the honourable member is going to say.,32

119,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The way in which certain honourable members behave forces the Chair to give arbitrary rulings that may appear harsh. If the honourable member insists in trying to circumvent my ruling, he will make me take a stronger line than would otherwise be necessary.",32
120,Mr HARRISON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I rise to order, Mr. Deputy Chairman. Do I understand from your ruling that, if an honourable member, feeling that the authority of the Parliament is being challenged and that the Parliament is likely to ,be undermined by certain political organizations that have been described by the Prime Minisconstruction) ter as heing foreign-inspired, takes the opportunity presented by the Estimates to express his fears, he will be prevented from doing so? Does your ruling mean that members may not direct the attenI tion of the committee and the country the dangers that exist and may not take the necessary steps to preserve institution of the Parliament?",32

153,Mr LANG,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Reid) [2.22] - I tried to address the committee recently regarding the establishment of standing committees in connection with customs and foreign affairs. I believe that all the statements that have been submitted about a supreme council are answered, in a democracy itself; that Parliament in a democracy is the supreme body; and - that Parliament represents the humblest persons in the community no matter how poor they may be or how low on the social ladder. No matter how distressing their circumstances may be they can be given a voice in the Parliament. I also point out that the King's justice flows from His Majesty the King down to the humblest and lowliest in the community. But it is not sumcient that that should be actually so; it must also appear to be so. In the same way, it is not sumcient for this Parliament to represent everybody in the community; it must also appear to do so. I suggest, therefore, that when the Parliament itself is under discussion in the Parliament the greatest possible latitude should be given. That would be the answer to those who say that democracy fails. Having said that I desire to address myself to the Estimates under discussion. There is no provision in these Estimates for the re-establishment of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Accounts, although the Auditor-General has recommended that it be re-established. The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) promised me last year that he would examine that matter which is, I believe, one of great moment and great urgency. The Estimates grant the Government access to specific sums of public money but without stating the specific purpose for which they are to be used. Both the Government, as the executive body, and this Parliament as the legislative body must accept the responsibility for the expenditure of that money. We must accept the responsibility of seeing that that money is not only properly budgeted, hut is also properly expended. We must be satisfied that machinery exists to supervise its proper expenditure. Those safeguards do not exist at the moment. Our financial affairs are being conducted in a slipshod fashion. The Parliament that votes this public money has no satisfactory checks or balances. I say deliberately that when this committee of the Parliament votes approval for this expenditure, it does so blindly. But after the Parliament meets and assembles, as we see it today, it is not absolved from the overriding responsibility of seeing that the money that has been extracted from the pockets of the people is being properly expended under proper supervision. I am not satisfiedand. I bope that the committee is not satisfied-that adequate precautions have been taken against maladministration, waste, extravagance and inefficiency. Precautions against those dreadful things do not exist today. They are all the more essential because of the revolutionary changes that have occurred in the field of public expenditure during the past few years. The Parliament, this committee, and the people should know that the Government expends almost half of the national income of over £500,000,000. The Australian Government is by far the largest employer of labour in this country.",35
154,Mr BEAZLEY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I rise to order. The item in the Estimates now before the committee relates to the Parliament. So far we have only heard from the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) about the total expenditure estimated in the budget, and the number of Commonwealth employees. Is the honourable member for Reid in order ?",36
155,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"At the present time the honourable member for Reid is in order. Under the division of "" Parliament"" there is a committee the activities of which have heen suspended. Whilst it is not competent for the honourable member for Reid to move the re-establishment of that committee, it is missible for him to discuss the matter.",36
156,Mr LANG,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The Australian Government has a huge army of temporary public servants and it has huge contracts with private contractors in every corner of this country. The old system of public tenders has been discarded in many fields. Instead we have variations of the cost plus system.,36
157,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I rise to order. We are discussing the various Estimates under the heading of "" Parliament"". There are nine divisions in this particular group of Estimates. I suggest that the honourable member for Reid must relate his remarks to one or other of these divisions, which refer to expenditure incurred as a result of legislative action under statutory authority. I contend that the honourable member for Reid is not entitled to deal with a subject-matter relating to the investigations of a committee for which, because it was suspended by legislative action, there is no provision in the Estimates.",36
158,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,But there should be!,36
159,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I suggest that the honourable member for Reid ought to confine his remarks to one or the other of the divisions in the Estimates under the general group headed "" Parliament"".",36
160,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Order ! It appears to the Chair that the honourable member for Reid is in order is discussing the Public Accounts Committee. That committee, which at one time scrutinized public accounts, was suspended by an act of the Parliament. It appears to the Chair that that matter can be discussed, but no motion can be made at this stage to reconstitute it.",36
161,Mr LANG,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Instea d of the old Public Accounts Committee, we have a variation of the cost-plus system. Minor officials have authority to purchase huge quantities of stores, whilst Ministers have the backing of regulations and government departments without reference to specific items in this Parliament. They now regard millions of pounds as farthings were once regarded. All of these elements have created a financial position that involves every member of this chamber in very heavy personal responsibility when pervoting for the expenditure of public money. Unfortunately financial statements are too often regarded merely as irksome figures without meaning. They are not measured by the committee in terms of bread and butter, as they are measured by the taxpayers who provide the money. I point out that of the 75 members of this committee one man has the real say in determining the amount of money to be voted. He has all of the say with relation to how the money is to be distributed between the different departments, and what secret reserves are to be established. The man who does all of those things is the Treasurer. That is his job in the first place, and rightly so. But it is the responsibility of this committee to see that he carries out his job in the best interests of the taxpayers who provide the money which he expends. Honourable members are therefore in a very responsible position of trust. They have exactly the same responsibility to the taxpayers as have the trustees of an estate to the beneficiaries in that estate, and as has the director of a public company to the shareholders of the company. It is no defence for a director of a public company to plead ignorance if the financial affairs of the company are mismanaged. He is paid to watch the affairs of the company and to guard the interests of the shareholders. It is his duty to see that the nnancial affairs of his company are not mismanaged. In exactly the same .way it is no defence for members of this Parliament to plead ignorance of the way in which public money is being handled by the Government. Yet there is an abysmal ignorance in this Parliament of the management of our public accounts. In the State parliaments there has always been a great awareness of how the pounds, shillings and pence that are supplied to the government are expended. Members of the State parliaments have a detailed knowledge of how money made available to the government is being expended. No stray millions are left lying around. During the last few years there has developed in the Commonwealth a rather chaotic jumble in the administration of public finance. The Treasurer is niggardly in matters in respect of which he should be liberal. He is nasty and unkind in matters in respect of which, as a Labour mau, he should be truly liberal. On the other hand, powerful bureaucrats are spending public money on all kinds of undertakings. Their attitude could be summed up as one of, "" ""What is a million here or a million there? ""What does it matter? Money is easy to get these days "". These are the people behind the Government. That policy is evidenced by the huge subsidies paid to international organizations, by the lavish expenditure . on embassies abroad and by the welter of boards that operate in this country. Prior to the outbreak of World War II , the Auditor-General had a comparatively easy task. Public expenditure flowed in normal channels and in accordance with a fixed code of practice. That code was, of necessity, scrapped during the war, but it appears to be in danger of being scrapped permanently, notwithstanding the fact that we are now expending more than five times as much as we expended prior to the war. In voting this money, it is the duty of every honourable member to satisfy himself that all possible safeguards are being taken in the supervision of the subsequent expenditure. Recently, I placed a number of specific questions on the notice-paper directing attention to paragraphs of the last report of the Auditor-General in which specific action was requested to deal with certain matters which arose during the year 1947-48. The Auditor-General was not satisfied that the present system of audit provides all the safeguards that are needed. He made serious strictures regarding contracts entered into by the Government in connection with aircraft production.",36
162,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I rise to order. The honourable member's remarks are related to the question whether a public accounts committee should or should not be established under the administration of the Parliament. I understand that at one time such a committee functioned.,37
163,Mr MCEWEN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,In stating his point of order the Minister should not he permitted to make a speech.,37
164,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Order ! The Chair will decide that matter.,37
165,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,In 1932 an act was passed which had the effect of abolishing the Public Accounts Committee.,37
166,Mr MCEWEN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Is this a second reading speech?,37
167,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The War Expenditure Cominittee was established during the war period to deal with public accounts.,37

169,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member for Reid is discussing matters which might be permitted to be discussed only if provision had been made in the proposed vote for the Parliament for a public accounts committee. As no such provision has been made, I submit that the honourable member cannot connect his remarks with the proposed vote now under consideration and that accordingly he is out of order. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN"" - The Chair is aware of the fact that the Puhlic Accounts Committee could he revived hy resolution of the Parliament. Because that is so, the honourable member for Reid is entitled to discuss the desirability of the revival of such a committee, but he may not indulge in a discussion relating to contracts for aircraft production and matters of that kind.",37
170,Mr LANG,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I shall endeavour, as far as possible, to observe the ruling.",38
171,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Order ! The honourable member will have to observe the ruling, even if he thinks it not possible to do so.",38
172,Mr LANG,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I shall submit to the ruling, because I have to do so. The Parliament is asked to vote more money in relation to aircraft, but honourable members do not know whether the Auditor General is yet satisfied with the manner in which the Government is handling contracts.",38
173,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Order ! The honourable member may not discuss the Auditor-General's report. He must confine his remarks to showing whether the Public Accounts Committee should be reconstituted.,38
174,Mr BARNARD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,That will limit the honourable member.,38
175,Mr LANG,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It is difficult for me to proceed in view of these constant interruptions. Speaking from memory, 1 believe that, at the 30th June, 1948, one contractor alone",38
176,The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Order ! The honourable member cannot pursue that line of discussion. All he is entitled to do is to indicate whether, because of the growth of expenditure or of any other circumstance, the Public Accounts Committee should be reconstituted. He may not discuss specific contracts.",38
177,Mr LANG,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I hope that I have not misunderstood the ruling of the Chair, but my view is that the Public Accounts Committee should be reconstituted in order to control expenditure, and to ensurs that there is no crookedness and that nothing wrong is being done. The only way in which I can support my case for the recon stitution of the committee is to show that something that is not right has been or is being done. I make that statement without any intention of being offensive. If I say that I consider that the Public Accounts Committee should be reconstituted, I shall be asked to support my contention with reasons. I should like permission to adduce those reasons now. If you, sir, rule that I may not proceed in that way, the people will be voiceless in this chamber, and will be robbed of millions of pounds.",38
178,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Order ! The Chair is not concerned with the honourable member's opinion. Under the Standing Orders, he is permitted at this is stage to discus's only the need for the reconstitution of the Public Accounts. Committee. He may not discuss any other matter in relation to such a committee.",38
179,Mr LANG,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,That is my object.,38
180,Mr HUGHES,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Now the honourable member has a free hand.,38
181,Mr LANG,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"What I am anxious to do, with the permission of the Chair, is to show why the Public Accounts Committee should be reconstituted, and the only way in which I can do so is by citing specific cas.es. If I am prevented from doing so, then, God Almighty, there should not be a parliament at all!",38
182,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Order ! The honourable member will be asked to resume his seat if he does not control himself.,38

184,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Order ! The honourable member will resume his seat. The Chair has given the honourable member a good deal of latitude. It has pointed out to him that he may discuss the reconstitution of the Public Accounts Committee, hut he may not go into any sidelines. If the honourable gentleman does not adhere strictly to that ruling, he will not be permitted to continue, even though he has only a limited period of time in which to speak.",38
185,Mr LANG,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I thank the Chair. I shall endeavour to observe the ruling.,38

One contractor alone at the SOth June, 1949 The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN"" Order! The matter of contracts must clearly be discussed when the estimates for the particular departments to which they relate are being considered. If the honourable gentleman desires to proceed, he should discuss the need for the supervision of general expenditure by the Public Accounts Committee.",38
188,Mr HARRISON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I rise to order.,39
189,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE, Order! The honourable member for Eeid ha.s exhausted his time.,39
190,Mr HARRISON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I should like your direction, Mr Deputy Chairman, for the future conduct of the proceedings. Should subsequent discussions reveal that the existence of the Public Accounts Committee would have prevented undue expenditure on a contract, would you rule that that contract should not he used as an illustration of the need for the reconstitution of the Public Accounts Committee ?",39
191,The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Such circumstances will be dealt with as they arise.,39
192,Mr TURNBULL,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Wimmera) [2.55] I desire to seek some information, and I shall not digress from the proposed vote for the Parliament, which is now under consideration. There are nine divisions under this heading and the proposed votes for eight of them show increases compared with the expenditure in 1945-4.9. In other words, the Government expects a reduction of expenditure only in respect of Division 8, "" Parliamentary Printing"". The first item in that division' is "" Printing of Hansard, including cost of distribution "", for which the proposed vote last year was £18,000 and the expenditure £30,304. The estimated expenditure on that item during this financial year is £23,000, or £7,304 less than the actual expenditure last year. As the number of senators and members of the House of Representatives will be increased after the forthcoming general election, 1 should like the Minister for Post-war Eeoonstruction (Mr Dedman) to explain why the Government anticipates a reduction of expenditure on the printing and distribution of Hansard this year. Will the honourable gentleman state whether more machinery has been installed to reduce the cost of printing Hansard? We know that the postal charges will not be reduced. In passing, I pay a tribute to the Hansard staff for the excellent work that it does; but I cannot understand why the estimated expenditure for the printing and distribution of Hansard this year should be substantially less than the expenditure last year, when the increase of the number of senators and members of the House of Representatives indicates a larger circulation of Hansard. I refrain from pointing out at any length that the Government, by reducing expenditure on the Parliament, could make this institution an example for other departments to emulate.",39
193,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Corio - Minister for Defence and Minister for Post-war Eeoonstruction) [2.56] - The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull) has stated that Division 8, ""Parliamentary Printing"", is the only one of the nine divisions under the Parliament in respect of which the .estimated expenditure this year is less than the actual expenditure last year. The reason, I understand, is that in the twelve months in which a general election is held, the Parliament does not usually meet so frequently as in the other years. Therefore, in accordance with experience, it is estimated that fewer copies of Hansard will be produced and distributed in this election year. That accounts for the difference between the treatment of this item, and the treatment of the other divisions under the heading of "" Parliament "". Last year, the vote was for the printing of Hansard £18,000, and the expenditure was £30,304. The increased expenditure was due to the fact that arrears of work in. the printing office, due to staffing difficulties, had to be overtaken. That situation is not expected to recur this year.",39
194,Mr FALKINDER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Franklin) [2.57]. - It is regrettable that, within the precincts of this building, there should exist in the bar for use by persons other than members of the Parliament, conditions which are, to say the least, quite primitive. Extensive alterations are being made to the building to accommodate an increased number of members. I suggest that something should be placed on the Estimates for the purpose of improving conditions in the downstairs bar, which is used by officers of the Parliament, public servants, and pressmen. Some years ago, pressmen and others were permitted to use certain parts of the main bar accommodation upstairs,, but that no longer obtains. Conditions in the lower bar are appalling. [ say at once that it is not the fault of those employed there, but of the existing conditions. I ask that some notice be taken of my remarks, so that the position may be rectified.",39
195,Mrs BLACKBURN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Bourke) [2.59] I have previously mentioned, during question-time in the House, the lack of provisions in this building for members of the various staffs employed here. I took the trouble to find out just how many persons are employed, and the list is as follows:Library .. - Joint House, including Tefreshincnt-rooins (in session) .. 100 Senate .. House of Representatives .. 27 Parliamentary Reporting (in session) Ever since I became a member of this Parliament, I have been concerned over the fact that there is no staff room in the building. Seeing that more than 200 persons are affected, it is time the matter was looked into. Some time ago, I asked that provision for a staff room be made while the alterations were in progress. There is in this building no canteen, or place where employees may have their meals. There is no rest room. There is no staff room with lockers. There is uo provision for recreation, or leisure-time pursuits. Members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate are employees of the public just as are members of the various staffs employed in this building. We, however, have pegs on which to hang our hats, but some of the employees lack even this amenity. That may seem a small matter, but it is one of great importance. The work of the Parliament could not be done effectively but for the members of the various staffs. Members of the Parliament have quite luxurious dining-rooms and billiardrooms, as well as other amenities.",40
196,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Not too luxurious.,40
197,Mrs BLACKBURN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"B y comparison, they are. Recently, a member of one staff employed in this building was taken ill . I went down to the lower part of the building to see what care was being taken of her, and I was shocked at what I saw.. Every member of the Parliament should; make it his business to find out about thesethings. There is here no first-aid room,, and no first-aid kit. There is no provision for taking care of any person who becomes ill . I have not mentioned the typists employed by members of the Parliament and Ministers, nor have I mentioned newspaper employees, because there is more opportunity for them, I understand, to have care taken of them. We have just heard that there is a downstairs bar, hut there are no other amenities for the men and women employed in the building, and it is time that something was done about it. A room should be set aside for them. There 64 should be recreation facilities. Lockers should be provided, and, if possible, a canteen. There should he, at any rate, a 16 place where employees ean eat. At present, some of them, have to eat their lunch at their desks, with their hats 24 under their chairs. I object to that situation.",40
198,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Fawkner) [3.5] - I support the references made earlier to the need for the re-establishment of a public accounts committee in this Par]lament. It is too late, of course, in the life of this Parliament to take action along those lines, but I hope that it will be found practicable by the suoceedinggovernnient to do so. It has been pointed out by other speakers that the Parliament had a standing committee on publicaccounts until 1932. But that was not the most recent occasion on which such a committee has functioned. Honourable members will recall that during the war the War Expenditure Committee operated. It was broadly a public accounts committee. As one of the members of the cominittee, I am sure that I speak for those who had the same experience as I had when I say that we felt that it did an extremely useful job and provided a useful check upon departmental extravagance. It was able to inquire into many matters. When investigation proved that there wasnothing amiss, at least we had the satisfaction of knowing that, and the publie in whose interests we reported also had had that satisfaction of knowing that matters were on a proper basis. Wheu the War Expenditure Committee was terminated, because its peculiar war-time function ceased with the coming ' of peace, all the members of the committee, conscious as they were of the usefulness of the work that it had done, combined in making a unanimous recommendation to the Government that a peace-time public expenditure commitr tee be constituted. There is such a committee in the House of Commons, of course, and one is very necessary here, particularly at a time when government budgets are covering more than £500,000,000 a year. Without elaborating the point, I content myself with saying that it is necessary to give back to the Parliament some of the control that it should properly exercise the expenditure of public money. We should have a standing committee on public accounts in the new Parliament. I propose now to deal with the item under Division 9, "" Conveyance of members of the Parliament and others for which an amount of £96,000 is provided. I feel that there has not been a proper adjustment made in the accounts of the Parliament for the circumstance that so many members now travel by air on their parliamentary duties. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) - can correct me if I am wrong, - but I understand that the Government pays exactly the same amount now to the Stale governments for the use of the railways by members of the Parliament as it did before air travel was instituted. T understand that an amount of £160 a year is paid in respect of each member of the Parliament so that we may have the privilege of travelling on parliamentary duties, on omciai occasions, or for aDy purpose on the Australian railways. Most - of the travelling that we now have to do, is clone by air, either necessarily or by - choice. We make use of the Government's own service, Trans-Australia Airlines. Mi . BEAZLEY - Most honourable members vvould not spend more than £1 a year - on rail travel.",40
199,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I agree that very fewwould spend more than £1 a year on rail travel. In the last two years I do not think I have had occasion to use my own pass on the railways at all. There must be many like me. That means that £320 has been paid out unnecessarily on my account at a time when the Parliament is under criticism for growing expenditure, particularly expenditure on the privileges of members. This is a matter that might be properly examined by the Joint House Committee or by the Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson). I do not suggest that the opportunities for travel ought to be restricted, hut I think savings could be made if the Government instituted a system of travel vouchers whereby members could travel by rail or by air. Air travel is the modern form of travel. We have become accustomed to it. On the grounds of comfort and convenience, over most of us prefer it. Choice of means of travel could be granted, provided that in any one year the amount thaf. has been paid previously on behalf of the member for travel privileges was not exceeded. That might not suit members from country electorates who have to travel long distances and for whom air travel facilities are not readily available. That could be examined. I believe that if my proposal were investigated, the overall cost to the Parliament could be reduced and that the facilities available to members for convenient and speedy travel might be increased. I ask the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction to have the matter investigated. I believe that we are paying for privileges which are neither not available or are not used under present - conditions.",41
200,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Corio - Minister for Defence and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [3.10] - I desire to reply to the two matters raised hy the honourable member for Eawkner (Mr Holt). It is true that the Government pays- £160 each for the gold passes that all honourable members have. The honourable member for Fawkner has suggested that instead of gold passes there should he a system whereby members would have a series of vouchers which they could use for either rail or air travel. The fact is that the amount that is paid for the gold pass is the standard amount set hy the railway authorities throughout Australia for an all-lines pass.,41
201,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,That was before air travel was instituted.,42
202,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Whether that is so, or not, if the honourable gentleman was a private citizen and wanted an all-lines pass on the railways throughout Australia, he would still have to pay that sum.",42
203,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,We do not need one now.,42
204,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member for Eawkner said that he did not want travel privileges curtailed in any way. An all-lines pass cannot be obtained for""less than £160 annually, because that is the standard amount charged throughout the Commonwealth. If honourable members agreed to exchange that privilege for a series of vouchers to be used, for either rail or air travel, it might be more costly than the present system.",42
205,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I suggested an upper limit on the expenditure.,42
206,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member suggested that he did not want to curtail the privileges of members. Immediately I set about discussing the matter, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) interjected that members do not need all-lines passes now.",42
207,Mr FRANCIS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Some of us need them.,42
208,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,There is some difference of opinion on the Opposition benches.,42
209,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The Minister is making a party debate out of an administrative matter that should be investigated.,42
210,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am merely examining the difficulties of adopting the honourable member's suggestion. I think that the matter should be examined, and I am sure that the Minister for the Interior will have it examined. The honourable member also raised the matter of the resuscitation of the Public Accounts Committee. The honourable member for Eeid (Mr Lang) has dealt with that matter at some length. I make it clear that the Public Accounts Committee was suspended in 1932, not by this Government, but by a government composed of gentlemen now in opposition. Honourable gentlemen opposite, when they occupy the treasury bench, take one line of argument. They say, "" There is no need for the committee. We shall suspend it "" . But immediately they find themselves in Opposition, they take the opposite line and say, "" Yes, when we were the Government, it was not necessary to have a Public Accounts Committee, but now that the Labour party is in power, we need it "" .",42
211,Mr MCEWEN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Was the Public Accounts Committee not suspended as an economy measure?,42
212,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am showing that honourable gentlemen opposite take one line when in power and a completely opposite line when in opposition. The honourable member for Fawkner in referring to the resuscitation of the Public Accounts Committee said that it was getting towards the end of Parliament and that it was not worthwhile raising the matter now. Why then, did he raise it at this stage? He has had three years during the life of this Parliament in which he could have raised the matter by resolution in the House, by a motion for the adjournment, by a censure motion, or by other means.",42
213,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I have raised it before.,42
214,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member could have raised the matter by any of the mean's I have mentioned and had it thoroughly discussed by the Parliament, and if there had been a majority of members in favour of it the committee could have been resuscitated long ago. But he has waited until the very last month of the life of the Parliament. Now following in the footsteps of the honourable member for Eeid (Mr. Lang), who is the de facto leader of his party, he tells us that there is something of advantage to be gained by the re-establishment of the committee, although during the life of the Parliament up to now the honourable member had never said a word about it.",42
215,Mr FALSTEIN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Watson) [3.16] - I should not have risen to speak on this item had it not been that the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) raised the question of the parliamentary gold pass. I should say that he haa special knowledge of the subject, as have other honourable members Estimates 1949-50. [5 OCTOBER, 1949.] who have served on the Gommittee and on the Privileges Committee of the House, when those committees have heen examining the possibility of adopting some substitute for the gold pass. The position is quite clear and I do not think that it admits of any equivocation. Modern methods of air travel have plainly superseded railway travel. I have not used my gold pass on the railways during the last five or six years, although, apparently, the Government during that time has been paying £160 annually to the various State Governments for my privilege of holding that pass. The sole purpose to which I have put my gold pass during the last few years has been to obtain free entrance to race-courses. I consider that it would not be difficult to find some substitute medallion to take the place of the gold pass, if it is the intention that members of the Parliament Should have some badge or other means by which they will he able to identify themselves to strangers or to certain authorities.",42
216,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Perhaps a tattoed design across the chest would be suitable. Mr FALSTEIN"" - That might be particularly applicable in the case of the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr . Beale), perhaps with the addition of a few feathers. I am only trying to assist the committee by re-emphasizing something that has been already put forward as, I am sure, purely a common-sense proposition. The gold pass as far as the great majority of members of this House and of the Senate are concerned is no longer being used for the purposes for which it was originally issued. That being so, it behoves the Government to inquire whether it is worthwhile continuing payments for a service which is no longer being utilized.",43
217,Mr FRANCIS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Moreton) [ 3 . 1 9 ] do not desire the Minister or the House to take the opinions of the two honourable members who have spoken on the subject of the gold pass as being representative of the opinions of the committee generally. One of those honourable members lives at Randwick, in Sydney, and the other at Toorak, in Melbourne. Other honourable members who live away fro m the capital cities, and far from the Estimates 1949-50. 929 House hurly-burly of metropolitan l if e and who have no air transport operating between the country town3 of their electorates and the capital cities, have to use the railways. When Parliament is in recess, I travel 50 miles on six days a week more often than not from my home to the Federal Members' Rooms in Brisbane. I trust, therefore, that the Minister will not accept the opinions of the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt ) and the honourable member for Watson (Mr Falstein) as the opinion of the committee as a whole. I consider that the matter should be examined, but not with a view to abolishing the gold pass as a means of allowing honourable members to travel by railway. I use the railways to travel to remote parts of my electorate. I consider that the object for which the gold pass was originally issued to members of Parliament was to permit such travel. Before anything final is done in relation to this matter the views of all honourable members should he considered. The matter should be referred to the House committee which should make its recommendations to the Government. I repeat, however, that I hope that the Government will not reach any decision to abolish the gold pass or adopt the suggestions made here today without giving the closest consideration to all aspects of the matter.",43
218,Mr BEAZLEY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Fremantle) [3.21] I shall deal with, a point that arises from the remarks of the honourable member for Bourke (Mrs Blackburn) in relation to the facilities in this building for the staff, which, she said, were inadequate. Parliament House, in Canberra, unlike the parliament houses in the States, is the seat of actual administrative govern- I ment as well as of the legislature. If one compares the Western Australian Parliament House in Perth, which is not a very good building, with this Parliament House, one finds that Ministers in that State have their offices scattered throughout the City of Perth instead of having them in the parliamentary building itself. Therefore, the problem of staff facilities does not arise there. When this Parliament House was built, it was designed to be a temporary Parliament House only. It was not intended to be an administrative centre as well as a Parliament House. As a result of its use for administrative as well as legislative purposes, accommodation for staff in the building has always been inadequate. Only a very large building programme would meet the suggestions of the honourable member for Bourke. I was surprised to hear that honourable member say that the staff had no dining-room facilities in the building. If that is so, it is quite wrong that men should be allowed to use the minor dining-room on the northern side of the member's billiard-room. If there is any ukase that excludes members of the staff from using that dining-room while pressmen ai-e permitted to use it, it should be altered. I do uot say definitely that members of the press should be excluded, because I am certain that typists from ministerial staffs frequently use the minor dining-room. I turn now to the accommodation provided for members of Parliament themselves, because I believe that imderlying the planning of this building was an idea which has led to discrimination against the House of Representatives in favour of the Senate. That discrimination, in view of the Australian Constitution, was based on fallacious premises. I am sure that if the honourable member for Bourke were not an Independent with a private 'room to herself she would have raised the subject of the accommodation of members of Parliament. Members of the three main parties have to share common rooms in which they have to deal with a very considerable quantity of mail. Only Independents, certain ex-Ministers and Privy Councillors have private rooms. The locker accommodation of members, the mail facilities and the opportunity that they have of peacefully attending to their correspondence in each common room, are necessarily poor. The reason simply is that when this building was erected it was considered that, apparently because the American Senate is more important than the American House of Representatives, the Australian Senate would be more important than the Australian House of Representatives. if r . Beazley. was no justification for that assumption other than that both the American Seriate and the Australian Senate bear the name of Senate. The Australian Constitution definitely makes the Senate a weak house by comparison with the American Senate. Yet senators in this Parliament have private rooms in which to deal with their correspondence and to do otherwork such as preparing their speeches. It is an objective fact that the Senate meets very much lass frequently than does the House of Representatives and it is also press- an objective fact that members of the Senate, not being known personally within confined constituencies, get less correspondence than do members of the House of Representatives. I do not think that an honest case can be made out for the provision of private rooms for all members of the Senate and of only a large common room for members of the House of Representatives. I think that in disposing of the new rooms that will become available on the completion of the enlargement of this building consideration should be given to the allotment of rooms to members of the House of Representatives. A great many rooms in this building have been allotted to the press. I doubt whether in any parliament elsewhere such facilities have been granted to the press in relation to all the facilities available. I certainly doubt whether the facilities that are granted to members of other parliaments are as poor as are those made available to members of the House of Representatives in this building. I should like the Minister to state whether in the enlargement of the parliamentary building which is now taking place any consideration has been given to the allotment of rooms to members of the House of Representatives in the same way as, for a long time, rooms have been, allotted to members of the Senate.",43
219,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Corio-Minister for Defence and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [3.27] - I am not in the position to inform the honourable member for Eremantle (Mr Beazley) whether any provision has been made for separate rooms to be provided for honourable members in the new portion of the parliamentary building that is now under conThere struction. I shall ask the appropriate Minister, either the Minister for Works aiid Housing (Mr Lemmon) or the Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson), to supply the information.",44
220,Mr FRASER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Eden-Monaro) [3.28]. - I enter this discussion merely to contest, the acceptance of the point of view that - this chamher is now not only a permanent place of assembly for the Parliament of the nation, hut also a permanent place in which administrative staffs, other than the parliamentary staffs, are housed. This building was not planned for that dual purpose. You, Mr Deputy Chairman, having been a member of the Parliament since it was transferred to Canberra, well know that this building has not always been an administrative as well as a legislative centre. Up to the outbreak of World War II . , it was customary for Ministers to have their offices in their own departments, which are located in buildings scattered throughout this city. During the war when the War Cabinet and the Advisory War Council had to meet at very short notice and when continuous consultation between Ministers was necessary to deal with emergencies suddenly arising, a practice gradually developed in which Ministers left their departments and established themselves wholly in this building with one or two members of their personal staffs. The number of Ministers and their personal staffs who have remained in the building has increased with the years. I suppose that private members of this Parliament would face an extremely difficult task if they endeavoured to uproot those Ministers and their staffs and return them to their departments where they would be in the centre of their administration and able to exercise close and personal control over all their officers. To bring about that result would indeed be a difficult task. Nevertheless, I contest the suggestion that we should accept as permanent this intrusion upon the proper purposes of a parliamentary building. I trust that when the new permanent administrative block is completed Ministers will immediately, either voluntarily or by the vote of their fellow members, transfer themselves and their personal staffs thereto. It is desirable that private members should enjoy better facilities and privileges in the way of accommodation than they can possibly possess in this building as its rooms are now allotted. I happen to be one of the few members of this chamber who enjoys the privilege of a private room. I have a private room, because I live in Canberra and make Canberra my head-quarters for the conduct of my electoral business. I have a private room only because of considerable determination and insistence on my part that in these circumstances I should have a private room. The view was very clearly expressed to me that I had no right to a private room in this building and that I should ask the Department of the Interior to provide a room for me at Civic Centre, where I could conduct my business as a member of the Parliament. When the system was established of appointing typist-secretaries for each member, the typewriter which I had formerly used and which belonged to the House of Representatives was taken away from me. I made some protest about that. The officials said, "" You cannot have this typewriter; it belongs to the House of Representatives "". I said, "" I am a member of the House of Representatives "". They said, "" If you are a member of the House of Representatives, you should apply to the Department of the Interior for a typewriter. You are certainly not entitled to a machine which belongs to the House of Representatives "". That is the position in which I and all other private members find themselves. It is wrong that members of the Parliament should be beholden in any way to the Department of the Interior for the supply of facilities to enable them to carry on their duties as members of the Parliament. It is wrong that in the employment of our typist-secretaries, and in the provision of facilities which we need for the discharge of our duties, we should be beholden in any way to an outside government department. Control over the provision of such facilities should be exercised by the President and Mr. Speaker and the officers of the Parliament who are under their control. I add my support to the request that further consideration be given to the provision of proper facilities for members of the Parliament who, as servants of the people, are required to work in this building.

Any references to proposed expenditure in this financial year must be made at the appropriate places in the Estimates. That is the ruling of Chair and no points of order will be tolerated.",47
249,Mr FRANCIS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I note that a siderable amount of money has been vided for the payment of "" temporary casual employees "" in various branches the Prime Minister's Department. For instance, £146,000 has been earability marked under that heading for the High Commissioner's office in the United Kingdom, £14,000 for the administrative section of the department, £89,300 for the Audit Office, £15,000 for the Public Service Board, £1,600 for the Governorcies General's office, and £4,000 for the National Library. The total of £270,000 almost staggers me. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) should explain why that extraordinarily large sum is provided for casual and porary employees in various sections the Prime Minister's Department. I am one of those persons who strongly believe in the principle of preference in employheads ment for ex-service men and women. I had been employed. know that the Commonwealth, under the Re-establishment and Employment Act, is obliged to grant preference to ex-serviceimportant men and women when persons are being of appointed to positions in the Public I shall be interested to learn whether in other departments have made such substantial provision for casual and temporary employees as the Prime Minisan ter's Department has done. A considerable number of temporary and casual emthe ployees are .ex-service men and women who have worked in Commonwealth offices since the end of the war and they should be given an opportunity to qualify for permanent appointment. I recall that after World War I . , ex-servicemen were able to sit for an examination, at a standard somewhat lower than that which is set for other persons who desire co be appointed permanently to the Public Service, and the successful candidates were able to become permanent in certain groups of the Public and within certain salary ranges. I hope that temporary and casual employees of the Commonwealth at the present time will be given a similar opportunity to qualify for permanent appointment to the Puhlic Service. This the Government constantly prates about social security for the people, but ex-service men and women, who are temporary public servants, have very little consecurity in employment. We have proexperienced a protracted global war, and during which the Government called of upon all men and women to play their part to the best of their in order to bring the struggle to a successful conclusion. While the war was in progress, the recruitment of permanent officers of the Public Service almost ceased, and many vacancies occurred. After World War I . , the vacanwere filled in two ways. University students were invited to seek appointment, and, as I stated, ex-servicemen had an opportunity to sit for an examination at a standard somewhat lower than that of the usual Public Service examination, temwith a view to qualifying for appoint of ment to positions in certain groups. Reports on the ability of those applicants were also obtained from the permanent of the departments in which they The time is long overdue when such branches of the Prime Minister's Department as the High Commissioner's office in the United Kingdom should employ a larger percentage of permanent employees to temporary and casual employees. I ask the Minister for Post-war Eeoonstruction to bring my protest to the notice of the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley). I understand that a large number of the temporary and casual employees at the present time are ex-service men and women, who should be given an opportunity to become permanent employees in the Public Service. Probably, millions of pounds a year are being paid to temporary and casual employees. I r is a monstrous state of affairs. Sucb employees are entitled to security, aibout which the Government members talk so much. The Public Service Board should consider the matter.",47
250,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Corio - Minister for Defence and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [3.46] - The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Erancis) has raised the general question of the number of temporary employees in the Public Service compared with the number of permanent employees, and has suggested that the Government should appoint more permanent officers.",48
251,Mr ERANCIS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Fro m amongst present temporary employees.,48
252,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Yes . The honourable member has touched upon a matter which applies to the Public Service generally. Almost every day, we read in the newspapers advertisements inviting applications for various positions in the Public Service, but the fact is that the Public Service Board is finding it very difficult to get persons to fill permanent positions. The Government is already doing everything possible to make suitable appointments to permanent positions. It remains true, however, that in various Commonwealth departments, including the office of the Australian High Commissioner in the United Kingdom, it is necessary to employ temporary officers upon duties which, by their nature, are themselves temporary. For instance, many persons employed in the High Commissioner's office in the United Kingdom engaged upon work in connection with Australia's expanded immigration policy to deal with the large number of immigrants passing through London on their way to Australia. The present flow of displaced persons from Europe is not expected to continue. Indeed, we have been informed by the International Refugee Organization that the number of displaced persons coming to Australia is likely to diminish greatly at the end of two years. It is possible that immigration, even from the United Kingdom, may also decline in the future. I am sure that the honourable member would not wish us to appoint permanent officers to the Immigration Department to do work of a temporary character.",48
253,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Barker) [3.48] - I should like the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) to inform the committee, if he can, whether the Government has given any consideration to filling the position of High Commissioner for Australia in the United Kingdom, and particularly whether he has given any personal consideration to the acceptance of that position. It would the a relief to the minds of many of us if he could say that he has definitely set his face against the idea. If , however, he has not done so, we should be much obliged if he would let us know, the so that we may accustom ourselves to his absence.",48

I made that statement to press representatives not long ago in order to correct an impression that might have got abroad as the result of newspaper speculation. Apparently, those who control the newspapers did not think, the matter of sufficient importance to give it any prominence.

275,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"We may deal with the Audit Office, I presume?",49
276,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Yes.,49
277,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The amount of £310,000 is proposed to be set aside for the public audit of the Commonwealth accounts, and, in general, when an auditor is appointed by an organization, whether it be a public company or a national parliament, it is customary for notice to be taken of the observations of that auditor. If the directors of a public company failed to take notice of the observations of the auditor, they would have to take the consequences in two different ways. One would be by prosecution for mismanagement of funds and the other would be by being supplanted by the shareholders. But, in the case of a government, there is no redress except that a government must face the electorate every three years. But there should be no necessity for any suggestion of that kind if the Government gave effect to the provisions of the Audit Act of the findings of the Auditor-General. We see that £310,000 is to be voted, and properly so, for the protection of the public accounts so that no one may misuse public funds and there shall be no misappropriation or irregularities of like character. we find each year-I am not referring specifically to this year, because the matter can be taken back over several years-that when the Auditor-General directs the attention of the Parliament, and particularly the Government, to some irregularities, his observations are completely ignored by the Government. He does his duty. He points out the faults. He cannot do any more if the Government refuses to take any notice. Let us look at some of the things that he reported on, and about which nothing has been done, so far as I know. In the 1947-48 report, he made the point that the total loss by the services departments for five years amounted to £470,536. So far as the Parliament has been concerned, not a thing has been done about that. A year or so earlier he directed attention to the misuse by Mr. Speaker of certain motor car services and to improper billing of the department. So far as we know, that account was paid by the Government. Mr Speaker said, in efTect, that the Auditor-General meant nothing to him. If we are to expend the very great sum of £310,000, which is the best part of one-third of £1,000,000, to maintain the Audit Office, a highly necessary office, and then have the Auditor General's report, when it is submitted to the Parliament, completely discounted, the taxpayer gets very little value from Mr Anthony. the supervision exercised over the Government. As a matter of fact, the Auditor-General's report has frequently been withheld from this Parliament for a period long after it could have been presented to it. I therefore hope that there will be a little more respect for the proper supervision of the public accounts than we have enjoyed in the past. I think I shall leave it at that. On your ruling, Mr Temporary Chairman, I cannot discuss the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization.",49
278,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"At the proper time, you can.",50
279,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Ver y well. I shall have to accept your ruling, although T notice the sum of £870,000",50
280,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Order! The honourable member is getting dangerously close to defying the Chair. But Mr ANTHONY - If we are not. to be permitted to discuss this item, why is it here?",50
281,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,It is there only as information in connection with the Estimates for last year. There is no proposed vote for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in these estimates.,50
282,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Ver y well. I come to the division that make provision for the Public Service Board. I do not know whether I shall be ruled out of order if I refer to particular departments, but I understand that appointments to all departments are made by the Public Service Board. They include appointments to the Patents Office. I have recently had occasion, on behalf of a constituent, to inquire why there has been such unseemly delay in dealing with applications for patents.",50
283,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,That does not concern the Public Service Board.,50
284,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Pardo n me. I was informed that the reason for the delays was that the Public Service Board had not made the appointments necessary to enable the Patents Oflice to carry out its duties. The people in charge of the office claimed that the office is understaffed and is two years behind with many applications. They say that the whole trouble is that they cannot secure the appointment of the necessary staff. I understand that only the Public Service Board can make the appointments. They told me that they were short of four examiners and that they have only one man doing the job of examining scores and perhaps hundreds of applications for patents. People who submit applications for patents, trade marks, designs and the like are entitled to reasonably prompt dealing. If appointments are not made because of the failure of the Public Service Board to make them, and no other agency can make them, there is a state of inefficiency in almost every department. The Public Service Board in its turn, will probably say that it has advertised vacancies. To be an examiner of patents in most cases a person must have had a university training; frequently a man with legal training is required. My opinion is that the salaries offered for the positions are so poor in contrast with what men with similar qualifications can get in other vocations, that no one, or practically no one, applies for the jobs. I say, therefore, that it is time that the Public Service Board reviewed the range of salaries that it offers in contrast with the range of salaries and rewards offered by outside organizations. Unless something is done about the situation, essential Commonwealth departments will be behind in dealing vvith the needs of the public in a score of ways. I have mentioned the Patents Office, but there is a back-log of applications in the Department of Trade and Customs and other departments, including, if you like, the Taxation Branch, from which it takes a long time to get a reply to a letter, as every honourable member knows. I refer to the administration of the Public Service Board, because each department is dependent for appointments to its staff on the salary range established by the board. I have had a little to do with the board in one way. and another. For a little while I helped to administer it. I know that the fault does not always lie with the men in charge of the board but it goes a little higher and involves government policy in relation to how far it will go in granting increased salary ranges or in giving the board authority to L31] widen the advantages that applicants may have. But the fact remains that there is inefficiency in a number of departments of the Public Service. There is a delay of up to two years in the Patents Office, because of lack of staff. I hope that something will be done. When we come to the appropriate departments, I may be more specific, but within the limits bf the proposed vote for the Public Service Board, I make the observation that unless some^ thing is done, we shall have a very much inconvenienced public for some time to come.",50
285,Mrs BLACKBUBJST,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Bourke) [4.7] Division 12 deals with the Public Service Board. I direct attention to the fact that some members of the Public Service have been asking for increases of salary by 75 per cent, over the 1939 figures, so as to bring their salaries into line with those paid in outside industry. I hope that the representations that have been made by those persons are receiving consideration. If they are being paid at a lower rate than is paid by private employers, surely they have a just case. I hope that something will be done about it. I have before me a letter from a superannuated public servant, one who has been superannuated for more than twenty years. He points out some matters of interest in these termsIn 1922, when the Superannuation Act came ' into force, the then Auditor-General insisted upon all superannuated officers paying duty stamps each fortnight for their superannuation cheques, until one bright officer contested his action, when it was at once decided that the amount of all these duty stamps had to be refunded on the ground that all superannuation was "" to be paid in full without any deductions "".",51
286,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am sorry to interrupt the honourable member, but she will have to await the Estimates for the Treasury before being able to deal with superannuation.",51
287,Mrs BLACKBURN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"There are many things that may be said about the Public Service Board. From information that has been given to me from time to time. I can only conclude that there is a hopeJess state of muddle somewhere, and I urge that everything possible be done to clear it up. I shall not go into detail about that. 'The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) has just given some information that seems to support a great deal of the information that haB been given to me.",51
288,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Balaclava) [4.10] - I should like some information about the item "" Leasehold office premisesrental, upkeep and alterations"" that appears under Division 15, "" High Commissioner's Office, United Kingdom"", which shows an estimated expenditure of £56,820. Expenditure for this purpose last year was £63,460. That expenditure has nothing to do with the expenditure proper in connection with the High Commissioner, who is very well catered for and is by no means ou the "" bread-line "". The estimates show that this year he will have £9,790 for incidental and other expenditure. That has nothing to do with his salary. This item, which amounts to £56,820, or more than £1,000 a week, is apparently for some premises that the High Commissioner is using. Where are these premises? Honourable members who know Australia House in London know that it has sufficient accommodation for all the activities of this Commonwealth in that city. It seems to me that the Government is displaying in London the same habit as it shows in Australia of taking over public buildings to accommodate obscure departments. I put a question on the notice-paper some weeks ago asking what leaseholds were held by the Commonwealth in Sydney and Melbourne and what properties had been acquired in recent years. That question does not now appear on the notice-paper hecause I was told that it would take some time to compile an answer. I presume that I shall get the answer some time the next general election. It appears from this item that somebody has appointed a director of sorts in London and provided him with accommodation. I may, of course, be wrong. The premises may be in use for some very important department controlled-by some very important person in the Government. In any event, somebody has apparently appointed a director or controller or some other official with a high sounding title. In such cases an office is found for the official, a typewriter and two or three staff hands are obtained for him, and in no time he has a huge department. This must be a huge department if it accounts for £56,820 for rental, upkeep and alteration of premises. To be quite fair to the department I quote a footnote which readsIncludes wages of stafT employed on upkeep as follows:-1949-50 , Vote, £7,640. 1948-49, Vote, £6,680; Expenditure, £6,684. Will the Mmister tell the committee to what this item refers?",52
289,Mr LANG,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Reid) [4.13] - ! trust that I shall have more luck than I have had in previous attempts to address the committee.,52
290,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Order! The honourable gentleman will have all the luck he desires if he keeps within the Standing Orders.,52
291,Mr LANG,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Provisio n is made in the Estimates for a number of private secretaries. I refer you, Mr Temporary Chairman, to page 197 of the Estimates. Those private secretaries include not only those attached to the offices of the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) but also to the leaders of other parties, and to at least one Minister. I should like some information regarding the industrial conditions enjoyed by the private secretaries that are employed by Ministers and other members of this Parliament. I understand that the private secretaries have some kind of an industrial association of their own which has been finding it very difficult to obtain any satisfaction regarding their industrial conditions. A private secretary is often at the beck and call of a Minister at all hours. When the House sits at night he has to stand by. He often works at the weekafter ends and very often is expected to take an interest in the electoral affairs of the Minister. He attends meetings and frequently has no leisure time. The Prime Minister told us recently that Dr Coombs, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, had had no holidays for eight years. Surely that was not in accordance with public service conditions. The 40-hour week is only a myth to the ministerial private secretary. Some private secretaries have been lucky enough to be appointed to higher positions, but the positions of others remain stationary. A Labour government should he the first government to ensure that the working conditions of its own personal staff shall be above reproach. It should ensure the rigid observance of the 40-hour week in respect of its employees. A Minister is in a very different position from that of his secretary, because he is compensated for his long, hours of work. During the life of this Parliament Ministers have received a very substantial increase of their remuneration, but I am told that the only, occasion on which ministerial private secretaries received any recognition was during the very brief period when the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) was Prime Minister. I should like the Prime Minister to investigate the conditions of private secretaries and to ascertain whether or not the Public .Service Board has ruled that they must take their annual recreation leave of three weeks within a calendar year, that if they do not do so they may carry the leave over for only one year on the authority of a certificate from the head of the department, and that the remainder of the accumulated leave shall be forfeited. Some private secretaries are no doubt in the same position as Dr Coombs and have had no leave for many years. They might go for eight years without a holiday because Ministers could not release them, and they lose all their accumulated leave. In addition, applications for overtime on their behalf have been rejected. If a private secretary has to work at night or on Sundays why should he not receive the ruling overtime rates? Why should he he restricted to a flat weekly salary? Those are not trade union principles. I understand that applications by private secretaries for tea money also have been rejected. What other section of employees isi expected to pay for more than one. meal a day while at work ? It would be a very paltry action indeed to refuse teamoney in such circumstances. realise that these people are only temporary public servants; nevertheless many of them have very responsible positions. They are engaged in highly confidential work and are even called upon to make important decisions. They should be paid accordingly. When a government goes out of office the new Ministers have the right to bring in their own private secretaries, which I consider to be right and proper. If a private secretary has been a known political supporter of a Minister-and several of them are-the n he must expect to go out when the government falls. The jobs of private secretaries are a part of the spoils of office. For that reason, private secretaries have no security. They may be dumped on to the industrial scrap-heap after years of faithful service, without even having the right to claim holiday pay that is due to them and that has been due for many years. Many of them work on Six Hour Day. Other public servants receive a day's pay in lieu of such public holidays, but a Minister's private secretary does not come under any such provision. As they are apparently expected at all times to promote the idea that we have reached the golden age, it might be worthwhile to give them a slight personal interest ih it. Most of them have performed, their duties faithfully for a number of years and there is no reason why they should not become permanent members of the Public Service.",52
292,Mr SPENDER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,They should be appointed by the Public Service Board.,53
293,Mr LANG,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I am putting up a fight for them.,53
294,Mr SPENDER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable member is not doing it very well.,53
295,Mr LANG,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am putting up a fight for theunder-dog. It is essential that persons wh© are engaged in work of that kind should have some security of tenure. A government may remain in office forfrom five to ten years. Ministers' private secretaries who have done their work well should not be cast to the wolves immediately after the Ministers whom they have served have relinquished office-. Irrespective of what government they haveserved, the loyalty of these officers I has never been questioned. Why, then, should they be kept on a slave labour status? I ask the Government to give them a fair deal. If no voice is raised in this Parliament on their behalf, what can they do to help themselves? We may yet see private secretaries picketing Ministers and demanding the same rights as are demanded by members of self-respect^ ing trade unions. I urge the Government to employ these officers on a permanent basis.",53
296,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Corio-Minister for Defence and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [4.29] - The honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) has referred to the pay and conditions of employment of private secretaries generally. Only nine private secretaries are covered by the proposed vote now before the Chair. This vote does not cover the salaries of private secretaries to Ministers other than the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) and the Vice-President of the Executive Council (Mr Scully). The details are given at page 197 of the Estimates. It will he seen from a perusal of the details that provision is made for £7,422 for private secretaries, numbering nine, who are filling unclassified positions. It covers the two private secretaries to the Prime Minister, both of whom are permanent officers of the Public Service; the private secretary to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who, I understand, is also a permanent officer; the secretary to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Cooper), who, I believe, is a permanent officer; and the private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives (Mr Menzies). I understand that the present private secretary to. the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber is a lady who has been seconded from the Public Service for that duty. It also covers the private secretary to the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison), who is deputy leader of the Opposition, the leader (Mr Eadden) and deputy leader (Mr MCEwen) of the Australian Country party and the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page). I understand of the nine private secretaries concerned five are permanent officers of the Public Service. The salaries of private secretaries to other Ministers are included in the estimates of the department concerned. The honourable member could have had in mind only the nine private secretaries to whom I have leferred, and since the majority of them have been allotted to Opposition members, any criticism of their rates of pay and conditions should have been directed to those members. The rates of pay and conditions of service of the private secretaries to the Prime Minister and the Vice-President of the Executive Council are laid down by the Public Service Board. They have a right to appeal against the conditions of their employment, if they desire to do so. They would not have applied for their positions when those positions became vacant had they not desired to occupy them. They applied for appointment knowing that' the conditions of their employment had been laid down by the Public Service Board. Within the last twelve months or so the private secretaries have formed themselves into an association. As far as I am aware the newly formed association has not made any complaints about, nor has it discussed with the appropriate authorities, hours of work, overtime and the other conditions of employment that were dealt with by the honourable member for Reid. It is true that the association has considered certain matters affecting its members. I believe that in the near future certain recommendations will be made to the appropriate authorities in relation to those matters. Whether such recommendations will be submitted to the Prime Minister or to the Public Service Board, I do not know. When the submissions are made they will he carefully considered hy the Government. As I have said, if the honourable member for Reid has any criticism to offer of the conditions of employment of the non-permanent private secretaries covered by this item, he should direct it to members sitting on the Opposition benches. Of course, he would not do so because he is their de facto leader. that The honourable member for Bourke (Mrs Blackburn) referred to the claim for a 75 per cent, increase in the salaries of public servants generally, and then proceeded to deal with the position of superannuated officers. The Chair very properly ruled that the subject of superannuation could he dealt with only when the estimates for the Treasury were under discussion. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) asked for information relating to premises which are leased in London by the Australian High Commissioner. Apparently the honourable member was very critical of the Government's action in leasing premises in London.",54
297,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I merely wanted to know what premises were leased and for what purpose they were leased. Mr Dedman"" - Apar t from Australia House, the only premises leased in London are Canberra House and a portion of Africa House. At Canberra House most of the representatives of the service departments are housed.",55
298,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,How can the additional expenditure involved be justified?,55
299,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It was necessary to obtain additional premises so that the staffs of the Department of Defence and of the service departments generally could be housed at one centre. These staffs have grown numerically - as the result of the plans of the Government for achieving greater co-operation with the United Kingdom Government in defence matters. It would be impossible to carry out a plan such as this Government has conceived for accepting a greater share of responsibility for the defence of the British Commonwealth, without providing suitable office accommodation in London for the housing of the requisite staffs. The provision of accommodation at Africa House was made necessary because of the expansion of scientific research work in London. A British Commonwealth scientific research organization has been established in Great Britain, and at a conference held in London two years ago it was agreed that the interests of scientific research would be much better met if all the research omcers of the dominions and of the United Kingdom were accommodated in the same premises. Obviously, Canadian research officers were located at Canada House, Australian research oflScers at Australia House, and South African research officers at Africa House, it would not be easy to make the contacts that are so necessary in scientific research officers come under the adminisit was decided that all the scientific research oflieers from the United Kingdom and the Dominions should be accommodated at Africa House. There is constant contact between the Australian research officers at Africa House and the officials at Australia House. The lesearch. officers come under the administrative control of the High Commissioner. That should be a suflicient explanation of the reason for renting premises outside of Australia House.",55
300,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The premises cost the Commonwealth £1,000 a week.",55
301,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member always complains that this Government is not doing very much about the defence of this country, but immediately it sets out to establish closer contact with the defence authorities of the United Kingdomand the other Dominions, so that strategic planning and general defence plans may be properly coordinated and integrated, he objects on the ground of the expense involved. Obviously, he does not know whether he is coming or going. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) referred to the staffing of the Patent Office. The Patent Office is administered by the Attorney-General, who can explain more properly than I can, why he has been unable to obtain the staff that is required to deal with the applications as they come forward. It is true that members of the staff must possess high qualifications, and that the Public Service Board determines the classifications that are applicable to those oflieers, and, therefore, has a considerable voice in fixing the salaries that are offered. In that respect, I suppose, it may be said that if the remuneration is not sufficiently high to attract a staff large enough to handle the work, the Public Service Board may be criticized; but I believe that the scale of salaries that is paid to employees in the Patent Office may be dealt with more appropriately under the proposed if vote for the Attorney-General's Department., The Attorney-General himself is in a much better position than I am to give a detailed explanation of the shortage of staff in that section.",55
302,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Balaclava) [4.41] - I thought that the Minister for Defence (Mr Dedman) would give a reasoned explanation of this great expenditure in London. Of course, he tries to twist statements that are made by honourable members of the Opposition. All I wanted to know waa the reason for this proposed expenditure, because the amount exceeds the cost of the upkeep of Australia House itself. Honourable members who are familiar with Australia House know that it is a huge 'building capable of containing these extra military sections. Members of the Opposition strongly support proposals for the closest co-operation with the United Kingdom Government. During the war, when the position was really serious, the Army and Naval staffs were accommodated in Australia House. The Royal Australian A i r Force was housed in other premises, which it vacated at the end of the war. However, the Minister will not evade the issue by abusing members of the Opposition. His idea of providing adequate defence is to expend large sums of money. He has stated that in the course of a few years an amount of £250,000,000 will be expended on the Defence forces. What protection shall we receive for that vast expenditure? In the Royal Australian Navy, the number of non-combatants compared with combatants is higher than it has ever been. In the Australian army the number of the "" chair-borne "" troops is now out of all proportion to the total strength.",55
303,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Order! The honourable member must relate his remarks to the estimates of the Prime Minister's Department.,56
304,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I was merely drawing a parallel between what is happening here and what is happening elsewhere. The Minister has stated that the Commonwealth has hired a portion of Africa House to accommodate the staff of the Commonwealth Scientific and In dustrial Research Organization in order that the omcers may keep in close touch with the scientific staffs of other dominions. Whilst I strongly support any move for closer co-operation between the United Kingdom and the various dominions, I point out that if the staff of the Council for Scientific and dustrial Research could be accommodated in Australia House during the war, they could be housed there now. The Minister has stated that Canberra House has been acquired for the Army staff. What is the size of the army staff that Canberra House should be required to house them? That is typical of the extravagance of this Government. We see evidence of it in our own cities, but overseas, extravagant expenditure is incurred for the glorification of some Ministers when they travel. The tittering Minister for Repatriation (Mr Barnard) has not had an opportunity to travel. When he loses his seat at the next general election, perhaps he will be able to go abroad to some ministerial post in Brazil or Chile, on the maintenance of which the Government is expending dollars for no good purpose. The previous Minister for Repatriation, Mr Frost, who lost his seat at the last general election, was given a job as Trade Commissioner in Ceylon, so the Minister might yet have an opportunity to travel. The Minister for Defence should have explained in a reasonable manner the various points that have been raised by members of the Opposition. Our submissions deserve greater attention than he is prepared to give to them.",56
305,Mr FALSTEIN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Watson) [4.44] - My remarks relate to the proposed vote for the High Commissioner's office in the United Kingdom. All that I desire to learn about that particular vote, which constitutes almost one-half of the entire vote for the Prime Minister's Department, is the reason for including it in the estimates for the Prime Minister's Department, because the proposed votes for high commissioners to various dominions are included in the estimates of the Department of External Affairs. Has the proposed vote for the High Commissioner's office in the United Kingdom been placed in this position in order to bolster up the Prime Minister's Department ? Would it not be more appropriate if the votes for all the high commissioners were placed in the estimates for the Department of External Affairs? Perhaps there is a reason for including the proposed vote for the High Commissioner's office in the United Kingdom in In - the estimates for the Prime Minister's Department, but I am not aware of it.",56
306,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Corio-Minister for Defence and Minister for Post;war Reconstruction) [4.45] - I am afraid that I cannot explain to the honourable member for Watson (Mr Falstein) precisely why the proposed vote for the High Commissioner's office in the United Kingdom is included in the estimates for the Prime Minister's Department, whilst the proposed votes for the high commissioners to various dominions are included in the estimates for the Department of External Affairs. All I know is that the High Commissioner's office in the United Kingdom has always heen attached to the office of the Prime Minister in Australia. As the honourable gentleman will realise, there is definitely a difference between our relations with the United Kingdom Government and our relations with, say, foreign powers.",56
307,Mr FALSTEIN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I was not speaking about our relations with foreign powers.,57
308,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable gentleman seemed to consider that the High Commissioner's office in the United Kingdom could be attached more appropriately to the Department of External Affairs.,57
309,Mr FALSTEIN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,-Yes.,57
310,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I am dealing with that particular point.,57
311,Mr MCEWEN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member for Watson referred, not to Australia's relations with foreign powers, but to its relations with other dominions.",57
312,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I ask the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) to be patient. He will have an opportunity to express his views, should he desire to do so, but at the moment, I should like to make my explanation without interruption. The honourable member for Watson will realise that there is a great difference between our relations with the United Kingdom Government and our relations with foreign powers. That is the reason why, traditionally, the High Commissioner's office in the United Kingdom has always been attached to the Prime Minister's Department instead of being under the jurisdiction of the Minister for External Affairs.",57
313,Mr HOLT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Canada , South Africa and New Zealand are not foreign powers, yet the proposed votes for the High Commissioners to those dominions are included in the estimates for the Department of External Affairs.",57
314,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Perhaps the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) will explain to the committee why it was that when he was a member of a government, the same position held good. Proposed vote agreed to. DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS.. Proposed vote, £1,005,000.",57
315,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Parramatta) [4.47] - I notice that the proposed vote of £1,005,000 for the Department of External Affairsthis year is slightly more than the proposed vote for 1948-49; but I have nodoubt that the expenditure this year will considerably exceed the estimate, because the history of this department over the years that I have been observing it shows that it is a constantly inflating body. It inflates itself rather like a bladder is inflated. The pumping is done by an industrious gentleman, and, in the process, he inflates the importance of the department that he administers. My observations on this department will be very simple, homely and easy to understand. The day must come when honourable members will decide that the Commonwealth cannot continue to expend more and more money on this kind of department. I observe that the proposed vote for the Australian Embassy in the United States of America is £100,000. That estimate was made, of course, before the devaluation of the £1 in relation to the dollar, so I assume that the revised estimate of our expenditure on our embassy in the United States of America this year will be approximately £130,000. We must ask ourselves whether, in the light of the service we are getting, such an enormous expenditure can be justified. An amount of £70,200 has been provided for the payment of salaries and allowances, whilst the estimate of expenditure on postage, telegrams, telephone serviees and cablegrams is £21,600. The Australian taxpayer will want to know whether that expenditure is justified. I yield to no one in appreciating the importance of Australia having proper representation abroad but we should have some feeling for the taxpayer, who must meet the bill. The Government should give a detailed explanation of the reason for these astronomical figures of proposed expenditure. I consider that the services that we receive from our embassy in the .United States of America do not justify expenditure at the rate of £100,000 per annum. In addition to the cost of the Australian Embassy in the United States of America, we propose to expend this £25,500 on the general expenses of office of the Consul-General in New York, and £7,200 for a similar purpose the consular representation in San pression Francisco. I assume that both suls perform the duties of trade representatives of this country. I have always understood the situaAffairs tion, representatiou at the embassy level is of much higher significance than representation at the trade level. gravely suspicious that Australia is getting its money's worth from the embassy in the United States of America. If the Government claims that Australia is receiving full value for the expenditure that is incurred thereon, honourable members should be given more information about it. I notice also that an amount of £61,000 has been provided for the Australian Embassy in France. That figure includes salaries and allowances, £39,500, postage, telegrams, telephone services and cablelegation. grams, £10,300, and a string of incidentals totalling nearly £9,000.",57
316,Mr SPENDER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Is any provision made for wines?,58
317,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I imagine that lurking concealed in some innocent corner of these items there may be some provision for wines. I do not begrudge expenditure on diplomatic representation provided can be justified. What return does tralia receive from the expenditure of £61,000 on our embassy in France? I have yet to he satisfied that it is adequate. In comparison with the proposed votes the Australian Embassies in the United States of America and France, the estiestablish mated expenditure on our legation in Brazil is only chicken feed. The amount that is provided this year is £12,200.",58
318,Mr CONELAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,That is indeed chicken feed.,58
319,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,We know that the if honourable member for Griffith (Mr. Conelan) deals in big money. I should like to know why Australia has a legation in Brazil. Do we trade with that country,58
320,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Nuts !,58
321,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"That may be the complete answer. Have we any relations with the Government of Brazil that justify expenditure of £12,200 of the taxthe payers' money? Some time ago, the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) let slip on some information that gave us the imthat the Australian Legations in conBrazil and Chile had been established as a part of an arrangeAs ment when the Minister for External (Dr Evatt) was seeking a little moral and political support for one of is the claims that he was pressing at the I am United Nations. That might, in a not cynical world, be said to justify the establishment of these legations, but it cannot justify their continuation. Yet, in 1949-50, it is still proposed to expend this large amount of money.",58
322,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,And in dollars.,58
323,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Yes , the estimate was prepared before the currency was depreciated in relation to dollars, so that it will now cost us 43 per cent. more. We now turn from Brazil to Chile, where it is proposed to expend £2,000 on our",58
324,Mr RYAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,What about Patagonia?,58
325,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The only reason that Patagonia has been left out, I suppose, is that it was not prepared to vote in the right way. I note that expenditure on our representation in Chile has suffered a substantial decline, and I trust that the dignity of the Chileans will not be hurt. In 1948-49, the amount was £6,278.' For it 1949-50 it is to be £2,000. I suppose Ausexpenditure is being reduced because Chile is no longer of any use to us. That merely emphasizes the fact that the legation in Chile should never have been for established. Indeed, it was the height of cynicism and poor, trashy politics to it in the first place. In Eire, it is proposed to expend £13,000 on the High Commissioner's office. I am sure the honourable member for Griffith will appreciate that.",58
326,Mr CONELAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,It is not enough.,58
327,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"As a good ""Eirean'', that is the word, he may think that it Ls not enough. I submit that no evidence has been placed before the Parliament to justify the expenditure of such a large ? amount of money on the High Commissioner's office in Eire.",58
328,Mr CONELAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Did the honourable member go to Eire?,59
329,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,No .,59
330,Mr CONELAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable member did not have enough sense to do so.,59
331,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member for Griffith went there, but whether at the public expense or his own I do not know. Perhaps he can tell us that the High Commissioner for Australia in Eire, who is a friend of mine, is living under comfortable conditions. I hope he is. For the moment, however, I want to know, not whether he is comfortable, but what he is doing for Australia's benefit. It is proposed to vote a large sum of money for the upkeep of the High Commissioner's office in Eire. It is not our money but the taxpayers', and sooner or later we shall have to decide that we are not going to continue voting large amounts of money for which we do not obtain value. ""When I say that, I make no reflection on the person who now fills the office of High Commissioner in Eire. I am merely indicating that much of our expenditure on overseas representation could well be pruned in order to save the taxpayers' money. The proposed vote for the High Commissioner's office in Pakistan is £19,000. In 1948-49, the expenditure was £10,468. I want to know why the increased expenditure is necessary. I pass on from that, to make an observation, which I have not had an opportunity to make before, about our representation in Pakistan. Some time ago, a Constellation aircraft was grounded at Karachi, in Pakistan, because of engine trouble.",59
332,Mr CONELAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable member was travelling in the plane?,59
333,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I was not, but some friends of mine were, and they told me the sorry story, which has already been related in this chamber. The story concerns a person who was at the time representing Australia in Pakistan. The aircraft was delayed for a week or longer. There was a full complement of passengers, many of whom had business appointments in Australia. It was learned that another aircraft with six vacant seats was coming through two days later. It was arranged by Qantas Airways, the company operating the grounded plane, that the passengers should choose among themselves those who had the most urgent engagements in Australia, and that those chosen should be taken on in the second plane. At this point, the person acting as commissioner for Australia in Karachi intervened, and forbade the captain to carry out that arrangement, claiming that four of the six vacant seats should be filled by government servants travelling to Australia. The captain and the passengers protested strongly, but the official said, "" We own the aircraft and therefore our servants shall have priority to travel on it to Australia"". That was, in fact, done. I think it was a scandalous thing that a government official, purporting to act for Australia, should dictate who was to travel on the plane. Two of the persons nominated by him were Australian government servants, and two were government servants from somewhere else. In that occurrence, we see the shape of things to come. That is the sort of thing that we may expect in the bureaucratic and socialist state. The matter was brought to my notice by some of the passengers when they reached Australia. I asked a question about it in the House, and the Minister for Air (Mr Drakeford) wriggled and hedged in an extraordinary fashion. It was not until weeks later that I got an answer out of him in which he admitted the facts, and said that such a thing would, not happen again. It might not happen in the immediate future, but it will certainly happen if we get a socialist state,",59
334,Mr TURNBULL,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Wimmera) [5.4] I wish to refer to an item in the general administrative costs of the Department of External Affairs. It is the item which covers postage, telegrams and telephone services, in which there has been an increase of nearly 50 per cent. In 1948-49, the amount expended under this heading was £67,405. It is estimated that for 1949-50, expenditure will be £102,800. That does not include expenditure on cablegrams and radiograms, which is estimated to be £40,000, as against £38,158 for 1948-49. We all know that the Postmaster-General's Department recently increased telephone and telegraph charges, a fact which would account for an increase for this item in the costs of the External Affairs Department. However, I have examined the estimates for other departments, hut none of them shows an increase comparable to the estimated increase for the Department of External Affairs. should like to hear the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) endeavour to justify the gigantic increase.",59
335,Mr RYAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Flinders) [5.7] - Honor able members are uneasy over the continually increasing costs of our overseas representation, and they know that the increase will continue. A few days ago, the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) informed the House that Australia was to have diplomatic representation in Cairo and Jerusalem, and that - representatives would be appointed later :to the Scandinavian states. That will involve increased expenditure in sterling, - as well as in semi-hard currencies. I - suggest that, in order to save expense, - one person might be appointed to represent Australia in more than one country. It would be convenient geographically few* ms to be represented by one person in Cairo ant! Jerusalem, hut in view of the bad relations between Egypt and Israel, it is very probable that any one appointed to represent Australia in both those countries would be regarded as a spy in one or both of them. Therefore, it seems to be necessary to appoint a representative to each country. The Scandinavian countries, however, are all on very friendly terms with one another, and there seems to be no reason why Australia should not be represented in all of them by a single officer. I turn now to the United States of America. As the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) pointed out, our embassy there costs real money, not £100,000 in Australian currency, but its equivalent in dollars, and that, of course, is a great strain on' our economy. The most important place in which Australia should be represented after London is Washington, and I do not think the money that we expend on our representation in Washington is badly expended. In fact, I think that very soon the Government will have to consider increasing ' the emoluments of the Washington post. The schedule of salaries and allowances sets out the salary of the Ambassador as £2,500. The representation allowance to the Ambassador is £5,138. Translated into dollars, at the present value of the Australian £1, that I means that the Ambassador gets roughly 15,000 dollars, which, as every one who knows anything about the economy of the United States of America is aware, goes simply nowhere. The Ambassador has a special allowance for exchange purposes, but, even with that, he does not receive enough to cover his position. One thing that is true-and I have had experience of it-is that the less the head of a foreign mission is able to go ahout and entertain on a footing equal to that of the heads of other foreign missions, the more is his position placed in jeopardy. Therefore, the Government will have to consider increasing the salary and allowances connected with that post. The the Government could consider how economies can be made in other directions. I agree that we cannot afford too large an expenditure on our foreign representation. I suggest economy in other places; for instance, in Brazil, and in some minor posts. I do not think that we should reduce our representation in sister dominions. It is most important that we should cultivate the closest possible relations with the United States of America. Heavy clouds hang over the Pacific, and Australia is the first country that will suffer if those clouds one day burst. Communist forces are sweeping down the south-east coast of Asia. I do not desire to enlarge upon that matter, except to point out that we no longer rely, as we did, on efficient help from Great Britain and the British Dominions. The United Kingdom is extended in every conceivable way, militarily and financially. Therefore, we have to look for friends to help us to defend ourselves should an emergency arise. Naturally, the first nation that we look to is the greatest in the Pacific, the United States of America. It is the only nation that we can logically expect assistance from. There is a great difference between our approach to the United States of America and its approach to us. It is very much in our interest to cultivate friendly relations with that great, nation. It would not matter much to the United States of America if we were written off completely, for we have nothing to offer it. Therefore, it is up to us to cultivate in the Tjnited States of America interest in ourselves. That can be done partly by diplomatic means and partly by citizens. We must awaken in both the citizens and the Government of the United States of America interest in us. I pointed out in my budget speech that our relations with the United States of America have sadly deteriorated in the last few years. We were very closely in touch with the American people at"" the end of the war. We were very friendly with them and they with us. I do not think that friendliness has diminished to any appreciable extent, but they are taking far less interest in us than they did in 1945. There are many reasons for that. Of all our negotiations with the United States of America I know of hardly one in which a satisfactory solution has heen reached, at least a solution satisfactory it. I instance the ways and means of putting into operation the Fulbright Act. Then there is the matter of the navigation treaties between the two countries. Thirdly, there is double taxation, about which I recently put a question to the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley).",60
336,Mr CONELAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable member wants to give everything away.,61
337,Mr RYAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Exactly . There is no question that financially we should losers, but what would the loss of few hundred thousands a year matter we got the friendship, co-operation and understanding of the United States America in exchange? A few hundred thousand pounds amounts to far less than the support militarily, financially and commercially of the United States of America. Finally, I mention some of the pin-pricks of which the Government been guilty in the way in which i operated the provisions of our immigrapronouncement, tion laws. Quite unnecessarily, the tralian Government has offended a great many Americans who are far more has tolerant than we are in immigration matters. I now come to the matter of our policy towards Japan as compared with that of the United States of America. Ten days ago, General MACArthur issued the world which he called the new policy of the Americans towards the Japanese. He described it as one of friendliness towards and guidance of the J apanese. In pursuance of that policy, he relaxed the ban on fraternization between the American troops in Japan and the Japanese people. I asked a question in the House ahout what the Australian Government proposed to do. The Minister for Defence (Mr Dedman) said that the Government proposed to continue the policy of banning fraternization by our troops in Japan. Proceeding with his, explanation, he said- I do not think that it is a matter of such' great importance as to require discussione on a government-to-government level at thia time. The policy adopted by our troops in Japan towards the Japanese, compared with the policy adopted towards them by the American troops in Japan, is only a to part of the larger question of the relations between ourselves and Japan and the United States of America and Japan. As an ally of the United States of America in the occupation of Japan, surely we should co-ordinate our policy with theirs. I do not believe that there have been any discussions on a high level, which is really what matters, between the Minister for External Affairs and the State Department about the Allied policy in the occupation of Japan as far as the be the Japanese people are concerned. I do a not think public opinion in Australia if would welcome any change with regard to fraternization, but there are other of matters that rise far above that. The first question is whether there should he complete co-operation between ourselves and the United States of America on the big problem of Japan in the future, which far transcends any question of fraternization. Finally, what is the attitude of has the Australian Government towards t has Japan? There has been no official on any level, on what we Austhink the future relations with the Japanese should be. No pronouncement been made on our view on the changed policy of the United States of America towards the Japanese people. These are matters that should be cleared up and I hope that the Minister for External Affairs will make some attempt to clear to them up when replying to this debate.",61
338,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Richmond) [5.20] There are one or two things about which I should like some information in this discussion on the proposed vote for the Department of External Affairs. Last year I asked the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt), in a written question for certain information, which he gave to me, but of course, last year we had no opportunity of addressing any further questions to the Minister personally in the chamber, because he was away in other parts of the world. I asked him what Australia's contribution was to the United Nations, on what grounds it was based compared with the contribution of other countries, how many Australians were employed in the organization ancl what was the salary range of those whose salaries exceeded £1,000 a year. ceived some very interesting information from the Minister, and from the Secretary of his department by letter. I wonder whether, in view of the changed monetary relations between ourselves and the dollar countries, because of the recent devaluation of the pound, and particularly in view of the fact that Australia must forgo the importation of many dollar goods, including petrol and machinery on that account we are justified in expending the huge amount that was voted to the United Nations by this Parliament last year. I asked the Minister last .year1. What is the monetary contribution Australia to the United Nations Organization? 2. On what basis is such contribution deterpersonally mined, and what are the individual contribuquests tions of all other United Nations members? 3. Approximately how much of Australia's contribution is payable in dollars? The Minister told me that contributions were broadly determined by capacity to staff pay, taking into account national incomes, &c. As a matter of fact, I imderstand that some members of the United Nations tralian currency)? are not paying their levied contributions. No one would know that better than names would the Minister, who was President the United Nations General Assembly. Minister's department. But Australia's direct contribution funds of United Nations last year was less than 543,000 dollars, which was more than half a million dollars. The Minister might justify that by saying "" This is a world organization, struggling to establish better relations between nation and nation, and that contribution is a good insurance policy for the future "". But is it a good insurance policy for the future ? How far has the United Nations served the purpose that it was proclaimed it would serve when it was first formulated in 1945 in San Francisco ? I submit that in the major matters that concern world peace, the United Nations is an inconsequential organization. For instance, the matter of the atom bomb has not been considered by the United Nations, except in a negative manner by the appointment of some kind of a commission that neither Russia nor the United States of America takes the least notice of. If in 1948-49 our contribution in dollars to the United Nations I re- amounted to 543,000 dollars, what is it to be in 1949-50? We are given no information at all on that point. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) has referred to the establishment of legations that absorb dollars in South America and certain other countries. I have made some fairly careful research into what justification may exist for the establishment hy Australia of dollar using agencies in those countries in the way of diplomatic representation and I have been unable to find any justification at all. This is the first occasion in the last year or two at least on which the Minister has of been present during a debate on the Department of External Affairs to answer some of the observations and refor information that have .been put by honourable members on this side of the chamber. Another section of my question to the Minister reads.How many Australians are on the permanent of the United Nations organization, and what are the names of those in receipt of a salary of £1,000 pcr annum or more (AusI am mystified by one of the 20 or 30 in the list that was supplied to me of in answer to that question by the At the top to the of the list appears the name of a no Mr Ian Milner whose salary range is from 7,450 to 9,200 dollars. Who is Mr. Milner? He may be a distinguished individual but at least hi3 name is not familiar to me. Then there is Mr Walter E. Crocker, who is in receipt of a salary which also ranges from 7,450 to 9,200 dollars, free of income tax, Then there is Mr Kenneth MCKenna who receives a salary with the same range. There is also a Mr Alexander Short on the same salary range and a Mr H . 0. Elvins. .Ooes anybody know who Mr Elvins is ?",62
339,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Yes , bnt I shall answer that later.",63
340,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Mr Elvins receives 10,000 dollars a year and upwards. But the most interesting name of all is left until the last. Honourable members will recollect that a lady by the name of Miss Giselle Schneider was lobbying around Canberra for a long period. She was an alleged Polish refugee who was supposed to have had to flee from Poland at the time that the Nazis got busy in that country. She was a very qualified Polish woman. I understand that when she reached Australia she joined the staff of the Melbourne University and that she later found a job in Canberra and finally insinuated herself into the Department of External Affairs. Every honourable member will recall the way in which she used to be in and out of ministerial offices.",63
341,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,That was when the honourable gentleman was a Minister.,63
342,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"No , it was during the present Minister's term of office.",63
343,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I know nothing about her.,63
344,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Sh e was not known in my time as a Minister. Many of us regarded with suspicion her story that she fled from the Nazis - That story remains to be proved. She found her way into the Department of External Affairs during the present Administration. She became a lecturer to the student cadets of the department. She was missing for quite a period and now her name has turned up in this document with which I have been supplied by the Secretary to the Department of External Affairs, who informed me in it as follows: The following Australians were employed on the United Nations Secretariat at the salaries shown aa at Slst August, 1947:Then appear the names of those employed. The last name of all is that of Mrs P. Podbielsky, who is, in fact, none other than Miss Giselle Schneider^ aud wljp, this document tells me, is an Australian representing Australia, and is the mouth-piece of Australia in the United Nations. Yet she is a former refugee from Poland! She receives a salary of from 4,410 to 7,800 dollars. I do not know very much about what happened in Poland during the war or in what circumstances she came to this country. I only know from the observations of quite a number of honourable members that that lady's activities in Canberra were under suspicion and that more than one honourable member of the Parliament commented upon the facility with which she was able to gain entrance to all kinds of government departments. But this document describes her as an Australian! When did she become an Australian? Was she permitted to become naturalized during the period of the war? I very much question wliether that was possible under the regulations that were then in force. Mr HAKKISO?; - It looks as though she : has been nationalised.",63
345,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"That seems to be. the case. The Minister might well answer the following questions: When did this lady enter Australian territory? When was she naturalized and how did she, a Polish refugee, come to be appointed as the representative of Australia in an international organization?",63
346,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable gentleman should know that these people are employees of the organization. They are in no sense representatives of Australia.,63
347,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I do not intend to be side-tracked by the Minister's statement, because I asked the Minister a specific question which readsHow many Australians are on the permanent staff of the United Nations organization, and what are the names of those in receipt of a salary of £1,000 .per annum or more (Australian currency)? The answer that I have received from, the Minister's department in writing includes the wordsThe following Australians were employed on the United Nations secretariat at the salaries shown:Mrs Podbielsky's name is included among the list of Australians employed.",63
348,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I must point out to the honourable member that none of these people is a representative of this Government. They are persons appointed by the United Nation's Secretariat and not by the Australian Government.,64
349,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Who nominated them? Did Eussia or Poland nominate Mrs Podbielsky, or did Australia nominate her ?",64
350,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I shall find out.,64
351,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The Minister may find out, but I doubt if I shall. These officials were also mentioned in the House by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Eankin) and he received a moat insulting letter from Mrs Podbielsky, vvhich stated that whether he was a member of Parliament or otherwise, he should mind his own business. But I am very much intrigued by the appointment of this lady when there are many Australian women, who were highly trained at our universities and hold arts and other degrees, with overseas experience, who should have been qualified for a position such as this. I should like to know how it is possible for a lady with the background and status that I have mentioned to be allegedly representing Australia overseas, because it is quite obvious that she has been regarded by the Department of External Affairs, in view of the answer that it supplied to me, as a representative of Australia. I turn now to the matter of dollar allocations to United Nations organizations. I have no doubt that we shall be told by the Minister in his reply that the expenditure of that money is well justified. We shall also undoubtedly be told by honourable members on the Government side that the Minister for External Affairs has achieved the highest honour that an Australian could achieve by being elected to the presidency of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We shall be told that that is an outstanding distinction for Australia. - GOVERNMENT MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",64
352,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It is indeed a distinction, hut who was the preceding President? He,was the representative of Brazil.  that?",64
353,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Brazi l is a country which contributed nothing of any consequence to the winning of the recent war. The next contender for the presidency of the General Assembly of the United Nations after the expiry of the term of the Minister for External Affairs, was the representative of Argentina, a country which came into the war at the very last moment and took no actual part in it.  ber is only a muck slinger.",64
354,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE, Order ! The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Pollard) must remain silent.,64
355,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am criticizing the value of the United Nations organization to Australia and am endeavouring to show that its highest post is being given to representatives of nations whose voices mean nothing to the other nations of the world. The latest appointment to the presidency is Carlos Eomulo, the Foreign Minister of the Philippines Eepublic, and the runner-up for the appointment was the representative of Iran. ",64
356,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Of course our friends on the opposite side find a lot of entertainment in expending 500,000 dollars that could be used for the purchase of petrol, tractors or some other necessaries so as to bolster up some alleged achievement in international affairs on the part of this Government. I affirm that the United Nations organization, so far as Australia is concerned, is not worth a contribution of 500,000 dollars a year. Our contribution will probably be more than that, in fact, because of the recent change in currency relationships.  honourable member's party contribute if it formed the government ?",64
357,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,- Order! The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture must cease interjecting.,64
358,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The Minister has asked how much we on this side of the committee would contribute to the United Nations if we were the government. I point out that in reply to a question, the 1 1 Minister for External Affairs saidContributions to the United Nations are broadly determined by capacity to pay. Healso said79.5 per cent, of Australia's' contribution is payable in dollars. In> view of the fact that Australia is unable to import essential goods for the maintenance of its industrial life, our capacity to pay in dollars is very important. I challenge the Minister, who is' a former President of the General Assembly of the Tjnited Nations, to say whether Afghanistan is payingits contribution in dollars and whether some of the other countries like China-whic h is put down for 2,081,000 dollars-pa y in dollars.",64
359,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,All the member nations pay on the same footing. That is to taj; the same proportion of dollars as we pay must be paid by other' nations. 1,65
360,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The Mmister could elucidate this matter far more clearly than we on this side of the House are able to hecause we are not in possession of all facts and we can only act on the information that is given to us, substantially by the Minister, plus a little of our own intelligence in working things out.",65
361,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I shall try to leave all the honourable member's points not unanswered.,65
362,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am glad of that I have a very long - list of the countries that contribute to the Tjnited Nations, and I do not see very many of them",65
363,Mr EALSTEIN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I rise to order! Is the honourable member in order in referring at this stage to a matter that is actually shown under Division No. 170, item 9 of which relates 'to Australia's contribution to the United Nations ? The TEMPORARY ' CHAIRMAN. The honourable member for Richmond is ih order and may proceed. Mf: ANTHONY - Than k you for your - ruling, it r . Temporary 'Chairman.

364,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,-It i's a valuable organiza: tion.,65
365,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Then why did not the right honourable gentleman attend the recent General Assembly in order to hand over the reins of office to his successor? Is it to be understood that, having himself reached the highest position in that organization, it was not incumbent on him as the retiring President of the General Assembly of the United Nations to fly to America, even for a few days, in order formally to hand over the reins of office to his successor? I believe that the Minister's action shows how lightly he regards the United Nations, arid how unnecessary he really believes it to be. His real opinion of the effectiveness and value of the United Nations' was demonstfate'd by his decision to absent himself from the ceremonies that marked the transfer of office from himself to another gentleman. During the absence of the Minister for External Affairs I referred to the handing over by him of the trusteeship - of New Guinea without any qualification whatever, as the result of which Australian representatives have to go to Lake Success each year and subject themselves to questioning by Chinese, Mexicans and - the representatives of other foreign - countries about the manner in which the trusteeship of New Guinea is being administered. ""We have read in today's press that the representative of the Chinese Nationalist Government which ds now in flight, has put the Australian representative - on the carpet and has compelled him to answer - changes alleging that Australia has improperly administered its trusteeship of New - Guinea. I contrast the action of the Australian Minister for External Affairs in this respect with that of the United States Department which, in regard to the trusteeship of the Marshall and Caroline Islands said, in effect, '"" These islands are 'strategically important to the defence 'of the United r .States -'of America aud our trusteeship 'of them w i ll accordingly be based on .'Strategic 'considerations. We -.ishall - not answer to any organization for what we do there. ""We shall prohibit entry into the Marshall and Caroline Islands of any person whom we desire to exclude "". The Minister for External Affairs, in his anxiety to demonstrate how extraordinarily valuable the Tjnited Nations is, was one of the first to hand over to the Trusteeship Council the trusteeship of territory that had formerly been held uuder mandate. As the result of his action Australia must in future send officials to Lake Success, or wherever the General Assembly of the Tjnited Nations may be held, to be subjected to all kinds of cross-examination by the representatives of foreign powers regarding its administration of New Guinea. Any foreign power which is a member of the Tjnited Nations may send its representatives to New Guinea to check up on our administration of the trusteeship and may subsequently pull our reputation to shreds in a ^manner it would not otherwise have a right to do. Contrast the action of the Australian Government with the more statesmanlike action taken by the Tjnited States Government. The Tjnited States made it clear that it would not accept trusteeship of the Marshalls and the Carolines except on the basis that those islands were of such strategic importance to the defence of the Tjnited States that that country had a right to administer them as though they were an integral part of the Tjnited States. Many questions were asked in the Trusteeship Council about Australia's administration of New Guinea. The representative of China saidMay I ask how the indenture system of Labour is operated and why it will take years to effect a change in it? The representative of Mexico wanted to know what salaries were paid to the members of the police force in New Guinea and what were the conditions of service. Another representative asked what kind of sanitary conveniences were provided for the natives there. ",65
366,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It is not a matter, for humour that the representative of Australia should be compelled to answer questions of that kind only because the Australian Minister for External Affairs gave away New Guinea without qualification. The right honourable gentleman should have emulated the example of the United States Department of State, and said: "" This territory is so necessary to the defence of Australia that we shall line ourselves up with the Tjnited States of America and insist that nobody may enter New Guinea without our permission. We shall not submit ourselves to the indignity of being questioned by the representatives of Iran, Mexico, the Philippines or any other country who may dare to take us to task. We shall not subject ourselves to questioning by the representatives of governments which cannot boast of a good record even in the administration of their own peoples "". These are some of the questions which the Minister for External Affairs might well answer. Perhaps he might begin by telling us what our membership of the United Nations will cost us during the forthcoming year, how much we shall have to pay in sorely needed dollars, and what value we shall get for our money.",66
367,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Barton - Attorney General and Minister for External Affairs) [5.48] - There are a few matters with which I should perhaps deal at once. Criticism has been levelled at the establishment of certain Australian legations abroad. No definite suggestion has been macle that any specific legation should be. closed.,66
368,Mr BEAIJS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I criticized the continuance of the Australian Legation in Brazil.,66
369,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It is true that the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr. Beale) referred to the Australian Legation five in Brazil. I shall deal with that in a moment or two. Only two legations were specifically mentioned either during the present discussion or on other recent occasions. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) and the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott) have referred at different times to the legations in Chile and Brazil. Both are Latin-American countries, and some honourable members opposite have contended that Australia does not need diplomatic representation in them. However, it is important for the committee to understand that Australia has only two missions in South America, oue in Brazil, and the other in Chile. We recently withdrew our ckarge-de-affaires and staff from Chile us a temporary measure, largely because of the dollar position. I believe that, ultimately, it will be essential for Australia to be represented in South America on a larger scale than it is at the present time, and that relations with Chile are important. Although the Australian Legation in Chile is included in these Estimates, the amount that is shown is simply ior the purpose of winding up that particular mission, and paying the salaries of the officers who have been withdrawn from it. E desire to take this opportunity to point out that any criticisms of the Australian Legation in Brazil that are based upon dollar expenditure are beside the point. That post is financed, not with dollars, - but through the sterling area. However, there are serious considerations which, in the opinion of the Government, warrant the continuance of at least one post in South America. In the view of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, Australia has important trade prospects in South America, and we intend to conduct active trade negotiations in the near future mainly with Brazil, but also with Argentina and other South American countries. At the present moment, negotiations are being conducted by the Australian representative in Brazil with a view to making a trade arrangement with Argentina. A post for a trade commissioner in Brazil has existed for a long time, but it has never been occupied. The whole of the trade work has been done through the legation at Rio de Janiero, and, in fact, it is being performed hy the Australian rharge d' affaires there. He was previously an officer of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, hut, in practice, it is often impossible to separate mercial representation from diplomatic representation. Therefore, it is often more convenient and necessary that the nommercial officer should also have diplomatic status.",66
370,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,That is not in the normal foreign office tradition.,67
371,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"N'o , but it is modern practice because of the difficulty of drawing a line of demarcation between strictly commercial matters and other matters in which general political policy is involved. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) is aware of that fact. In my opinion, it is of considerable advantage that the commercial officers should have diplomatic status. Egypt provides a good example of that. Australia has its trade representative in that country, but often a matter affecting trade also has a political aspect, and it is impossible for trade representatives to discuss the subject unless they have some diplomatic status. In order to have diplomatic status the officials must be, accredited as representatives of the Department of External Affairs. In view of the potentially important market in South America for Australian products, especially those of our secondary industries, the cost of maintaining what is, after all, a very small diplomatic mission in Latin America is a small price to pay for the benefits which even from the limited trade viewpoint, must accrue to this country. I shall now deal more generally with the estimates for the Department of External Affairs. The estimated expenditure this year is an overall increase of £77,000 on last year's expenditure. I remind honourable members that expenditure last year was £50,000 less than the estimate and we hope to make similar economies this year. Actually, the estimates for 1949-50 are less than £30,000 in excess of last year's vote. The proposed vote has been increased because of anticipated additional costs that are quite unavoidable. The increases cover five items. First, overseas air-mail rates have been increased by 100 per cent., and 70 per cent, of those charges, which arc borne by the Department of External Affairs, reprecomsents expenditure on behalf of other departments. Secondly, rates for cables between Australia and France, America, Russia and other countries have greatly increased.",67
372,Mr TURNBULL,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,That is a separate item.,67
373,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am aware of that. I am dealing with the estimates as a whole, and not with the specific matter that has been raised by the honourable member. The committee may take it that the increased costs of communications are represented by such factors as higher rates for over* seas air-mails. The department is concerned mainly with overseas rates. In ternal expenditure on matters to which the honourable member has referred is comparatively small, but the overseas fates are heavy, and they have been increasing. Thirdly} Australia's contribu^ tionS to international organizations have increased. Australia has always been a member of that very important body, the International Labour Office,- and we must maintain our membership of it. Its purpose is to increase labour stan dard's throughout the world* All political parties represented in this chamber have supported the International Labour Office. Australia's increased con=tributions to that and other international bodies amount to more than £30j000. Before leaving this matter, I should mention the Fobd and Agriculture Organization. Surely honourable members opposite, particularly members of the Australian Country party, will not complain because Australia is a member of that organization! I was horrified to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Eichmond on this subject. In fact, I think that we have to attribute to some of his remarks an over-estimated sense of humour. I do not believe that the honourable gentleman really considers that Australia should not be a member of the United Nations. Probably his purpose is to make a rather spoiling attack on a few items, of expenditure in the estimates for the Department of External Affairs. Does any honourable member seriously propose that Australia should withdraw from the United Nations? All political parties that are represented here are pledged to support it .",67
374,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It is just Waste of time, is it not?",68
375,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I cannot express feelings about the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), whd £9,000. knows perfectly well that Australia be a member of that inter'na'tional organiAffairs zation. M""f. AS'OHTE CAMERONI- I do hot.",68
376,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,It is not aVwaste of tiine.,68
377,Mr ABGHXB CAMERON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,-It is. V,68
378,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"In the opinion bf the ; honourable member for Barker, all international organizations are a waste of time. The honourable gentleman believes that the only way in which disputes on an international basis should be dealt with is by force;",68
379,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,That is the only way in which international disputes are being dealt with at the present time.,68
380,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"That is not correct. It is Contrary to the whole history and practice of the United Nations. I can cite instance after instance tb show that inter1 vention by the United Nations has prevented the use of force, and, in addition, that that intervention has been successful.",68
381,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Such al iri Palestine and iii India \,68
382,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Palestine is one example.,68
383,Mr ARCHIE CAMERONV,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Ari d Greece ?,68
384,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Le t lis deal with brie instance at a time. Palestine 14 tthe example, and the dispute betW'eeri Pakistan and India over Kashmir is ahb'ther. The honourable meinber belief es that the United Nations has iiot been able to preyent fighting in soriie parts of the wbfld. Intervention by the United, Nations' h'as arrested fighting, saved precious, lives arid led to' conciliation and 'eventually agreement, In this 'and many other respects which I 'shaU elaborate late*, Australia must adhere to the United^ Nations, aha honourable members opposite should not Criticize it as they have done. Sitting foispen&ed from 6 to 8 p.m.",68
385,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The fourth reason j o r the increase of the proposed vote for Shis item is that £50,000 has fyeeri expended on the purchase of new furniture and equipment for overseas posts i i ^ order to a save the post _ of renting furnished prefnises. Finally the appointment of a my High Commissioner to Pakistan has involved the expenditure of an additional The estimated iricrease of expenmust diture in the Department of External . over, last year's e'xp'ehditur'e is £77,312. Very substantial, ec6n6niies : have been, effected in' the actual administration of the department. Taking into a'ceouht unavoidable' increases' du'e to higher costs, this' year's estimates are £100,000 below those of last year. This saving has been effected by refraining from making appointments in dollar areas until it becomes absolutely necessary to do so. This has caused some inconvenience, because it is in the dollar areas that our representation is very important. Posts at Washington and Ottawa .are carrying on with inadequate staffs because of the dollar shortage. We have delayed the making of appointments and the purchase of vehicles, &c, as long as possible. The post in Chile has beeu temporarily closed for reasons of economy, and we have deferred the appointment of a Minister to Brazil. Thus, the utmost economy has been exercised, particularly in the expenditure of dollars. I now propose to discuss departmental expansionmore broadly. The Department of External Affairs has grown steadily according to plan since the Labour Government assumed office in October, 1941, nearly eight years ago. At that time, there were seven officers of the department in Canberra, and fifteen overseas. Besides London, in which we have had representations for many years, there were representatives at Washington, Ottawa, Tokyo and in China. With the exception of the London post, the others were created and filled after the beginning of World War II . The Labour Government has extended Australian diplomatic and consular representation to many parts of the world. The original five foreign posts have been increased to 28, and the diplomatic staff in Canberra has been increased to 64, while that overseas has been increased to 76. I speak now of diplomatic officers in the strict sense of the term. This great expansion was necessary, first, because of the war, and, secondly, because of the need to implement the international policy of the Government after the war. The war taught us that Australia had to exercise its status as a nation. It further taught us that Australia had to take an active part in all forms of international co-operation. Mention has been made of the United Nations, which is one of the most prominent forms of international co-operation. Australia must also maintain day-by-day relations with other countries. There is an enormous flow of information from abroad to Australia, and from Australia abroad. The promotion of such activities requires efficient oflieers to be available for duty every day of the year. That is of the very essence of a properly organized foreign affairs department, and is just one aspect of government. Active participation in the United Nations and associated organizations is the key note of the Government's policy. .One of the first planks of the Labour party's platform is unwavering and unfaltering support of the United Nations. We make no apology for that. It is the policy adopted by the British Commonwealth of Nations, and. it occupies a prominent part in the policy of President Truman. By a coincidence, those very words, ""unwavering and unfaltering support"", were used by President Truman in a recent important speech. He said that, in his opinion, the United Nations was the only bulwark guarding the ordinary people of the world against another war. It may be said that such a statement needs to be supplemented; and that, in addition to the United Nations, regional arrangements are needed. No one will deny that, but support of the United Nations has been the settled policy of this Government since we first sent our delegates to San Francisco to take part in the drafting of the original charter, which was inspired by President Roosevelt himself. There have been setbacks, even heart breaking setbacks, but aworld organization is bound to have such setbacks. After a war like the last one, it is not easy to condition people to the normal ways of peace. The proposed expenditure on the External Affairs Department, is little more than £1,000,000 a year, and it is less than the one day's expenditure by Australia during the height of the war in the Pacific. We must remember also that we receive something to balance our expenditure on overseas representation. It is not a one-way traffic. From 48 separate countries we have received in Australia diplomatic or consular representatives. When we speak of dollar expenditure by Australia on representation in the United States of America, we should remember the dollar expenditure in this country of American and Canadian representatives.",68
386,Mr SPENDER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"They do not spend dollars in Australia, they spend sterling.",70
387,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Fro m day to day they spend sterling, but actually their expenditure over the whole field is in dollars. However, apart from the monetary side, which is an important, but not the most important, feature, there is the fact that Australia, as a nation, is entitled, by its international status and by its contribution during the first and second world wars, to take its place in the councils of the nations, and to discuss international affairs with the representatives of other countries, sometimes in Canberra, and sometimes overseas. We cannot say that we shall have representation i u one country, but not in another. overseas representation must extended. The Government preceded the Labour Government had to extend our foreign representation. It began with the establishment of a post in Washington. Later, posts were established in Tokyo, in China and in Canada. The establishment of all such posts has been justified, and they must be properly staffed, and supported by the Government and the Parliament. In order to provide for their staffing, it has been necessary to establish a special scheme of recruitment which made allowance for the fact that, during the war, serexpense. vicemen were deprived of opportunities to make places for themselves in the Public Service. Therefore, they were specially favoured in the granting of cadetships in the Department of External Affairs. Now, many of them have finished their training, and have been appointed to various posts throughout the world, where they are taking their part as important units in the service. The Australian diplomatic cadet system has been followed to some extent in Canada, and has aroused interest in other countries. The system ensures that Australia's overseas representation, whether in the diplomatic field, or at international conferences, shall be based on specially selected and trained career staff. This administrative development has been in accordance with the development of the policy of Australia in relation to foreign affairs. It is designed to protect Australia's interests abroad and I refer not only to governmental interests, but also to private and commercial interests, and that work is going on all the time. Australians abroad go to those posts for advice and assistance and they are never turned down. They are always getting assistance. The department receives numerous letters of appreciation of the work done in our posts from Australians who happened to be engaged in business or travel overseas. It is a fundamental part of our policy to have the closest association with both the British Commonwealth and the United States of America and to give whole-hearted support to the United Nations and its agencies. So, I submit that, looking at these figures and looking at these activities, they are completely Our justified. Indeed, in one sense, they have be always been approved by the Parliament, that subject occasionally to some particular form of criticism. Certain suggestions have been made of a practicable kind. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Ryan) suggested that we might consider the appointment of one officer to man two places. That is being considered. It is a suggestion that, is not particularly favoured by a foreign country that has a representative here. But it is being explored in order to carry out our obligations with the minimum The honourable member for Richmond raised the matter of contributions to the United Nations. He wanted to know whether the contribution of dollars that had to be made by other members of the United Nations was the same as that which has to he provided by Australia. The answer is "" Yes, it is "". The rules provide that a certain percentage of the contribution is to be made in dollars, and that applies to every one of the 59 member nations. Then he asked how the percentage was worked out. The percentage in the case of Australia is 1.97, which is practically 2 per cent, of the total contribution, or approximately one-fiftieth. It is reckoned in dollars, because the centre of the United Nations is in the United States of America. But that is a burden of dollar expenditure, not only to countries like Australia, but also to many other countries, and it has led to a desire, if not a. demand, by member countries at the present assembly that the dollar expenditure be lessened to some extent hy holding some of the meetings of the Tjnited Nations and its agencies in other countries - than the United States of America for the time being. That is a difficult matter. Certain other places have been suggested for the next meeting of the United Nations. One is Cuba and the other is Great Britain. Edinburgh has been suggested as a possible place for the next meeting. The honourable member for Richmond then referred to the fact that a number of Australians are on the staff of the United Nations. There is nothing wrong in that. We should be blamed if Australia did not have its proper quota of persons who happened to he selected by the secretariat for posts with the United Nations and in any of its centres.",70
388,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Was Mrs Podbielsky an Australian ?,71
389,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member then referred to a list. I do not think it is necessary for me to go through it. I want the committee to understand that these persons are not the nominees of the Australian Government. They are not the representatives of the Australian Government. This is an international public service, and each member signs an undertaking or takes something in the nature of an oath to further the interests of the organization and not of any particular country. Some of those people have been reco.manended by the department and many have not.",71
390,Mr SPENDER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Most of them have been.,71
391,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I said that some have and many have not. The lady whoso name was mentioned in the interjection of the honourable member for Parramatta if apparently of Polish extraction, and she was not recommended by the Australian Government.",71
392,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The right honourable gentleman told me in his letter that she was an Australian.,71
393,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I have never said that she was an Australian, or that she was not, an Australian. I said that she was not recommended by the Australian Government.",71
394,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Her e is the letter.,71
395,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The letter is correct in substance. The person whose name is second in the list was recently appointed by the governing board of the Australian National University, of which the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender) is a member, to fill a chair in the National University because of his special knowledge of trusteeship.",71
396,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,What about Mrs. Podbielsky?,71
397,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I understand that she Was a member of the staff of Professor Copland at the Melbourne University. Subsequently she was appointed to the economic secretariat at Canberra. She was appointed temporarily at one time to the Department of External Affairs by the then secretary of the department. She received, her present appointment on an application made by her on her own behalf, and without any support from the Government, I might add. In any case, I would not admit that her appointment would be wrong, if she is, as I understand she is, a distinguished linguist. She has done excellent work on the staff of the United Nations. She has been naturalized as an Australian by the Department of Immigration. Is that any reason to complain that she has heen given a post by the United Nations ?",71
398,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Is - there not an Australian woman available who is capable of doing the work?,71
399,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable member does not face the fact that we cannot make these appointments.,71
400,Mr SPENDER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The Minister is hiding behind doors.,71
401,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable member for Warringah rumbles and grumbles and says that he knows what he does not know.,71
402,Mr SPENDER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I have a shrewd suspicion. .,71
403,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I have heen assured hy the department' that in quite a number of cases there has been no recommendation by it of any kind. Thismarried woman has been appointed on her own merits. Instead of complaining about it, the honourable member for Richmond should be proud of it. Just because she is of Polish origin",71
404,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Sh e is suspect. ,71
405,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"That is the first suggestion of that kind that the honourable member has made. So far as I know, and so far as the department knows, she is doing her work well. That brings me to the broader question raised by the honourable member for Flinders, and it is very important that it should be dealt with. He suggests-and it is not the first time that it has been suggested on that side of the chamberthat the relations between the Australian Government and the Government of the Tjnited States of America are not so intimate or so satisfactory as they were a few years ago. The statement is completely and absolutely untrue.",72
406,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,^-Rubbish !,72
407,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"In addition to the rumbling and grumbling of one honourable member, we have the growling of the honourable member for Parramatta. I do not know why he does it. There is no advantage to be gained by not facing the facts. I shall deal with each point made by the honourable member for Flinders. First, let fine say quite definitely that relations of the Australian Government with the Government of the Tjnited States of America have never been so intimate, so close or so friendly as they are at present. Mr Spender interjecting,",72
408,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Agai n we have thunder on the left. Because the honourable member for Warringah does not agree with another speaker he growls. There is not much argument in the growling, and the honourable member will not stop me from saying that Mr Jarman, the recently appointed ambassador of the Tjnited States of America to Australia, on the occasion of his arrival in Australia and the presentation of his credentials to the Governor General, indicated that the relations between the two countries could not 'be closer or more intimate than they are. That is true. Honourable members know it is true. The only trouble that I know of is that on a few occasions in this chamber, one or two honourable members, in the corner in which members of the Australian Country party mainly sit, have suggested that differences exist between the two countries. The honourable member for Flinders asked why the arrangement for the agreement under the Fulbright Act had not been completed. t I understand the position is that Australia, under the lend-lease arrangement with the Tjnited States of America, provided what was called reverse lend-lease and the accounts nearly balanced. Approximately, it was £1,000,000,000 on either side of the accounts, such was the contribution of Australia by reverse lend-lease. There was a balance in favour of the Tjnited States of America, which was settled by an arrangement to provide",72
409,Mr SPENDER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,How much was that?,72
410,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It amounted to £20,000,000.",72
411,Mr SPENDER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,'Onl y pin money!,72
412,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Onl y pin money? I should not mind having the pin money now. It was in dollars! In an agreement like that referred to, various matters have to be provided for. They include, for instance a fair system of taxation of the scholarships to be provided the out of the fund. Negotiations between the Australian Government, particularly through the Treasury, and the United States of America, have been going on for some time. They are approaching completion. There is no complaint of any kind about that. It is suggested that there should he a system of double taxation. That is very important. What has to be considered by the Government in the light of its policy is the policy of other countries, particularly the United States of America. When an honourable member makes a speech to the effect that another government does not think the terms of an arrangement are very satisfactory, that does not indicate that any but the best relations exist between the two countries. The honourable member said' that Americans were offended by Australia's administration of its own immigration laws. There is not a tittle of evidence of that. The United States of America enforces its immigration laws under the quota system, or under the previous system, with complete rigidity. It would be unusual to have such a complaint from the United States of America. There has been none. Yet that is the basis of the suggestion that has been made by honorablemembersopposite. In fact, the only forum at which such a suggestion' as that has been' made is in this chamber on one or two occasions by one or two' honourable members who represent al small minority of the Opposition . 1 The honourable member for Flinders' referred to a more important quesfion about policy in relation fo Japan. He extracted' from the Minister for Defence - and the Minister for the Army is concerned in the matter-the fact that the Australian Government by arrangement with the Commander of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force In Japan, General Eobertson, has adhered to themilitary rul'e of nonf.r.aternization> by the Army units in Japan.. That is purely a question of. military discipline, and involves no general question of political policy, in which the Government would naturally be guided by military considerations'.. That is the sole basis for the incorrect,, unsound and' baseless suggestion that there-is any strained'relationship between; Australia and the United States of America. I should not have to answer such childish suggestions as those which have, beenput. forward one after the other by honourable members opposite, and which amountto nothing.. Nothing plus nothing, plus nothing; plus nothing equals nothing, arid that is exactly what these suggestionsamount to. The positive, fact of which I can. assure the House and the peopleof Australia is that this country's relationshipswiththe United' States are as I have described them tb be When General. MACArthur came to this country early in, the war with, Japan wo heard, criticisms from, certain parts of Australia that the relationships^ of this. Government with, the United States were altogether too close. The: late M-r. Curtin was condemned} when he was 1 Prime Minister, because early in. the war with Japan, Australia looked to the United. States for aid. It Was said that his; statementsindicated-disloyalty, or at leasta wrong, attitude towardsGreat Britain-, and the' BritishCommonwealth..",72
413,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"That was round about the time that the Australian Government ordered the Australian Broadcasting: Commission td cease playing the' "" British Grenadiers"" as the theme music for-its news session.",73
414,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Honourable , members opposite are rebuked in substance by every statement made by every United States representative at the conferences of the United Nations. Over and over again the United States representatives have' referred to the Australian Government and its spokesmen abroad and have approved of what we have done. Over and over again they have gone out of their way to praise Australia's policy. Is it impossible in this country for a government which carries out an active international policy based, on the objectives of the United Nationsto j i a in any credit from the Opposition?! How is it possible that' the administration of foreign affairs'^ which* should be above party' politics,, can produce the kind of speech' delivered this afternoon by' the' honourable Member' for' Richmond' (Mr. Ailtho'riy)-. Any one who took the honourable member for Eiehmoflcf seriously would; draw' from his' remarks the conelusion that he' is iiot a> supporter of the United Nations, although I do not know whether that iscorrect or' not:",73
415,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am a supporter ofhuman rights,, and the Minister is not.",73
416,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am also a supporter of human rights. The committee will observe that the honourable member for Richmond has not answered my remark, and will not unequivocally come outas a supporter of the United Nations. I turn now to' the honourable' member for Barker (Mr Archie' Cameron), who has been more frank about this matter than has the honourable member for Richmond, and who, before the' suspension of the sitting said, in effect, that Australia could not expect any benefitfrom the United Nations. Consistent with his other observations he also said' that the' only' arbitrament to which the people of the world could look was the arbitrament of force. The honourable member may have historic parallels for so dismal a view which involves an attitude of resignation andalmost' of despair in the face of the troubles' that confront the world today, but I can"" hardly believe that the Honourable' gentleman, whose pessimism, on ""Wednesday is succeeded a qualined optimism on Thursday, is succeeded by pessimism on priday and optimism on Saturday, has abandoned hope in the United Nations. Everyonly thing that the honourable member for Richmond said in criticism of the Nations was unfounded. So far from failing in the terrible crises that have confronted the United Nations in the last few year9-and I say "" terrible"" because of the acute differences exist between the great powers, caused world in the post-war era, mainly by the attitude of Russia - it has acted in a praiseworthy manner. Because of the differences between the great powers the United Nations has had placed before it for consideration matters that normally would have been dealt with under the peace treaties. I shall enumerate some of those matters. I have already referred Kashmir. Tens of thousands, and perInternational haps hundreds of thousands of lives were saved as a result of intervention hy the United Nations in the Kashmir dispute. The same remark applies to Greece. It is perfectly that there has been fighting in Greece, but it has been restricted, and limited through the operation of the United Nations Balkans Commission. In Korea intervention by the United Nations led to the ""firm establishment of the Bepublic of Southern Korea free from oppression from the northern part of that peninsula. I turn now to Indonesia, which used to be the theme song of honourable members opposite. As a result of United Nations intervention, in which Australia took prominent part through its distinguished representative, Mr Critchley, the parties to the Indonesian dispute are healing their differences at a round table ference at The Hague. The Australian Government is lending its best aid that direction. I apply similar remarks to Palestine where United intervention has met with substantial success. Although there was fighting Palestine the intervention of the United Nations mediator and of the Palestine Commission limited the fighting, and the end stopped it and produced agreeitself ment. The problem of Palestine is yet solved, because there remains the question of the internationalization of peoples. Dr Evatt. by Jerusalem which has to be considered by which the Palestine commission. The achievements that I have enumerated are important, but it is not on the political side that the United Nations has a great record of success. United It has a similar record on the economic side. The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund is one of the greatest contributions to the alleviation of the conditions that that obtain in many parts of the and the Government and I personally are intensely proud of the fact that, of the 5& member nations of the United Nations,. Australia gave the second largest contribution to the United Nations in itsgreat crusade for children. The people of Australia supported that action by their response to a voluntary appeal last year when the voluntary contributions of to Australians to the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund were, in the aggregate, greater than the voluntary contributions that came from any other country in the world. Those illustrations show that the true economic side of the work of the United Nations is of supreme importance. The Economic and Social Council of the United Nations has done good work. That brings me to the curious remarks of the honourable member for Richmond about the trusteeship system. He told the committee that Australia, because it administers New Guinea as a trusteeship territory, has to answer the questions of the Trusteeship Council ahout the wela fare of the native peoples, and he regarded that as wrong. It almost appears as if the honourable member is ignorant of the fact that from 1920, under the conmandates system which applied to Australia, as the mandatory power, this in country had to appear before the Permanent Mandates Commission of the Nations League of Nations and answer the same kind of questions' and give the in same kind of informations as are required by the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations, because, by in solemn treaty, Australia had pledged to govern New Guinea, which not had been a German possession prior to 1914, in the interests of the native",73
417,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Did not the mandate go out of existence with the League of Nations ?,75
418,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable member for Richmond apparently understands that Australia was under the same duty during the time of the League of Nations as it now is under in respect of the United Nations.,75
419,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The mandates system disappeared with the League of Nations.,75
420,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE, The honourable member for Richmond will disappear from the chamber if he is not careful.,75
421,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"There was great argument about whether the mandates system did or did not disappear when the League of Nations ceased to exist. When the conference of the United Nations met at San Francisco it was decided to convert the mandates system into the trusteeship system, and it is perfectly true that Australia voluntarily continued, under the trusteeship system, to administer the same territory that it had administered for twenty years under the mandates system. The British Government took the same action. That was not a socialistic government but a coalition government. In fact all the nations of the British Commonwealth that were concerned-the United Kingdom, New Zealand in respect of Samoa, and Australia-too k the same action. In relation to Nauru there is a tripartite trusteeship in which Australia is administrator, and the three parties to which are the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia. It is almost like a summons to the Dark Ages to say that the administration of New Guinea, which had been conducted for twenty years satisfactorily and well by Australia under a system akin to the trusteeship system should not be administered in the same way according to a system under which Australia would undertake similar obligations. One of the most important functions of the - United Nations is to raise the standards of dependent peoples and to ensure that - colonies are no longer regarded as mere possessions of an imperial power, but are administered as British colonies were administered, according to the declarations of the great colonial administrators, in a spirit of trust. I see no degradation, and nothiqg except honour, propriety and justice in Australia answering questions to a committee elected by the United Nations, half of the members of which must belong to trustee nations themselves. All trustee countries are members of the Trusteeship Council, and I can see nothing wrong in Australia answering the questions of that council about what has happened during the previous twelve months in respect of the welfare of native peoples. I am quite sure that that opinion is shared by the majority of the Australian people. Representatives of all the churches have acclaimed the principle. Only recently in a broadcast a distinguished leader of the Church of England praised the principle of the improvement of the standards of native peoples. The Government adheres to that principle which is a United Nations principle. Yet we have the honourable member for Richmond saying, "" Ah, you should have done what the United States of America did, and treated New Guinea as a strategic area "". The United States of America treated as a strategic area the Caroline, Marshall and Marianas Islands which had been administered by Japan as mandates after World War I . , and in respect of which the Japanese, by constructing fortifications there, did not honour their obligations. The United States of America succeeded in obtaining the approval of the United Nations for these islands to be deemed strategic areas. However, Article 83 of the United Nations Charter deals with that kind of trusteeship territory. It .provides that the Security Council shall, subject to the"" provisions of the trusteeship agreement and without prejudicing security considerations, avail itself of the assistance of the Trusteeship Council to perform those functions of the United Nations under a trusteeship relating to political, economic, social and educational matters in the strategic area.",75
422,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,It can be vetoed in the Security Council.,75
423,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I know that; but they must avail themselves of the assistance of the United Nations and the Trusteeship Council in respect of everything pertaining to the welfare of the native peoples, even in strategic areas. The honourable member for Eichmond and the honourable member for Barker, must, in fairness, indicate where they stand in respect of United Nations.",75
424,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I have never been in any doubt about it ever since the silly thing was first formed.,76
425,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable member for Barker is very frank. I trust that the opinion which he has expressed is only his view on Wednesday and that it will be changed by Friday. He knows that the United Nations cannot be written down and sold short. I know something of the United Nations,76
426,Mr SPENDER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,To o right!,76
427,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Some people appreciate the fact that the honourable member for Warringah does not know anything about the United Nations. I have worked unsparingly for it.,76
428,Mr SPENDER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Why not for Australia ?,76
429,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member for Warringah asks, "" Why not for Australia ?"". The policy of the Australian Government, and the policy which will make Australia a great nation, involves unfaltering support for the United Nations. When we find Australia in the company of the UnitedStates of America and it9 great Presidents like the late Mr Roosevelt and Mr Truman, when our policy is also the policy of the British Commonwealth, I say that service to the United Nations with its machinery of action is in the best interests of Australia and it involves a positive foreign policy on the part of this country. That is the kind of policy we are pursuing now. I have tried to explain the deveolpment of the Department of External Affairs. I had thought that in substance these things were not disputed. I know that they are not disputed by the overwhelming majority of the Australian people.",76
430,Unknown,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Opposition members interjecting,",76
431,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am amazed that honourable members opposite, certainly only two or three of them, should object to that statement. I am glad that most Opposition members are silent. The overwhelming majority of the people of Australia favour the maintenance of international peace based on justice, the economic well-being of all peoples,"" and the doctrine of full employment, which is a part of the pledge in the Charter of the United Nations. The people are for the United Nations; the Government is for it and has always been for it ; and the committee will support what the Government has done in this connection.",76
432,Mr SPENDER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Warringah) [8.48] We have listened to the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) make one of his usual defences of the United Nations, but not until the last moment of his speech did he have very much to say about Australia, the country from which he sprang. Time and time again he has talked of Australia's interests being those of all the nations of the world. I dispute that contention. Some nation's would destroy this country if they were given a chance to do so. Yet the Minister, who is supposed to be our Minister for External Affairs, says that the best path for Australia to follow is the path of internationalism. As I have said on other occasions, the - Minister, in his pursuit of internationalism, has forgotten his duty to this country. In all of his discussions he does not say one word about this country and its difficulties. Indeed, he has used the debate on the Estimates very unfairly. Under the Standing Orders he is permitted to speak for an indefinite period, but Opposition members are limited to 30 minutes. Within that short period we are expected to sum up the whole international situation. I had hoped to hear from the Minister some statementof the particular dangers that confront this country at the present time, but he did not mention one word about them. In truth the foreign policy of this country may be summed up in the five letters of the alphabet, "" E.V.A.T.T."". That has been the policy of this country for the last six or seven years. To-night the Minister, in defending his department, has sought to turn this debate into a debate on international affairs and the vital interests that affect the world today. Not one word was said hy the right honourable gentleman in defence of his action in handing over New Guinea to the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations. He seems to have forgotten that there lie dead in that country no fewer than 6,000 Australians. He has told us what the late President Roosevelt and President Truman have said, but he did not say one word about what Mr Churchill has said. He did not tell us, as he could have done, that when the Tjnited States had to determine whether certain of its possessions or places occupied by it should be placed under the trusteeship of the Tjnited Nations it specified a special kind of trusteeship, known as a strategic trusteeship. New G-uinea, which is so vital to our interests, and in which 6,000 of our men laid down their lives, was handed over by the Minister to the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations without consultation with the Parliament or even, I suspect, with the Government. The right honourable gentleman is a law unto himself. He speaks on behalf of this country with no authority other than that which devolves upon him by virtue of the office which he holds. He has handed over to the inquiry and inspection of all other nations, enemy or friendly, a territory which is of the highest strategic importance to us. I am not prepared to follow the course that has been followed by so many persons, even on this side of the chamber, and say, "" What a great man this is"". In the pursuit of his own interests and in the cause of internationalism, the right honourable gentleman has sacrificed the interests of his country time and time again. I do not ask pardon for having made that statement. I stand hy it . If we examine the map of this part of the world we shall find that Noumea lies within 1,000 miles of the whole of OUT eastern coast extending from Sydney to Eockhampton. It within 1,500 miles of the whole of our eastern seaboard from east of Melbourne Cape York Peninsula. Australia is 1,000 miles from Timor. Prom those two points alone, as any man who has served in the Air Force knows, the whole of Australia is open to attack by a hostile power. Time and time again we have asked what the Government is doing to counter threat, but all.we get in reply is a speech by the Minister for External Affairs defence of the cause of internationalism. Similar speeches to the one he has just made were made after the League of Nations hajl been established. If we cast our minds back to the speeches that were delivered at that time, we will recall that they were couched in terms almost exactly similar to the speeches that have been delivered by the Minister for External Affairs; but at least some - had the virtue of having been made with a better sense of reality. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) did not take the view that this country should be sacrificed in the cause of internationalism. Let there be no mistake about our stand in this matter. We ou this side of the chamber believe in and support the principles of the United Nations, but we differ from the Minister in that we say that although we believe in the ideals of the United Nations, we must at all times put the interests of our own country first, since there are hostile forces in the world which are still determined to destroy us and our way of life. Time and time again, the Minister has told the people of Australia how he is fighting for its interests. I deny that he is doing so and all thinking people will agree with me. Let us consider what is taking place to the north of Australia. Not long ago, when the Minister made a speech on international affairs in this chamber, he omitted to mention two very vital matters. He did not say one word about what was taking place in China nor did he mention the North Atlantic Pact. Honourable members will recall how, when questions were directed to him about the position in China, the right honourable gentleman slid over them because he did not want to mention that country. The Minister for External Affairs lies has always shown a strange desire to placate Eussian interests. When the to light of publicity is thrown upon him he stands up as a world figure. He is even prepared ou occasions to stand up to Vishinsky and make a bold statement in order to direct world attention on himself. I well remember the occasion some years ago in this chamber when, having walked that with the mighty and spoken with the leaders of Eussia, he said that he was in satisfied that Eussia's foreign policy was founded on self-preservation and on no other premise. What kind of nonsense was such a statement hy a man who puts himself forward as the only man in this country who really knows anything ahout this subject? He may be judged by his own statements. Later, he said that the foreign policy of Russia was based on a desire to live in peace with the other nations of the world and that it was designed merely for the protection of Russia's own boundaries. What has happened since then? The world has been divided into two camps solely because Russia has not been prepared to compromise with the rest of the world. We have seen China overwhelmed. No doubt the Minister is waiting for the moment when he will be able to stand up in this chamber and say, "" We recognize the de facto Government of China "". He may avoid making such a statement as long as he possibly can, but it will not be long before it will be made. AVhat is the de facto Government of China but a government of force? During and since the war we have fought for the maintenance of certain principles, one of them being the right of people to determine their own destiny. The Chinese people have not been given the right to determine their own destiny. They are now governed by forces which were aidedand protected by Russia. Let there he no doubt about that. When Russia turned towards the west and found that it could not penetrate western Europe beyond its western zone in Germany, it directed its attention to the east. As I have said time after time, we are a white people occupying a geographical appendage of Asia. Because we occupy what is, in substance, an archipelago of Asia we have a very special problem to meet. I had thought that the Minister would tell us how he proposes to protect Australia from that threat, but he did not do so. The idea of a Pacific pact emanated, not from the right honourable gentleman, but from this side of the chamber. The Government played around with the idea and used it for political propaganda, hut it did nothing whatever about it. So, today, the Government pursues its foreign policy at Lake Success and in all the capitals of Europe, but not in Asia, where our vital interests lie. Mr Spender. Our lack of a defence policy constitutes-' an open invitation to any aggressive hostile power. Only four years have passed since World War II . came to an end but on every occasion when the Minister for External Affairs has happened to be present in this chamber to make a statement on foreign policy he has delivered a speech which has been neither more nor less than an apotheosis of the Tjnited Nations. I have waited for a long time to hear the Minister, who proclaims that he is a great Australian, state how he proposes to serveAustralia other than through the United Nations. When members of the Opposition mentioned the Pacific Pact, he made two statements, one of which was quite inconsistent with the other. He said that the Pacific Pact would merely bo supplementary to the United Nations, and then he said that it would he an alternative to that organization. Every honourable member will recall his references to those matters. He was trying to compromise with an idea merely for a political reason. He has always stood for internationalism. He believes in internationalism. He is an internationalist. He is not, in my view, an Australian, and that remark applies also to some honorablo members opposite who interject.",76
433,Mr DUTHIE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Rot .,78
434,Mr SPENDER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I do not propose to enter into personalities, but I say that that is so. If the honourable members opposite so desire, I shall mention a few names. In point of fact, the Government has been infected for a long time by communism. Honourable members opposite pretend to dispute that fact, but there is no doubt about it. I remember perfectly well that just before the last election the Labour party issued the same kind of propaganda as it is pouring out today to mislead the people of this country. Honourable members opposite said, "" The Labour party will fight the Communists"". The Labour party has fought the Communists only with words. Words are the only weapon with which the Lahour party will ever fight the Communists. The Minister for External Affairs stood up for two Communists whom I had interned when I was Minister for the Army. Those men had been engaged in treachery to their country in war-time; but the Minister declared that tliey should be released. As soon as he became Attorney-General, he released them from internment. But he did more tban that. When he became Attorney General, he supplied the Communist party with all the things that any government eould supply to enable them to carry out their treacherous and traitorous work in this country. That is the kind of man that the Minister is, and that is the kind of political party that the Labour party is. To-day it tries to convince the people that it is fighting communism. Let there, be no doubt in the minds of the people about the attitude of the Labour party on that issue. The Labour party will stoop to any action at all to try to persuade the people that it stands against communism. But, in truth, the honourable members who sit on the right of the Chair are nothing less than the political wing of the industrial movement of this country, and the industrial movement is split asunder because of a division between the Communists and the non-Communists. So, when I say that the Minister is an internationalist, it is simply indicative of attitude of many members of the Labour party. That remark does not apply to all of them, because I know that some of them are as bitterly opposed to communism as I am. I know also that the Labour party is quite incapable of dealing with this treacherous movement in our own country. So it does not surprise me that, when we listen to a debate on international affairs in this chamber, we do not hear the spirit of Australia being breathed at all. All that we hear is international jargon, and it is a jargon which we have heard for a long time. I am not one of those who believe for a moment that the ultimate solution of the world's problems can be obtained finally other than through the comity of the nations; but I am quite satisfied that, in this world of uncertainty today, the important thing for us to do is to put our defences in order, and adjust our foreign policy along lines which will preserve our own security. Our own security must be the first consideration. The Minister, and Labour members who seldom make a speech but who always interrupt, state repeatedly that Australia is closer to Great Britain than it has ever been in the past, and, hy the same token, that we are closer to the United States of America than ever before. That statement is absolutely false, as the Minister himself ought to know. It is quite wrong to mislead the public of this country into believing (ihat there has been a smooth, harmonious relationship at official levels between the Australian Government and the representatives of the United States of America in this country. Those of us who have anything to do with these matters know that the contrary is the fact. For a long time the Americans have been seeking to consummate the Fulbright agreement and eliminate double taxation in order to encourage the investment of American capital in this country, but this Government has at all times placed barriers in the way of the fulfilment of either of those objectives. Yet we are told that our relations with the United States of America are closer than they have ever been in the past. I agree that the Government's relations with the Government of Great Britain the are very close, hut I take leave to doubt whether our relations are closer with the people of Great Britain than they have ever been before. The Government's relations with the Government of Great Britain are close only because both governments serve au out-worn philosophy known as socialism. I now desire to make some observations upon a minor matter, although it reveals how the Minister himself is prepared to avoid giving a direct answer to questions on public affaire. This touches a small matter, hut the principle involved is important. On the 28th September, I asked the Minister for External Affairs whether any personal advances had been made to a certain high official in New York who was about to go to another post. I asked the right honourable gentleman whether it was a fact that between the 30th December, 1946, and the l l t h April, 1947, advances totalling 10,500 dollars had been made to that official without any authority from Australia to do so. My question continuedIf authority was given, by whom was it given ? I also asked what amount was outstanding today and whether those advances to a consular official constituted a permissible use of government funds. Before I proceed to deal with the answer that the Minister has given, I shall make a few preliminary observations. This Government imagines that any money which it expends belongs to it . The truth is that it holds the money only as the trustee on behalf of the people. However, the Government expends public money as if it owns it . Before I give the Minister's answers to my questions, I remind the committee that I did not mention the name of the official, but the Minister, who pretended a complete ignorance of the affair, mentioned him. He said that he was quite satisfied that the Australian Consul-General in New Y o r k had not engaged in anything irregular. I point out that I did not mention the Australian Consul-General, but hy a strange circumstance, the Minister who pleaded ignorance of the matter knew of the person to whom I was referring.",78
435,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable member said that the official was going to a post abroad. .,80
436,Mr SPENDER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I supoose that there are many Australian oflicials who are going to posts abroad. The Minister shifts them all over the place simply by ringing a bell. He has them under his thumb. He pushes them hither and thither. It is becoming known that more and more officers of the Department of External Affairs are men who are under the Minister's personal dominion. The reply to my question continuedI have made inquiries I beg leave to refuse to accept that statement to its full valueand have ascertained that the officer referred to did obtain certain advances in 1947. Am I to understand that when I asked this question, the Minister did not know of this strange departure from ordinary practice, and that a senior officer of his department was receiving personal advances upon personal security? But the Minister said that he had made in quiries and had ascertained that those advances had been made in 1947. I point out the indirect, tortuous, clever, and, in my opinion, politically dishonest way in which the question has been answered. The reply proceededThe advance was made necessary as a result of accommodation commitments into which the officer had necessarily to enter on the expiration of an existing lease. It was considered to be in the interests of the Commonwealth service to provide the advance as against salary. There was more than one advance over a period of some months. The answer continued The alternative was to allow the officer to obtain a furnished apartment or house and to pay him a special rent allowance to meet the unusually high costs of furnished accommodation in New York. I pause at this point to make the observation that if , in point of fact, an officer is so badly paid that he cannot struggle along and keep up his position as a representative of this country, the proper course is to increase his allowance. In my view, that is a matter which should be tested ultimately in this chamber, because I want the file to be laid on the table in order that honourable members may examine it . The answer proceededThe advance was personally approved by the then Secretary of the Department of External Affairs, Mr W. E. Dunk, now Chairman of the Public Service Board. I make two observations on that statement. The Minister has not said whether the advance was approved before or after it was granted. I want to ascertain whether this quite irregular procedure, for which I can find no justification in the Public Service Regulations, was brought to the Minister's notice. If it was not, I want to know who runs the Department of External Affairs. ""Was the secretary of the department responsible? If so, who gave to the permanent head of the department the right to advance public funds to an official by way of a loan? I should like to have that information, because it raises a matter of prime principle. The answer continuedTlie Treasury, to whom the matter was referred in the normal course What is normal about an abnormal transaction? I challenge the Minister to say that a transaction of this description has ever taken place before. The answer continued The Treasury, to whom the matter was referred in the normal course, concurred in the arrangements for the repayment by regular amounts aud an appropriate mortgage over the officer's furniture. Honourable members will be intrigued to know that the Commonwealth has entered into the business of money-lenders and brokers. What kind of a development is this? Apparently an officer was in financial difficulties and could not carry out his duties as a representative of this country because of the meagreness of his salary and allowance. In that event, the Minister stands condemned because he did not pay the officer a sufficiently high salary to enable him to represent this country abroad. Alternatively, the full story has not been told and all the facts have not been disclosed. In any event, the idea of taking a mortgage over an officer's furniture strikes me as passing strange to say the least. The answer proceededThe original amount was 8,500 dollars and not the larger amount stated by the honourable member for Warringah. I asked another question, and I should be glad to receive an answer to it. I asked whether a number of advances had been made, seven of which were in the amount of 1,000 dollars, one in the amount of 2,000 dollars and one in the amount of 1,500 dollars. That question could have been answered clearly enough with "" Yea "" or "" Nay"". I gave specific amounts aud dates, and I am entitled to know precisely what those amounts were, when they were drawn, and to whether approval was given before or after they were drawn. Finally, the Minister statedAs a result of regular deductions, the outstanding in March last year was approximentioned mately 4,000 dollars, and it has since further reduced. We are not told the amount by which it has been reduced. The committee is entitled to know why the department allowed that extraordinary transaction. The answer continuedPresent practice is to provide senior with furnished nccommodation wherever possible and to deduct a reasonable amount from the officer's salary. This avoids expense of moving officers' furniture upon re-posting and also avoids the necessity pay excessive rentals for furnished accommodaapproved tion. Afi it was, the arrangement made relation to the home of the consular officer in question wau in accord with the same general principle. That is a tortuous and misleading legalism, because there is no relation between one. transaction and another. If furnished accommodation is provided wherever possible and a reasonable amount is deducted for rent from an officer's salary, it is different from making a personal advance to him to enable him to acquire his own property. Australia is desperately short of dollars, and I should like to know whether that official has been placed in the position of being unable to carry on because the department has paid him a miserly salary and allowance. If that is so, let it be said by the Minister. If not, what is the reason for using public moneys to make a personal advance to any officer of the Commonwealth? If , in faet, a Minister or a permanent officer is able to say, "" You may have an advance for this or that purpose"", what becomes of the boasted control by Parliament of public expenditure? The Parliament would be reduced to a mere shadow. This Government has been too long in power, and has come to believe that it can deal with the public purse as if the money belonged to itself. Therefore, I move That the vote be reduced by £1.",80
437,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Barton - Attorneya General and Minister for External Affairs) [9.17] - The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) asked without notice a question which referred a consular officer who was about to be transferred to another post. I assumed that the reference was to the Consul General in New York. I had no previous amount knowledge that an advance of the kind by the honourable member had been been made. I do not even now know the details of the transaction. The honourable member's question was referred to my department, and the answer that has was supplied to the honourable member was provided by the department and by the Treasury. I saw no documents relatofficers ing to the incident. The advance was approved by Mr Dunk, who was then Secretary of the Department of External the Affairs, and is now Chairman of the to Public Service Board. It was also by the Treasury. The case in seems to be on all fours with that of officers for whom furniture is provided, the cost being recovered hy deductions from their salaries. In this instance, officer purchased the furniture himself, and paid for it from time to time deductions from his salary. How absurd it is to suggest that the Government entering into business. It was a perbeing fectly proper arrangement for an Affairs. employee to make with his employer circumstances prevented the ordinary procedure from being followed. The honourable member said that such an arrangement was politically dishonest. throw that back in his teeth.",81
438,Mr SPENDER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I repeat it.,82
439,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It is politically disHe honest on the part of the honourable membassador ber for Warringah to make such an was imputation. What is a Minister of the Crown supposed to do? I was asked a sador, question about a transaction of which knew nothing. Where did the honourable member himself get the information? Did he get it from some public servant? Did he commit a breach of confidence? do not know. The proper thing to was to refer the inquiry to the departthose ments concerned-the Department External Affairs and the Treasury. The approving omcers were the then of the Department of External Affairs, Mr Dunk, and the head of the Treasury. It is wrong to suggest that the transaction was improper, or that the Government is using public money as if it belonged to individual members of the Government. Throughout the whole of his speech, the honourable member exhibited malevolence and jealousy and hatred of a kind that unworthy of him. I gave the informaan atomic bomb? tion in good faith, and it is contrary to the fact to suggest that something has been kept back. I challenge the honortoo ahle member to persist with his own amendment.",82
440,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Barker) stage, [9.22] - I am amazed that the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) should admit that he placed before the Parliament an answer to a question on of envy and jealousy, too. notice",82
441,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The question was asked without notice.,82
442,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Well , lieve the answer took the form of a written statement. The Minister said that supplied an answer for the accuracy of the which he cannot vouch. He does not know whether it contained one truthful hy statement, and apparently he does not care, either. It is time the committee is took a good look at some of the things done by the Minister for External We have listened to a very long when speech from him to-night. It began before the dinner recess aud then, after a two-hour break, it was continued. It seemed to me that the committee, at the I end of the speech, looked very much like the Privy Council must have looked after the right honourable gentleman concluded his address on the Banking case. took great credit for what the Amof the United States of America reported to have said when he arrived in Australia. I shall never be an ambasbecause I am not sufficiently diploI matic, but I have always thought that it was one of the most important functions of ambassadors and ministers, to be friendly and courteous to the governJ ments to which they are accredited, do and not to say anything to which governments or the people generally of could take exception. I should be surprised if any minister or ambashead sador who comes to Australia from a foreign country should say anything different from what the American ambassador is reported to have said. What did the Minister for External Affairs expect? Did he expect the American ambassador to come here with a bouquei of roses fresh from California? Or did he expect a bouquet of stinkwort was or a crown of thorns, or perhaps The Minister should take a common-sense, objective view of these things. He lives altogether much in a circumscribed world of his creation. The rest of us are inclined to look on his comings and goings and his posing and posturings on the world's with a good deal of amusement, and sometimes with some disgust.",82
443,Mr CHI,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,TLEY - And with a good deal,82
444,Mr AECHIE CAMERON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"No , the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) and I have too much in common for him to be that of me. We are, in fact, two of the greatest tories in the Parliament. he What purpose has the Government in scattering ambassadors and ministers, and consuls-general all over the world? might search the public statements of Minister for External Affairs since took office without finding a coherent expression of the policy of the Governthem ment in thi9 respect. It appears that the Department of External Affairs, like Topsy, has "" just growed"". If this spread of diplomatic activity is to of any use to Australia, there should some evidence of it already. Some of have viewed at first hand the activities of foreign ambassadors and ministers Australia. If our ambassadors and minisvided ters overseas are no more usefully ployed than are foreign representatives in Australia, the whole lot could be back to their respective countries without any loss to the world, and there would no danger of war breaking out overnight. The Minister for External Affairs takes great credit to himself for the United .Nations, and has twitted me foi being a person who does not believe in it I never did believe in either the United Na tions or its predecessor. Eor reason I spoke and voted for the applicarightly tion of sanctions to Italy. I did not lieve that the sanctions would be worth the paper they were written on. I never believed that the League of Nations would work. I did not believe that sanctions would stop the war in Ethiopia. History proves that the United Nations cannot prevent war. What is its record? the United Nations settled the trouble Berlin? Did the Minister for External Affairs settle anything there, even after buying into the trouble? In spite of the efforts of the United Nations, and of British Minister, Lord Cadogan, the trouble in Berlin was not settled. Berlin is a diplomatic and military cancer in the heart of Europe, and this great organiThat zation, to which we are told to look up the guardian of world peace, has not done a darned thing about it. War has nation, been going on in Greece for a able long time, but the United Nations has done nothing about it. In Palestine, United Nations submitted to force, which is the very thing that the Minister for External Affairs says it was created curb. The United Nations saw its If own mediator, the descendant of a and Frenchman who left his country for a throne, murdered without anycharity 1.32] One thing being done about it. It did the nothing more than the Australian Gohe vernment did when Australians were murdered in Java. The Government left in their graves, and did nothing. I turn now to India and Kashmir. A leading Australian officer and a well known pressman were selected to go be there, but the United Nations went cold be on the proposal, and they are still here. us I have seen them. What did the United Nations do about Indonesia? It made a in bad situation infinitely worse, and proa supreme example of muddle. In emIndo-China, the French are struggling against a Communist uprising. Has the sen. United Nations done anything to assist in the preservation of law and order in bo that country? It has done nothing. If events in Korea are an example of intervention by the United Nations, then God forbid that we shall ever have to depend on that organization to save us. Now let . us consider China, where there exists the most unlovely situation in the world. that The honourable member for Warringah said that Eussia, checked to the bewest, would immediately turnto the east. The time will come again when Eussia will intrude into Asia and rightdown the Persian Gulf. The time will come when Eussian divisions will approach the passes on the north-west frontier of India. I ask the Minister for Has External Affairs what the United in Nations can do about it. It will do nothing more that it did in Palestine. Greece, Indonesia, Indo-China, China, and Korea. Its members will have a greatthe big talking match at Lake Success, and, after they have talked themselves into a stupor, Molotov, or whoever may be anting for him, will get up and say, "" No ! "" . is as far as they will go. So long as as we have an organization of this sortin which the right of veto is vested in one it cannot work. The right honorgentleman can talk about the four freedoms and things like that. All 1 the ask him to do is to come home for once and tell us what freedom is extended to himself or to any member of his party to to speak against the policy of that party. he did so, he would be tipped out quick lively. Those who preach these things to the world, should remember that and freedom begin at home. Until such time as the four freedoms can be extended to the spartan-disciplined Australian Labour party, its members should maintain silence on the subject of freedom.",82
445,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE, Leave that alone!,84
446,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,That is a sore point.,84
447,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Do not pursue it, anyway!",84
448,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I do not propose to do so. I always know whea. I get to a cliff and I have never gone over one yet. The Minister for External Affairs is a student of history. He has devoted a lot of his time to it. I have had to work hard for my living, and I have not had much time for avocations of that sort, but I recall to the right honourable gentleman the fact that there is nothing new in the idea of a united nations organization. This is no new discovery by a few Marco Polos. It goes back into history. I shall not take honourable members back further than Alexander the Great, who thought that he would achieve a united nations of Europe and Asia by spreading the Greek language. He was wrong. Not long afterwards Rome came on the scene.",84
449,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Order! The honourable member may not recite the history of the world.,84
450,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am not reciting the history of the world. I am going into the matter of the United Nations. The Chair gave the Minister for External Affairs an absolutely "" open go"". He was allowed to wander from the Sahara to the Gobi Desert and from the North Pole to Mount Erebus. All I crave is a small amount of the latitude that was given to him. I do not think that you, with your sense of fair play, Mr Temporary Chairman, would deny that to me. There is a historical novel called Quo Vadisl You will find, Mr Temporary Chairman, that the story is quite true. It is about an old Roman who, when he was celebrating a little unwisely and a little too well, not sure whether 32 or 34 legions had guarded Rome. Charlemagne was another who thought he would Unite the world. The Mohammedan conquests of North Africa and Europe were designed to establish another united nations authority. People then were given the choice of the Koran or the sword.",84
451,Mr MCLEOD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,What did the Macdonalds do to the Camerons?,84
452,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member is wrong in his Scottish history. I advise him to look at the picture of Bonnie Prince Charlie and he will see what the MCLeods did not do for the king of Scotland. He will want a much wider red stripe in his yellow tartan than he has up to date. We get down further. I do not intend to go into the whole history of the Holy Roman Empire. I mention only Charles V. when practically all Europe, the two Americas and a good slice of Asia were under the one king. That went overboard. There has been one league of nations that has been supremely successful. About it we seldom hear a word. It was previously known as the British Empire. One does not hear, it mentioned in this chamber very often. I have heard it spoken of disparagingly and most apologetically. I have seen it go into a form of voluntary liquidation since completing a successful war, an action for which there is no parallel in history. The Minister for External Affairs tells us about the successes of the United Nations, but he does' not seem to be doing much to increase the strength and cohesiveness of what has been the most successful league of nations, up to date. I refer to the British Empire. I ask the right honourable gentleman where he stands in regard to the Western Union. Does he think it is fated to go in the same direction as ancient Greece? He has read Lord Bryce's Greater Greece. Does he expect Western Europe to go in the same way as Greece went or does he think it would be better to get a united Europe than a United Nations? I point out that, before the 1939 war, the boundary between Europe and Asia was not the Ural Mountains, but the Vistula River. The boundary is far west of the Vistula today. It runs through Berlin. To the west is was Western Europe and to the east the barbarism of communism and all that barbarism has stood for in the last 4,000 years. Before there can be any approach to a successful United Nations there must be a strong English-speaking union. That is the first essential. It must be the first stone in the foundations of anything of the character of a united nations - organization. The next matter devolves upon ""Western Europe. Can we get Scandinavia, Germany, the Low Countries, Erance, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Australia, in other words, the very cream of Europe, to agree, first, to a customs union, and, secondly to a tenuous and perhaps rather shadowy form of political arrangement for common defence and a certain superior governmental authority? That is the first step. The right honourable gentleman asks us to gallop before we can even - crawl. I think it is high time that he took a good look at world history. I am, prepared to discuss it with him any time he likes, in public or private. I make no apology for my attitude to the United Nations any more than I did for my attitude to the League of Nations. The right honourable gentleman begged one question. By interjection he was asked why he handed over Papua to the United Nations",84
453,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable member means New Guinea.,85
454,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The right honourable gentleman gave it the United Nations.,85
455,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Is the honourable member referring to Papua or New Guinea? Papua is different from New Guinea.,85
456,Mr AEOHIE CAMEEON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"If I am say. incorrect, the right honourable gentleman must have misinformed the committee. Nothing that was under the control of the Australian Government should have gone out of its control. If the right honourable gentleman thinks that at Lake Success they can run Australian terriHe tories better than they can be run Canberra, it is time that he took himself to Lake Success for good. What this country needs, above everything else, some one with, first, an Australian look, secondly, a British outlook, thirdly, an English-speaking outlook and, fourthly, a European outlook. When we have that I am prepared to give some attention to the so-called principles of United Nations. We have been treated to something that I shall remember for a long time, because we have had a very good discussion on a matter of policy, whereas it was ruled that that could not be permitted while we were in committee on the Estimates.",85
457,Mr FALSTEIN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Watson) [9.40] - If the cacophony of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) and the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender) can be accepted as argument, the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) must have been overwhelmed. When the statements made by the honourable member for Barker are examined, it will appear first that what he had to say was mostly burlesque, which is a travesty on the Parliament, and, secondly, that what he had to say would not stand any analysis whatever. The honourable member for Barker, after disavowing the United Nations, went on to say that the United Nations has not settled anything. He illustrated his statement by making a reference to the Berlin air lift. Whether he knows it or not, the situation in Berlin was critical, and had there not been an air lift, there would have been war.",85

It was unmistakable. If he declares that the air lift was not a substantial contribution to the preservation of peace, all that I can say is that he is not quite conscious of what took place. concluded magnificently by calling from for an Australian outlook, a British outlook, an English-speaking outlook and a European outlook. I wish that we is oould get him to put those points in this outchamber when the debate centres on the matter of immigration and white Australia, because he would perhaps be able to give an influential lead to the Opposition in understanding the matters that the the Minister for Immigration (Mr Calwell) has long been trying tb make apparent to this country as being essential for its clef ence. I propose now to say one or two things about the concluding remarks of the honourable member for Warringah. Half of his speech was taken up with a long dissertation and an allegation concerning the Consul-General in New York, who had some advances made to him by the Department External Affairs. Curiously, although the advances that were made to the Consul-General were made abnormally, the department was cautious enough to accept some security against the advances. I wonder what he would have 3aid regarding the abnormality of the transaction if the department had not taken that precaution. I consider that that portion of his speech was in bad taste in view of the fact that when the honourable gentleman was in New York he did not hesitate to accept the hospitality and generosity of the Consul General, or so J am reliably informed. Yet he is now seeking to vilify the Consul General in this chamber. Honourable members may make their own judgment about what kind of a person the honourable member for Warringah must be when, after having accepted a man's hospitality, he comes into the chamber and vilifies him although he is thousands of miles away. The remainder of the honourable member's statements are not capable of analysis, and that remark applies also to the statements of the honourable member for Barker. One of the things that the honourable member for Warringah referred to according to a note that I took was the situation in China. He said, in effect: "" I wonder what the Minister for External Affairs will say when it comes close to the time to recognize the de facto government of China. Will he do so, and what will he tell us then ?"" The implication in his remarks was that there is something sinister in this recognition of another foreign government. According to my notes the honourable member also used the words "" recognition of a government that has come to power by force."" The people of this country have not such a short memory that they forget that the honourable member who said that was a Minister in the Menzies Government Ur. Falstein. which recognized the de facto Franco regime which came into power in Spain by force. The people are not going to forget that when the Soviet Government eventually assumed control of affairs in Russia in 1917 conservative governments of that time did not recognize what was a reality. I put this question to the honourable member for Warringah: What is the alternative, if v/e seek to preserve of peace, to recognition such as must be eventually afforded even to the new Government in China? I told the House after I returned from China two years ago that the Kuomintang government was rotten and corrupt. I told the House that Chiang Kai-shek, Dr Soong and their minions were persons who retained power in China only by virtue of their corrupt practices and their maintenance of private armies. That was the only way in which they retained power but the people of China have removed them from a substantial area of the Chinese domain. If it appears that it is desirable or necessary in the interests of peace for Australia to accord de facto recognition to the new government of China, that recognition must be accorded even although it may be ideologically unsavoury, OT foreign to our desires. The honourable member for Warringah referred to what he described as the singular failure of the Minister for External Affairs to say what were the particular dangers that confronted this country. Having made such a statement the honourable member himself neatly passed on to ths consideration of another matter without specifying what the dangers were, thus leaving the people to conjecture what the dangers were. The maintenance of a force of 100,000 men in New Guinea would not give us any greater security in Australia than we can obtain by our co-operation with other nations through the United Nations, by entering into obligations such as, perhaps, a Pacific pact, and by our subscription to the North Atlantic pact and to the Western Union, as well as by our adherence to a form of collective security. No greater safeguards for peace than those could be obtained by our worrying about a few acres of ground in New Guinea, even although they may he held by a squadron or two of aeroplanes and by an aircraft carrier and a few battalions of troops. The plain fact of the matter is that the proposed vote of £1,005,000 for the Department of External Affairs wonld provide . a far greater safeguard for peace than the maintenance of large forces and territorial stations in areas beyond Australia's shores. In case it has been forgotten I shall remind honourable members that the Minister is asking for the sanction of Parliament for the expenditure of a sum of £1,005,000 in the current year, which is the equivalent of 2s. 6d. a head of population per annum. That is a sum which some people spend by subscribing to membership of the Liberal party, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Let us examine what we shall buy for this 2s. 6d. each, because I consider that it is time that we had some practicality in this debate. What we shall buy for that 2s. 6d. is first, direct representation for Australia in all the other dominions of the British Commonwealth, which include Canada, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, the Republic of Ireland, and South Africa. Secondly, we shall buy direct representation for Australia at ambassadorial level in the countries of the permanent member nations of the Security Council of the United Nations. Those nations include the Soviet Union, France, China, Great Britain and the United States of America, f n addition to that we shall buy direct representation, through our office in Brazil, in all the Latin-American countries. I do not think that any one would doubt for a moment that the expenditure of such a small sum of money per capita is an extremely wise insurance from the point of view of both security and trade. No honourable member who has spoken in this debate has suggested that the amount for which approval is being sought is in excess of what should be provided. Nobody has suggested that it is inadequate in any way. A full explanation has been given by the Minister about what I regard as the successful attempts by the Government and the Minister to conserve expenditure in areas in which vve have to provide dollars to maintain our diplomatic representation. There has been no argument from honourable members opposite about the importance of the vote for the Department of. External Affairs. The argument by honourable members opposite in this chamber today has been based upon a worn out case on foreign affairs that has been advanced on every occasion on which statements on foreign affairs have been presented to the Parliament, irrespective of the contents of those statements. Honourable members opposite have simply said the same old things over and over again. The Minister did not initiate a debate on foreign affairs himself today but was provoked by the statements of honourable members opposite. The same old arguments have been adduced again and again by the same few honourable members opposite. I refer to the honourable member for Barker, the honourable member for Warringah, the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) and the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison). We might as well have gramophone records made of their speeches, because having once been made they could be played over and over again and we should be just as well informed on the subjects that the honourable members speak on, as we are when they stand up and make a speech on them. If cacophony were to be accepted for argument, then we have been overwhelmed today, because all I got from the speech of the honourable member for Warringah was plenty of noise and not much sense. We also got that little bit of scandal about the Consul-General in New York that he threw into make up the weight. I suggest that that piece of scandal was in the worse possible taste when we consider that the honourable member for Warringah had previously accepted the Consul-General's hospitality and generosity.",85
462,Mr MCEWEN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,How does the honourable member know that?,87
463,Mr FALSTEIN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I have already explained that to the committee.,87
464,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable member might have told a lie.,87
465,Mr MOEWBW,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,We know that the Government keeps dossiers on all of us which must be very complete.,87
466,Mr FALSTEIN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Honourable members need not accept my word for what happened in New York. There are some matters on which I seek information from the Minister. One of them concerns the provision, if any, by the Department of External Affairs for the maintenance of the Australian Mission in Tokyo. That does not appear to be covered in the Estimates. Can the Minister also tell me why the vote for the High Commissioner in the United Kingdom is included in the previous division under the Prime Minister's Department, rather than under the Department of External Affairs. I sought an explanation of this from the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman), but ' I regret to say that I was not satisfied with the answer he gave me. Perhaps the Minister for External Affairs can enlighten me on the subject. The total proposed vote for the Department of External Affairs is £1,005,000, or 2s. 6d. a head of population per annum. That is a small individual contribution for each taxpayers to make for a department that is as important as this one is. The total proposed vote for the department represents two-elevenths of one per cent, of the entire budget vote, and, therefore, it seems unfair and unreasonable that the time of the committee should be occupied with the trivial and frivolous amendment that has been moved to reduce the vote by £1. That amendment was moved merely to satisfy the vanity and desire for publicity of the honourable member for Warringah.",87
467,Mr MCEWEN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Indi) [9.59] thought that it would fall to my lot make some reply to the speech of the honourable member for Watson (Mr. Ealstein), but as he has not said anything substantial there is no need for me reply. I shall direct my attention, thereman fore, to the speech of the Minister for issue? External Affairs (Dr Evatt) himself. The Minister spoke for about an hour the debate which he himself lifted from the level of a discussion of financial estimates in relation of his department, to the level of a debate on international affairs.",88
468,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Anothe r honourable ber did so earlier in relation to certain aspects.,88
469,Mr MCEWEN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It is true that an honourable member did make a passing reference to the matter, but the Minister wil] concede that, in his address that lasted for about an hour, he has lifted the debate from a discussion of the estimates for the Department of External Affairs to a debate on Australia's foreign policy. In an address of that length, delivered on one of the rare occasions when he is present in this chamber, he should have explained his attitude to certain issues that are of vital importance, not only to this country, but also to the world at large. Instead of doing so, the right honourable gentleman made what can only be reasonably described as a political speech about our foreign policy. He did not give us an objective account of the policy of the Government in relation to the events in Europe and, indeed, over the whole face of the European and Asiatic continents, the outcome of which may well affect the fate of this country. What is the attitude of this Government to the trends that have unfolded in Europe? What is its attitude towards the North Atlantic Pact? What is its attitude towards the militaTy implications of that pact on the nations of Europe? Where does Australia stand in that regard? The right honourable gentleman did not mention those matters. Where does Australia stand today with Asia aflame? Where does Australia stand in Tegard to the conclusion of a formal peace with Japan, an issue on which - the Minister spoke with great vehemence and virility two years ago? - I To-day, the Communist-backed new to nation of China is reaching right to the Pacific Ocean and is standing before allied-occupied Japan, where Australian soldiers are still serving. What is the to attitude of the right honourable gentleand of the Government towards that I have never been convinced that the Minister has treated in Australia's position in Japan with the seriousness that his words have indicated. He chose to send as the Australian representative to J apan to sit opposite General MACArthur and to take his place in the deliberations of the Far Eastern Commis young man, but one of the youngest and most junior officers in the Australian diplomatic service. That was the most curious appointment that one could conceive. It certainly did not fit in with the Minister's proclaimed earnestness about Australia's status in the international arena. How could we expect a young man in his 'thirties who, ten years ago, was a junior cable clerk in the Prime Minister's Department, to wield influence when seated opposite a man of the international stature of General MACArthur? I say nothing against Mr Shaw personally, but I say that it was a fantastic appointment, though no more fantastic than some of the other appointments that have been made by this Government. What is the significance of replacing Mr. Shaw by the senior Australian career diplomat, Colonel Hodgson? Does this change portend greater activity in the Japanese area, or does it indicate that Colonel Hodgson has been removed from his former post as Australian Ambassador to France merely to make room for some one else ? Those are some of the matters that we expected the Minister to discuss. This country is vitally interested in the conclusion which the Minister draws from the revelation that the Soviet possesses the secret of the atomic bomb. We shall not be brushed aside by the sneering statement of an honourable member opposite that the association of diplomacy with the prospect and possibility of war is the task of the war-monger. One hears such accusations even from the ministerial bench. The truth is that the principal job of the diplomat is to avoid war. That is the raison d'etre of the diplomat. It is his task to do everything possible to avoid war. If war cannot be avoided, it is his job to see that his own country is so situated that it is not likely to bo defeated and not likely to have to fight without the assistance of allies. That has heen the historic function of the diplomat. History carries many messages to us of the services that have heen rendered by skillful, assiduous foreign ministers to their respective countries, and of the disaster that has befallen some nations because of the failure of their foreign ministers. Where do we stand in that respect today? Are we merely floating along happily in the belief .that, because this nation subscribes to the principles of the United Nations, it is safe from agression? I support the principle of the United Nations. It is the one organized hope for the preservation of human society. I hope that we may be able to avoid the horrors of war, but I do not rate the prospects higher than a hope. I remind the Government and the people that the whole history of mankind is one of conflict after conflict. I simply cannot believe that I just happen to live on the earth, which has existed for millions of years, and which has been inhabited by humans for 3cores of thousands of years, at the moment when war has ceased forever. If that were true, we should have reached the age of miracles. This nation requires its Minister for External Affairs to devote his talents primarily to the historic function of all foreign ministers, and that is, to see that his country has a sound recognizable foreign policy; that it knows where it is going and with whom it is going; that it knows who are its friends and who are its potential enemies; and that it knows-, too, that, if the catastrophe of war befalls it, who its allies will be. That is the function of a Minister for External Affairs, as I conceive it. There is another job of work to be done. I refer to the carrying on of a crusade for peace in the United Nations and its subsidiary organizations. The United Nations must have vast powers. The General Assembly must have a president. The Minister for External Affairs has enjoyed the congratulations of honourable members on both sides of this chamber on the high honour he has achieved in being chosen to preside over the General Assembly of the United Nations. I remind him and the people that such an appointment places him in much the same position as that of a judge of a court or an umpire of a football match.. It lifts him above the level of partisanship. But we all are partisans in a partisan world. The task of our foreign Minister is to recognize that he is a partisan, and that his offices as Minister for External Affairs and as the President of the General Assembly of the United Nations have been completely irreconcilable. The office of umpire or judge and, at .the same time, leader of his own particular team are completely irreconcilable. If the Australian Government or the Australian people are able to produce a man who is so highly regarded as to bo elected President of the General Assembly of the United Nations, the honour conferred upon him is dearly bought. After the honour has been conferred upon him, he ceases to be able to take his place as a partisan. When our Minister for External Affairs was President of the General Assembly we were the only nation in the world without a leader. We should not be leaderless in this sphere in days when bitter, acrimonious and partisan argument has never been more acute in international affairs. That was our lot during a vital year when we, of all the nations of the world, were denied a representative to state our case, because the President of the General Assembly is like a judge or an umpire and cannot state a case for a litigant or for one of the teams. A judge must hold the scales of justice evenly between the contending parties. The Minister for External Affairs had to hold the scales of justice at the General Assembly of the United Nations, and sometimes it was his lot to hold the scales when they were tipped against the interests of the English-speaking peoples. I do not wish to be misunderstood on this matter. I am proud that an Australian has been chosen to fill such a high office, but I hope that never again will a Minister for External Affairs accept such an office. If , in the an Australian Minister for External Affairs is offered such a post, he should vacate his office as Minister and allow his place to be taken by another person who is not inhibited by his obligations to disregard the partisan spirit. I am sure that the Minister for External Affairs does not misunderstand the point which I am endeavouring to make. Australia should be represented at the General Assembly of the United Nations by a Minister for External Affairs who can state a case for his nation, and fight for it in a manner which has not .been possible in the past, because of conflicting loyalties on the part of our representative. The Minister for External Affairs, whoever he may be, is our Mr MCEwen. frontline advocate in conferences that discuss measures for the avoidance of war, and for formulating plans against the possibility of war. He cannot satisfactorily, occupy two offices at the same time. I refer to the office of spokesman for his country, and to the office of an objective and impartial judge. I regard that as an important matter. What should be the policy of the Australian nation. I certainly shall not attempt to cover in detail at the present time what I consider the policy of the Australian nation ought to be, but the Opposition parties say collectively and unanimously that the broad course of our policy is clear. It is to maintain a complete and unbroken alinement of all the elements of the British Commonwealth. This should not be done in the expectation of getting our own way on every occasion, and we certainly should not pursue any course either through theoretical or selfish national and personal motives that will weaken the alinement of the whole of the British people. That is the first and simple objective of Australia's foreign policy. The second simple and recognizable point of our foreign policy is to lend the whole of our weight of influence towards welding all the elements of the British Commonwealth with the rest of the English-speaking world, including our great cousin, the United States of America. Unless that unity is achieved, there is no hope for us in this future, kind of world. When that objective has been achieved, we should try to weld the English-speaking elements with those who see democracy with the same eyes as we see it. In the world today, there is a Hoc of satellites circulating around one tremendously powerful nation which preaches the gospel of democracy but does not practise any principle of it - We must ensure that we shall not drift into a position of weakness ms-a-ms that great bloc. The Minister for External Affairs and members of the Opposition have referred at various times to the territories of the Commonwealth. It is true, as has been stated, that the territory of New Guinea was held under mandate, not because we desired to administer it in that way, but because the League of Nations would not award it to us under any other conditions. Australia held New Guinea under the mandate system until the League of Nations dissolved after the outbreak of World War II . New Guinea is geographically our frontline of defence, and with the disappearance of the League of Nations it came into the possession of this country. It cannot be denied that Australia has given away New Guinea under the trusteeship system. The Minister for External Affairs can rightly claim to be the principal author of the doctrine of trusteeship at the San Francisco conference. That doctrine was not well received by the representatives of the United Kingdom. Indeed, they resisted the doctrine, and, in doing so, they had the support of the representatives of the United States of America. However, the doctrine of trusteeship and all the arguments in favour of self-determination and the like can be wrapped up in such plausible language that they become almost irresistible. The Australian Minister for External Affairs, as the principal spokesman for that doctrine, was immediately supported by the delegates of Soviet Eussia and of all the little countries of the world which have not played a part of deciding national destiny but which were invited to the party at San Francisco.",88

477,Mr MCEWEN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I recollect clearly that the American State Department and the United Kingdom Government resisted those proposals. Be that a3 it may, the position today is that the Australian Government defends the'principle of trusteeship for the territory of New Guinea in the interests of the advancement and security of the native population. Last night, the Prime Minister said that the people of the United Kingdom were the same today as they were in 1939. May I express the opinion that members of the Labour party in this chaniber today hold the same views as members of the Labour party held in 1939? What was the attitude of the Labour party ten years ago to the defence of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea? When the Menzies Government introduced legislation to extend the provisions of the Defence Act to New Guinea, every member of the Labour party voted against it. They desired that the mandated territory should be left without defences. The Minister for External Territories (Mr Ward), speaking either on that bill or on the defence Estimates in 1939, said, in effect, ""Let those who want to defend New Guinea go there and defend it themselves "". That gentleman is now entrusted with supervising the welfare of the backward peoples of the trusteeship territories that are administered by Australia. He had nothing to say in their favour in 1938-39, but today he holds the banner high aloft, or so he says. The scene has changed. We cannot put back the hands of the clock. Trusteeship is an actuality in the Charter of the United Nations. I hope that the Australian Government will realise that we cannot go along in the certainty that Australia will never again be involved in war, and that Australians will not have to fight again in New Guinea, where their fathers or brothers He in their thousands as the victims of the last war. I hope that this Government will start to take a more realistic view in relation to the defence of New Guinea, as the Government of the United States of America has from the outset taken a more realistic view in regard to the strategic importance df some of the islands which that country holds under trusteeship. I shall say no more on that aspect, but will hearken back to the principal motif of my speech, which is that one cannot be both a player and an umpire. This country cannot afford to be without a spokesman in the councils of the world today. We have been without a spokesman for a year, due to the high honour that was conferred upon our Minister for External Affairs. I argue most strongly that if ever again an Australian Minister is so honoured he should vacate his office as Minister for External Affairs during the time that he holds such a high position, and thus allow us to have a spokesman in the councils of the nations, as has every other country in the world.",91
478,Mr BURKE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Perth) [10.26] - The honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen) has made a thoughtful and - useful contribution to the debate. If the - speech that he has just delivered represents Opposition policy there is very little difference of opinion between the Government and the Opposition on the vital question of foreign policy. I think that the Leader of the Liberal party (Mr Menzies) has from time to time expressed sentiments similar to those that have been expressed by the honourable member for Indi. The utterances of other prominent members of Opposition parties, however, give us reason to doubt whether they give such unwavering support to the agencies that have been established to prevent war in the future. We all know that in time of war, or threatened war, such agencies may break down. As the honourable member for Indi has truly said, he puts his faith fully in the United Nations organization as one of the few organizations from which peace might ultimately be derived. That is a faith and a hope that each of us who supports the United Nations puts in that organization. honourable member said that the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) altered the tone of this debate so that there could be a full discussion on foreign affairs. That is not so. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) made a definite attack oh the United Nations as an organization. He indicated quite clearly, that he was completely without faith in the United Nations though he denied this later by interjection. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) also expressed lack of faith in the United Nations. Each of us could preach that gospel of despair. It is highly probable that we would be right if we said today that the United Nations will fail. As the honourable member for Indi has said, we must hope that it will not fail when a future crisis comes, as it surely will come. One of the major reasons why these organizations fail is that the nations of the world are not yet willing to sink their immediate national interests and sovereignty in order to give international organizations some real power by which to preserve peace in the world. The honourable member for Richmond also made sneering references to the high honour that had fallen to the Minister for External Affairs. In order to high-light his view of that honour, which the honourable member for Indi acknowledges, he cited all of the nations-al l small nations - whos e representatives have been honoured in this way. He implied that the representatives of small nations were chosen for this honour, without regard for the ability of their representatives, probably because they were the only ones who would accept the honour. That is wholly false. It ought to be accepted that any nation, no matter how email, may make a useful contribution to the world's discussions, and may, as we did, produce a man who could with dignity and good results fulfil the very high positions to which he was appointed. The honourable member for Indi stated a quite false analogy when he set out the principal object of his speech, to prove that the Minister for External Affairs, as president of the General Assembly of the United Nations, could and should be The likened to a judge or umpire, because he was called upon to lay down or interpret Tules, and to give judgment on legal points placed before him. I think that the honourable member has misunderstood the nature of this position, at leastas it appears to him. Instead of heing in the position of a judge or umpire, it appears to me that the president of the General Assembly of the Tjnited Nations plays a vital role as a leader in the councils of the world. He does not judge the issues or interpret the rules, hut gives a lead to a team of men and women who are seeking earnestly to spare the world the horrors of future war. The representative that Australia sent to the General Assembly last year was elected president of that body. In that position he played a vital role, and gave the lead in all of the Tjnited Nations discussions. He gave aid and assistance, and the benefit of his wide organizational knowledge, as well as diplomatic energy and sense, to the representatives of nations that were striving earnestly to preserve the peace of the world. I do not think that the argument of the honourable member for Indi that Australia was deprived of a spokesman can be sustained. Rather do I think, as I have already said, that we have had our spokesman in the most vital role to which he could be elected. Apart from that there is little in the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Indi with which one could quarrel. The item of the Estimates which is now being debated deals with the total work of the Department of External Affairs. The United Nations is only one of the variety of organizations in which the department is interested. The General Assembly and the Security Council are vital parts of this new world organization which seeks to find a formula for continued peace. I believe that the specialized organizations to which Australia subscribes play a vital role. The failure of the League of Nations was due in part to its failure to establish such specialized organizations. There were other reasons, however, which were associated with nations that were jealous of their sovereignty. The failure to establish specialized organizations dealing with finance, trade and commerce, and a host of other problems, was one of the major reasons why the League failed. That fault the present organization has sought to correct. Australia has diplomatic representatives in various parts of the world. These diplomatic posts are, as the honourable member for Indi pointed out, agencies for peace. They perform three functions-to stimulate and expand international trade, to improve friendly relations with other countries and to promote peace. Therefore, there is no reason why the Government should be criticized for establishing diplomatic posts overseas. Rather should it be commended for so doing. In addition to relying on the United Nations, to which we have given our full and unwavering support, we seek to maintain good relations with the United States of America and the United Kingdom. That has been Australia's traditional policy, and it is our policy today. The British Commonwealth, hy whatever name it may be called, has always been a major force for peace. It can still play an important part in the world. The United States of America is a bastion of peace and liberty. It could well stand alone. It is the strongest, richest and the most highly industrialized nation in the world, but it has given full support to the United Nations. That ought to be sufficient answer to those carping critics who say that no reliance can he placed on the United Nations. Great Britain, with colonies and territories all over the world, has also, under Conservative and Labour governments alike, supported the United Nations. Yet we are told by some honourable members opposite that we should not be associated with that organization and that because similar organizations failed in the past, we should have nothing to do with the United Nations. The fact is that every country, great or small, that gives its support to the United Nations is seeking to preserve world peace, and to prevent the suffering and horror associated with modern war. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) discussed the work of the United Nations, and claimed that it had failed in every issue to which it had addressed itself. The reverse is the truth. It has succeeded in almost everything it has attempted to do. Most of the issues to which he referred were specifically excluded from the activities of the United Nations. For instance, the making of peace with Germany and Japan was specifically excluded in that way. It was to be left to the Great Powers to work out peace formulas, and only after that was done was the United Nations to take up its task. In some instances, work which had at first been specifically withheld fro m the Tjnited Nations, had to he handed over to it . All the problems dealt with by the Tjnited Nations have not yet been solved, and some may not be solved for a considerable time. The honourable member for Indi made a valuable contribution to the debate. He has given almost unqualified support to the United Nations, and to the work of our own Department of External Affairs. I do not believe that we can spread our representation too widely throughout the world. Such representa-. tion should be the means of our getting to know other nations better, and of allowing other nations to know us better. We need to promote trade and good relations with other countries. It is proposed to expend just over £1,000,000 on the work of the Department of External Affairs, and I believe that the expenditure of even more would be justified. The Government has no case to answer. Its foreign policy has been wise, and the Minister for External Affairs should be commended for his work, and urged to continue it .",92
479,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Parramatta) [10.43] I notice that whenever we embark on a discussion on external affairs, the Minister for External Affairs (Dr E v at t ) , when he is here, which is not very often, rather cunningly seeks to turn the discussion into one on the United Nations. It seems that the United Nations is with him a ruling passion, strong in death. Everything else is subordinated to the United Nations. Let me point out that the first duty of the Minister is no.t the United Nations, but to the people Australia. H is performances during last few years have indicated that he in truth, an internationalist, and in truth, a good Australian. I made similar statement when he was in the House during a fleeting moment last year. He was annoyed at remark, and said that it was not - but he had fled back to Lake Success Timbuctoo or somewhere else before could j u s t if y my statement. endeavour to justify it now in. his presence. With the exception of honourable member for Watson (Mr . Falstein) and the honourable member for Perth (Mr Burke), honourable members who support the Government have been strangely silent about the Department of External Affairs. The lionorable member for Perth was also completely obsessed by the United Nations. The committee is not discussing the United Nations. It is discussing the estimates for the Department of External Affairs, which amount to a little more than £1,000,000, as the honourable member for Perth has airly put it . This amount of the taxpayers' money is to be expended, at the behest of the Minister for External Affairs. I do not propose to discuss whether the United Nations is any good, whether it should occupy this place or that in the heirachy or whether it should be first in our scale of values, or last. I think that it falls somewhere in between. The United Nations certainly does not come first in my scale of values. Mr Duthie interjecting,",94
480,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Duthie) should remain silent on this matter, which is outside the ambit of his normal activities. Australia comes first in my scale of values, and the British Empire next. I agree with the honourable member for Barker (Mr . Archie Cameron) that the English-speaking peoples should come third, and the United Nations may come fourth. I do not know what place that body occupies in the scale of values of t.he honourable member for Wilmot. The honourable member for Warringah to (Mr Spender) raised a very material of matter when he moved an amendment the that the proposed vote of the Department is. of External Affairs should be reduced by noL, £1. The honourable member took that a action in order to draw the attention of the committee to a question that he asked on the 28th September, to which the the Minister for External Affairs supplied a true, written answer a few days ago. The. or honourable member has already discussed 1 the matter at some length, and I do not I shall propose now to do more than to draw the attention of honourable members to the the answer supplied by the Minister. His answer was profoundly unsatisfactory, more so because the question related to a matter of such importance. Surely it was a serious matter if a high consular omciai in the course of his activities, used public funds without proper authorization. The honourable member for Warringah asked the MinisterHas the Minister for External Affairs given any direction that members of the Australian diplomatic or consular corps shall have the right to draw upon government funds as personal loans to themselves? The Minister ' s reply to that question was. . . no ministerial direction was given in relation to the advance, the matter being dealt with administratively between the department, the Treasury and of the oflicer concerned. . . . A p p are n t l y the Minister intended vey the impression that the officer concerned did not have a u t h o r it y to d r a w upon the f u n d s at his office. The next question the honourable member asked wasIs it known to the Treasury and to the secretary of the Department of External Affairs that a certain high consular official in New York who is now about to ' go elsewhere, arranged, between the 30th December, 1948, and the 11 th A p r i l, 1947, for advances to himself totalling 10,500 dollars without any authority from Australia to do so? The Minister replied. . . I have made inquiries and have ascertained that the officer referred to did obtain certain advances in 1947. The advance was made necessary aa a result of accommodation commitments. . . . There is not a single word in that reply to suggest that there was any authority whatever for the officer to obtain the funds. Was his action authorized ex post factol If so, why was not the Parliament informed of the fact? Eeading between the lines of constitute the evasive answer furnished by the Minister, I suspect that when some one had covered that the officer concerned had the money, the Government sought to hush the matter up hy approving retropermissible spectively of the officer's action. why was the Minister not frank with House concerning the circumstances the transaction? The honourable member also asked the following question:Is it a fact that, in order to have advances made to himself, the official to - I have referred issued certain instructions to the finance section of the Australian ConsulateGeneral in New York to make out vouchers payable to him, seven of which were in the amount of 1,000 dollars, one in the amount of 2,000 dollars and one in the amount of 1,500 dollars V Again, the Minister failed to deal with the question. In fact, he did not answer the question at all, and we have not been told whether the officer concerned did give instructions to his own finance section in New York to make advances to him. We ought to be told whether he did so or not. It is highly important to know whether a consular officer, whoever ho may he, issued instructions to his subordinates to advance money to him. It does not matter whether or not his irregular action was subsequently ratified. Even if such conduc to conwere approved ex post facto, we ought to be told how the officer concerned came to get the money. The honourable member also made the following inquiry:Is it also a fact that in March of this year « sum of 8,500 dollars in advances to this official was still outstanding? In reply to that question, the Minister stated that the amount involved was now only 4,000 dollars. Then he was asked whether the facts were known to the Department of External Affairs and to the Treasury. The Minister replied to the effect that they wero known - to Mr Dunk. There is a cloud of doubt even now around the Ministers or senior officials to whom details of the transaction were known. I am still not clear whether the Minister, the Secretary of the department, the Chairman of thp Public Service Board, or any one else, knew about it. The honourable member also askedDo those advances to a consular official funds? a permissible use of government disThat question has not been answered. got The Minister has not expressed any - view about whether the advances constituted a use of government funds. But Every honourable member of the comthe mittee must be driven to the conof clusion that the .transaction was not a permissible use of .public funds. Finally, the Minister was asked whether he was prepared to lay the - file those on the table of the House, hut he did whom not reply to that portion of the question. It is clear, tlierefore, that the answers supplied by the Minister to the honourable member covered only part of the questions' and that some aspects of the questions were not answered at all. In those circumstances, I submit that the honourable member for Warringah was amply justified in moving that the proposed vote of the department be reduced by & 1. Are the public accounts to be dipped into by people in the manner suggested by the circumstances of this Case? If , and when, such irregularities Occur, are .they to be approved of subsequently by the Government? Is it permissible for a consular official to do such a thing as has been suggested? If a consular official is entitled to do such <i thing, why should not any other officer of the Public Service be permitted to do likewise? In other words, is any official who finds himself short of money and who deems his allowances insufficient for his needs to be permitted to draw upon the public funds? Is a senior official to be permitted to instruct his subordinates to issue funds to him? I repeat that none of those questions have been replied to in the answer submitted by the Minister. The matter has heen left in a shady and unsatisfactory state and the committee would be quite justified in voting for the amendment in order to show its disapproval of the Government's attitude. I turn now to Australia's participation in the trusteeship agreement respect of New Guinea. A question was recently asked in the House about the matter, and a reply was furnished hy the Minister. To my mind that reply was quite unsatisfactory. I have already expressed my views on this matter in the House in the absence of the Minister, and I now propose to repeat, them while he is present, so that he may have an opportunity to reply to my criticism. I say that when the Minister, at various international conferences, including that which was held at Dumbarton Oaks in 1945, agreed to place New Guinea under trusteeship to the Tjnited Nations he betrayed the vital interests of Australia. I make that statement without any equivocation whatever. I remind the committee that when World Mr Beale. War II . occurred Australia was holding New Guinea under mandate, as distinct from Papua, which was a British Crown colony administered by Australia, and part of Australia's territory. New Guinea was held by Australia as a C class mandate from the league of Nations. At the peace conference of 1919, the Australian representatives, in common with the British representatives, desired that Australia should annex the territory as being strategically vital to it. That was opposed by President Wilson, who favoured a different arrangement altogether. He was entirely opposed to annexation. He had alongside him many advisors with great experience in his own State Department who did not share his views. One of them was Byers, the chief of his colonial department, who favoured annexation of New Guinea by Australia. He said that a country so close to Australia was vital to it and should be absorbed by it. However, the Wilson view was against annexation. A compromise was reached under which New Guinea and German South-West Africa became 0 class mandates. Those territories were to be administered as integral parts of the mandatory countries. There is ample evidence in the documents, most of which I have taken the trouble to read that it was understood by all concerned that ultimately the administration of those territories would lead to their absorption. That was the position from 1919 to 1939. It is true in that during that time we made reports to the League of Nations on our administration of New Guinea. Those reports did not receive the sort of reception that our reports have received since the the trusteeship arrangement of 1946. TJnder the mandate, it was clearly and widely understood that Australia's interest in New Guinea was vital and strategic, and our reports were accepted almost universally without criticism. The League of Nations folded up and died in 1939. When it died, the legal arrangement, if one may so describe it, under which we held the mandate for the administration of New Guinea died with it. Another factor emerged in 1942 when Japan invaded New Guinea. We had to fight for our life in New Guinea. Australian lives were lost there to defend it. The view held in 1919 by Mr W. M . Hughes, the Australian delegate, and by the British delegates was that New Guinea was essential to our safety, and this was amply demonstrated in 1942 when Australia was nearly overwhelmed. We had to fight for New Guinea. The blood of Australian manhood was shed there. A new situation altogether arose with the death of the League of Nations. At that moment, we ceased to be under any legal or moral obligation to regard New Guinea as a country to be held under any form of mandate or trusteeship. We had been administering it for the benefit of the natives as we had administered Papua for the benefit of the natives. Our administration of Papua was a model to the world. Every one knows of the wonderful work done by Sir Hubert Murray and others in Papua. We did the same thing in New Guinea proper. There was no reason to suppose that we should not go on doing it. So no argument can be based on the fact that we had an obligation to the natives. We observed that obligation. We did an extremely good job, and, when the war came, and the League of Nations collapsed and died, we were entitled to regard New Guinea as our country and to take possession of it and fortify it and exclude all other people on the ground of its being essential to our safety to the end of That is what the Prime Minister of our sister dominion South Africa did about German South-West Africa. South Africa held a similar mandate over German South-West Africa, and when the time came, the then Prime Minister of South Africa, Field-Marshal Smuts, declined, in one form of words or another, to accept the position that South-West Africa automatically came under the trusteeship of the Tjnited Nations. There has been argument ever since, but .the position has never been yielded. South Africa regards South-West Africa as strategically necessary to it. We have a much stronger case for the retenetion of possession of New Guinea, because of its geographical situation in relation to that of Australia. The learned Minister for External Affairs tries to justify the dumping of New Guinea into the lap of the United Nations. I quote the words that he used in 1946, when he saidThe future of native races 13 the subject of legitimate international interest. But what about Papua? On that ground, why did he not take Papua along, too, and dump it into the lap of the United Nations for trusteeship? What about all the British Crown colonies? What about all our own aborigines if the future of native races is a proper subject of international interest ? Why does he not dump Australia itself into the lap of the United Nations for trusteeship? Let us see what really did happen between the Dumbarton Oaks conference and the United Nations conference in 1946, because the Minister for External Affairs has not been frank with honourable members. He suggested that the British Government had acquiesced in the arrangements, but that is not so, for it was presented by him with a fait accompli. After objections had heen made, the original proposal was modified. The draft treaty prepared for the Dumbarton Oaks conference left a blank space under the headings indicating international mandates or trusteeships. That space was never filled, for the reason, as I interjected during the Minister's speech, that the Americans "" jacked up "". They were not going to have this proposal, which was apparently inspired by the Minister, and time. some people associated with him, by which all native races and their countries came under trusteeship. As the result, the Carolines, the Marshalls and Ladrones came under strategic trusteeship. The Americans said that they would take them over under that arrangement. That was done. To put the casr; at its lowest level that could have been done about New Guinea. Then we could not only have fortified New Guinea but could also have excluded other people from it, whereas under the trusteeship we cannot exclude other people as all honourable members well know. However, the ideas of the American State Department did lean towards an increased international control over colonies, including, by the way, British colonies. The Americans did not have many colonies, so some members of the State Department thought it would be a good idea to have increased international control over colonies. The State Department's views were not accepted by the American service departments, on the ground of American security. Those departments insisted that either the United States should annex the former Japanese mandated territories of the Carolines, the Marshalls and the Ladrones or at least that they should be available as "" floating aircraft carriers "". The service departments held that at t.he very least American control of those islands should take the form of a strategic trusteeship, and that was what ultimately happened. remind the committee that in the meantime a .treaty was concluded by Australia and New Zealand which referred to trusteeships in the Pacific. As the result of that treaty a declaration was issued early in 1945 by the Australian Minister for External Affairs and the New Zealand Prime Minister, the effect of which was to give approval to the trusteeship principle with international supervision by countries that were members of the Trusteeship Council. I also remind the committee that that declaration was intended to cover the British colonial mandates as well as the Australian and New Zealand mandates. To say the least it did not obtain the approval of the British Government. Shortly after that a conference of the Prime Ministers of the British Commonwealth was held. Mr Edmonds interjecting,",94
481,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I know that some honourable members do not consider this matter to be very important, and the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Edmonds) may be one of them. I should like to tell the honourable member for Herbert that it is of supreme importance to us on this side of the committee that the people of Australia should learn the history of this matter and discover how they have been betrayed and how our vital interests have been subordinated to other considerations. We have never been told the full story in the Parliament before. We have had to fossick it out for ourselves. Now we have heen told that the British Government has agreed to this, that and the other, but that is not true. The original pron? al for a ireneral colonial trusteeship a was not adopted by the British Government. Yet step by step the territory of New Guinea was brought into a position where is was handed over to the Tjnited Nations and we are now obliged to make reports each year to the United Nations on our administration. We have been obliged to submit ourselves to the humiliation of being criticized, on one occasion by the Chinese, on another occasion by the Patagonians or somebody and on still another occasion by some other nation, in respect of our administration of that territory which is so essential to our security. I Mr BLAIN - We were also criticized by Russia.",98
482,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Russia , of course, has criticized us on every possible occasion, and every honourable member must know that under Article 76 of the United Nations Charter, pursuant to which we hold this territory in trust, any member nation of the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations is entitled to send its representatives to examine the territory of New Guinea including its defences, if it so chooses. We are no longer masters in our own house. I believe that we should have taken the territory over and made it ours when we could have done so in 1939, just as the present right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) wanted to do in 1919 when he was Prime Minister. We should certainly have taken it over in 1939 or 1940 when we had the legal and moral opportunity to do so after the League of Nations had collapsed and we had to defend it by force of our own arms. Our plain duty then was not to hand it over to the United Nations but to make it our own territory. One person to whom I mentioned my view on this particular matter said, "" But that is an annexation! "" I describe it only a., claiming a country that is geographically, strategically and on every other basis, essential to Australia. Anyhow at the very least we should have followed thf American lead, because the arrangement that the United States made in relation to the former Japanese mandates let it open for other members of the United Nations to adopt the same policy. In stead, however, we adopted this incredibly unwise proposal to hand - over New Guinea holus-bolus to the United Nations, and we have been biting our nails and ruing it ever since. We should have made it our own country because that was at least one direct way of advancing the security of Australia.",98
483,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Barton-Attorney General and Minister for External Affairs) [11.14] - The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale), has referred to New Guinea. In many respects he has been completely inaccurate. He has been most dogmatic ahout this matter. First of all he stated that by accepting trusteeship over the former Mandated Territory of New Guinea we had betrayed the interests of Australia.",99
484,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Hear , hear!",99
485,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable gentleman says, "" Hear, hear! "" The facts do not matter to him. He will not study the debates. One honourable member opposite, I think it was the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender), has suggested that no matter was brought before the Parliament in connection with New Guinea. That is completely untrue. Every stage of the proceedings before finality was reached, was brought before the House.",99
486,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Year s afterwards.,99
487,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,How many years afterwards .,99
488,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Tw o years. We debated it in the Minister's absence a few months ago.,99
489,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member states that it was debated a few months ago during my absence. I take it that that would be in 1949, when the Papua and New Guinea Bill was introduced. I do not desire to take up unnecessary time over this matter, but I consider that the inaccuracies of the honourable member for Parramatta should be placed on record. In rebuttal of those inaccuracies I refer the committee to the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Ohifley) on New Guinea trusteeship to this House on the 7th August, 1946, long before the arrangements for the trusteeship were made. The facts in relation to the San Francisco conference at which the United Nations Charter was drawn up, are quite clear. I stated them earlier to the committee, but was contradicted quite wrongly by one honourable member. I said that the trusteeship system agreed upon at San ""Francisco was worked out in detail by the representatives, not only of Australia, but also of the United States of America and the United Kingdom. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture  as one of the Australian delegates, and so did the honourable member for. Indi (Mr MCEwen), but he has apparently forgotten a]l about it.  for Indi was absent from the deliberations most of the time.",99
490,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I should not say that, but apparently he has forgotten what happened at that conference. I said, by way of interjection during the speech of the honourable member for Indi, that Mr. Harold Stassen, a leader of the Republican party in America and an American delegate to the San Francisco conference, was in charge of the committee which dealt with trusteeship. His suggestions were the basis on which the agreement was finally worked out.",99
491,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,It was on the suggestion of Mr Stettinius and of the American service departments.,99
492,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am speaking of the United States representative at the San Francisco conference. Now we have another interjection by the honourable member for Parramatta to the effect that Mr Stettinius was one of the delegates at San Francisco and was actually responsible for the form of the trusteeship agreement. I cannot believe that the honourable member has even the sightest hasis for such an assertion. These things are part of the work that was going on then. The honourable member for Parramatta has referred to Dumbarton Oaks. Australia was not represented at Dumbarton Oaks. The honourable member has referred to it six times as though we were represented there, but that was simply a conference of great powers. It was a conference at Washington of representatives of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Russia and China simply for the purpose of preparing a draft for San Francisco. It acted as n drafting committee. The Dumbarton Oaks proposals were submitted to a conference of 50 nations at San Francisco. Trusteeship was of great importance. What was to happen about the mandated territories? The honourable member, dogmatizing as he so often does on difficult questions of international law, said that the mandate system had come to an end. That was the question. Had it come to an end?",99
493,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Of course it had.,100
494,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"There is not the slightest foundation for saying that the outbreak of war brought that system to an end. Such a doctrine was never accepted by any international lawyer. At any rate, it was a matter of debate. What had to be done in connection with these mandates? The matter was taken up at San Francisco. I am not dealing with the Dumbarton Oaks proposal now. I repeat, and the records of the San Francisco conference establish beyond doubt, that the main paper, the working paper of the trusteeship committee, was Stassen's paper presented on behalf of the United States delegation. That was a broad outline of the trusteeship system as it applies to New Guinea today. Mr. Strassen was the leader of the committee. As the proposals were put forward, he would speak as the leader of the house. The United States was active in support of the trusteeship system, and the United Kingdom delegate played an almost equally prominent part in the elaboration of it. It is perfectly true, as the honor1946. able member for Parramatta says, that Australia and New Zealand favoured the system. But then we had not just a few countries imposing a trusteeship system. We had the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Australia and New Zealand in favour of it. The working paper was, in substance, adopted with some modification.",100
495,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Is it not a fact that the United States did not put its own territories under the same trusteeship?,100
496,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The United States did not at that time have any territories under mandate..,100
497,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,It had the Japanese mandate in the Marshalls and the Carolines.,100
498,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"That is a different thing altogether. If honourable members will follow the situation carefully, the position is that the United States was not possessed of any mandated territory prior to the occasion of which we are speaking. The countries that were directly concerned were countries like Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Now I come to the statement that was made in this chamber, because a full report was brought back and presented to the Parliament and debated here, I suppose four or five times before 1949. The House never divided on the issue. The Opposition accepted the principle. The present objection is merely something that has been thought of years later, I presume by the honourable member for Parramatta. Those are the facts. The Prime Minister made a statement to the House on the 7th August, 1946 which is reported on page 3853 of volume 188 of Hansard. The right honourable gentleman saidOn the 17th JanuaTy, 1940, The conference had been held in 1945the Australian Government declared its intention of placing the Territory of New Guinea under the international trusteeship system established by the United Nations. Similar declarations were made by the governments of the United Kingdom and New Zealand concerning their mandated territories in Africa and Western Samoa respectively.",100
499,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,On what date was that statement made?,100
500,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"On the 7th August,",100
501,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I entered this Parliament in November, 1946, and I took the first opportunity that was available to me after that to debate this matter.",100
502,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE, Order ! The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) has been persistently interjecting. That must cease. It does not contribute to orderly debate and does not help the statement of the case by the Attorney-General.,100
503,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The Prime Minister, in pointing that out, then explained the system which applies now, although it had not been adopted at that time by the United Nations. It was a declaration of intention, to put the territory under trusteeship. New Guinea had not been accepted as a trust territory, and therefore there was time to withdraw. It was merely a statement of intention. The Prime Minister saidThere are two fundamental considerations on which the Government bases its attitude in the negotiation of the trusteeship agreement, namely, the fact that Australia will have complete and exclusive power in controlling administration of New Guinea and that the only limitation upon this control is the obligation to carry out the duties imposed by the Charter. The Commonwealth of Australia, as the administering authority, must have full powers of legislation, administration and jurisdiction over the territory. This was the position under the mandate, and the Government is resolved that it must continue. The Territory of New Guinea, in which so many of our men died in battle against the Japanese, is of such importance to the safety of this country that nothing but'absolute control could be accepted by any Australian government. Moreover, the welfare of the native peoples demands such control. Then he quoted a statement that I had made on the 13th March, 1946, saying that I had made the point very clear when I declared thatIn order to be acceptable to Australia the new agreement must, like the present mandate, designate the Government of Australia as the exclusive administering authority in the ter.ritory. I shall not read the rest of that passage because it is substantially the same as the statement by the Prime Minister that I have quoted so far. The Prime Minister then continued- Furthermore, under the provisions of the United Nations ,Charter, to which this country is a signatoryThis is a very important point, because honourable members can see from this how the trusteeship system, from a defence point of view, represented an enormous advance upon the position under the mandate system. . . the administration may make use of volunteer forces, facilities and assistance the territory in providing for the defence of New Guinea. We could not do this under the old C mandate terms. The Government, moreover, intends to go farther and to ensure that itB complete administrative authority will be utilized to the full in providing, where necessary, for naval, military and air bases in New Guinea and for the erection of fortifications. In substance that was forbidden under the mandate. Therefore, .the trusteeship system provided for an enormous extension from the point of view of the defence of that important territory.",100
504,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Are those bases and fortifications subject to inspection by any foreign power ?,101
505,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"That is a different thing altogether. Inspections to ensure that the the terms of the mandate providing for the welfare of the inhabitants are being observed may be conducted from time to time by the Trusteeship Council. The Prime Minister's statement continuedNo agreement would be considered by UB which restricted in any way our right to provide for the defence of New Guinea and consequently for the safety of Australia. I must emphasize that such comprehensive defence measures were not possible under the old mandate. By bringing the mandated territory under the trusteeship system we are permitted to plan and carry out measures directly relevant to the security of Australia itself. Therefore, the arrangement did not contemplate any weakening of Australia's defences. It was the mandatory terms which limited defence in New Guinea. The mandate prevented the erection of fortifications in the territory and granted a very limited right of defence. However, under the trusteeship system, Australia is entitled to defend the integrity of New Guinea to the same extent as though it were Australia itself. Therefore, the assertion of the honourable member for Parramatta is completely erroneous. He has been misled by some statement. Erom the defence and security point of view, the trusteeship system gives Australia ample protection and ample security. The other question referred to was the welfare of the native peoples. Protection of the natives' rights was binding under the old mandate system. It is also binding under this system. The only other matter that I want to mention is the speech that was made by the honourable member for Indi, who, I from agree with the honourable member for Perth (Mr Burke), made a contribution to the debate on a level worthy of a proper statement on foreign affairs. The honourable member was critical of one or two aspects of policy. I think that I can answer him very shortly. In my statement to-night I did not attempt to traverse the whole field of international affairs. I merely followed np some observations that had been made by the honourable member for Elinders' (Mr. Eyan) with regard to our policy in regard to certain countries in which we have established embassies and legations. The United Nations had to be discussed because one of the largest of the proposed votes covers our contribution to the United Nations. I did not pretend to deal with our relationship with every other country. The honourable member for Indi has referred to our relationship with the British Commonwealth. I entirely agree with his remarks. Our relationship with the British Commonwealth goes hand in hand with our friendship for the United States of America and our unwavering support of the United Nations. There is no question of priority; these things dovetail together because it is the policy of the Tjnited States of America to support the United Nations and also the British Commonwealth. The honourable member for Parramatta asked which we place first, second or third. I remind him that there may he occasions when a choice has to be made, especially in relation to questions involving peace or war. As the honourable member for ""Warringah has freely admitted, our relationship with the British Commonwealth is very intimate. Honourable members opposite will see the danger of arguments which tend to draw a distinction between the British Government ancl the British people. Britain remains the same to Australians whether Britain be governed by a Conservative or a Labour Government. Our relations with the present Government of the United Kingdom, intimate as they are, are the same as were our relations with the coalition government led by Mr. Churchill. These things go hand in hand. They are not contradictory. agree with the honourable member for Indi that we cannot rely on the United Nations and forget everything else. It is not fair for honourable members opposite to say that I am not carrying out my duties to Australia. I do not think that honourable members opposite really believe that I have not carried out a policy which is in the best interests of Australia. The honourable member for Indi made the astonishing suggestion that if an Australian Minister for External Affairs is ever again elected as President of the Dr Evatt. General Assembly of the United Nations he should immediately resign his portfolio. I point out that if he did so, he would no longer lead the Australian delegation. The President of the General Assembly is always selected from the leaders of the delegations from the different countries. As everybody knows, the first President was the Belgium Foreign Minister, M. Spaak. ""When I was at Lake Success I had the benefit of the advice of the Australian ambassador to the United States of America, Mr. Makin, and of the other Australian delegates. During my term of office as President of the General Assembly they did not cease to put the Australian case, in regard to Nauru and New Guinea; indeed they fought very hard for it. It is not criticism that hurts the Australian case in relation to New Guinea. The mere fact that the representatives of a few great or minor nations criticize Australia does not hurt us. The General Assembly is a place where there is criticism of one country after another. The fact that we have criticism of the Government in this Parliament does not constitute an argument against the parliamentary system of government. On the contrary, it is an argument in favour of the continuation of that system of government. Let alleged defects be pointed out. If they are proved to be true, they will be corrected. In all our activities in the United Nations we fulfil our duty to the Australian people and to this Parliament. There is no conflict between our obligations to the United Nations and our duty to safeguard the defence of Australia. I was amazed to hear the honourable member for Parramatta speak of the betrayal of Australia. Not one honourable member who was in this Parliament I during the war against Japan can accuse this Government of ever having betrayed this country. ""We took care that the trusteeship agreement would leave us completely free to administer New Guinea as we thought fit.",101
506,Mr BEALE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"If that be so, why was there a trusteeship agreement at all?",102
507,Mr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The majority of the nations, including Great Britain, Canada and New Zealand, decided that we would keep up the spirit of the mandate system. Had we said after the war, which, among other things, was supposed to have fought for the improvement of the of dependent peoples, ""We shall not bound by the restrictions of the mandate any longer; we believe in simple accession of our mandated territories"", we would have dealt a blow to international coby operation. The mandate system did not hurt us except that it prevented us establishing defences in mandated terricomparison tories. TJnder the trusteeship system are free to establish defences in terriLeague tories under our trusteeship. broadly, answers the. criticisms that have been made by honourable members opposite in regard to this important matter.",102
508,Mr HARRISON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Wentworth) [11.32]. Territory of New Guinea. - I was interested to hear what the ister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) had to say on the third occasion on which he has spoken on thi9 subject today. The right honourable gentleman "" prodate testeth .too much, methinks "". Some of his statements will hear Very close vestigation. In that idealistic way which he has, he spoke without knowledge cognizance of the hard practical facts that face this country. We have already experienced the effects of his idealistic compromise with regard to mandates. Before I . give that subject its proper colouring, let me have something to 6ay with regard to the Tjnited Nations. I take the same attitude towards the Tjnited Nations as I took to the League of Nations. I believe that the League of Nations had not been brought into existence after World War I . the nations would have had to establay lish some other similar body. I believe that some organization such as the Tjnited Nations is necessary to preserve our hope for the future. Every honourable member on this side of the chamber I am sure, subscribe to that view. I abandon our ideals and the hope achieving something better than a world mandate. constantly ravaged by warfare, the outlook for the future will he black indeed. The Minister for External Affairs is pared to sacrifice Australia on the altar of the Tjnited Nations in order to attempt to achieve within the short space of decade an objective that will take centuries to achieve. He does not hesitate .to sacrifice his country on that altar he feels that by so doing he can contribute been something, towards the achievement status of the objective of the Tjnited be Nations. Let me develop that argument because I believe that I should do so. The right honourable gentleman has said that we have gained something placing New Guinea under the trusteeship of the Tjnited Nations. I agree with from him that we have done so on paper by with what we formerly had we under the old "" C "" mandate of the of Nations. As a former MinisThat, ter for External Territories for a brief period, 1 know something of the difficulties that confronted Australia on the eve of the war as the result of its inability to fortify the Mandated We Minwere well aware that Japan had defied the League of Nations and had fortified its mandated territories as best it could. Although it deliberately violated its manthe League of Nations was absolutely powerless to force its will upon inso great a belligerent nation. But Australia, which was prepared to honour its or obligations, was made the scapegoat on that occasion because of our own foolishness. What led up to that position? It is perfectly true that if we had not accepted the mandate in respect of New Guinea, those who failed to appreciate the significance of that territory because of its proximity to Australia might very well have left it wide open to Japanese migration. That mandate gave certain if powers to Australia, but denied us the right, even though we were administering that territory, to fortify it, and therein the great weakness of that mandate. Unfortunately, we have not yet learned to the full, even by the expenditure of Australian blood, just what it may mean to take full control of an outpost for our will, protection against aggression in the f we future. We failed to obtain the necesof sary safeguards under the old "" C "" It is true that today we have, on prepaper, the right to fortify that territory, to establish naval and air bases there and to send troops into New Guinea, but, side a by side with that provision, it is equally us true that members of the Trusteeship Council, even those who may be if opposed to us in political ideology and ideals, or even opposed to us physically, or who may wish to witness our destruction, have the right to go to New Guinea, and examine the territory and the circumstances associated with our mandate. In view of modern methods of espionage, can we not realise that a nation that has that right as a member of the Trusteeship Council could easily find ways and means of obtaining the information it might require with respect to the defences of that territory? Of course, we have, on paper, the right to do the things that I mentioned, but from a practical point of view, the trusteeship is a very weak thing and something that we should not rely upon. The United States of America was fully concerned with that aspect. That country would not agree to place the Carolines, the Marshalls or the Ladrones under a trusteeship similar to the one we now hold in respect of New Guinea. The United States of America insisted upon being granted a strategic trusteeship in relation to the islands I have mentioned, and under that class of trusteeship the representatives of any nation that it does not wish to admit to those territories can be refused admission to them. In that respect the United States of. America has adopted a. realistic attitude. It has not been prepared to sacrifice its interests on the altar of the United Nations organization. But the Minister for External Affairs is prepared to sacrifice Australia's interests in that way. He did a great disservice to this country when he did not insist that Australia should be given a strategio trusteeship in respect of New Guinea. I believe that the ideal of the United Nations is something that will be realized ultimately, but not immediately or even within a few decades. I believe that many world cataclysms will occur before that ideal can be attained. It must be worked for step by step. I am aware of the attitude of the Minister on this matter. His attitude has some virtue in that he is aiming to attain that ideal, I do not wish to discredit him on that score. He has the right ideal, but in striving to attain it he has no right to sacrifice the interests of his own country or those of the people of any other country. In his approach to problems affecting Greece and other members of the Mr Harrison. United Nations, he has sought to interfere on the basis that the interests of the nations concerned must be sacrificed on the altar of the United Nations. This is not an age when he can in that way demand sacrifices for ideals; this is not an age when he as Minister for External Affairs can afford to sacrifice Australia's interests for that ideal. He must take the realistic view, as Eussia, the United States of America and each of the countries that can exercise the veto in the United Nations have done, namely, that they must first protect the interests of their own countries and then do all in their power towards the attainment of the ideal of the United Nations. However, in the immediate future, we must at all costs protect the security of this nation. Although the Minister can be commended for his idealistic approach to this matter he must realise that he must first do for his own country what other countries will first do in their own interests, and that is to ensure the protection and preservation of the Australian people, whom he claims to represent.",103
509,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Balaclava) [11.42] The committee is discussing the estimates in respect of the Department of .External Affairs. The honourable member for Watson (Mr Falstein) said that no honourable member criticized the proposed vote. He worked out the cost to his own satisfaction and calculated that it amounted to only a few shillings per capita of the population. I say definitely that both the proposed expenditure and the policy of the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) are being discussed. Within the last half-hour the debate has centred on the Minister's action in allowing the New Guinea mandate to go to the Trusteeship Council. We know the reasons and the ideals that guided him in that matter. But he has let Australia down. Had Australia adopted a similar attitude in the League of Nations in 1919 and towards the administration of the New Guinea mandate, we should not have been able to make of New Guinea a bastion against the Japanese in World War II . with the result that the Japanese would quickly have advanced to the Australian mainland. The Minister, apparently, was persuaded by therepresentatives of other nations that the present trusteeship was a good thing and should be accepted. is natural that influences of that kind should be exerted in the councils of the nations, upon the representatives of individual nations; but he must remember his own loyalties first. Iri spite of his ability he has forgotten that his first loyalty is to Australia, his second loyalty is to the British Empire and his third loyalty is to the nations of the world as a whole. Let us work gradually towards the attainment of the last-named ideal but, at the same time, do not let us sacrifice our own vital interests. The Tjnited States of America may have supported the idea that the New Guinea mandate should go to the Trusteeship Council, but that country did not follow that course when it sought to protect the Marshalls, Carolines and other islands which it captured from the Japanese. In its own case, the Tjnited States of America insisted upon being granted a strategic trusteeship under which it has the right to prevent inspections of the territories concerned from being made by any other nation. We know that Bussia has refused to agree to any plan for the inspection of resources for the production of the atomic bomb. Russia advocates the complete abolition of the atomic bomb; but it will not agree to any system of inspection. Yet we have agreed to a proposal that the Russians themselves have refused to accept. Our defences in New - Guinea will be open to inspection by the representatives of othsr nations, including Russia, which has shown an extraordinary interest in the administration of our trusteeships. At meetings of the United Nations at Lake Success, the Russian representatives have criticized our administration. The Minister for External Territories (Mr Ward) rules the rich and fertile territory of New - Guinea in a manner that is more in keeping with that of a tyrannical colonial governor or dictator than anything else one can imagine. He has been obliged to send his departmental officers post-haste to Lake Success to answer some of the questions that the Russians and others have asked about our administration of the trusteeships. Although we have the privilege of defending that territory, our defences are open to inspection by the representatives of other countries. InciIt dentally, I should also like to be given some information about the kind of defence works that have been undertaken in our territories. But we should not allow this "" snooping "" by Russia. The position is bad enough when Australian Communists sabotage our defence programme, but it is worse when the representatives of the power that threatens to uncivilize the world with its barbarous creed is able to inspect our defences. I regard that position as infamous, and the Minister for External Affairs must take the responsibility for it. Whatever his minions may have said, he advised the adoption of that policy. If , unhappily, war should occur, he alone will be responsible for the lack of secrecy in relation to cur defences in the trusteeship territories. I make that statement now because honourable members opposite frequently refer to Australia's unpreparedness for war in 1939. I recall that the Minister for External Territories expressed the opinion in that year that those people who considered that New Guinea should be defended should go there and defend it themselves. I point out that Australia had more squadrons in the field in 1941 than the Royal Australian Air Force possesses today.",104
510,Mr DBAKEFOBD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Nonsense !,105
511,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,It is the truth. Why does not the Minister for Air (Mr. Drakeford) answer the question in my name that has been on the notice-paper for so long?,105
512,Mr DBAKEFOBD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"When I do so, the honourable member will go to sleep forever.",105
513,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Does the Minister deny the truth of my statement ?,105
514,Mr DBAKEFOBD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The statement was ridiculous.,105
515,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Does the Minister say that Australia has as many operational squardons today as it had in 1941 ?,105
516,Mr DBAKEFOBD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,We are better prepared today than we ever were in the past.,105
517,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE," Order ! I ask the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) to ignore interjections, and to relate his remarks to the proposed vote for the Department of External Affairs.",105
518,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I shall do so. If , happily, Australia is again plunged into war, the guilty men will he the members of this Government, and the most guilty man will he the Minister for External Affairs, who has allowed Australia's front line of defence to he open to inspection by the representatives of other nations, including those of a potential enemy. This is the last occasion before the general election that honourable members will have an opportunity to discuss the estimates for the Department of External Affairs. Perhaps the Minister for External Affairs feels that some of the criticisms that have been voiced in this debate have been rather sharp and even barbed, but he must be able to "" take it "". He 'has been away in other fields, where he has received, very properly, a good deal of laudation and praise for the work that he has done in that sphere, but we are entitled to disagree strongly with his policy, and I definitely believe that the right honourable gentleman has made a colossal mistake. The Territory of New Guinea is in close proximity to a continent where one-half of the people of the world live. Expressed in another way, New Guinea is only two days' flight from 1,000,000,000 people, or one-half of the number of people on the face of the globe. Australia is an outpost for the white race, almost adjacent to the teeming millions of Asia, and yet the Minister for External Affairs, who is chasing an international ideal, throws away a valuable and realistic defence outpost. That is a cardinal error. In my opinion, the Department of External Affairs is due for re-organizahave tion. The right honourable gentleman has dotted embassies, legations and sulates throughout the world like so many post offices. That policy deceives no Does the right honourable gentleman believe that the establishment of those embassies, legations and consulates gives Australia enhanced status among leading nations of the world? In the past, United Kingdom provided those services for us, without expense. I note that Australia has legations in Brazil and in Chile, and that the estimated expenditure on those establishments this year exceeds the vote last year. I calculate that the un- expenditure on those two legations this year will amount to 42,000 dollars. Earlier, the Minister for External Affairs stated that the payment for one of those two legations was made in sterling. How was that possible? I agree that 42,000 dollars is not a large sum, but I contend that the expenditure on those two legations is unnecessary. We buy scarcely a bag of nuts from Brazil, and our contacts with that nation are remote indeed. However, the establishment of a legation in that country may be helping to enhance the prestige of the Minister for External Affairs. I do not desire to attribute dubious motives to him, hut he has most expensive ideas in the international sphere. What justification is there for having legations in Brazil and Chile? They should have been abolished long ago. In respect of the legation in Brazil provision is .made for a Minister, a first secretary and a third secretary. Australia is incurring that expenditure at a time when it is desperately short of dollars. If the Commonwealth could increase its petrol imports by 10 per cent.. the necessity for rationing would he averted. I realise that I am not in order in discussing petrol rationing when the committee is considering the Estimates for the Department of External Affairs, but the Government should seize every opportunity to reduce the expenditure of dollars.",106
519,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Order ! I ask the honourable member not to refer to petrol rationing at this stage.,106
520,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Because of the shortage of dollars,' the primary producer, the businessman and industry generally will to submit to a severe form of petrol rationing, and I am pointing out that, conin my opinion, Australia could save dollars by abolishing unnecessary legaone. tion in South America. Unfortunately, the Minister is able to go gaily on his way. If , unhappily for Australia, the Labour party is returned to office at the forthcoming general election and the the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr. Beazley) is defeated, the right honourable gentleman may find a position for him in a legation in Patagonia or Kamschatka, with a staff consisting of a first secretary and a .third secretary, provided the legation is similar to our legations in Chile and Brazil. Perhaps the Minister will be able to arrange for the honourable member to have a second secretary as well. Among the politically slain at the last election was the Minister for Bepatriation, Mr Frost, who was appointed to the office of Trade Commissioner in Ceylon. Probably that gentleman had not previously seen Ceylon on the map. The former member for Calare, Mr. Breen, was whisked off to the Middle East, but he returned to Australia shortly afterwards and became secretary to the Minister . for External Territories. The former Minister for the Army, Mr Forde, was appointed High Commissioner to Canada, a highly lucrative post. The former Minister for the Navy, Mr Makin. was appointed Australian Minister to Washington. That is one method of providing full employment in the political service. But why should the Australian taxpayers have to foot the bill? The Minister for External Affairs, who has this retinue, does not bear the cost. The unfortunate taxpayer meets the expenses, although taxes have been increased by 550 per cent, since 1939 and the national income has not risen proportionately. Previous utterances by the Minister for External Territories show that he has not the interests of our trusteeships at heart. An extract from one of his speeches reads as follows:Having no clear evidence to the contrary and having during the last four years to know some of Russia's greatest statesmen, I take the view that the Soviet Union's policy is directed towards self-protection and security against future attack. In my opinion, desire is to develop its own economy and to improve the welfare of its people. Since that time, Czechoslovakia has come under the domination of Soviet Russia. That great republic, with an industrial population, is now under the heel Soviet tyranny and imperialism. Poland has been destroyed, and Greece is just holding out, as a nation, with the greatest difficulty. Has the Minister ever told us about the plight of the Greeks? honourable members know that since the end of the war the Greeks have had 80,000 casualties in a civil war that been promoted by the satellites of Russia ? Even if the Minister has said a word about that matter, he has not told us where his sympathies lie. Does he know that the Turkish army has been mobilized in the Caucasus since 1941, and that a Russian army is facing it across a noman's land? The Minister for External Territories jeers at that statement. When he speaks, he will probably praise Russia, from which he has drawn his inspiration ever since he has been a member of this Parliament. I note a strange change of front among honourable members opposite. They boast that they have a great friendship for Great Britain.",106
521,Mr WARD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Kee p it clean.,107
522,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I thought that I was doing so. If the Minister is not familiar with any of the subjects that I have been discussing, he may like me to refer to Bulolo and certain timber leases. The Australian Government now professes to be a great friend to Great Britain. That is a new love. The explanation is that a prominent member of the United Kingdom Government is Mr Aneurin Bevan, who attacked Mr Winston Churchill bitterly throughout the war.",107
523,Mr WARD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Mr Bevan is a great man.,107
524,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Yes , he is a great man who, like the Minister, is in line with Russia. Because both he and Sir Stafford Cripps have become obsessed hy international ideas to the detriment of their own heritance they are bringing ruin upon us. If the Minister for External Affairs believes that he is in the category come of Palmerston, Castlereagh, or Joseph Chamberlain in relation to this matter, let him take a leaf out of their book. The its Minister knows his history. Does he intend to abandon all that he ever learned ? Toes he not know that there is a practical League of Nations, at the head of which stands Great Britain, the country that fought the battle of Britain nine of years ago, and is now in its tenth year of austerity and fighting a second great battle, the economic battle of Great Britain? Does he not realise that if he were to devote some of his great energy Do towards greater co-operation between Australia and the other nations in the British Commonwealth of Nations, Great has Britain would be lifted out of some of the difficulties that it is facing today? I ask these questions hecause of the ability of the Minister and irrespective of - what we think about his policy. Had there been Empire parliamentary conferences at which he and the leading men of Canada, New Zealand, and other countries got together to consider the economic difficulties associated with defence, ping, and finance, we should be in a better position today. Honourable members know that devaluation is only an emergency measure, a break as it were, which gives us breathing time. Of course, it may have been necessary. Trade within the Empire group should instead have been fostered and improved. Instead of the Minister devoting himself to international issues of a kind alien to our own peoples, and which were outmoded and unsuccessful, he should have applied himself to the subjects that I have mentioned. playing the game in accordance with an admission that he made about a Russian statesman, he is bringing about the chaos that must come the way of any democracy that adopts that line. deplore that the Minister has not seen fit to establish a foreign affairs committee in the Parliament as proposed by me in 1943. The Senate Committee in the Parliament of the United States of America has done great good for that country. If our foreign policy had been framed in accordance with a cross-section of the opinion of the people, and a foreign affairs committes composed of members of the various parties of both Houses of the Parliament had been established, it would have been continuous. That was done in Great Britain. Mr Bevin, who succeeded Mr Anthony Eden as Secretary for Foreign Affairs, carried out the traditional British policy. He is opposed to the Russians. He does not support Gromyko and Vishinsky and yet a representative of the Australian Minister at of the conferences stated that the Dutch action in the Netherlands East Indies was worse than Hitler's invasion of Holland. That was an infamous thing to say. Honourable members kuow who said it. I do not want to mention his name, because he must have had the authority of his Minister to say that. The Minister does not deny that his representative Mr White. said anything of that kind. If , instead of wandering around the world and sitting in conferences at what should be called Lake Non-Success, while never going to Israel, Java, or Greece, where the real trouble is, to study conditions on the spot, he had tried to elucidate the problem of the Netherlands East Indies, possibly we shipwould not now be so unpopular with the Dutch. I point out that the Dutch colonized those islands 200 years before our ancestors came to Australia and have been our loyal allies. Yet with the approval of the Government, the policy of the waterside workers in this country is in keeping with Communist policy. That is a terrible state of affairs, because before the war we were doing a trade of millions of pounds yearly both ways with the Netherlands East Indies. Yet, today, because a CommuBy nist leader in a trade union becomes a dictator and says that there should be no trade between here and those islands, the Min'ister abdicates and Mr Healy bpcomes the de facto Minister for External I Affairs. This lamentable state of affairs has gone on for years! It remains for this man, who recently served a term of imprisonment for contempt of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, to say when that trade will again operate. Of course, some trading is going on. For instance, petrol, such an inflammable political subject, is coming through. Many people appreciate the assiduity of the Minister, and concede that he must enjoy very good physical health in order to be able to attend so many conferences and go from forum to forum and from banquet to banquet. However, he could have done greater good for his country had he treated the New Guinea issue as did the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) in 1919. Had he one so devoted his knowledge instead of pursuing wider international ideas some good would have resulted. Thursday, 6 Octoier, 194-9.",107
525,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Richmond) [12.3 a.m.] - Despit e protests from the Government side of the chamber because of the lateness of the hour, I shall address myself to this matter because it is not often that we have had the opportunity to discuss foreign affairs when the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) has been present. The Minister has had a great deal to say to-night answering the questions that have been posed by various honourable members. I do not propose to deal with any matter other than the trusteeship of New Guinea, because the Minister has endeavoured to defend both himself and his Government for the handing over of New Guinea to a trusteeship council under the Tjnited Nations organization, to which Australia must tender an account of its stewardship every twelve months. The Minister's representative for the last twelve months has had to go to Lake Success to be subjected to an inquisition by various small nations about what Australia has attempted to do for the natives of New Guinea. I do not think that Australia should be under challenge at all by minor foreign powers in respect of its treatment of the natives. Nevertheless each twelve months the Minister for External Territories has to send Mr Halligan or some other officer abroad to answer all sorts of questions, many of which are not intended to assist Australia. Some of them are questions put to our representative publicly by Ukrainian or Soviet representatives in such a light that they are intended to place Australia on the defensive, instead of relating to its administration of the mandate.",108
526,Mr WARD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,We do not mind.,109
527,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I know the Minister does not mind, but the people of Australia have a right to object. They are not so tough in the skin as is the Minister. The Minister for External Affairs, who sits beside the Minister for External Territories (Mr Ward) at the table, voluntarily sacrificed the right of Australia to tell these people to go where they wish. I remind honourable members that 6,000 Australians laid down their lives in defence of New Guinea in order to preserve it as Australian territory, and as an outpost for our protection. They believed that New Guinea was essential to our defence. The Minister for External Territories has said that the present arrangement about New Guinea has many advantages over the old mandate system. For instance, we have the right to fortif y New Guinea, and that is true. It iB also true that the mandate system lapsed when the League of Nations lapsed in 1939, and there was no obligation upon Australia, which held New Guinea by right of conquest, to surrender it to any outside tribunal. New Guinea is more important to the defence of Australia than are the Marshall and Caroline Islands to the defence of the United States of America. Honourable members opposite may smirk, but few of them have taken any interest in New Guinea. The Minister for External Affairs said to-night that there was not very much in the trusteeship which the United States of America exercised over the former Japanese territories in the Pacific. I have here a book entitled Trusteeship in the Pacific with which the Minister for External Affairs is probably familiar. It contains contributions by many notable Australians who are qualified to write on the subject. The Minister for External Affairs may laugh, but it was no laughing matter to give away a territory that cost so much to win.",109
528,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I did not give it away.,109
529,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,It cannot be contradicted that this Parliament had no opportunity to decide the matter until it was an accomplished fact. The matter was not brought before the Parliament until the pass was sold.,109
530,Mr WARD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,That is not true.,109
531,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It is true, as the records of the Parliament will show. The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) brought a bill dealing with the subject before the Parliament, but that was after the Government had agreed to hand New Guinea over to the control of the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations. That was done in 1946, and the bill was not brought in until two years later. The Minister for External Territories, who now unfortunately administers New Guinea, ought to know the facts. Australia should have insisted upon a strategic trusteeship of New Guinea, as the United States of America did for the Marshall and Caroline Islands. The records show that Australia and Great Britain, among other countries, tried to persuade the United States of America not to insist on a strategic trusteeship. I quote the following paragraph from the book, Trusteeship in the Pacific:The United States draft waa approved unanimously practically unaltered. Here again the main reason appeal's to have been the American threat to withdraw the area from trusteeship and to annex it on the basis of military conquest, if fundamental changes insisted upon. The United States of America was so insistent upon a strategic trusteeship that it was prepared to smash the whole trusteeship system rather than submit the Marshall and Caroline Islands to the control of the Trusteeship Council. I wish to point out the difference between the trusteeship that Australia has accepted over New Guinea and the strategic trusteeship which the United States of America has obtained over the Caroline and Marshall Islands, which are much less necessary to its defence than is New Guinea to ours. The United States of America has not to make a report each year to the Trusteeship Council on its administration of the islands, as we are required to do in respect of New Guinea. The Trusteeship Council consists of representatives of Iran, the Philippines, United States of America, Mexico and some other countries. Membership changes from year to year, but each year it is necessary for the Minister for External Territories to send an officer abroad to report upon our administration to the representatives of Iran or Mexico, or some other country.",109
532,Mr WARD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,To account to the world.,110
533,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Every year, an may opportunity is given to some country-an there is usually some country that wants to put Australia in the wrong-to misrepresent the administration of the them. trusteeship. On the other hand, the United States of America is not required to present any document at all to the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations, but only to report to the Security Council. If anything arises the discussions of the Security Council that is inimical to the interests of United States of America that country has the power to prevent discussion by use of the veto.",110
534,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,It cannot prevent discussion.,110
535,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I assume that it can veto any discussion.,110
536,Dr EVATT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It can exercise a power of veto, but it cannot prevent discussion.",110
537,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"But the United were States of America can also exclude the representatives of other nations from entering territory which it holds under a strategic trusteeship of the United Nations, although Australia cannot takesimilar action in respect of New Guinea. Government supporters interjecting,",110
538,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"If Government supporters had given as much attention to this matter as have honourable members of the Opposition we should have had a much better debate. The only honourable member opposite who is qualified to speak on the matter is the Minister himself, who is, of course, very well qualified.",110
539,Mr DALY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable member does not know anything about the matter.,110
540,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I know suflicient to realise that what has been done is detrimental to the interests of Australia, and I have studied the situation sufficiently to convince myself that it is in the interests of Australia that these facts should be made public. I point out that under the Tjnited Nations strategic trusteeship the United States of America can exclude any foreign representatives from its mandates. Can the Minister for External Territories take similar exclusive action in respect of New Guinea? Has he the power to prevent representatives of foreign powers who be appointed by the United Nations d from visiting New Guinea ?",110
541,Mr WARD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,We do not want to exclude,110
542,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"If New Guinea had been fortified, as it should have beenand which, incidentally, the Minister for External Affairs says the Government could do under its mandate-doe s not the in Minister for External Territories agree that he is powerless to prevent the reprethe sentatives of powers, whose intentions towards Australia may not be entirely the friendly, from visiting New Guinea and inspecting defence works there ?.",110
543,Mr WARD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"They would not he entitled to inspect defence works, in any event.",111
544,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I haye no douht from the Minister's interjection and from the statements that he has made from time to time that he is quite unconcerned about the defence of New Guinea.,111
545,Mr WARD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member wants to be careful that his banana plantation is not placed under the trusteeship agreement, because it would then be liable to inspection by international labouiofficials.",111
546,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"--I have a timber lease in New Guinea, which is, admittedly, very valuable, but I am careful about the people who go there to look at",111
547,Mr WARD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable member could not keep the labour inspectors away from it. Let him tell us the date of his last fine.,111
548,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I can tell the House the .details of a little frame-up that was engineered by the Minister.,111
549,Mr WARD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Tell us all about it.,111
550,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I shall do so at some other time; but, in any event, the Minister has already told the courts a good deal about timber in New Guinea.",111
551,Mr WARD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I have never been convicted.,111
552,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member was very fortunate, indeed.",111
553,Mr BEAZLEY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I rise to order. I understand that the Standing Orders prohibit tedious repetition. The matters mentioned by the honourable member concerning trusteeship were mentioned by bim in the speech that he delivered before the dinner adjournment. Is it permissible for an honourable member to make an infinite number of speeches covering the same matter? The TEMPOBABY CHAIBM AN (Mr Lazzarini) - The Standing Orders provide that the Chair may call to order an honourable member who repeats himself unduly in the course of a single speech. The honourable member has not repeated himself unduly in the course of his present speech.,111
554,Mr ANTHONY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I point out that when I spoke before the suspension of the sitting I was not in possession of the evidence which I now have to enable me to contradict the Minister's statement in respect of strategic trusteeships. Had the Minister desired, and had he displayed a little less enthusiasm for the United Nations, and a little more enthusiasm for his own country, he could have insisted on obtaining for Australia a similar strategic trusteeship to those granted to the United States of America. I have endeavoured to point out that Australia could have held New Guinea as an integral part of the territory of this nation, and it could have told the rest it. of the world to do what it liked about it, but because of the type of trusteeship agreement into which the Government has entered, we are committed for all time to an unsatisfactory arrangement. The Parliament was not consulted until after the trusteeship agreement had been made with the United Nations. In spite of the fact that the Minister for External Affairs shakes his head, he was not here to state the case when the Prime Minister, acting on his behalf, placed the matter before the House. Members of the Parliament have had very few opportunities in this chamber to discuss foreign affairs in the presence of the Minister, who, had he been here could have corrected us if we had been wrong, or could have supplied information that was lacking. In this matter there is no douht whatever about the attitude of the Opposition. We believe that New Guinea was sacrificed. We believe that something was given away to the Trusteeship Council for which 6,000 Australians had laid down their lives. We believe that no good can come of the trusteeship agreement; that no advantage will be reaped from it ; and that what was done by the Minister for External Affairs was done in pursuit of his own personal aims and ambitions, and that it was to the detriment of Australia.

556,Mr MCEWEN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"the Minister for ..33 Post-war Reconstruction, upon notice I. What was the production of Australian 10 wire netting in 1948-49, and how does this compare with production in 1938-39? 2. What proportion of the Australian production is supplied to consumers in Victoria? AYES. 3. What proportion, if any, of the total production is exported from the Commonwealth?",112
557,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The production of wire netting in Australia in the year 1948-49 was 7,880 tonB. This compares with a production of 12,240 tons in the year 1938-39. 2. When the Commonwealth was responsible for the allocation of controlled materials, including wire netting, to the States the Victorian quota was 24 per cent, of production. NOES. The Commonwealth relinquished the allocation of controlled materials to the States on the 16th August, 1949, and the States themselves now have to make their own arrangements with the manufacturers regarding supplies. 3. Exports of wire netting during the year 1948-49 represented less than one-half of 1 per cent, of total production. This included exports to Australian external territories and islands in the South-West Pacific Area which have always been dependent on Australia for supplies. GOODWILL MISSION TO MALAYA-TJNBBA .",112
558,Mr WHITE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice I. What was the cost of the MCMahon, Ball mission to the Far East? 2. What was the value of gifts made by the Government to various nationalities by this mission, and to whom were they made? 3. What was the value of Australia's sub* script ion and gifts to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration? pre- Dr. EVATT - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1 and 2. The cost of the goodwill mission to Asia led by Mr MCMahon Ball was £3,795. As a consequence of the mission a programme of fellowships for study in Australia involving an expenditure of £00,000 was commenced and students from 'Pakistan, India, Ceylon, Burma, British Territories in .South East Asia, Siam, China and the Philippines and Indonesia will benefit from this scheme, l n addition scholarships to the annual value of £5,000 will be made available to permit students from South East Asia to study in Australia and medical supplies, clothing and X-ray equipment valued at £480,000 is being made available to Burma, Indonesia and British territories in South East Asia. materials valued at £40,000 are also being supplied to Asian countries. 3.

Mr Archie CAMERON ister representing the Minister for S h i p p in g and F u e l , upon not i c e 1. What was the total petrol consumption in gallons of all Commonwealth departments for the year 1948-49? 2. How does the figure compare with 1938-39? 3. What is the consumption by Trans-Australia Airlines, shown as a separate item?",112
559,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The Minister for Shipping and Fuel ha9 supplied the following information:1. 8,441,215 gallons. 2. Statistics showing the petrol consumption by Commonwealth Government departments for the year 1938-39 are not available. It may be assumed, however, that consumption by Commonwealth departments has increased substantially since 1938-39 due to the expanded operations of most departments, particularly the Postmaster-General's service departments, the Department of Works and Housing, the Department of Aircraft"" Production, the Department of Civil Aviation, the Department of Munitions nnd the Department of Supply and Development. 3. It is not the practice to make public the amount of petrol obtained by any individual commercial user, and as Trans-Australia Airlines is a business organization, the information sought cannot bc furnished.",113

562,Mr ADERMANN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"the Minister for the Interior, upon noticeDepartment, the 1. Why were two privately owned omnibuses hired from Mr Greg Cusack, of Canberra, at a cost of £329 18s. 9d., to convey forestry students from Canberra to Coff's Harbour and Warwick during the latter part of August, 1949? 2. Why could not the journey have, been made by train or aeroplane? 3. Have any private vehicles been hired by the Commonwealth for the carriage of passengers during the past two years? COAL. 4. If so, when, for what purpose, and what was the cost of such hirings?",113
563,Mr JOHNSON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1 and 2. It is normally the practice for Forestry School students to travel to camps by rail. When arrangements were being finalized for the canips which commenced late in August, traffic by rail was extremely uncertain on account of the coal strike. The possibility of postponing the camps until rail facilities were assured wasconsidered, but it was found such a course would involve losses with contracts already entered into in. respect of the camps and would, in addition, seriously interfere with the curriculum of the school. Prices were obtained for the transport of the pupils from bus operators in Canberra. Cusack's quotation was accepted. Actually it meant a saving when compared with the cost of normal rail transport. In addition, it provided transport from the school to the camp, thus avoiding the charges usually necessary for transport from the school to rail and rail to camp. The vehicles used in the Canberra omnibus service are unsuitable for this long distance travel. The students returned from the camps by rail. 3 and 4. One of Cusack's buses was utilized earlier for the transport of students to a camp at Ma thou ra, in the Deniliquin district. There is no direct rail link between Canberra and Mathoura. I have no knowledge as to whether other departments are hiring private vehicles for the transport of passengers.",113
564,Mr FRANCIS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"the Minister representing the Minister for S up p l y and Development, upon not i c e 1. Is it a fact that, although heavy dollar expenditure is being incurred to purchase^ t in plate from the United States of America, British manufacturers are able to supply quantities of tinplate in excess of those now heing purchased by Australia from the United Kingdom ? 2. Is it a fact that this is because of an agreement entered into by the Commonwealth Government with the United States suppliers to purchase tinplate from the United States? 3. If such an agreement does exist, does it contain a waivure clause such as that in the many other commodity supply agreements between Australian consumers and American suppliers which have been prematurely terminated in accordance with the Government's dollar conservation policy? 4. If such a waivure clause does exist, why is it not being used to place consumers of tinplate in the same positiou as consumers of other goods whose raw material supplies from the United States and Canada have been curtailed or terminated? 5. Is it a fact that two former officers of the Tinplate Board who had a large part in recommending the acceptance of the American tinplate contract subsequently appointments in an American company or companies supplying tinplate to Australia under this contract?",114
565,Mr DEDMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The S up p l y and Development has supplied the following in for m at i o n : 1. Australian users have not f u l ly taken up the tinplate allocations made to Australia by the United Kingdom Board of Trade for the third and fourth quarters of 1949 m ill rollings. The Commonwealth has accepted this position having regard to the question of suitability for Australian requirements of available tinplate in the United Kingdom. 2. No. The agreement made with the United States Export Company assists Australian importers to obtain from that company 40 per cent, of their overall requirements. This quantity, together with the amount of suitable British tinplate available, does not exceed Australia's basic requirements. 3 and 4. These involve a matter of legal interpretation upon which it is not the practice to give information in answering parliamentary questions. 5. Mr J. F. Foot, who held a temporary war-time appointment, visited the United Kingdom and the United States of America in 1947 as Controller of Tinplate for the purpose of discussing the possibility of increasing t in plate supplies from those countries to Australia. Whilst in the United States of America Mr Foot discussed this question with TINPLATE. the United States of America authorities, the United States Steel Export Company and other United States of America steel companies. Mr Foot had no authority to enter into any agreement or commitments on behalf of the Government. The agreement with the United States Steel Export Company was made by the Government after consultation with the United Kingdom Government and after full y considering the difficulties of obtaining sufficient tinplate to maintain essential food processing industries. Mr Foot resigned his appointment in November, 1948, and is now employed by the United States Steel Export Company. No other former permanent or temporary officer of the department is in the employment of that company. PEPPER.  ber, the honourable member for E d e n M o n a r o (Mr F r as e r ) asked the following questions:1. Will the Minister for Trade and Customs cause an inquiry to be made into the landed cost and the selling price of pepper? 2. Will the Minister make some representation to the six States which now endeavour to control prices, with a view to having this matter decided, because sellers of pepper arc accepted making it too hot altogether? The Minister for T r a d e and Customs has supplied the following in for m at i o n :Minister for The matter of the increased cost of pepper has been brought under the notice of the prices authority in each State. The payment of subsidy on pepper was discontinued as from the 14th March, 1947, and on the 20th September, 1948, this item was decontrolled.",114
