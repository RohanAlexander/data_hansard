'ERRORS IN TELEGRAPH. MESSAGES-TELE - . Mr Mauger GRAPHIC DELAYS-TASMANIA N . SERVICE. Mr KING O'MALLEY - In a letter written to me by Mr H . A. Pratt, sion agent, of West' Devonport, Tasmania, the writer says that he wishes me to under noticethe continual loss we, as produce agents, put to through the mutilation of our telegraph messages. On the 2nd of A p r i l , I wired a Sydney firm an offer of 20 tons of potatoes, at £ 3 17s. 6d. f.o.b. The message despatched', through an error in the George Town cable station, read ,£3 7s. 6d., thus causing me a loss of "" over '£10 ios. Now, every business turn is re-' sponsible for the errors of their servants, but the officials screen their error by stating- "" no claim can be entertained for compensation."" May I trespass upon your good nature to see into the matter for me? I have it on good authority that a claim of over £ 8 0 was paid by the State Government. Will the Postmaster-General look into these complaints, and make his servants responsible for their errors? I hope, too, that the Government will see that compensation is given where loss is caused by the mistakes of the Department.",14
1,Mr MAUGER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I shall cause a thorough inquiry to be made.,14
2,Mr FULLER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I wish to read a letter received this morning, in which the writer saysI enclose one telegram which you see took 10 IIOUTS 25 minutes to come froni Gerringong. I have driven the. distance in less than 9 hours, and on a previous occasion - a telegram, was handed in at the same office at 13.30, and I did : not receive it here t ill 9.45 that night. Again, a telegram was sent from Sydney about 5.30 one afternoon, and I got it at ir.30 next day, five hours after I had received a letter confirming the telegram. I shall hand the enclosed telegram to the - Postmaster-General. The state of affairs mentioned by my correspondent is disgraceful, and I ask the Postmaster-General to make a full investigation of his complaints, with a view to having matters rectified. - Mr Mauger - Every inquiry will be",14
3,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Whil e the other com. plaints are being investigated, I ask the Postmaster-General to cause an inquiry to be made as to why no answer has yet been given to a complaint which I made to the Deputy Postmaster-General some weeks ago, in reference to a telegram which I sent from this building, which was not delivered to. an address within the city radius until live hours after its receipt by the despatching office. If the honourable MAIL member will give, me the particulars, I shall .cause inquiry to be made.",14
4,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Some time ago it commiswas promised by the Union Steamship Company and the Huddart Parker. Steambring, ship Company that the Coogee would be - replaced by the Rotomahana for the winter are service between Tasmania and the mainland. As there is some doubt about the fulfilment of that promise, I wish to know from the Postmaster-General effect will be given to it , and, if so, when ?",14
5,Mr MAUGER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Rotomahana is on its way from New Zealand, arid will take up the running immediately after arrival. COMMONWEALTHAND STATES : FINANCIAL PROPOSALS.",15
6,Mr KNOX,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In view of the importance of the memorandum of the Treasurer on-the subject of the transfer of the debts of the States to the Commonwealth and the financial relations connected therewith, I ask him when he will afford the House an opportunity to discuss it .",15
7,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is not possible to - name a date at the present moment. We certainly shall not postpone the consideration of the Senate's requests on the Customs Tariff Bill to deal with the subject. I do not know what the Premiers of the States intend to do in the matter; but it may not be necessary to deal with the scheme at the earliest possible date, even after the Customs Tariff Bill has been disposed of. The course taken will depend a great deal on the action of the Premiers.",15
8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Has the scheme been submitted to the Cabinet, and received the approval of the Prime Minister?",15
9,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Of course, it has. * .",15
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he approved of the scheme which the right honourable member for Swan submitted to the Premiers' Conference last year, and, if so, whether he does not think that he should ' take' an early opportunity to reconcile his - position with regard to these two widely different schemes?",15
11,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The scheme submitted by the right honourable member for Swan was one for ten years only as an extension of the Braddon clause, and for reasons then given was put forward because of the urgent desire of the Government to obtain control of a certain portion of the Customs revenue before 1910, to. at once introduce a system of old-age pensions. That necessity is now being' removed.",15
12,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"My scheme would not have come into operation until 1910. RABBITS FOR THE NAVY . whether - Mr LIVINGSTO N - In today's Age is a paragraph headed ' "" Tinned Rabbits for the Navy, Australian supply."" Will the Government call the attention of the Admiralty to the fact that Australia can supply all the rabbits needed by the Navy, and that the Commonwealth laws insure that they will be good? At Mount Gambier, and Millicent, there are the most up-to-date plants in the world, and the rabbits are of the best quality.",15
13,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The information has been, or will be, conveyed to the A d miralty. It should be added that the representative of the places mentioned deserves as high an encomium as he has passed on the rabbits. ANTARCTIC EXPEDITIO N.",15
14,Mr CROUCH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I wish to ask ' the Prime Minister whether he recollects that when the proposal to grant .£5,000 towards the expedition to the Antarctic regions, conducted by Lieutenant Shackleton, was before this House, the statement was made that that officer would complete a meteorological and meteoric survey of Australia? I also wish to know whether he has observed that it has now been announced that no sucb promise was made, and that there is. no intention"" whatever of making any such survey ? """,15
15,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I am not aware of any promise in regard to the meteoric or meteorological conditions of Australia having been made by Lieutenant Shackleton. I understood the only statement made in that connection to relate to observations while the expedition remains in the south polar regions. NA ADMINISTRATION. RECLASSIFICATIO N OF OFFICERS.,15
16,Mr JOHNTHOMSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I understand that some time ago a scheme was submitted for the reclassification of officer's in the Postal Department, and I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether that scheme has received his approval, and, if so, when effect-will be given to it?",15
17,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The scheme prepared' by the Public Service Commissioner, and approved by the Postmaster-General, will be submitted to the Executive at its first meeting. COMMONWEALTH AND STATES: FINANCIAL PROPOSALS.",15
18,Mr BRUC ESMITH,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"In the summary at the head of the Argus reprint of the Treasurer's financial proposals, it is made to appear that it is intended that ^6,000,000 per annum is to be returned to the States for a period of five years^ and that the amount is then to be gradually reduced, and finally abolished after a period of thirty years, whilst, in the "" recapitulation "" paragraph of the scheme, the reduction over thirty vears is made applicable to the amount which the States are required to pay the Commonwealth to make up the interest on their respective debts. In order to remove any possible misapprehension, will the Treasurer say whether the summary mentioned is or is not correct?",16
19,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I have not seen the summary in question, but, as read by the honourable member, it is absolutely i ncorrect. The second part of the statement is more reliable. LABOUR PARTY' S CAUCUS.",16
20,Mr HALL,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I desire to ask the honourable member for Fawkner whether he is correctly reported in yesterday's Argus to have saidThat party may drop its fads, but they were not allowed to do so by the caucus. betraying no confidence when he said that members of the party often opposed the dictation of the caucus, and were yet compelled to vote on questions against their consciences. If the honourable member has been correctly reported, will he cite one instance in which a member of the Labour Party has been compelled to vote against his conscience ?",16
21,Mr FAIRBAIRN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I really think that some notice should be given of a serious question of that sort.,16
22,Mr HUTCHISON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Did the member make the statement ?,16
23,Mr FAIRBAIRN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,i ' do not know whether I did or not. But I really thinkin view of what our friends in the Labour corner have said about me-that they are a very thin-skinned lot.,16
24,Mr FOSTER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The honourable member made a serious charge.,16
25,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,It is quite too. They have to vote as a majority direct.,16
26,Mr FISHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"That is absolutely incorrect, and the right honourable member knows it. '",16
27,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I should be sorry to have to name the two honourable members who are still continuing an altercation across the Chamber.,16
28,Sir JOHNFORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If you, sir, had heard the disgraceful language used towards me, you would not have been surprised at my little rejoinder.",16
29,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"If I had heard any comments of the kind referred to, I should certainly have called those who uttered them to order. Later",16
30,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I desire to make a personal explanation. You know, Mr Speaker, that I have ho desire to say anything offensive to, or to be on ill terms with any honourable member in this House, and when I interjected a few moments ago I did not intend to suggest that the members of the Labour Party or any other honourable members in this House voted against their moral con-. science. I think that ks a general rule, in connection with our votes,' the question of conscience does not come in. We simplv exercise our judgment as to what is the most desirable course to pursue. All that I intended to say was that as I understand the position, members of the Labour Party, when they differ in caucus, on caucus matters are bound to be guided by the decision of the majority, however much they may be individually opposed to the proposition He was under consideration.",16
31,Mr MCDONALD,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,The honourable member is wrong.,16
32,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I did not mean to say anything more than I have indicated, and I do not want my friends in the Labour Party to think that I intended to say more. I repeat that what I meant was that on matters coming within the platform of the Labour Party, when they came io be discussed in caucus the majority ruled, honourable and the others had to submit, however much they differed from the decision of the majority. - Mr HUGHES - B y way of personal explanation, I should like to say that when I interjected, in reply to the right honourable member for Swan, that he was hardly the kind of man to say what he did say, I , really said what I fully meant. The right true, honourable member had a seat in a Cabinet for a very long while, and he gave a number of votes then, which he has since said were entirely wrong. I thought that the right honourable gentleman had given those votes against his conscience, but henow tells us.that they were errors of judgment merely. I am sure that the Labour Party are quite content to leave the matter at that. NEW HEBRIDES.",16
33,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister with reference to the grave condition of affairs in the New Hebrides disclosed by his reply to a question put by the honourable member for Mernda yesterday, whether the Government have made any protest to the British Colonial Office against its attitude of apparent apathy and indffference to British and Australian interests in the islands. If not, does he propose to make strong representations to the Home authorities without delay, in reference to the existing condition of affairs ?",17
34,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"L as t year I made a protest in person in as emphatic terms as it was possible to employ. In reply, I received certain . assurances. Some objection was taken to the nature of the protest which I then lodged. Under these circumstances-m y views being perfectly well known- I have since confined myself to simple representations of facts in a way that constitutes perhaps a sufficiently effective protest. IMMIGRATION: LAND FOR SETTLEMENT.",17
35,Mr KING OMALLEY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he has observed the following paragraph, which appears in today's AgeAt a meeting of the Donald Shire Council, Cr. E. Osier tendered his resignation, as he is leaving the district for Queensland, where hehas taken land. He said he had to settle his children on the land, ancl he could not get land in Victoria for them. He had to go out among strangers to find homes for his family, as scores of other Victorians had had to do within the last few years. In view of that statement is there any way in which the Government can help to retain these splendid farmers in Victoria?",17
36,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I would remind the honourable member that the Commonwealth knows no distinction between States, and that any movement of settlers from one State to another is beyond our ken. I regret to say that I did notice, not only the paragraph in question, but also a. long article in a recent number of the Sydney Daily Telegraph, in reference to a similar condition of affairs in New South Wales where there was a demand for land far exceeding the available existing supply. I have seen similar statements made in other States, and regret them, because I hope to see the time when not only the whole of the local demand for land will be met by the States, but we shall also be prepared to find land for a large number of white immigrant settlers.",17
37,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Following up the honourable member for Darwin's question, I wish to ask the Prime Minister ""whether he has seen in this morning's newspapers a cabled report of a, speech made by Mr. Price, the Labour Premier of South Australia, in which he referred again to the urgent need of immigration to Australia. If the Prime Minister believes that, as is claimed by a certain section of politicians in Australia, there is no land available for 1 settlement here will he despatch to Mr. Price a cablegram pointing out that he is going beyond his book in advocating immigration to Australia? On the other hand,  correct, will he cease to make in this House statements which would appear to assist the Labour Party in laying this base charge against the Commonwealth?",17
38,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I may, .perhaps, be pardoned for saying that the honourable member's question, and particularly its conclusion, appears to be incoherent. I have made a statement of facts as u> the States, and am not concerned with the question of whether or not a statement of fact is in the interests of or adverse to the Labour Party. I have repeatedly read in newspapers such as the Sydney Daily Telegraph-whic h no one will say is a Labour newspaper-that the number of applicants for lots offered in a particular district was greatly in excess of the blocks available. I regret that such a state of affairs should prevail 1 in Australia, and .think, it can and ought to be altered. I saw the report of Mr. Price's speech, and noted that his remarks were associated with, a reference to the proposed locking of the Murray. It is perfectly certain that when that great work is accomplished thousands of acres now carrying unitswill be able to support scores of families. But Mr FAIRBAIRN - Does not the Prime Minister think that the action of the honourable member for Darwin in calling public attention to the irresponsible statement of a farmer as to the lack of land for settlement in Australia savours very strongly of the "" stinking fish "" policy ?",17
39,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"It is, in some aspects, unfortunate that attention should be called to such a statement, but it is still more unfortunate that it should be founded on fact.'",17
40,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"Is the Prime Min tical programme to overcome the difficulty referred to is a progressive land tax, and that he' has carried through the House of Assembly in South Australia a measure providing for such a tax?",18
41,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I can scarcely answer the question, but may add that I have learned from the Acting Premier of South Australia-the . present Chief Secretarythat he intends next session to reintroduce that measure.",18
42,Mr FULLER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he is aware that the Government of Queensland recently resumed 90,000 acres, and that, although it has thrown open 45,000 acres for selection, only 10 per cent, of the land has been applied for ?",18
43,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,- I wa's' not aware of that.,18
44,Mr LIVINGSTON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,Does not the Prime Minister think that the Premier of South Australia' has advertised Australia in the Old Country better than has any man from the Commonwealth except the Prime Minister himself? PAP UA LAND TRANSACTIONS . SUSPENSION OF MR . DRUMMOND:,18
45,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Has he received any petition, memorial, or other communication from the white residents of Papua relating to the omcers concerned in the alleged improper .land transactions at Papua ? 2. Does he know of the existence of any other reason for. Mr Drummond's suspension than the one given by Judge Murray? 3. Has he any further proof of Mr Drumrnond's guilty intent than the mutually contradictory statements of Judge Murray and Mr. Staniforth Smith which have appeared in the public press. ' If not, will he have fuller inquiry made before final action is taken in the matter of punishment? 4. Will he lay bn the table all correspondence and available papers relating to the matter?",18
46,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The answers to orable member's-questions are as follow1. A petition was received relating to Mr. Drummond, signed by twenty residents, of whom - three were formerly members of the Public Service, and one was one of the applicants in the - alleged improper land transactions. 2. No. I give that answer in relation to the question of suspension because the honourable member is aware that the Royal Commission passed some comments on Mr Drummond's qualification for the office which he was then temporarily occupying. 3. All the papers in the matter, which were voluminous, were carefully considered by me, and convinced me of Mr Drummond's culpability. The matter, so far as it relates to that officer, has been finally dealt with. 4. All the more important papers have been laid before Parliament and printed, but the complete file will be placed on the Library table. IMITATIONART PAPER. INSTRUCTION TO CUSTOMS OFFICERS.",18
47,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Is it a fact that on the 4th of September, 1907, the following instruction was issued to his officers :""Imitation art paper and super calendered papers, used exclusively in the production of newspapers and other publications, such as The Bulletin, & c , registered for transmission through the post as newspapers, may be deemed 'News,' and admitted accordingly ?"" 2. Is it a fact that the effect of this instruction was that the Sydney Bulletin could get its British super calendered paper in free, instead of at 15 per cent., under the Tariff?",18
48,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. Yes. 2. Yes, in common with all other papers, for instance the Argus, in regard to which precisely similar instructions were given in Melbourne on the same date (4th September last). The instruction quoted was given to all States, and the Bulletin was mentioned merely as an example, and because the question first came up in regard to that particular paper. The particular description of paper referred to was deemed to come within the then terms of exemption, and consequently was not subject to duty at 15 per cent. SUGAR INDUSTRY . WAGES OF CASUAL LABOURERS.",18
49,Mr ARCHER,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"the Minister of the honTrade and Customs, upon noticeWliether he will place upon the table all cor- ' respondence, papers, and reports bearing upon 1 his decision of 4th inst. regarding wages to casual labourers in the sugar industry under the. Sugar Bounty Act of 1905?",18
50,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,I have no objection to place the papers in question on the librarv table. NA DEPARTMENT. CABINET COMMITTEE'S INQUIRIES.,18
51,Mr WEBSTER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact, as reported in the papers, that the Cabinet Committee found the postal service in New South Wales overworked and undermanned ? 2. Is it a fact that some 500 further additional hands will be necessary to properly man the service in that State? 3. Is it a fact that they also decided that many of the telegraph and telephone lines wil l need to be duplicated before a satisfactory service can be established ? 4. What steps are being taken to inquire into the position of the service in other States than New South Wales? 5. Is the Committee satisfied that the task is one beyond, their power, and that a fuller and more searching inquiry will be necessary in the public interest?",19
52,Mr MAUGER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as followsA great many matters, including those referred to by the honourable member, have been inquired into by my colleagues and myself in Sydney, and further information elucidating the conditions of the postal service in - New South Wales has been requisitioned. Inquiries are also being made as to the conditions in the other States, the result of which will be laid before Parliament. ADVERTISING AUSTRALIA. PURCHASE OF "" LONE HAND "" ARTICLE PAYMENT FOR ARTICLES.",19
53,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"A r e there any papers from Captain Collins bearing on the distribution of the Lone Hand article in England, showing the expense incurred, or giving other information? If so, will the Prime Minister consent to lay them on the table?",19
54,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"If there are such papers, I shall lay them on the table.",19
55,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeWith reference to his statement as reported Hansard (unrevised proof) in reply to a question by the honourable member for Wentworth, that low""The Government was supplied with 50,000 copies of the Lone Hand, and these were sent to every newspaper in the United Kingdom, and terday.. to every leading newspaper in the United States. Those copies were in addition to the 10,000 copies of the article which was circulated through United Kingdom as a separate pamphlet.""- (1) Was he aware when these 50,000 of the Lone Hand were circulated throughout the United Kingdom and the United States that there was lished - in that issue a defamatory article on the Capital of the Southern Hemisphere, entitled, "" Sydney^: The Cinderella of Cities?"" (2) Was he aware that the article was preceded by the following explanatory sub-heading, printed in bold black type :- "" How a City which has the most beautiful site in the whole world is running the risk of remaining one of the ugliest, the most backward, and . the most disease-stricken; while its commercial future is imperilled;"" and that the article contained the f o l . lowing, amongst other disparaging references to the Capital City of Australia :- "" Sydney is in Hie position of the Cinderella of the fairy talein the kitchen covered with soot andgrime-slovenl y and out-at-heels, bedraggled and neglected."" . . . . "" B y her own exertions what has she done but uglify ' the primeval beauty 1 of her site."" . . . ""The criminal negligence of the past is matched by - a criminal content and neglect as to the possibilities of present improvement and future growth."" . . . . ""-The effort will be made by articles from time to time in the Lone Hand to preach civic reform for all Australia, with Sydney usually as ' the shocking example ' "" ? (3) Does he think that it is fair to pick out for the subject of an illustration to the article one of the oldest and? ugliest slums in the ""Rocks"" area, and thus convey to readers in Eng.land and America, the erroneous impression that the illustration is typical' of the workers' homes in Sydney? (4) Does he think the broadcast circulation of an a-rticle of the above description amongst the people of Great Britain and America is calculated to create a favourable impression of Sydney, and induce people to come out and make their homes there; and (5) Does he think it fai r to ask the people of New South Wales to assist in defraying the cost of a publication, and its circulation abroad, in which their Capital City is defamed and untruthf u l l y referred to as ""the most disease-stricken "" of Australian cities; and in which unmerited charges of ineptitude and incompetency are levelled against its municipal and other authorities?",19
56,Mr DEAKIN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"The answers to the i i i honourable member's questions are as f o l The inaccuracy in the report quotedby the honourable member was pointed out by me yes1. I am aware that the proprietors of the Lone Hand circulated 50,000 copies 6f the first the number throughout the United Kingdom and? elsewhere, and remember that an article relating copies to Sydney did appear in that number. 2-, 3, and. 4. I do not feel called on to exercise judicial functions in regard to criticism pubof local matters by a local publication. 5. Neither the people of New South Wales nor any other part of the Commonwealth assisted in defraying the cost of that publication, or its circulation. Motion (by Mr KELLY) proposed1. That a return be laid upon the table of the House showing(a) The publications that have received payment from the Commonwealth Government for articles or for services in connection with the advertisement of Australia. [b) The names of the persons connected with such publications with whom, the Government negotiated for such articles or services. 2. That what papers there are in existence in connection with all the above matters be laid upon the table of the House.",19
57,Mr CKOUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I should like to know, Mr Speaker, whether I should be in order in moving an amendment providing that the proposed return shall also show the payments to, and arrangements made with, Mr John Plummer by the Reid-MCLean Administration ?",20
58,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,There is no objection to that.,20
59,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"The honourable member will see that the motion has been brought on as unopposed business. It will be competent for him to move his amendment on some other date, but. if he were to move an amendment now, and any comment took place on the motion, it could not be dealt with today.",20
60,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I shall give notice to move tomorrow for a return giving the information desired by the honourable member for Corio.,20
61,Mr CROUCH,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I wish to oppose this motion.,20

In Committee (Consideration of Senate's requests resumed from 5th May, vide page 10828) : Item 234. OilsIn vessels exceeding 1 gallon, viz. :Request - Inser t the following paragraph(JJ) Lubricating (Mineral)*-To come into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation. Proclamation to so soon as a joint address has been passed on the motion of Ministers by both Houses of Parliament stating such manufacture is sufficiently established in the Commonwealth. Per gallon (General Tariff), 4d.; (United Kingdom), 3jd. Upon which Sir WILLIAM LYNE had movedThat requested amendment be made. And Mr Bruce SMITHThat the motion be amended by the addition of the modification that the letters "" j j "" be left out with a . view to insert in lieu thereot the letter "" J,"" and that the words "" To come into operation ' on a date to be fixed by proclamation. Proclamation to issue so soon as a joint address has been passed on the motion of Ministers by both Houses of Parliament, stating that such manufacture is sufficiently established in the Commonwealth,"" be left out.",20
63,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Parkes) [3.3] 1 understood last night that the Treasurer intended to devise some means of preventing this item being duplicated. The honororable gentleman pointed out that, under the heading of "" j "" we had already voted for, I think, an immediate duty of 3jrd., whereas now we have a proposal for a duty of Ad., consequent to a proclamation. The Treasurer seemed to think last night that my proposal to eliminate the words embarrassed him in dealing with the Tariff, by leaving - the two items therein; but 1 point out that the two items would be in the Tariff'in any case. 'Supposing my proposal to eliminate the words were not made, we should then be in the peculiar position of still having the item of lubricating oil in two places, subject to an immediate duty of 3}d., and tt) a duty of 4d., following on a proclamation. It will be seen, therefore, that this amendment does not in any way add to the embarrassment caused by the duplicate proposals.; and I suggest to the Treasurer that he could very easily get: rid of one of these duties by a recommittal.",20
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I do not desire any recommittal.,20
65,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Then the only question before us is whether the duty shall be 3^d. as passed, or 4d., as proposed by the Senate, the latter being not an immediate duty, but one pursuant to a proclamation. I think the Committee has shown very clearly that they desire to get rid of the principle of making duties depend on a proclamation to be used hereafter. We alldesire to know exactly what the Tariff is going to be, and to have it settled without liability to having the question disturbed issue at some future time by a proposal on the part of the Government for a proclamation to be endorsed by both Houses.",20
66,Mr WH IRVINE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,That point was settled on a former division..,20
67,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"The honourable member for Flinders is quite right in saying that that point has been dealt with ; but it was dealt with by the proposal being eliminated, and I am proposing a further elimination now. The Treasurer, however, has pointed out, as if it were a consequence of my amendment, that there would be two duties left in the Tariff on the same commodity.",20
68,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Hume-Trea surer) [3.7] - The honourable member for Parkes is quite right in saying that I postponed the further consideration of tiiis item in order that I might inquire into the effect of the proposal made. I have satisfied myself that whether the paragraph JJ is in o"" not, no harm can be done. But it is better to take one of the j ' s out, and if that Irvine, W. H . be done, then the question as to the duty of 1 4d. and 3|d. will have to be decided. On the decision of the latter question, the duty carried will take precedence. .1 do not intend to oppose the proposal. Amendment agreed to. Proposed modification made. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM? LYNE), proposed - That the requested amendment, as modified, be made.",21
69,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"East Sydney) [3.9] - I desire to ask the Treasurer whether the duties of 3^d. and 3d., which are already imposed in a previous item, do not amount to someline; Gasoline; Pentane, Petrol; thing like 40 per cent, or 50 per cent, of the value of the oil?

74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"It was not intended that mineral oils, n.e.i., should be dutiable at f d . per gallon, though those 34 rates were to apply to naphtha and benzine. With regard to the request that the words "" and all petroleum spirit under .790 gravity,"" be inserted, that is a drag-net AYES. provision which will catch any mineral spirit that may be imported under any other name than those specified, and a gravity of .790 has been fixed to prevent the duty from applying to highly refined kerosene oil, investigations having shown that such oil has a higher gravity.",21

85,Mr HUME COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"That is the departhas been mental interpretation now. ' Mr Frazer (Kalgoorlie) [3.25.] - As of a test of the strength of petroleum spirit I confess that the reference in this parato a specific gravity of less than .790 does not enlighten me very much. If to these figures be inserted I do not know what quality of oil will be subjected to duty. But if the request of the Senate would have the effect of imposing keroa tax upon that necessitous section of the community who dwell in rural districts - I and who are .compelled to use oil as the motive power for their engines, I think' that we ought .to reject it. If we admit kerosene for illuminating purposes free, but impose a duty upon it when it is used, in in connection with rural industries,- I think that we shall be guilty of a very grave inconsistency. The proposal of the Treasurer will subject to duty all. the lower I grade oils now being utilized for motive",22
86,Mr HUME COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,That is not so.,22
87,Mr CARR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Macquarie) [3.28] - It is progenerally understood that any spirit with a higher specific gravity than .790 is keroAny oil with a lower specific gravity is petroleum spirit, and may be used for such purposes as naphtha and benzine are used. We need to exercise great care to prevent petroleum spirit, of a less gravity than .790 introduced ostensibly for industrial purposes, but afterwards being used for be dutiable. domestic purposes.",22

It seems very difficult to conof these oils by upon them these oils cruder should, I think, be dealt with under at present time that Act does not'give the Minister power to compel oils of different degrees of strength to be branded, and I and think that it requires to be amended in that direction. That is the way in which all the oils used for industrial purposes",22
89,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Thes e oils are used for those purposes.,23
90,Mr SAMPSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,If the Treasurer can assure me that there is no danger of oils - used for motive purposes being taxed under this proposal I shall be satisfied. Otherwise I shall vote against it.,23
91,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I can give the honourable member that assurance.,23
92,Mr WATKINS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Newcastle) [3.32] - It appears to me that a specific gravity of .790 marks the difference between kerosene, and benzine, benzoline, gasoline, pentane, petrol, and turpentine substitutes. This Committee has already decided that kerosene for illuminating purposes shall be admitted free, but it has not decided that other oils shall be so admitted. I am satisfied that if we fix too low a specific gravity many of these oils will be introduced as kerosene, and will afterwards come into competition with the other oils which are being produced in the Commonwealth. The oils enumerated in this paragraph are used chiefly in. connection with motor cars and motor boats, and the remarks of the honourable member for Wimmera had reference principally to residual oils. In the mineral oil industry in New South £ 1 . 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 has already been invested by a company which today is capable of supplying the requirements of the Commonwealth. Under such circumstances I am surprised at protectionist members of this Committee casting free-trade votes simply because the industry is not native of their own State.",23
93,Mr SAMPSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I do not think that the honourable member has any reason to complain. A duty of 3d. per gallon has already been imposed on lubricating oils, and an impost of i d . per lb. has been levied on paraffine wax.'",23
94,Mr WATKINS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I think that a limit should be fixed to the specific gravity of kerosene. At the present time there is a large quantity of kerosene upon the market which is being used - in the homes of the poor, and the use of .which is positively - dangerous. If we desire to protect the poorer section of the community, we shall see that only kerosene of the highest standard is used for illuminating purposes. am convinced that if the request of the Senate be reiected, inferior oils' will be introduced and sold for lighting purposes. Mr HENRY WILLIS £3-36]--The Treasurer has stated that the oils specified in this paragraph are not used - for motive purposes. As a matter of fact', not they are used for no other purposes. A motor engine in reality is a gas engine. Naphtha and benzine are extremely volatile substances, and as soon as they are mixed with water they are useless. It is their admixture with air which - generates a gas that is the motive power of the ordinary motor. Kerosene possesses a higher specific gravity than .790. The oils mentioned in this paragraph are really spirits which are used for motive power, and for motive power only. The Treasurer is evidently labouring under a misapprehension.",23
95,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,The experts say that these oils are not used for motive purposes.,23
96,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"If a naked litrht came into contact with these spirits an explosion would result. Electricity is, therefore, used with this class of oils. 'The gas generated must be enclosed in a chamber, ancl it is the explosion which produces the motive power. The .Treasurer has attempted to induce honourable members to vote with him by declaring that these substances are not used for motive purposes. I hope that the Committee will not be under Wales a misapprehension, as is the Treasurer.",23
97,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,If the honourable . member knows better than the experts; of course my statement is wrong.,23
98,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"We very frequently see "" mora"" spirit advertised. That is a naphtha. "" Pratt's Naphtha and Benzine."" which we also see advertised, are used to supply the motive power to motors. "" Mota ""'spirit comes from India, while "" P r at t 's spirit"" comes from America. It is impossible to use either of .them as an illuminant.",23
99,Mr HUME COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"As the duty is not in dispute, why worry about that? Under this proposal the spirit will come in at a lower rate than it woulcl do if these words were taken out.",23
100,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I wish the spirit to be free, because there is no local industry involved. My real reason for rising was to put the honourable member on safer ground than he was induced to take by the statement of the Treasurer that this I spirit was not used as a motive power.",23
101,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"And the honourable member has proved the correctness of my statement. (Robertson) Mr FAIRBAIRN (Fawkner) [3.42]-So much information has been supplied that I find it difficult to readily follow this proposal. I understand, however, that the crude oil used for oil engines will come in under the requested new paragraph ""PP,"" and that if the .proposal be agreed to it will be free.",23
102,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,That is so.,24
103,Mr FAIRBAIRN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"As I desire to ex-' tend some protection to the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, which is carrying on a very important industry in New South Wales, I think I shall be safe in voting for the requested amendment.",24
104,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,The amendment reduces the duty.,24
105,Mr HUME COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Onl y in respect of the spirit.,24
106,Mr FAIRBAIRN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"This is the best that we can do at the present stage. I shall vote for the requested amendment, on the understanding that the oil which is used by farmers and others for engines will be free under the requested new paragraph ""pp.""",24
107,Mr WYNNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Balaclava) [3.44] - I have here a Hand Book on Petroleum, by Captain Thompson and Dr B. Redwood, from which it would appear that the specific gravity of the spirit used for motors is .700. That being so, spirit with a specific gravity of .790 is really a high class oil, used for lighting purposes. It was pointed out. in this work thatThe "" refined o i l "" obtained from American petroleum is of several descriptions, but only two of these, the ordinary American lamp oil of commerce, and what is known as "" water white"" or "" high test"""" o i l , are 'imported into this countrymeaning EnglandThe ordinary oil is usually of a pale straw colour, and has a specific gravity of about .796.. Its flash point is generally not much above the. legal limit of 73 deg. F. (Abel test). liigher grade of oil, of which the average petroleum yields only about 15 or 16 per cent., is colourless, or nearly so, and has a specific gravity of about .788. I assume that very little above that percentage will be imported into Australia. This proposal means, therefore, that under the general Tariff, a duty of | d . per gallon will be imposed on all that class of oil. Modification negatived. Motion agreed to.

I have also other information in regard to the request.

111,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Wentworth) [3.47] - I am not canvassing the merits of the question, but would point out that the Only alteration requested by the Senate is in respect of the duty. It has not made any request in respect of the wording of the item. The Minister proposes to abolish the item as it stands, and to create a new one.",24
112,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"That question, however, has been tested.",24
113,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I believe that the question has been tested, and, therefore, although I do not think that the proposed modification will come within the terms of the Constitution as to the respective powers of the two Houses, I suppose that we shall have to agree to it.

Solar oils, per gallon i d . (L) 2. Crude residual oils, per gallon i d . The Mr DUGALD THOMSON - On a point of crude order, I should like to know, Mr Chairman, whether it is competent for the Treasurer to. move a modification providing for the insertion of the word ""crude""? I hold that the Treasurer's proposal to insert that word will make the item different from that which was considered by the Senate.",24
114,Mr HUME COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Surely it is a modification.,24
115,Mr CARR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Oi l cannot be residual without being crude.,24
116,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Then there is no necessity for the insertion of the word gallon, ""crude."" A proposal in another place to request that that word be inserted, was rejected.",24
117,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"The question raised by the honourable member places me in a rather awkward position, since I have not sufficient technical knowledge to enable me to say whether the addition of the word "" c r u d e "" to the paragraph relating to residual oils would make the item refer to something which did not appear in it as it left this House originally. It is a technical matter, and it is almost impossible for me to say whether the addition of the word ' crude ' ' would alter the meaning of the 1 words ""residual oils.""",24
118,Mr KNOX,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Koovong) [4.52] - As we proceed with the Tariff, we recognise more and more that one needs to be an expert in many matters to be able to deal with it. I understood that the Government intimated its intention of accepting the requested amendment.",25
119,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,No ; we are now proposing a modification dividing the item,25
120,Mr CARR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I wish to press for the acceptance of the request.,25
121,Mr KNOX,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"There might have been some justification for the acceptance of the request, since the item relates to an indus-. try in New South Wales which has established itself on a very broad basis.",25
122,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I do not think, Mr Chairman, that you are f u l ly seized with the actual point of order that I wish to raise. I take this point of order with no ulterior object, but if we are allowed in this case to go beyond the request made by the Senate we may have to do so in connection with other requests. My contention is that if the word "" crude "" does not alter the article described in the item to which it applies, namely, residual oils, there is no occasion to insert it. If it does, then the Minister is proposing to insert in the item something with which the Senate has not dealt.",25
123,Mr GLYNN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I would suggest, on the question of order, that we are not tied to the actual words used in the item. This is not like amending part of a clause in a Bill ; we are dealing with the request of the Senate on a substantive proposal; and if the addition of this word simply provided for solar oil, without residual oil, it would be competent for us to make the addition, because we should be operating on the amendment suggested by the Senate. We can subject solar oil to a duty and exempt residual' oil, but if the effect is to introduce a new proposal, which does not embrace either solar oil or residual oil, it is not competent for us to make the alteration, [388]",25
124,Mr CARR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Do I understand that the question of crude oil, as distinguished from residual oil, is before the Chair ?",25
125,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"l t is quite competent to make any necessary alteration. For instance, if the Treasurer desired, it would be a fair modification to move that one oil should be subject to a duty of i d . , and the other oil subject to a duty of i d . But as to the word "" crude,"" as there has been an objection raised by honourable members who regard it as another item altogether, and as I have no technical knowledge on the subject. I must rule such an amendment out of order.",25
126,Mr CARR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"As I desire to have the suggestion of the Senate tested, it would be as well to know whether that matter will be settled before the Treasurer's amendment is dealt with.",25
127,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"The modification must be dealt .with first, and, if it be rejected, then the honourable member may deal with the original proposal. Is it the pleasure of the Committee that the Treasurer have leave to amend the modification by leaving out the word "" Crude?"" Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear. Modification amended accordingly.",25
128,Mr CARR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Macquarie) [3.59] - The Treasurer has placed it beyond my power to do more than has been indicated by the Chairman; and I must protest against the action of the Minister.,25
129,Mr HUME COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,The honourable member may have an opportunity to do what ho desires.,25
130,Mr CARR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Protectionist s vote for duties in relation to industries that are known to have no prospects of success, and still more do they vote for duties when it is known that an industry will be open to such competition as will regulate prices, apart from any prospective powers we may have in this connection. I may say that, in addition to the one company already established, there are two other companies, who own equally large and rich deposits, and which are prepared to enter into the bus ness as soon as this duty is impf-sed. : This shows that, apart from any administrative power, there will be sufficient competition to insure a check on prices. In 1906, there were imported 187,000 gallons of oil, showing that the facility for dumping has been sufficient to subvert the duty, if any, which has hitherto prevailed. At any rate, this importation shows that the protection, up to the present, has not been sumcient to secure the market to our own people; and I appeal to all protectionists ro vote .with me on this question.",25

I have myself seen contracts for a supply of over 50,000 gallons of New South Wales oils for use in Victoria in connection works. We all know that these various oils are the results of different stages in distillation, solar oil being the third product, and residual oil, of course, a later duct. The honourable member for MACWales quarie, who attaches so much importance to this industry, will act wisely if he cepts the suggestion which has been made. Neither he nor the industry has anything thank the Treasurer for in accepting a sugbe gestion which represents a modification the position I understood to have been definitely agreed upon by the honourable gentleman last night.",26

Mr THOM AS BROW N (Calare) [4.7]- I am glad that it is proposed to divide this item. The honourable member for Maci f my information is correct, has not much to fear from the introduction of foreign residual oils at a low rate. These oils are very crude, and are used mainly for fuel, and I am given to understand that the shale deposits in the honourable member's electorate do not produce that kind of oils, which are a primary necessity in a number of industries, notably, manufacturing industries, where great heat is required. If , therefore, we impose a heavy duty oni residual oils we shall do no great good to the oil industry of New South Wales, and, at the same time, do much injury to a number of other industries. I shall support the proposal of the Government to divide these oils, and I am glad that they are prepared to stand by the original decision of this Committee.

159,Mr HUME COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Does the honourable member suggest that we should adopt than a standard higher than the local production can attain ?  that locally-produced oil which is not. up to the proper standard shall be used? Mr HUME ' COOK - If we adopt too high a standard, our consumers will be at the mercy of the most rapacious trust in existence.",27
160,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Boothby) [4-21] The Minister's proposal seems unlikely to receive enthusiastic support. I was unable to hear his remarks very distinctly; but I gather that it is intended to impose a tax on kerosen;.,27
161,Mr HUME COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,If below a certain flash point.,28
162,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"S t ill , preference is to be given to the oil wells of England.",28
163,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"The proposal to give preference to British oil caps the edifice. I gathered that the Minister desires us to deal with this question, not as a commercial one, but on humanitarian considerations. His proposal is to be regarded as a life-saving provision, intended to prevent persons from being killed by lamp explosions. He mentioned an instance in which a boy had been so killed. But to merely discourage the importation of crude oils",28
164,Mr ARCHER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,It is not crude oils that are concerned.,28
165,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I should say, oils other than those most highly refined. To merely discourage the importation of such oils will not effectively protect the community from such risks, because persons will still be able to use locally-produced oil which is not highly refined.",28
166,Mr HUME COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,They can be probuilding tected by increasing the flash point for poration locally-produced oil. *,28
167,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"If it is intended to do that, the Government should propose selves. an Excise of 6d. per gallon on all oils having a lower flash point than 97 deto grees, manufactured and sold in the , monwealth. If his proposal be prompted by humanitarian motives, obviously that the course which he should adopt. this is really a proposal to levy a tax upon kerosene when it is used as a fuel, l a question of prohibiting the use of kerosene, having a flash point of less than degrees Fahrenheit as a motive power for already engines.",28

169,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"It is not necesprise."" sary to argue the question at length. So many conflicting statements have been made in respect of it, that it is very difficult ascertain the truth. But-we know fectly well that a flash point of not less 100 per cent. than 73 degrees Fahrenheit is the test which has been applied to these oils all over the world. That flash point is practically the universal standard.",28
170,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,The member's statement is not correct.,28
171,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Where has higher standard been adopted?,28
172,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,A higher standard has been adopted here for a very considerable time.,28
173,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I am informed by a large number of persons who use oil engines that the oil which they use as a fuel has a somewhat higher flash point, namely, 83 degrees. If the proposal of the Treasurer be adopted the importation of this oil will be prohibited.",28
174,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Does the honourable member object to the oil being produced in the Commonwealth ?,28
175,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Not in the least. Is it necessary for me to again remind the Treasurer that I did not come here as a prohibitionist ?,28
176,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I do not think that the honourable member came here as a protectionist either.,28
177,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,The Treasurer is at liberty to class me iust where he chooses. But I will not sanction the imposition of a high duty upon oils used by a great many of my constituents. I do not believe in up the Commonwealth Oil CorSir.

I hold, however, that we should not impose a prohibitive duty upon these oils to enable the Commonwealth Oil Corporation to build up a monopoly.",28
184,Mr WATKINS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,What constitutes prohibition ?,29
185,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I regard 6d. per gallon as a prohibitive duty.,29
186,Mr WATKINS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,The honourable member must be aware that in the matter of kerosene a high flash point was recognised in every State prior to Federation.,29
187,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"The honourable member is now referring to the use of kerosene as an illuminant. If there be anything in his contention, he must support the levying, of an Excise duty of 6d. per gallonl upon the locally produced oils which are below the standard.",29
188,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Does the honorThat able member mean an Excise upon the product of the Commonwealth Oil Corporation ?,29
189,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Certainly . I mean an Excise upon all the oil that it sells, which has a lower flash point than 97 degrees Fahrenheit. If that is agreed to there will be something logical and consistent in the honourable member's suggestion. I hope that the Committee will not agree to the proposed modification.",29
190,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Then what consisThat tency would there be between this and next item?,29
191,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"The Treasurer did the Committee. not have the advantage of hearing the remarks made by his colleague, who pointed ness ? out that the flash point test was .raised to 97 degrees Fahrenheit because this oil was sometimes used as an illuminant, although it was dangerous to put it to such a use. He urged that, to prevent its being used as an illuminant, it was cessary to prohibit its importation. If that is the reason for raising the flash test viously an Excise duty of 6d. per gallon should also be imposed, so as to absolutely prevent inferior locally-produced oil being used as an illuminant. But whilst that would mean that only high-class oil would be used for such a purpose, ancl might be an excellent proposal from a humanitarian point of view, we must recognise that, it would involve larger expenditure on the part' of those used these oils. Oils of a lower flash point are now being used, not as illuminants, but for other purposes for which they are not dangerous, and since they are giving great satisfaction they should be allowed to come in as before. Mr TILLEY BROW N (Indi) [4.42] I have not a wide knowledge of this question. The speeches which have been made upon it have not been of much educational value, and as I think that an ounce of practical information is worth a ton weight of theory, I propose to read a letter which I have received from constituents of mine carrying on business at Wangaratta, who apparently have closely followed the consideration of the Tariff by this Parliament. The letter is as followsWangaratta Brick Works, ist April, iqo8. Sir,-On February 27th, 190S, the Senate agreed that kerosene oil be free of duty provided it be of a flash test of not less than 97 degrees Fahrenheit. Kerosene oils which flash at 86 degrees Fahrenheit will be classed under item O i l , n.e.i., dutiable at 6d. per gallon. bears out the statement just made by the honourable member for Bootnby. The writers also sayThese oils are the best for oil engines, and the duty will make them prohibitive, and 73 degrees 1 ahrenheit has been fixed by all authorities as a safe flash test. May .we ask you to use your interest to get the Senate-to recommit the item and amend it to "" Kerosene Oil shall be free, provided it has a flash point of not less than 73 degrees Fahrenheit."" * Yours obediently, FERCUSON BROS. letter, I think, clears up the position. the Messrs. Ferguson Brothers are practical men, and I commend their suggestion to",29
192,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,What is their busi-.,29
193,Mr TILLEY BROWN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"They are in a large way of business as brick manufacturers, and are patentees of the Ferguson dry pressed brick machine. They are bond fide business men, and would not write that newhich they knew to be untrue. I should have placed this letter in the hands of the obTreasurer before if the opportunity had offered, because I like, when I can do so, to keep him on the straight track. If he will amend his proposal in the direction suggested by' my correspondent I am sure that he will give great satisfaction.",29
194,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"The discussion has been somewhat irregular, inasmuch as I have not yet put the requested modificaa tion. When it was submitted I thought it who well to allow the debate to proceed for a few minutes whilst I examined it , and determined whether or not it was in order. I have come to the conclusion that the latter part of the proposed modification will not be in order. I refer to the words11 and on and after 6th May, 1908, Mineral O i l , n.e.i., per gallon (General Taritf), 3d.; (United Kingdom), 2d.""

I do not think that it is expected of the Chairman that he should look up such information for himself. cumstances, I rule that that portion of the modificationwhich I have read would be an entirely, new item, and is therefore out of order.",29
195,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Hume-Trea surer) [4.46] - Before I take the course that I intend to adopt, I want to point out, in reply to the honourable member for Boothby, who said that the flash test had not been over 73 degrees Fahrenheit, that, when I held office as Minister of Trade and Customs, certain representations were made to me in reference to a very large importation of oil by the Standard Oil Company. Sixteen vessels from America came here at different times loaded with kerosene, with which it was proposed to flood the local market. ing on information that I received, I discovered that* the tins or cases of oil .comprising these shipments were not marked as being of a safe flash point. formed that the flash point of 105 degrees close test was the same as the open test of 150 degrees. I therefore held up those consignments until the consignees were able to - mark on the tins and'cases the proper flash point of 150 degrees fire test. ard Oil Company is trying to destroy the development of kerosene oil production in Australia.",30
196,Mr KNOX,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,What was the total quantity of the shipment?,30
197,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I forget for the moment. It is true that 73 degrees Fahrenheit has been the test, but there is a great divergence of opinion on the question of whether or not that is a safe test. There are documents in the Department which show very clearly what strong evidence there is in support of the view that that is not a safe test.",30
198,Mr KNOX,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,When did the shipments arrive to which the honourable member has referred ?,30
199,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"At the end of 1906 and early in 1907. Sixteen vessels carrying large consignments of kerosene for the Standard Oil Company were sent to Australia with the deliberate object of preventing the Commonwealth Oil Company, which is struggling at the present time, from commencing operations.",30
200,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,There is now in force - are Act under which those people can be dealt with.,30
201,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I dealt with them under the Commerce Act,30
202,Mr MCDOUGALL,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Did not representaI n the cirtives of the company say that it was going to buy the Australian Parliament?,30
203,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"No such statement was made to me. I had a long correspondence with the Standard Oil Company, and was informed that, although we had passed an Act under which I might take action, the company would ride through it . I stuck them up, however, and made them do what I required. They complained that my action would cause thero to take the oil back to America. My reply was, "" For Heaven's sake, take it back."" I held up their vessels until they placed on the tins or cases the proper test mark.",30
204,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,The Treasurer did so in the interests of public safety.,30
205,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I did so beActcause it was represented to me that it was necessary in the interests of the public, and because, also, of the divergence of opinion as to whether or not 73 degrees Fahrenheit I was in- is a safe test.",30
206,Mr SAMPSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"If the Minister could deal with those consignments under the Commerce Act, why is it necessary fo insert' in the schedule this condition as to the flash test?  me that the Standard Oil Company's production was the best for motor purposes ?",30
207,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I have been told that it is the .worse.  that it was the best.,30
208,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I did not. Evidently the Senate considered-acting , I suppose, on safe representations-that 97 degrees Fahrenheit was the proper test to insist upon. If this proposal does not interfere with the principle which has been laid down by this House, that kerosene for illuminating purposes shall be free",30
209,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,And for engines-that was the settlement.,30
210,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,No. We determined that kerosene for lighting purposes should be free. The honourable member for Boothby was inclined to sneer st the suggestion that we were able to so develop our resources as to be able to supply - our own requirements in this respect.,30
211,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I said nothing about that.,31
212,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,The honourable - member did. When the honourable member for Newcastle interjected. I regardedwhat the honourable member for Boothby said as a sneer; ancl I do not think it could be taken as anything else.,31
213,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I never said anything of the kind imputed to me.,31
214,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I admit that I oilsometimes become heated, when honourable members, who were returned here for the purpose of supporting protection, turn round, and, because a particular uuty does not suit a State, or a particular part of a State, are utterly careless how they may thwart those who are endeavouring to develop industries of the greatest moment to the future of Australia. An honourable member has told us that this company has spent £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 without the inducement of any protection. But if the company did spend that amount, it was with the idea of prospective protection; and I think that shareholders ought to have some return for the investment of so large a sum, if the investment were bond iide. I hope to do all I can. at any time, to help an industry which, so far as the possibilities of - the present and the immediate future are concerned, has not a very bright outlook, in consequence of the undue competition of foreigners in the Australian market. If we are to succumb, because it so happens that a few people in a particular district or State, use oil, then, of course, we must .abandon the protective policy which has been decided upon by the people of Australia. I feel that I am called upon at this particular stage to draw attention to the votes of some honourable members, who might justly be expected to suPDOrt a protective policy, buf who are drifting away into another channel, because certain duties mav not suit a particular corner of some particular State. I hope that this parochial and un-Australian spirit, which is exhibited in some particular cases, will receive no encouragement.",31
215,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"We had the same spirit displayed during, the consideration of the first Tariff",31
216,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Quite so; and I think that the vote on the duty on salt was the most parochial ever given in this House. While not interfering with the decision of the Committee in regard to kerosene, I appeal to honourable members to support me in my present proposal, in order to further the development of a great industry in Australia - There is also the fact that the use of bad oil entails the sacrifice of many human lives. ",31
217,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"If the honourable member will follow the record of deaths due to. the bursting .of kerosene lamps, whiGh have been filled with bad  one case? Sir WILLIAM LYNE,-There have been hundreds of cases. M i . PAGE - How many people die from drinking water?",31
218,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"They ought to follow my example, and put something in the water.",31
219,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Does this danger attach only to imported oils?,31
220,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"At the present time, yes.  Excise duty on inferior local oils that are liable to explode.",31
221,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"If local' oils were produced of a quality dangerous to human life, I should not only propose an Excise duty, but their absolute prohibition.  importation of certain patent medicines? Sir WILLIAMLYN ' E - I did my best to introduce a law to that end; and had I remained at the head of that particular t Department, such a law would have been passed. .1 can assure the honourable member that I was not to be frightened by people outside, who threatened all sorts of pains and penalties, if spurious medicines were not admitted into the Commonwealth. In my opinion such medicines are a curse. However, all that is beside the point; what I desire to say is that there should be some definite action regarding the flash point. If any action we take is incidentally .protective, while not in any way upsetting our decision in regard to kerosene, there is no reason why we should not deal with the matter in that way. In every case where honourable members fry to get behind their protectionistc principles, they ought to be exposed. As the Chairman has ruled the latter part of the amendment - which , I may say, is a very important part-ou t of order, I move That the further consideration of the requested amendment on item 234, paragraphs O and F, be postponed until a later hour this evening.",31

224,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"No , but I desire to have a vote in a full House, especially in view of the fact that the Chairman's ruling was unexpected.",32

229,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Wentworth) [ 5 . 5 ] - I must protest against the language used by the Treasurer in reference to a very important and prosperous New South Wales company - the Commonwealth Oil Company. The honourable gentlemani has stated that the prospects of this company are not too surer bright.,32

247,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I intend later on to. draw attention to one or two instances, in addition to several to which the attention of honourable members has already been directed. I assume that the only reason for the postponement is that the Treasurer has not the necessary numbers present; and, in the meantime, I suppose there will be an urgent whip, with possibly a fresh set of pioposals, having the object of securing the power of prohibition by Ministerial regulation, or some other means of defeating the \\\\\ of Parliament regarding free kerosene. The Minister has been urging us to expedite the disposal of the T a r if f ; and to that end a number of honourable members on this side have refrained from speaking.  from Queensland at the request of those of my constituents who use oil engines, to oppose a duty on the oil which they have to buy.

I am ready now to vote against his proposal, but I may not be here this evening, owing to an engagement which I cannot postpone. I have known a debate to be continued for some time, in order to secure a satisfactory division, but I have never known a postponement to be asked for by a Ministry on the ground that it wished for time to bring its supporters into the chamber.

If we took a vote now, the ma- joritv would be against the postponement of the request.

295,Mr HARPER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Mernda) [5.40] - I wish to say a word or two regarding the duty levied upon linseed oil. For years past, not only has this oil been produced in Australia, but the linseed has been grown here - The Victorian Government for some years offered a bonus on the production of flax and linseed. The industry of linseed production has been introduced, and I believe that both in Sydney and Melbourne there are factories which express the oil. This proposal is a very ingenious way of securing the free introduction of linseed oil, which is imported only to be mixed with paints. Those who make up liquid paints use imported oiL",36
296,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,It is scarcely fair that they should have to pay a duty amounting to 4s. 6d. in respect of the oil used in every 1 cwt. of paint made by them.,36
297,Mr HARPER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"That may be a reason for raising the duty under this item, but the proposal to which objection was taken yesterday seems an extraordinary one. I refer to the request in regard to item I l recognised the existence of the industry of oil production in Australia, because it proposed that linseed when denaturated, as prescribed by departmental by-laws, should be freeProvided that, in the opinion of the Minister, sufficient linseed of l for manufacturing purposes is not produced in Australia. That was a most absurd proposition.",36
298,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,I took it to mean that there was really no production.,36
299,Mr HARPER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"As a matter of fact, linseed oil is being produced in Australia. As I have said, the Victorian Government has spent a considerable amount of public money in an effort to encourage the growth of the plant, and its production is increasing, not only in Victoria, but I believe in New South Wales, certain parts of which are well suited to its cultivation.",36
300,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I was misled by that proposal, because it is foolish if the oil is produced here.",36
301,Mr HARPER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"That is so. Linseed oil is denaturated only by mixing it with paint. The provision seems to be an ingenious device to get rid of an import duty. One of the difficulties in regard to the establishment of oil production in Australia is that, by a curious development, the oil for which the plant originally was chiefly grown, has now become a residuary product. The demand for oil cake for feeding purposes in Europe is so great, and the price is consequently so high, that the oil itself is being produced very cheaply, not only there, but in India. It is brought here at a very low rate, and the progressof the industry of oil production in Australia has thus been retarded. The imported oil is cheap, because the producers are now paid a very high price for what was formerly a by-product. That illustrates the difficulty of dealing with this question. There is no doubt that linseed oil has been subjected to a very low duty, and that fact, together with its cheap production abroad, has made it difficult to establish the industry here. Nevertheless, it is being carried pn in Victoria as well as in New South Wales, and it would be a mistake to agree to this extraordinary provision, to which, by the way, I object on other grounds.",36
302,Mr BATCHELOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,The manufacture of paint cannot be carried on without it.,36

312,Mr HUTCHISON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Can the honourable meinber name any painter or any manufacturer of paint who is satisfied with Australian linseed oil for paint-making purposes? At one time it was the custom to allow linseed - oil to come in free when mixed with whiting, and there is no reason why that practice should not be continued. We want to be sure that the oil has been denaturated in such a way that it cannot be used for any other purpose than the manufacture of paint. It is not necessary that it should be mixed with whiting. I should have no objection to a proposal that paint in which free oil was used should be manufactured in bond - by the House",37

This Parliament does not propose to give the local manufacturers any relief in that respect.

The users of paint might as well say that Australian paint cannot be employed with, success, and that the duty on paint ought to be removed.

Sir,-Wit h respect to linseed o i l , the Senate has made a request to the House of Representatives that linseed oil, when denaturated as prescribed by departmental by-law, be admitted free, provided that, in the opinion of the Minister, sufficient linseed oil for manufacturing purposes is not produced in Australia. It is presumed that this request, if accepted of Representatives, will satisfv your wishes in the matter. duty That shows that the Comptroller-General is satisfied that it would be fair to allow the old custom to continue. It is rather surprising that the honourable member for North Sydney has not received from the paint manufacturers a request to support its continuance. It may perhaps have escaped their attention.",37
319,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,In the circular I have mentioned they estimate their totai cost on the supposition that they pay full duty on linseed oil.,37
320,Mr HUTCHISON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"In the circular that I have received on the subject a calculation is made on the same basis, and it .shows that both manufacturers of paint and of putty will have no protection if they have to pay duty on linseed oil - I for one should be satisfied if . in the meantime, we agreed to what has been the old practice The honourable member for North Sydney has not shown the Committee that the paint manufacturers are using the locallymade linseed o i l ; and I think thaf if he I made inquiries he would find that they are doing nothing of the kind.",37

323,Mr HARPER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Mernda) [5.56] - The honourable member for North Sydney is quite misrepresenting the position. Oil, as good as any in the world, is produced in Australia, but very little of it up to the present time, and the reason is that the duty of 6d. does not counterbalance the greater advantages in Calcutta and elsewhere in oil expression, owing to' the fact that we have not the same market for the by-products. The oil that is made here is, so far as I have ever heard, preferred in Victoria and elsewhere, as, at any rate, quite equal to the imported article for the making of paint, putty, or any other kindred commodities. It is recognised that there is a production of oil here, because a stipulation is made for a sufficient production. But who is to say what is sufficient? Surely we ought to give' some encouragement to the production of an article on the production of which a bonus has been offered. There can be no use for linseed unless its oil is expressed j and that, of course, means an oil-producingindustry.

When this item was originally before this Committee, the honourable member for Parramatta pointed out tnat the Government proposal meant an increase in the duty of 225 per cent.; and, while he did not profess to know much about colours, he protested against an absurd increase of the kind, and moved that the duty be reduced from 3s. 3d. to 2s. That amount was negatived, but immediately afterwards the honourable member for Gwydir moved that the ""duties be reduced from 3s. 3d. and 3s. to 2s. 6d. and 2s., and that amendment was agreed to,and was, therefore, practically accepted by the Government, and became in essence a Government proposal. Now, however, we have the Treasurer asking us to reverse a vote to which he, on behalf of the Government, agreed on a previous occasion. When is this sort of thing going to end? How long are we going to overlook and acquiesce in these breaches of faith, and to regard them as, if not meritorious, at least permissible on the part of the honourable gentleman? We are becoming absolutely demoralized, and the time has arrived when we 'ought to make a protest.

If honourable members believe that by imposing the duty requested they will bring about the local manufacture of these articles, they are labouring under a misapprehension, because the statements'of those who are most familiar with ihe details of the trade show that that is impossible. I trust that the Treasurer will either take time to consider this question, or will refuse to accede to the request of the Sena'.e.",40
344,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Robertson) [7.53] - I wish to point out that fibro cement is used for many purposes, bo.h in our cities and in the country. Amongst other things, it is used for making silos. The value of silos is now generally recognised, ancl the only reason why more of them are not erected is their excessive cost. A silo to carry 100 tons of ensilage will cost anything from j £ to o to j£ts°> DU t in its construction fibro cement be used, it can be erected for a very much smaller sum. A framework of wood lined with fibro cement makes an excellent silo. would further point out that, on account of its extreme lightness,' the cost of conveying fibro cement to the back blocks is very small indeed. This article can also be employed for roofing purposes in lieu of slate. It makes an excellent roof, as an exhibit at the recent Agricultural Show, Sydney, demonstrated. I have read testimonials as to its value from, quite a number of persons in responsible positions. They declare that it answers all ' requirements. It is very warm; it is fireproof; and does all that is claimed for it by the manufacturers. The Senate' requests an increase of 20 per cent, in the duty which was placed upon fibro cement under the Tariff as it left this House. ister should give some reason for his proposal to agree t'o the increased duty. - should be prepared to accept as a compromise a proposal to omit fibro cement slabs from this request, so that they would remain dutiable at 15 per cent, under item 247. This is an 'age of compromise, and when one has to deal with a maiority, one must be content with a compromise.",41
345,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Hume- Treasurer) [7.57]--The reasons that have been supplied to me in support of this requested amendment are thai the addition to the wording of the item was made because all the materials indicated by these additional words mav be manufactured in Australia just as are other manufactures of asbestos.,41
346,Mr ATKINSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Fibr o cement sheets are notmanufactured here.,41
347,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I am informed that they are, but have no personal knowledge on the subject. I have seen asbestos produced in sheets, a third of the size of this table, at Ilfracombe, in Tasmania, just inside the heads at George Town.",41
348,Mr HEDGES,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Absurd . Asbestos is not found in sheets.,41
349,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Then I shall say that I have seen layer after layer of asbestos brought to the surface at I l f r acombe, where a company was carrying on. operations some years ago. I am also informed that the requested amendment of (he wording is necessary to avoid confusion, and trouble in classification, owing to the presence of fibro cement in item247. It if was intended that manufactures of fibro cement, such as slabs and roofing tiles, should be dutiable at the same rate as other tiles, but the specific reference to I fibro cement in item 247 confuses that intention, ancl makes it very doubtful. M.r. JOHNSON - Who says that that was our intention ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE The officers of « the Department who were present and heard thedebate.",41
350,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"They have made a mis' Sir WILLIAM LYNE - It is useless for me to supply this information to honourable members opposite. When I do so, they almost invariably dispute its accuracy.",41
351,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Surely we can see by a reference to the Tariff itself what was our intention.,41
352,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"There is a The Min- discrepancy between this item and the next, and it is very difficult to distinguish beI tween the two for the purposes of Customs classification. It is therefore proposed to bring this into line with the next item. Since the honourable member for Fremantle doubts my statement in reference to the local production, of asbestos, I shall only say that he needs a little more education on the subject.",41
353,Mr ATKINSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Wilmot) [8.2] - The difficulty might be partially overcome if the Treasurer would modify the request by omitting from the proposed additional wording the word "" slabs,"" leaving, slabs of fibro cement dutiable at 15 pei cent, under item 247. I have it on good authority that fibro cement sheets are not made here. They are imported, and a good deal of work is involved in cutting and preparing them for use in Australia. To accept this request, so far as fibro cement slabs are - concerned, would be to inflict a hardship on users of that material, whilst at the same time restricting employment in the Commonwealth. I hope the Treasurer will agree to my suggestion.",41
354,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"North Sydney) [8.4] - The Treasurer has read a statement to the effect that it was intended that all these materials should be subject to the same duty. As a matter of fact, it was not. The item as originally introduced was amended, and the intention was that fibro cement, being anarticle not manufactured here, according to the information at' our disposal, should be admitted at 15 per cent., as it is largelv used in rural districts for erecting structures which, if built with .other material, would be f ar more costly. It is used, as the honourable member for Robertson has pointed out, in the construction of silos, and enables such structures to be erected at small cost. It is easily distinguishable from any other preparation, and a duty of 15 per cent, would be a considerable protection in respect of it . I therefore ask the Treasurer to stand by the decision at which we previously arrived. I do not know whether asbestos cement is made here, but I ; do know that asbestos is produced in Australia. I propose to move",42
355,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Do not move anytiles thing at present.,42
356,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Ver y well ; I should prefer the Minister to take action. My suggestion is that fibro cement slabs sliould remain at the lower duty of 15 per cent.,42
357,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"East Sydney) [8.7] - I think that a fair compromise would be to remove fibro cement slabs from the requested amendment, leaving them dutiable under the next item at 15' per cent. These sheets are cut up when they arrive here, and in that way a good deal of employment is given. Fibro cement is a building material of great value. It is not made in Australia, and its importation extends employment in the Commonwealth. leave fibro cement tiles subject to the higher rate, and simply take fibro cement slabs out of the requested amendment, so that they will lie dutiable at 15 per cent., that will be a very fair oompromise. We shall then be able to settle the question of whether or not this duty should be increased by 5 per cent. Our original intention is quite clear. Under the Tariff as originally passed by us, the duty of 30per cent, was applied only to roofing tiles, flooring tiles, and tiles n.e.i., whilst a duty of 15 per cent, was imposed on fibro cement.",42
358,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Hume-Trea surer) [8.9] - I had prepared a modification of the request in regard to the word"" ""slabs,"" and also in regard to the request for the omission of fibro cement from the next item. I propose to add after the words"" fibro cement,"" in the next item, the letters "" n.e.i."" I desire, M.r. Chairman, to amend my motionby proposing, as a modification of the request, that the words ""and slabs"" be left out. Motion amended accordingly.",42
359,Mr HEDGES,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Fremantle) [8.10] - I should like to call the attention of the Committee to the following extract from the article in the Encydo-padia Britannica on asbestosAsbestos consists of fine crystalline elasticfibres, witli a silky lustre. . ."" . Woven into. cloth it fomis a fireproof texture.' That, I think, bears out the statement. I made that asbestos is a silky fibrous material, which is not found in sheets. If it be wished to put asbestos into sheets or slabs, it has to go through a process of mixture with some other material and cement, and be subject to pressure. People who were importing roofing and flooring complained of the competition of tiles made of fibrous cement and asbestos cement; and if the amendment as proposed by the Treasurer be carried it will place all upon the same footing. This material is coming into use now; and I have seen a building composed of it piled up with wood and set on fire, with the result that it still retained its shape. Motion agreed tr>. Requested amendment, as modified, made. - Motion (by Mr HUME COOK) proposed - That the requested amendment, making the duty (General Tariff), 35 per cent., be mads.",42
360,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"East Sydney) [8.14] - I suggest that the duty might fairly be left If we at 30 per cent. When we consider that later pn, glassware, including smelling and perfume bottles, is subject to a duty, of only 25 per cent., it does not seem at all reasonable to make the duty on building materials' 10 per cent, higher. '- Mr JOHNS ON (Lang) [8.15] - I think that we might retain the original duty, in view of the fact that these particular tiles are coming largely into use in the erection of buildings. A duty of 30 per cent, is very high, and, unless there be some special reason for the increase, the Committee ought to resist the Senate's suggestion.",42
361,Mr HUME COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Bourke-Honorar y Minister) [8.16] - When this item was discussed in the Senate the chief object in making the increase was to give greater preference to Great Britain. It was pointed out that these articles are mostly imported from foreign countries, and though preference might have been extended by reducing the duties that would have conflicted with other items such as those which immediately follow. It is a very small increase when all is said and done.",43
362,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Then I think the Government might give way, seeing that we are supporting the duty originally proposed by the Government.",43
363,Mr HUME COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I think there is some strength in the argument that importations from foreign countries are greater than they ought to be.

364,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Will the Minister ' explain why the Government is departing from its original position in regard to this item, and proposing to agree to the Senate's request? Sir'WILLIAM LY.NE - Because the articles which it is proposed to leave out are being 20 made in"" three or four places in Australia. 25 Mr HUTCHISON (Hindmarsh) [8.29]. --When this item was being dealt with before, I pointed out that one of the largest bottle-making firms in South Australia- a good protectionist firm-ha s to import crucibles from the Old Country,' because it cannot get here such as aire ' suitable .for its requirements. It pays £14. for each of these crucibles, although f.o.b. one costs only £ 4 . Crucibles are made in my own electorate, but not the sort to which I refer. The locally-made crucibles will not stand the work required in bottle-making. The firm in question would be the first to use locally-made crucibles if they would serve, because they are being.made not far from its own premises.",43
365,Mr WILSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,The honourable member's remarks apply also to scorifiers and muffles ?,43
366,Mr HUTCHISON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I believe so. One of the leading glass-bottle manufacturers in Melbourne, who has also a business in South Australia, but does not use these crucibles, assures me that they have to be imported. That should be sufficient proof that they cannot be made here. Firebricks are made in Victoria and elsewhere, but the locally-made bricks are good only for certain purposes. Some time ago I saw a furnace under construction at South Melbourne, which was to be used for experiments in steel making, and they were sending to Scotland for the firebricks required. Similarly, it is necessary to send to the Old Country for the crucibles I have spoken of, which I am informed are made only in Glamorganshire.",43
367,Mr FRAZER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Kalgoorlie) [8.32] - I am at a loss to know why the Government wish to make crucibles, scorifiers, and muffles dutiable. When the item was last under discussion it was demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that the crucibles, muffles, and scorifiers in use in all the Government analytical departments, and in all the laboratories of the Commonwealth, have been imported. For such technical work as assaying,"" locally-made crucibles are useless.",44
368,Mr WILSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,'Crucible s can be made ' anywhere that there is clav.,44
369,Mr FRAZER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Yes ; but the material needed to make crucibles for important work has not yet been found in Australia. If these articles are made dutiable, they will have to be imported none the less. The Minister will be better advised if he considers the scientific needs of Australia in this matter. - Mr HEDGES (Fremantle) [8.34] The opinion of the chief mining men of Kalgoorlie on this question is of interest, and in a letter which I have received from the general secretary to the Chamber of Mines of Western Australia, the writer saysLocally-made crucibles vary in quality on account of the clay being unsuitable, and are thus very unreliable, and are little used. The Battersea (Morgans) crucibles are imported, and used very extensively. In Western Australia the crucibles of German manufacture have the preference because they are more durable even than the Battersea, the latter, as a rule, can only be used for one charge, whilst the German crucibles are invariably used four or five times. I have been told by a gentleman who is, I think, the leading metallurgist in Australia, that local crucibles are uneven in quality, and absorb a large part of the charge, so that the results cannot be depended on. As thousands of pounds are sometimes invested in a mine on the results of"" an assay of an ore sample, it is necessary that the crucihles used should be absolutely reliable. I hope that the Committee will not make the requested amendment.",44
370,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"East Sydney) [8.36] Surely if roasting dishes, which can be made in Australia-the Treasurer has been on them two or three times today-ar e to be admitted free, crucibles, scorifiers, End muffles should be similarly treated. I doubt if the enlightened intelligence of the Ministry can tell us what muffles are. On behalf of the mining industry, I appeal to the Committee to oppose the Senate's request. Motion negatived.

371,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Dallev) [8.37] - The largest glassware manufacturers in the Commonwealth are in the Dalley electorate, and I ask the Government why Ministers think that smelling and perfume bottles, glass stoppers, and fruit-jar caps can be made here, but that glass-bottle marbles cannot ? Why is it proposed to agree to the Senate's request?",44
372,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Because glass-bottle marbles are not made in Fitzroy.,44
373,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"They may not be made on the banks of the Yarra. but may be made in other parts of the Commonwealth. The protection given tr> the local manufacturers of glassware is only 25 ancl 20 Der cent., rates' of duty which are very low compared with some which have been imposed for the benefit of other industries. Those connected with the two large glassware factories in mv district have not asked me to support duties for their protection. Indeed, it is to the credit of New South Wales industries generally that they have not canvassed the Committee for assistance.",44

' Is it unprofitable to make them ? In the absenceof anv explanation. I shall vote for retaining the item in the form in which it left this Chamber. Air. HUTCHISON (Hindmarsh) [8.40]. - I would point out to the honourable member for Dalley that there is no difficultywhatever in making, glass bottle marbles. But it .would not pay more than one company to erect the necessary machinery for their manufacture. Consequently the whole of the glass bottle manufacturers would be entirely dependent upon one firm for the supply of glass bottle marbles.'",44
376,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Coul d marbles be manufactured incidentally to other glass bottle making?,45
377,Mr HUTCHISON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,In other countries these marbles are made by special firms.,45
378,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Is the honourable member in favour of allowing, these marbles to be "" dumped ' ' into the Commonwealth ?",45
379,Mr HUTCHISON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I am not in favour of the smaller glass bottle makers being made entirely dependent upon one large firm in the Commonwealth for the supply of glass bottle marbles. I would further point out that one firm could not compete successfully with similar establishments in other parts of the-world.. Consequently. I believe that we ought to allow our glass bottle manufacturers to obtain their marbles in the cheapest market - For this reason, I hope the Committee will agree to the request of the Senate.",45
380,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Parramatta) [8.42.] - I should like to know from the honourable member for Hindmarsh whether it is, not possible for ordinary glass bottle manufacturers to make these marbles ? The honourable member spoke of a firm exclusively devoting itself to their manufacture. Is that really necessary ? Mr H UTCHI SON - No . The are made by machinery.",45
381,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Why could not that machinery Ine an incidental part of a large glass bottle manufactory? It is very strange that whilst we can make bottles in any quantity, and of almost any quality, we are not able to' manufacture marbles in the same factories.",45
382,Mr SPENCE,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Darling) [8.45] - Upon other occasions, the Government have accepted increases of duty with great eagerness, but in the present instance they are willing to' place glass bottle marbles upon the free list, notwithstanding that the free trade members of the Committee desire aduty to be imposed upon them. I really thiiik that the Government ought to five way to the Opposition. The Treasurer ought to encourage its members to assist him in framing the Tariff upon good protectionist lines.",45
383,Mr WILKS,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Dalley) [8.47] - I am getting very tired of these old free-trade arguments. During the course of the Tariff debates, we have heard a great deal about the consumer. But may I ask, "" Where does the consumer of glass bottle marbles come in ? "" The honourable member for not the Hindmarsh stated that one of his reasons for assenting to the request of the Senate is that these marbles can be produced in enormous quantities in the 'Old Countrv. That statement might, with equal reason, have beeiii made in respect of every item in the Tariff schedule. It mi.'rht have been urged in regard to locks, and yet the honourable member voted for a 20 per cent, duty upon them. He further stated that only one firm would be .required to manufacture these marbles. Need I remind him that only one firm, employing four men, is engaged in the Commonwealth, in the manufacture of locks? It is strange that honourable members"" should be such great protectionists only when an industry is located in their own electorates. In the electoral division of Dalley there are two glass companies-the Federal Glass Company and the Co-operative Glass Company-bot h very fine firms indeed. The r employees number over 300. : When the Tariff was before us on a previous occasion, I voted to extend to them a protection of 25 per cent, under the general Tariff, and of 20 per cent, under the Tariff - for the United Kingdom. I cannot understand why a great protectionist like the Treasurer-and such - an ardent lever of New South Wales industriesmarbles should baulk at the manufacture of glass bottle marbles. If we can make glassware in the Commonwealth, why cannot we manufacture these marbles? I utterly fail to see why this industry should be penalized more than is any other industry.",45
384,Mr HUTCHISON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Hindmarsh) [8.51]. - It is quite idle for any honourable member to urge that we cannot make glass bottle marbles in Australia. As a matter .of fact, it is the simplest thing i h the world to manufacture them. But if we retain the duty upon these articles, they will still continue to be imported, because one firm at Home can manufacture in a few hours, sufficient marbles for the requirements of the Commonwealth for a year. That is why I support the request of the Senate. Motion agreed to. Requested amendment made. Item 253.

395,Mr SINCLAIR,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I am well aware of - the industry. I believe I am correct in saying that the graduated necks of thesf. test tubes are imported, and that the only- work done in respect of them in the Queensland factory is that of adding bottoms to the tubes. As one who has had practical, experience of these tubes, I say that the annealing of the Austrawork does not correspond with that done abroad, and that consequently when the locally-made tubes are subjected to a very high temperature, as they often are, they break. Even if this duty be imposed, as requested, tubes used for testing cream : and milk in the majority of cases will still imported. The other articles included the item.are manufactured in Australia, Rebut we have not yet been able to properly anneal the glass bottoms to these tubes. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [9.0]. - My information is somewhat difof ferent from that of the honourable member forMoreton. I have had an opportunity to visit the factory where all these articles Vat are made, and have seen the graduated being done there. All the apparatus for such work is installed in the factory, and I know that, comparatively speaking, a large number of these test tubes are being made in Brisbane, and used with satisfactory results in the dairying industry. If they were not satisfactory they would not have the sales they command. The honourable member for Moreton is an expert in . dairying matters, and if any of these tubes have ever failed him I am inclined to think, on the principle that one swallow does not make a summer, that he has been unfortunate in having purchased a defective one. Defective work is occasionally turned out.by even the best manufacturers. It may be taken for granted, however, that if the work of the Brisbane factory were not on the whole thoroughly satisfactory, it would not command the business which it now does. These tubes are used not only by dairymen, but by brewers and others. I have here a statement from the manufacturers to the effect that all the articles mentioned in this item, and proposed to be struck out, are made by them, and give perfect satisfaction. The .regulations relating to their manufacture in Queensland might' well be adopted in every State. These are very stringent in regard to the Government inspection and mark ng of all these instruments. Before they leave the factory they have to be approved by a highly qualified officer of the Department of Agriculture, who, on passing them, stamps them accordingly. The regulations required that on a certain date- I think that it was 31st December, 1906-al l instruments of a similar character in use in dairies in Queensland should be submitted to the Govern-' ment official to whom I have referred, and if approved by him stamped with the Government mark. It may therefore be ,aid with perfect truth that every one of these instruments in use in dairies in Queensland has been approved, and bears the Government stamp.",46
396,Mr WILSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Does the Government official issuethe "" Kew "" certificate with eacn instrument ?",47
397,Colonel FOXTON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,Thes e are not instruments which require that certificate.,47
398,Mr WILSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,What about eudiometers ancl nitrometers ?,47
399,Colonel FOXTON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I do not know that the "" K e w "" certificate' should be given with them. The manufacturers point out that many of these instruments are part of the necessary riant of a large number of industries, and are no more difficult to manufacture than are the engines used in those industries. As the manufacturers pioperly say, a great many of the instruments which they have to use are also dutiable, and it is only fair that this struggling industry should receive its fair measure of protection. They inform me that - if the proposed protection be granted, they intend to extend, their operations lo Sydney and Melbourne, and probably to Adelaide, io that the industry will cease to be an essentially Queensland one. It is within their knowledge that there is in Australia a large 'number of men thoroughly competent to make these instruments, who, owing to the limited extent of the industry here, are unable to obtain employment, except in directions outside the work for which they have been specially trained. I sincerely trust that in these circumstances the Committee will see fit to concede this measure of protection.",47
400,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Lang) [ . ] . _ l f 9 7 m y memory serves me rightly, this item was originally considered in this House during ar. all-night sitting, and the honourable member for Corangamite then made a most informative speech.

It is quite possible to cheaply and effectively denaturate low test kerosene so that it may be perfectly adapted for use in oil engines, and, at the same time, unsuitable for burning in illuminating lamps. The denaturation would not affect the fuel (heating or calorific value) of the oil detrimentally, on the other hand, the denaturation would be so carried out as to slightly raise the calorific value of the low-test kerosene.

There never was a law passed yet which did not interfere with the interests of somebody. It has been recognised for years that, a low standard is bad, and that it is necessary to protect the public, first against dangerous oil, and, secondly, against inferior oil sold at the price of good oil. .

It has been stated that such oil may occasionally be used for with dangerous consequences; of but I know that when the proprietors of oil the Fairy Mead Sugar Mill, in Bundaberg, tried it for the sake of economy, an they found, not that it was dangerous, but that it gave a very poor light, and its use No one who some was not exceedingly ignorant would use it in preference to the ordinary illuminating oils, which are properly advertised, and can be easily distinguished from it. Even if people were foolish enough to use' it, they would run no risk, the general expert opinion being that a lamp which is dangerous if oil having a flash point of 73 degrees is used in it, would also be dangerous if oil of a higher flash point were used in it .",54
491,Mr KELLY,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"As a matter of fact, the o i l in lamps is heated to a much highjer' temperature.",55
492,Mr ARCHER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Yes . The standard in - Great Britain is a flash point of 73 degrees, and while one American standard is 100 degrees, the test is made in such a way that it is only the equivalent of 73 degrees in the Abel-Pensky close cup test. most of the States of America, and in every other country in the world, the standard is 73 .degrees or less. not object to a standard of 83 degrees, our position being that oil having a flash point of 86 degrees or more should be admitted free. The honourable member for Macquarie says that this oil is not so good for motive purposes; but the following unsolicited letter from a Mr Wrench, a butcher in Childers, and a. user of an oil engine, puts a different complexion on the matter.

Mr CARR,-- I have' been informed that the regular quotation is 8d.",55
493,Mr ARCHER,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"That is the wholesale price in bulk at the ship's side; is not the price at which consumers Sydney. in Central Queensland can purchase. My information is supplied by a person who uses oil engines. of the proposal before the Committee is to force these persons to buy a dearer though less serviceable oil, to the advantage of .the British Imperial or CommonwealthOil Company. Sir Frederick Abel, an acknowledged authority of world-wide repute, whose opinion is to be taken even before Mr Wilkinson's, stated in an official report presented to the Imperial Government after a prolonged and exhaustive experimental inquiryThere are not, in my judgment, any well established grounds for considering that the preIn sent' flashing point of 73 degrees, Abel, is not calculated to alford adequate protection to the public. We should Mr HUME COOK - The flash point fixed by a recent conference of experts in America is 83 degrees.",55

Mr Hake, the Chief In spector of Explosives, and Chemical A d viser to the Department of Defence, reported in 1904 that oil having a flash point - of 70 degrees is perfectly safe, and the Government adopted that as the standard.

499,Mr SALMON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"Naturally . orable member for Capricornia has also made an address of a similar character. His whole argument was that the proposal of the Treasurer would impose a prohibition upon those who were using kerosene of l for industrial purposes, and would result disastrously to them and to their industry. He carefully avoided any reference to the proposal of the Government to secure safety to the public without adding a single penny to the cost of the oil to the consumer.",56

The secretary of the conference, however, went further, and said that 86 degrees was the lowest really safe flash point. It was also pointed out that climatic conditions had to be taken into consideration. Now, the mean temperature of Germany is.far lower than that of Australia, and more especially of Queensland.",56

524,Mr SALMON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I do not want to give a monopoly to any company. The most contradictory statements have been made in regard to this matter. I hold no brief for any party. I am simply trying to protect the public. I have, however, Been driven almost to distraction by the varying statements made by those interested. been assured on the one hand that if we carry the proposal of the Treasurer it means the complete obliteration of the British Imperial Oil Company, and also of the local company. On the other hand, I have been assured by authorities just as competent that the Treasurer's proposal would secure a virtual monppoly for the local producer.",57
525,Mr ATKINSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,The Standard Oil Company would get a monopoly if the Treasurer's suggestion were carried.,57
526,Mr SALMON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I am not prepared to take any notice of any of these statements.' I am proceeding on the broad principle that we should protect the public in two respects: first,. from danger to life, limb, and property, and secondly from fraud. I say that an oil which is imported to Australia for something like 6d. per gallon, and which is sold for lighting purposes, is not safe to use; and in my opinion we should not allow it to tie imported for that purpose. cognise that the oil engine is becoming generally used, especially in the country districts. These engine's are frequently under the control of inexpert persons who do not really know the danger they run. I do not wish to deprive the users of oil engines of cheap fuel. The proposal of the Treasurer will permit a cheap fuel to be admitted free of duty, but it would h i admitted in such a way as to be easilv recognised .from the oil .which could [389] be used safely for lighting purposes. If the company which is importing this f u el were prepared to place upon its tins an intimation of the purposes for which the oil was to be used, I should be satisfied.

I have Mr SALMON - The honourable member Cor North Sydney stated specifically that we could not expect the company to put up their oil in a different fashion for Australia as compared with other countries.,57
531,Mr JOHNSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,He said that it could not be done without increasing the cost to the consumer.,57
532,Mr SALMON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"I have a perfect recollection of what took place. I heard the honourable member say more than, once that we could not expect the company to put uptbeir oil in a different fashion for Australia. In fact, he said they would not doso.",57
533,Mr ATKINSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,That was in referenceto denaturating the oil. It bad nothing to uo with the label on the tins.,57
534,Mr SALMON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,The honourable member should remember that no one has suggested that the denaturating should take place outside Australia.,57

537,Mr REID,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"No . The honourable member misunderstands my suggestion. There is no expense in putting a' label, on the tin. That does not require tbem to put up the oil separately.",57
538,Mr SALMON,POST ANDTELEGRAPH,"The honourable memmerely ber does not realise how the tins are marked. They are all embossed, and, if therefore, - as he knows, cannot be tampered with. A label can be easily removed. M.r. REID - I would not ask them cur that expense.",58

We have the authority of a competent analyst - and I take leave to say that. there is no more competent man in Australia than Mr. Wilkinson to express an opinion on this subject-no t only that it can be cheaply and effectually done, but that the heatgiving power will be increased. surely is an answer to the argument which has been used. Those who say that if we carry this proposal' the user of oil engines will be placed at a disadvantage, must be able to see that the slight disadvantage in any infinftesimal increase in the priceand I do not think there will be any increase because the tendency is to fall rather than to rise-wil l be more than counterbalanced by the .greater safetv to the lives and property . of people.

He said' that it was not likely that they iwould put up a special number of tins in that way for. Australia. He did not refer to the marking of the'tins. That is a very good suggestion, and one which seems to be feasible. Like most honourable members, I have read. ,1 great deal on this subject, during the last week or two. The letters and articles which I read were so contradictory that I do not feel competent to offer an opinion.
