Will he consider the advisability of having' a survey made of the depression in question, with a view to determining its extent and the point at which its sea-level contour approaches nearest to . the sea, in. order that those studying the matter may have authentic data to work upon ? Sir WILLIAM ' LYNE - - The answers . to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The matter has been under consideration. - 2. As far as it possibly can, viz., Lake Torrens is a vast inland salt lake, from 35 to 170 miles Spencer's Gulf, with on average breadth of 20 miles, and .about 80 feet above. sea level. Lake Eyre is a large salt basin, about 120 miles long by 40 mileB wide, 35 feet below sea level, north of and divided front Lake Torrens by a ' range of hills. I luive applied to the South Australian Governinserted menb for any information tliey have, and ascertain as near us possible the length of ting and cost for carrying out the project. 'A. At present this cannot be made, but may so at some future date.

Upon whioh Mr KINGSTON had moved by way of amendmentThafc allfchewords after the word ""schedule,"" line 7, be omitted.",15
6,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," I am glad to have an opportunity to deal with this measure before the combonuses mittee comes to a final decision in regard it. For the histfifteen rather weaiy months we have been watching the legislative of my friends opposite; bufc the series gyrations connected with the measure now before us is unprecedented even in this ParAs liament. A Bill was introduced for the specific purpose of encouraging the manufacbonuses ture of iron in Australia from Australian ore by private individuals; but in committee an amendment was moved which said that under no circumstaaices should private dividuals receive the encouragement proGovernmenb posed. When the ostensible purpose of ports a Bill is practically nullified in way, the only course open to an honorindustry able Ministry is to throw it under the the table. But in connection with this Bill veiy peculiar action has been taken. The Govei'nment, instead of throwing under the table, have made inquiries from the different State Governments to ascertain if they will be good enough to accept a of £250,000 for the creation of the industry. They have all replied that they wish to have nothing to do with such an undertaking, and are unwilling to receive the money. Now, therefore, the Bill is brought before us again, and the Governtion menb ask us to excise the proviso which was 42 D in clause 3 when it was originally to taken into committee. But we are not told, cutwhether the Government - will stand or fall by be bheir proposal. They intimate to the House by their action that they are of opinion that private individuals and not the States should be entrusted with the establishment of the BILL. iron industry in Australia. But if the amendment of the Minister for Trade and Custom is defeated, will they still go on with the Bill, and send to the Senate a measure, the provisions of which fchey disapprove which We have a right to know whether our bonuses affairs are being administered under a, comsystem of responsible government or whein ther Ministers are to be regarded simply as sefca committee appointed to record the votes barof the majority. If the Minisbry have a unless policy they should stand or fall by ib. I by a desire bo know whebher, in the event of bheir proposal upon recommittal being defeated, the Governmenb will go on wibh the Bill ? We have . a righb to look for an answer bo thab question. No two principles could be more diametrically opposed those involved in granting bonuses toprivate individuals and in the offering of with a view to a State Government to carrying on an industry. If the Government, like some doctors who believe in antics bwo kinds of quackery, bell us that of we can pay our money and bake our choice, they will be degrading Parliamenb, a f ree-brader I am absolutely opposed bo. the bonus sysbem, bub I would rabher givebo private individuals, wibh whom we could deal afterwards, than offer them, in order bo assisb in the creation of a great State monopoly. Such a monopoly could innot be interfered wibh. Either the Federal would have fco shut oub all imby means of high protective duties, or that the State Government carrying on the would be compelled to so reduce price of ibs products as bo practically bax its own people in order to prevent competition. If the iron industry were it established as a State monopoly, and ib were exposed bo outside competition, the State would have to crawl to the Federal bribe Parliamenb again and again, and ask that iron the duty might be increased until it reached the prohibitive point, or make its own people supply any deficiency created, by the sale of the goods under cosfc price. One of the great principles of our constituis that which gives the Federal Government power, with the consenb of the States, to take over more and more of the States services. For instance, with the consent of the States, we have the right to take over the railways, and we might also, assume the control of their funded debts. But, in adopting the proposal to grant bonuses for the establishment of the iron industry by a State Government, we should be reversing this wholesome principle. It is proposed that £250,000 should be granted by - us in order to create a new service in one of the States. There is no authority in the - Constitution to justify us in granting money for the purpose, of creating a State industry over which we should have no - control.",16
7,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,.The honourable member - admits that we have the right to grant a bonus to a private individual.,17
8,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Yes; because we could control it to some extent in that case. A private individual would cany on the industry only as long as it paid, and he would bear any loss that might be incurred, but we should have no - control over the business if we once handed it over to a State Government. If the iron industry were established as a State concern in New South Wales, it might be conducted under conditions that would render it impossible to enter upon the same business in any other part of Australia; but there is no reason why we should with Commonwealth money foster an industry of that kind against the principle of equality of trade. I would point out to honourable members who hold free-trade views, that this policy of granting bonuses is associated with a scheme for the imposition of ad valorem duties. Some honourable members believe in bonuses pure and simple, but the policy of the Government is that the moment the iron industry has been established as the result of the bonus system, heavy ad - valorem duties shall be imposed fco keep it in existence. Therefore, I warn honourable members who profess free-trade principles, that thej' would not be voting for bonuses pure and simple, but for bonuses coupled with protective duties of a, highly objectionable, cliaracter. I hope the committee will reverse the vote previously recorded. was then generally understood that the States would have cheerfully acquiesced in the proposal. We are now, however, dealing with this question in the .'light of the fact fchafc the States will have nothing to do with it at present. The Government have in this matter displayed very bad judgment. Why should we have been called upon to waste week after week in the discussion of proposals which were not embodied in the Government policy, and for which there is no urgent need? When the Prime Minister issued his manifesto, the principle he enunciated was "" revenue without destruction."" The Tariff was to be framed primarily for the purposes of obtaining revenue, but ifcs incidences were to be such that they would not harshly interfere with existing industries. Our State finances are still in such a position that no man can thoroughly understand them, and yet the Government ask us to vote £250,000 for the purpose, not of maintaining a struggling industry, but to encourage the establishment of an absolutely new enterprise. The proposal is untimely, and should, on this account alone, be rejected. What right have we, until we know how our finances will stand, to vote £250,000 away-whic h will involve the raising of revenue to the extent of £1,000,000? Where is the money to come from? We might be committing ourselves to an expenditure which would seriously cripple our finances. It has been strongly urged on the one hand that we should dispense with loans, and endeavour to construct necessary public works out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and yet, at the same time, the Government propose fco give away £25.0,000 to establish an industry which, in spite of all bonuses, may prove a rank failure. We have no right to adopt either the original or the amended proposal. Apparently we have no responsible government here. I have asked the Minister for Trade and Customs if he intends to stand or fall by the proposed amendment, but I can get no answer. Are we to be told that the Government, if defeated, will pass the Bill even in an emasculated form ? If so, Ministers will not be discharging their duties according to the first principles of political honour. Are they prepared to father in another Chamber a measure of which thej' do not approve 1 If they do not disapprove of it , why should they seek to recommit it 1 As I have said, I am entirely opposed to the bonus sj'stem It in any form, and especialfy to bonuses of which certain Tariff arrangements are the complement. Further, I am strongly averse to any attempt to introduce a system of socialism which makes an enormous departure from the main principles of the Constitution. This proposal was not before the country at the last general election, and I - do not believe it would be favoured by the majority of the people. Mr. CONROY (Werriwa) - I think the position taken by the honourable member for Wentworth is a sound one. It might be urged by some honourable members that it is useless to seek for any promise from the - Government, because it would be impossible to rely upon them for any length of time. First of all they introduced a Bill which was intended to assist in the estabUshment of the iron industry by means of private enterprise. The committee, however, amended the Bill so as to provide that bonuses should be offered to State Governments only. This was a complete reversal of the Government policy, but Ministers led honourable members to believe that the alteration was just what they desired, and they cheerfully adopted it. Now they have changed front - once more, and are asking honourable members to upset the work already done. Is not that a wonderful position for any Ministry to assume ? Should the purpose of the Government in recommitting this Bill be defeated, do they intend to resign? Do they propose to stake their official existence upon the result of their action ? Anybody who knows the in knows that in their vocabulary the word "" Bill e t "" is spelt very differently from the word "" Bill,"" and consequently will not suspect them of cntertaining any such serious intention. If they are defeated upon their present proposal, we shall still find the in hanging on to their billets. Perhaps, we may even witness the spectacle of the Minister for Trade and Customs rising to declare that, despite what has happened, the Government are quite prepared to swallow whatever the committee choose to .present to them. Many reasons were given by the acting leader of the Opposition why honourable members should vote against the amendment. Having considered the matter very carefully, I cannot see my way to abandon the position which I previously took up in this connection. I have consistently opposed the bonus principle. I oppose its application to private individuals upon the ground that we have no light to assist any class at the expense-of the rest of the community. Oh the other hand I claim that no State is in need of the pecuniary help which we should afford it by the passing of this Bill. The least powerful of them is quite able to struggle along without any such aid. My 42 n 2 object in voting as I did upon a previous occasion was to insure that private individuals should not receive this artificial encouragement. The more I study the mattei' the more I am convinced that, owing to the very scant deposits of iron ore throughout the Commonwealth, this is an industry which should be controlled by the State. Evidently if it were placed in the hands of one or two private individuals it would be sure to develop into a monopoly. The same arguments which apply to the State ownership of railways are equally applicable to the State control of the iron industry. Honourable members should recollect that there are not more than one or two big deposits of iron throughout the Commonwealth.",17
9,Mr MACDOXALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,PATERSON - There are many more than that.,18
10,Mr CONROY,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"There are not many deposits of true commercial value. After closely examining the matter from all points of view, it seems to me highly undesirable that any private monopoly should be created in connection with the production of iron, and therefore I do not intend t c reverse my previous vote. That vote was given for the express purpose of. defeating this Bill. My imagination did not then depict the depths to which the Ministry are prepared to descend. I did not realise that, though the ""whole purport of the measure might be changed, they would still be prepared to accept it as their own. I never dreamed that Ministers would be ready to proceed with the Bill in a form absolutely different from that in which it was introduced. I should like to know how any honourable member who supports ""the clause as it stands can, at a later stage, turn round and say- "" I voted in favour of granting a bonus to the States for the production of iron, but, because that proposal was defeated, I am now prepared to offer the same encouragement to private individuals."" I shall vote for the amendment; but, liaving done so, it will be impossible for me subsequently to favour granting a bonus to private individuals. The Ministry seem to be pushing this measure forward without rhyme or reason. Originally they fixed the date upon which it should come into operation as the 1st July of this year. That date has now passed, and because the Government saw that it was otherwise impossible to get the Bill through the House, they have given a reluctant assurance that if it be carried they will possibly allow a day or two to elapse before they make it operative by proclamation. The object of providing for its enforcement thus early is to prevent people in other parts of the world from knowing that any encouragement is to be offered to private enterprise to engage in the production of iron. This knowledge will thus be confined to one or two firms who happen to be acquainted with what is transpiring here. The Minister for Trade and Customs has affirmed that he is almost certain that one or two firms will embark upon the undertaking. As he has seen the prospectus which they have issued, I should be glad if he would inform honourable members of the estimated cost of production as it is set down in that document. That information has been, carefully concealed from us. It has only to be pointed out to the Minister that there are one or two individuals who are prepared to engage in this enterprise, and he immediately becomes alert and eager to push any measure through this Chamber.",18
11,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I wonder if there is a second man in the committee who would make that statement 1,19
12,Mr CONROY,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,A good many think it .,19
13,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I do not believe that there is one who thinks it , including the honourable and learned member himself.",19
14,Mr CONROY,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,^There are hundreds and thousands who believe it . Has the Minister ever shown any consideration for the thousands of people who have been ruined through the drought ?,19
15,The CHAIRMAN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I must insist upon the honourable and learned member confining his remarks to the question before the Chair. He must know that he is travelling altogether beyond the standing - orders.,19
16,Mr CONROY,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I submit that for the purposes of comparison it is perfectly petent for me to show that if this Bill be carried, the bonuses payable Tinder it will be appropriated by. one or two firms only. I was pointing out that no man is consistent in declaring that he is in favour of granting a bonus for the production of iron to the States exclusively, and afterwards affirming that he is willing to grant the same encouragement to a particular - individual or set of individuals. Minister for Trade and Customs himself made one declaration upon this point ou Friday last. Having affirmed that he is in favour of granting a bonus to the States, which is equivalent to collecting money from the people and handing it back to them, how can he consistently declare that his words had no reference to the people of Austraha, but were limited to the. members of a particular syndicate? These are the people of whom the Minister was thinking, and so far as language goes, seeing that there are probably more than one in the syndicate, he may be perfectly right in speaking of "" people."" But the Minister did not say from how many people the money had to be taken, and the. passing of this Bill will make the taking of the money none the less robbery. Wherever I find robbery, legal or otherwise, I shall denounce it, because I am against all injustice and oppression. The pity is that we too often find men who are skilled in the law using their abilities, not to uplift, but to degrade the people; and there is no doubt that the intent in the present instance is. to take from the whole of the commumity in order to give to individuals. I should be swerving from my duty if I did not oppose such a proposal, and I intend to fight this Bill at every step. I shall vote against the amendment proposed by the Government, and for the Bill as it now stands; and I trust that maijy honourable members intend to do likewise, so that we may have the pleasure of seeing what the Government will do in the event of a defeat. None but a prophet can tell what action the Government, may take under the circumstances, because they seem to be guided by no principles of honour or reason. Past Ministries in Australia, in case of a defeat.of the kind, would have resigned, but from the faeing-both-ways attitude assumed by the Government we know that, whatever may happen, they will ' say that that was their exact intention all along. It behoves honourable members to vote steadily com- for the Bill as now presented, if only to keep Ministers to their professions in favour of such a measure. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - It is my misfortune, so far as concerns this Bill, to differ from several of the party with whom I act. I do not, however, differ ' from all of the free-trade party, because a considerable number are, like myself, in The favour of bonuses and. against duties on iron - I should like to give the committee the benefit of the opinion of the community of Launceston, which is, perhaps, the most free-trade in Australia. During the federal elections another free-trader and myself addressed, at the Albert Hall, Launceston, a packed audience of 2,000 or more, and, at the same time, an opposition meeting was held around the corner, the chairman of which said he considered himself fortunate in having fourteen people present. The Chamber of Commerce, Launceston, has forwarded to me the following resolution :That this Chamber is clearly of opinion that any bonus granted hy the Federal Parliament sliould be to stimulate private enterprise, and uot for State monopoly. A copy to be forwarded to the Honourable C. C. Kingston and eaeh of Tasmania's representatives in both Houses, and to solicit their support and interest to give effect the views expressed.",19
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,That is not a tion in favour of bonuses-j?er se.,20
18,Sir EDWARDBRADDON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"It is a declaration, indirectly, of a desire to see bonuses granted to private enterprises, and not to the States. I ask the labour party where is the sense in excluding from amongst us capital absolutely necessary for carrying on enterprises by means of which an enormous amount of labour will be employed ?",20
19,Mr FOWLER,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"We are not capital, but trying to exiclude the capitalist.",20
20,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,We cannot do without the capitalist when we want his capital.,20
21,Mr FOWLEK,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,We do not capital; there is sufficient capital in the country.,20
22,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The labour party desire, above all, to encourage such enterprises as will furnish a large portion of the community witli the means of support, and it is short-sighted on their part to decry and discourage the introduction of capital which we all desire, and without which a great many industries would not have been flourishing amongst us today.",20
23,Mr GLYNN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," This subject has been; exhaustively discussed,, honourable members having, entered upon an elaboration of detail on the two former occasions when the Bil l was before us,- and I shall do no more now than make a few remarks on the questionimmediately before us. Owing to having to leave the House earlier than I expected, I had no opportunity of hearing the speech of the Minister for Trade and Customs last week, but on looking through the remarks which the honourable gentleman then made, I confess - I cannot, place very much reliance on the Canadian statistics as published in the Year Book of Canada. The Minister made a strong point by comparing the returns of 1900 with the returns of 1901, but I do not think that one line of figures, which forms the basis of the Minister's argument, is very trustworthy. As to production the Minister will, I think, acknowledge that the statistics from 1SS4 down to 18S9 or 1900 do not indicate the success of the bonus systeni.",20
24,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I thought the figures for 1900' very encouraging, and the later figures much more so.",20
25,Mr GLYNN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"But the Ministeimust to acknowledge that there was a tremendous declension of exports between 1885, the declarayear in which bonuses first became operative, and 1900. A shrinkage of exports from 35,000 tons to 6,000 tons does not indicate success.",20
26,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I did not bother about the export figures.,20
27,Mr GLYNN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I wish to bother about all the figures, without which the sum total may not be complete.",20
28,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The last figures, quoted excluding by no less an authority than the honourable member for Melbourne, show that 66,000 tons of pig-iron have been exported from Canada in the. first eight months of the present financial year. want his Mr Glynn - Surely the Minister must acknowledge that it is a very lame argument to rely on the comparison of two years in order to maintain the position - he has taken up in regard to bonuses-to compare the years 1900 and -1901, when the figures from 1885 to 1900 show his case to be a bad one. If there be a cause in existence for twelve or thirteen .years for the non-production of successful results, and the statistics show good, results in one year only, there must be some unknown factor to explain the apparent success of that one. year. If bonuses were in existence from 1884to-1900, and the statistics indicate failure, then the apparent success in 1900. must be dueto some other cause or causes. And we need not go very far to find the cause. The Minister, in his second speech on the bonus proposals a few weeks ago, stated that within the last five or six years there had been an investment of about 50,000,000 dollars in Canada in the production of pig-iron.",20
29,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I did not say that.,21
30,Mr GLYNN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The Minister said that five companies had been formed in the last live or six years with a capital of 50,000,000 dollars.",21
31,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I said that 50,000.000 dollars was put as the total investment in Canada, looking a little ahead; and the honourable member will find that to be the now. case.",21
32,Mr GLYNN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I think the Minister must have taken his information second-hand from the Year Book.,21
33,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Yes , I did ; and shown that the investment increased from 25,000,000 dollars to 35,000,000, and then to 50,000,000 dollars.",21
34,Mr GLYNN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"It is stated in the Year Book that within five or six years the total investment will approximate to 50,000,000 dollars.",21
35,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"It does not say that 50,000,000 dollars will be invested at the commencement of that period ; the amount is then set down at from 25,000,000 to 35,000,000 dollars. . Mr Glynn - The enormous increase production has been since 1895.",21
36,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The honourable learned member ought to read the whole for 1900 at 583,000 dollars. paragraph in the Yea/r Book.",21
37,Mr GLYNN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"It is too .much to ask me to inflict the whole quotation on the committee. The Year Book states that cause during the year 1895large deposits of chromic first of which is utterly unreliable. iron were found in Coleraine, in the - vince of Quebec, the ore averaging over 50 per cent, of metal, the 'quality of which said to be equal to that of the metal found in Sweden. It is since then that there has been an enormous increase in the invested capital, and the indication is that this increase has been brought about by the take the stand in the beginning-and more profuse exhibition of nature's bounty, and not by the miserable percentage of profits represented by the bonus. The William MCMillan-that production of-pig iron in Canada in 1884 was 29,000 tons, and 34,000 tons in 1900.",21
38,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The total local production in Canada is 102,000 tons. . Mr Glynn - The Minister appeals to us to encourage local production from local ores.",21
39,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,And it is local ore Canada.,21
40,Mr GLYNN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The Minister's idea seems to be that ore taken from an adjoining State or province not in the Dominion is nevertheless Canadian. I suppose the Minister regards geographical proximity as bringing an adjoining province within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, seeing that the great bulk of the ore comes from Newfoundland.",21
41,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,That is not the fact,21
42,Mr GLYNN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"As I said before, it is very strange that the Minister should rely on the figures for one year in disproof of the statistics for about twelve years. In it is 1884 there were 29,000 tons, and in 1900, 34,000 tons. These figures do not indicate a success. The Minister says that in 1901 there were 99,000 tons. But evidently that increase is explained, not by the operation of the bounty, but by the enormous investment of American capital. If the Minister looks at the figures, he will also see that we cannot depend upon the 34,000 tons for the year 1900. Por this reason : I find that in the table given as to the total production of iron ore in Canada in 1900 the figures are put down as 35,000tons odd. In 1S99 the total is given as of 74,000 tons odd. But the value in 1S99, for nearly, double the quantity, is put and down at 240,000 dollars, and the value Surely there must be some, mistake in the figures; and, if so, the Minister's comparison between 1900 and 1901 is valueless, be- , it is based upon a set of figures the I canpronot see that there is any way out of this difficulty except the explanation that there is is a huge mistake in the figures. Un luckily, I cannot check them, because the 1 Statistical Register for 1901 is not procurable. As to the general question of the granting of bonuses to assist industries, I I am glad that it has been again mentioned by the acting leader of the Opposition, Sir a law which can be taken advantage of only by a particular person is undoubtedly ultra vires.",21
43,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I do not think the acting leader of the Opposition said that.,21
44,Mr GLYNN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I state that first. I say also, in regard to the bonus policy of the Government, that a State itself is an indiin vidual. A State, in respect to our fiscal policy, has no relation to the Federal Parliament. We must frame a general law which can be taken advantage of by a State or by an individual. Surely if this Parliament frames a law under which a bonus can be given to a particular firm-o r we will say to six firms, one in each of the different States-that would be ultra vires of the constitution ; because it would be granting a preference to particular persons as against others. It would not be an uniform law. Similarly, if this Parliament frames a law which can be taken advantage of only by a State-whio h is really an individual in regard to our policy-it must be a violation of at least the spirit of the Constitution and probably also of the letter of it. I , fore, think that it is a mistake for those who have advocated the payment of bounties to States, to insist upon that policy. It may be a logical policy to prevent monopolies, but it is unconstitutional, and is open to the possibility of a great amount of political pressure from the States. Some State representatives will be trying to strengthen themselves relatively by comparing themselves with the .Federal Parliament and federal politicians ; and it will be found in the future that some State politicians will be standing on the ground of the pressure they are likely to bring to bear upon federal members, with a view of getting this bounty system extended for the benefit of the States. That is a vicious element to introduce into our policy, in addition to its unconstitutionality. Besides, we are not compelled to aid the States in this way. If a State wants to give a bounty to a particular industry, it can ask permission from the Federal Parliament to grant that bounty.",21
45,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,-Apply for financial relief.,22
46,Mr GLYNN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Oh , no; if a State desires to give a bounty to an industry it can do so with the permission of the Federal Parliament. And it is a far more equitable course for a State like Tasmania-so well represented by my right honourable friend, Sir Edward Braddon-for the Legislature of such a State to grant a bonus to one of its own industries, if it wishes to do so. If the policy is a good one, we shall be glad to see it result in benefit to Tasmania ; aud, if it is a bad one, the other States will not have to pay for an experiment which can benefit only Tasmania.",22
47,Mr BRUCE SMITH,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," I had intended some weeks ago, when this measure was discussed in the House, to say something in regard to its general principles. But I was too late for the second reading debate, and then I supposed that I had missed my opportunity.. This occasion gives me' another chance to say a few words on the general principles affecting the measure. It appears tome, in the first place, that the question is very much complicated by the situation which has been brought about in consequence of the amendment carried at the instance of the honourable member for Bland. Because, I take it, that if the amendment now proposed by the Minister for Trade and thereCustoms be carried, we shall then have the Bill before us in the position in which it originally stood, so that every honourable member will have the opportunity to say "" yes "" or "" no "" to the general principle of granting bonuses to private firms or companies.",22
48,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,The Bill will then apply either to a State or to companies.,22
49,Mr BRUCE SMITH,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The right honourable gentleman has nob very clearly announced his inbenbion bo the committee. I undersbood the acting leader - of the Opposition bo say bhat he thought the Minister might have made the position of the Government clearer-. I am bound to say from what I have' heard of the right honourable gentleman's statements this afternoon, that I am not aware of what course he proposes to take, supposing that his amendment is negatived. Because that would leave the Bill as it is now, and the Minister would be bound either to take it as it stands or to abandon it altogether. Which course he proposes to bake the committee does not know. If we did know, it would lead to a clearerand I might say a more honesb-expressio n of views wibh regard to the question. It has been suggesbed to me-and I mention it to show whafc a complicated position the question is in-that , although, as a free trader, I am opposed to all forms of bonuses, if I were to vote for the retention of the clause as it sbands, including the amendment moved by the leader of the labour party, it would be the most effective way of killing the Bill. But that course would require me to put myself in the position of voting foi a form of State socialism which .1 utterly disapprove of , and although I might protect myself by stating that I was doing this for the purpose of more effectually killing the .Bill, yet, at some future time, I should be open to have this vote brought up against me-probably without an opportunity of stilting to those who so accused me of voting against my principles that I had explained my purpose to be a matter of mere party tactics. Therefore, I have made up my mind to vote against the proposal inserted in the Bill enabling the Government to pay bonuses to the States ; and I shall give my reasons for that course.",22
50,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,The honourable learned member will vote for the amendment ?,23
51,Mr BRUCE SMITH,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I sh ill vote for the proposal of the Minister, bnt not because I am anxious to help hini. He knows that. He knows that my object is to negative a more objectionable proposal than the one he has put into the Bill. Because I would infinitely rather see a bonus paid to private individuals than see - one granted to a State ; for the reason that the granting of bonuses to States appears to me to open up an avenue for the worse form of political corruption, both in the working of a grear, enterprise of the kind proposed, and in creating a sort of channel through which unprincipled politicians could work all sorts of political purposes, by enlarging upon it and making it a sort of outlet for helping the employed and other classes who might assist them politically. But the question is not to be decided by figures such as have been mentioned by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn. Prom the free-trade point of view, it cannot matter what has been the result of Canadian experiments. From that point of view, a bonus to private individuals is as objectionable, on principle, as bonuses to States. The only thing we have to consider here, as free-traders, is whether iron is a commodity upon which we may fairly collect revenue for the purposes of the Commonwealth and of the States-whethe r it should not be included in the ordinary category of commodities upon which we have to collect from £8,500,000 to £9,000,000? My direct ""purpose, then--whic h may be pursued in an indirect way-is to try to kill the Bill altogether, because I say, in the first place, that it is distinctty opposed to free-trade principles. Bub I also say that it is opposed to the policy of the Government themselves, for the reason that, as the acting leader of the Opposition has pointed out, the policy laid down by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth at Maitland was this- "" We do not intend to protect industries; we ""are going to collect revenue."" But we never heard a word at Maitland a'bout the Government collecting a million of money more than was wanted for the Commonwealth and the States, in ordei to devote £250,000 out of that million to paying bonuses either to the ancl Sbabes or bo privabe individuals. Honourable members musb recognise that every pound that is wanted for the purposes of this policy must be collected through the Customs, and it can be obtained only by collecbing £ 4 in order bo geb the £ 1 . Therefore, if in the fubure the revenue of the Commonwealth does not show a surplus as it has done in the past, an extra million must be raised from Customs in order to get the £250,000. And for what ? Not bo prevenb the desbrucbion of industries, but to create entirely new industries in the Commonwealth. Has, bhat policy ever been foreshadowed by the Prime Minister, either at Maitland or elsewhere ? Honourable members will recollect what an amusing difficulty the right honourable gentleman at the head of the Customs department experienced when, during his speech upon, the Tariff, he was endeavouring to prove to the House that the object of the Government was really to collect revenue, and how now and then the truth came out of him and we found him warming up to the subject of protection. But the part he was playing, whateverhe might have felt or might have desired, was this"" We are merely seeking revenue by means of tin's Tariff."" There is a complete reversal of that principle, because the Government are not merely seeking revenue, but they are deliberately taking four times the amount involved by bhis Bill out o£ revenue, and taxing, the people to the extent of another- £1,000,000, in order to obtain £250,000 to give a-way bo assisb certain individuals or certain States to embark upon a particular industry. Why one industry more than anobher no one knows. The Sbate, as it appears to me, has no particular association or identification with the iron industry any more than it has with the timber industry. But we are asked, in the first place, to reverse the policy of the Government.",23
52,Mr HUGHES,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"What is their policy? Mr BRUC E SMITH - Thei r announced policy is to gefc revenue through the CusCommonwealtli, toms, but their actual policy now appears to be to spend revenue as it is collected through the Customs, and to diminish the quantity of revenue obtained for the legiticular timate purposes announced by the Prime Minister. I am opposed to the State bonuses. I am opposed. to private bonuses, but, all free-traders under present conditions the Commonwealth, I am prepared to fine down, I will not say my free-trade principles, but my free-trade actions, in order that we dustry in that State. may get enough revenue to carry out the work we have to do in the first ten years the Commonwealth's history. We all know that at the end of thab ten years we shall have an opportunity of fighting but this issue, without this revenue question divert us, on the true principle of "" yes "" "" no ""-free-trad e or protection. But, the meantime, we recognise that, although we are uot called upon to sacrifice principles, we have to adapt our actions the exigencies of the situation. The tion is, how can a free-trader most effectually get rid of both these proposals, the one give a bonus to a State, and the other to give a bonus to individuals,, and leave the whole measure one for getting revenue 1 It must be by getting, rid of the Bill altogether, because by so doing we shall avoid the necessity for collecting £1,000,000 of money bhrough the Customs. My objection bo the State bonus is this :-Firs t of all, in my judigment, it is contrary to the spirib of the Constitution, because the Constitution actually conbemother plates that the States themselves shall give bonuses. Can it be said foi a momnent that when the Constitution provides that a State may be empowered und'er certain! conditions to give bonuses to industries within its territoiy it was intended that the Commonrailways wealtli should give a bonus to a States sioners Why was it contemplated that a State might give a bonus, to an industry within its own territory? Because it was recognised that inasmuch as the State in which fchafc industry was earried on. would benefit against the other States by its establishof ment, therefore the cost of carrying should fall upon that particular State. Therefore the Constitution provided that ! of that, if any industry were to be started and [ maintained in any particular State the money which was required bo give it this artificial support should come out of the funds of that State. Is it not a complete contradiction of that principle to ask the consisting, of six States, to put it * hands inbo ibs pockets and take from them a sum of money sufficient to artificially assist an industry in a parState ? No one doubts for a moment that there is only ome State of any importance in which this industry is likely to like be established om any large scale. I am in quite aware that the Tasmanian people are sanguine enough to expect that fchis may lead to the establishment of a very large inI do not propose to argue against the possibilities of Tasmania, of but every one knows that there is no State so well adapted to the furtherance of this industry as New South Wales. What follows ? It follows that this means that the to people of New South Wales are to be or assisted in the development of this indusin try at the expense of every other Stabe in the Gomoionwealth. It is a our very great pity bhat we have not into existence at the present time the Federal quesCourt, which we have required for many months past, in order that a. question of this to kind might be decided at a very early date in its. existence. I feel satisfied that under section 91 of the Constitution not only is the question arguable, buifcthab bhere are sbrong probabilities that a Federal Court would prevent the diversion of Commonwealbh moneys, coming, out of the revenues of the six States, bo amy particular Sbate forbhe encouiragemenb of an indusbry within the tef ribory of bhat State. But I have objectionsto a State bonus, many of which apply to private bonuses, though to a State bonus particularly. We are all too 1 well awai-e of the. effectsresulting from putting any enterprise into the hands of a own State. We know that in thehistory of our until the institution of commissolved the difficulty-if it did solve the difficulty-the y have been a means of enabling, politicians to put their friends by tens, hundreds, and thousands, into the public service of the country. We know as that whenever anything in. the nature a private enterprise has come into it on the hands of a Govei'nment, the result has been the same. In the face and in the face of the experience of all the States with their rail, ways, some honourable members are now pre' pared to endorse a proposal to put into the 1 hands of a State an industry to which there - can be no limit. Parliament has some control over a railway, but it cannot be doubted for a moment that the experience of all countries in the world is thut the State cannot work an industry as cheaply as can private enterprise. If the State undertook this enterprise, politicians would be putting hundreds of people into the industry at a minimum wage irrespective of the amount of work done for that wage, and when in time it was discovered that the industry was involving the State in loss, the State would then request the Commonwealth to increase the import duty upon the commodity, in order to enable it to compete with a similar commodity coming from other parts of the world. Under this proposal we shall really be creating what will be one of the most and most troublesome institutions in the Commonwealth. Upon these grounds I certainly object to this bonus being given to any particular State. Moreover, the States have declined to take up the industry. standing the tempting invitation which has been offered""to the different States Governments by the Ministry, I think I am right in saying that not one of them has intimated any desire to take this function upon themselves. Seeing that in the Constitution the States had had reserved to them the right to give bonuses themselves, I have no doubt that they were very much astonished-if they had not carefully followed the course of events in this House-to find that it was actually proposed to give them bonuses to carry on State industries. Turning to the question of a bonus to private I have another sort of criticism to offer. My criticism of bonuses to private industry is this : that even from the point of view of the protectionists, the proposal is premature. Wc must remember that it was only in January of last year that, for the first time in the history of Australia, the whole of this Commonwealth was offered as a market to this particular prise. We know that for years past attempts have been made in New South Wales to open np this industry. Ministries there have been approached in order that a contract might be offered for a very large supply of railway iron, and whenever the persons interested have been told by free trade Ministers that this enterprise stand upon its own merits, they have always replied in these terms-"" We are shut out of Victoria by their Tariff. We are shut out of Queensland and South Australia and Mr Bruce Smith-. every other State in which railway iron is required for State railways."" Bnt in January of last year the whole situation was altered, because by the introduction of Inter-State free-trade the whole of Australia with its population of 4,000,000 became a market for the enterprise.",23
53,Mr A MCLEAN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I do not think that Victoria charged a duty upon railway iron. Parliament Mr KENNEDY - There was no duty on rails in Victoria.,25
54,Mr THOMAS,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Surely no Government imposed such a duty!,25
55,Mr BRUC ESMITH,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"It was said so. That was the answer given by Mr Mitchell, dangerous who, as' many New Soutli Wales members know, was endeavouring to start the industry in that State. His answer was that he was shut out of the other States and had only the limited market of New South Notwith- Wales.",25
56,Mr A MCLEAN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,He had not read his Tariff.,25
57,Mr BRUCE SMITH,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"It may interest honourable members to know that, when I had the honour of filling the position of Minister of Works in New South Wales, Mr Mitchell, representing a very large iron industry, approached the Government and made this practical proposal. He pointed out that when the Government bought their railway iron in England, they had to pay shipping charges, insurance, and the cost of cartage of the railway iron to the particular industry, part of the State in which it was required. He made the suggestion that the Government should undertake to buy from a prospective company 150,000 tons of railway iron afc a price equivalent to the English cost, with shipping, insurance, and cartage charges added. The Government considered the proposal and offered to do what was asked. Mr Mitchell took some time to conentersider the matter, and he actually went to England for the purpose. The answer then came to the Government that, if they would give the company a 10 per cent, advantage, they would accept the contract and startfcheindustry in New South Wales. It ended in nothing, but it satisfied me that there is no necessity for a bonus at all. must As the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Treasurer are aware, there was a firm or syndicate in existence many months ago, dealing with the New South Wales Government, who were prepared to take a contract for the railway iron required for the New South Wales railways upon much better terms than those now proposed by giving them a bonus. Seeing that it is admitted that in New South Wales there are very large iron deposits, and an unlimited quantity of coal, and seeing that only about eighteen months have elapsed since the market of the whole of Australia was thrown open to this industry, it is certainly premature that the Commonwealth Parliament should now be asked to tax the people of the Commonwealth to the extent of £1,000,000 in order to give this artificial support to an industry which we have no reason to suppose will not come into existence by natural means in a reasonable time. On free trade principles, therefore, I . am opposed to bonuses to private enterprise, and I am also opposed to bonuse| to States. The question is-How can I , as an individual, effect my purpose best? As I have already said, it has been suggested to me as a member of the free-trade party that, by voting against the Government on this particular proposal to rescind the amendment of the labour party, the Bill would be made so objectionable, from the Government point of view, that Ministers would abandon it . If the Minister in charge of the Bill had told 'the committee that such was the case, I should have voted dead against it ; but inasmuch as it appears to me that the Minister is prepared to act either way in order that he may get his Bill for a bonus, or get some enactment within the very general order of leave which he has at the head of the measure-sinc e it seems to me that he is willing to take either a State bonus or a private bonus, I think I shall effect my purpose best by voting with him in order to rescind the proposal for a State bonus, and retain the hope that, when the general - bonus to private individuals again comes before the committee, I shall have an opportunity of negativing that, also. I shall vote with the right honourable gentleman who has moved the rescission of this amendment, not to help him. but with a view to defeating his Bill.,",25
58,Mr HENBYWILLIS,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Robertson)!When this question was before honourable members some months since, in the form of Division YLv. of the Tariff, I delivered a speech in which I endeavoured to show that this particular industry required no protection whatever, and that consequent^' I should not think of voting in favour of a bonus. For many years past I have had opportunities for considering this question which many honourable members have not had, and I have gone into the subject pretty fully. I have already stated that I was in the confidence of the late Mr Mitchell, who had this project in hand, and who had obtained from the New South Wales Government the promise that, if he established the iron industry in the State, they would purchase from him the whole of the State requirements in the shape of iron rails, for a price equivalent to the ruling price abroad, plus freight and other charges incidental to importation. Mr Mitchell, however, failed to establish the industry. He was not certain at the time that he would be able to secure from the other State's a sufficient number of orders to make the enterprise profitable, but he believed that under federation-whic h was then in the air-h e would be able to establish it, and that with Inter-State free trade it would not only be able to standalone, butwouldbecomeaverythriviugundertaking. I have heard nothing from the Minister to cause me to believe that there was any tiling unsound in the arguments which I brought forward upon the last occasion ; but all the arguments advanced during the long and instructive debate which took place then have been passed over by him without notice. The right honourable gentleman, however, referred to some statistics of a rather doubtful character which appear in the Canadian Yea/r Book for 1901 - But it is stated there that the figures regarding the consumption of native.ore are only approximate and subject to revision, and a significant note is added to the effect bhat the ore used was imported very largely from foreign counbries likewise, a greab deal of ib being broughb from Newfoundland, which, as honourable members know, is nob parb of the Dominion of Canada. When the Bill was originally in committee, I supportedthe amendment moved by the honourable member for Bland, which added to clause -3 the proviso which the Minister now wishes to rescind. I voted for that proviso in order to throw upon the Government the responsibility of giving encouragement to State socialism. It was not part of the policy of the Government, as announced at Maitland, to give encouragement to Sbate socialism, and I naturally supposed that the addition of the proviso bo the clause would cause them to drop the measure. But, true to his characteristics, the Ministei of Trade and Customs has 1 stuck to the Bill. I admire the man who will stick to his measures, but I should not admire the Minister who adhered to a measure which provided for the establishment of collectivism in connection w t h the iron industry. Although a great deal might be said in favour of the establishment of the iron industry by one of the States Governments, the people have not asked fOF an application of the principle of State socialism in that direction, and until there is an agitation, in favour of it in all parts of Australia, I do not think we shall be justified in taking the course provided for in the Bill. My reason for voting for the proviso was that I considered that the most effective way of defeating the bonus system., a system to which I think; all free-traders are opposed. We, on, this side, are now revenoietariffisbs as a matter of necessity; but I hope that the time is not far distant when I shall be able to vote strictly according to my principles, in favour of free-trade as it was understood in New South Wales and exists in Great Britain. Of course, whilerevenue-taritfism is necessary, I am prepared to stick to my party in supporting it. But, as a f rae-trader, I think I shall be doing, my duty in assistingto retain in this Bill a proviso which will render it unacceptable to tliose for whose benefit it was introduced. All the autliorities upon the bonus system whom I have been able to consult are agreed that if a bounty of; bonus is paid for the lishment of an industry, and a portion of the customs receipts are applied for the purpose, the bulk of the community, rich and poor alike, contribute in proportion to their appetites. I contend that if a definite sum of money is to be given for what the Minister calls the ""sufficient establishment"" of this orany othei industry, it should be levied by direct taxation, and the people who benefit most from the establishment of the industry, tliose who have a large stakei n the country, should pay for thab benefit in proportion to their wealth, rather than in proportion to their appetites and the size of their families. It is only by voting for the proviso in the clause that we can at the present time accomplish our object of wrecking the bonus sysbem for which the Bill provides. If the Bill were passed, the people Of New South Wales would contribute 4s. of the 12s. per ton, or £83,000 of the £250,000, which ib is proposed bo JI/)-. Henry Willis. pay for the production of pig-iron, puddlediron, and other raw material set out in class 1 of the schedule, while Victoria would contributeabout another third, and the remaining four Sbates of the Union the balance. If the establishment of the iron industry were likely to prove of equal value to every State in proportion to its population, something might be said for the proposal in the Bill ; but there are not more than two States, and, as pointed out by the honourable and learned member for Parkes, in all probability only one, New South Wales, in which the iron industry is likely to be esbablished. That being so, the fact constitutes a strong, argument in favour of putting aside the proposal. But the Bill does not provide only for the granting, of bonuses. A bonus is to be given which, at the beginning, will equal approximately 20 per cent, of the value of the iron produced; but at the end of five years it is to cease, and its place is to be taken by an import duty upon iron of 10 per cent., which is apparently to remain for all time. No doubt there are protectionists who might be found to support a 10 per cent, duty upon iron, but would any one support the establishment and retention of a monopoly by a duty, which, on the first revision of the Tariff,, would probably be raised to 2.0 - or 30 per cent % A very plausible argument for the raising of theimport duty from 10 per eent. bo 2.0 per cent, would be estabbhe faeb bhat the original bomus! was equal to 20 per cent, upon the value of the iron produced-, that the industry was still in its infawy, and bhat it employed thousands of men who would be thrown out of employment if. more protection were not granted to it . We read of logrolling in connection with otheiParliaments, and we know how 1 much lobbying, has taken place since this Parliament met.",26
59,Mr MAUGER,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,On both sides.,27
60,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Yes , on both sides. I am disgusted at it . But it leads me bo believe bhat sufficient influence would be brought to bear upon honourable members to cause bhem bo increase the irnporb duby upon iron bo20 or even 30 per cent. Sk EDWARD BRADDON. - Has the honourable-member been lobbied ?",27
61,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I have been consulted over and over again. I do not think that anybhing has been said bo me in respecb bo this Bill which should not have been said, but I know the object of the interviews, and I had experience of the lobbying which took place last year. The provision which the Government now - wish to rescind was deliberately agreed to by the committee, and it must be inferred from the action of the Government that they .are. of opinion that it should not be retained in the Bill, the proposal being no part of their policy. That being so, they will be justified in dropping the Bill if the amendment of the Minister is negatived. Surely the Government will not adopt the decision of the third party in this Chamber as theu policy, and if the committee do not reverse the decision previously arrived afc thei'e will be no course open to them but to drop the Bill. The Minister stated that he was induced to ask the committee to reconsider their decision by the attitude assumed by the States ; but no other result could have been expected. If the proviso is allowed to remain, private enterprise is not likely to be encouraged, because it will be open to one or all of the States to embark upon the manufacture of iron at any time, and to bring their unlimited resources to bear against any private competitors. This would prevent capitalists from investing at least £500,000 in plant for the establishment of ironworks. An investment of this kind would in its turn involve the further expenditure of millions of money, and give employment to thousands of men. Some honourable members may ask why the States should refuse to avail themselves of the bonuses proposed to be offered. In the first place, there is very little likelihood of any State besides New South Wales being in a position to establish the industry, and that State would derive no material assistance from the granting of a bonus, because she would have to contribute very largely to the maintenance of the system. Moreover; the Ne.w South Wales Government is independent of the Federal Government, and as States Ministers are very jealous with regard to the'Federal Government, we can easily understand their dismissing the proposal with a shrug of the shoulders. If New South Wales desired to establish the iron industry she could do so - with greater advantage by remaining independent of all aid from the Federal authorities. Under the bonus system proposed by the Government she would have - to contribute one-third of the outlay involved by the system, and as it is unlikely that the impecunious States will be able to bear their share of the .expenditure, a further fairly heavy burden will probably fall upon the mother. State. Therefore New South Wales would have the advantage of only the Victorian contribution of one-third of the cost. This would be equivalent to 4s. out of the 12s. per ton proposed to be granted for the manufacture of iron. If New South Wales were to establish ironworks entirely on her own acounfc, she would lie - able to obtain her own materials where she chose. She might, for instance, obtain supplies of hematite, which is required in the manufacture of pig iron, from New Caledonia. Upon this subject George Griffith, in his work, In an Unkncnc-n Prison Land, says :At Prony, not only the rocks and the boulders,, bnt the very sands of the shore themselves were of iron-sometime s pure, bufc as a rule containing from 85 to 90 per cent, of the metal. Millions of tons of it are lying round the shoresof one offchefinestand safest natural harbors in the world. A thousand miles away are tbecoalfields of New South Wales. Since it pays, fco ship copper aud iron from Spain, mid even Soubh America,fcoSwansea, one wouldfchinkifc would pay to ship this to Newcastle: However, fchere it lies, waiting, I suppose, for some one to make fortunes out of it. That is the finest deposit of ore in tliese southern seas, and would be extremely valuable to New South Wales. Freedom to draw upon the resources of New Caledonia would be worth more to New South Wales than 4s., or even 12s., per ton bonus.. Probably this is one of the reasons which actuated the New South Wales Government in intimating that they had nointention to avail themselves of the provisions of this measure. Sir John See, in his reply to the 'Minister for Trade and Customs, said:I desire to inform youfchafcmy Government havegivenfchefullest considerationfcofchematter of the establishment of ironworks ancl works of a kindred character, and are of opinion that such should be carried out by private enterprise rather than by the Government offcheState. I might addfchatwe favour both a duty and a bonus, and should be glad to support any action taken hy the Federal Government in regard thereto. That is a very courteous reply, and such ! as one would expect from the Governj ment of an important State like New 1 South AVales.",27
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Si r John even more emphatic in his statement to Parliament. ,",29
63,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I can quite believe it. As free-traders we are fully prepared to learn that the protectionist Government of New South Wales is in favour of a protective policy in regard to the iron industry. They know that if pressure were brought' to bear upon them to establish the iron industry as a State concern, they would be at liberty to act quite independently of the reply which they have forwarded. As a free-trader I am opposed to the bonus system, and I wish it to be understood that I think that the Bill should be made unacceptable to Parliament, and that the most effective way of securing its defeat is by retaining the proviso. The responsibility in this matter must rest upon the Government, and they must stand or fall by their policy. I do not think that the way in which I intend to vote should be interpreted to mean that I am an advocate of State socialism. In Australia, however, there are very many State socialists. They are to be found upon both sides of this Chamber, and in the ranks of the most conservative in other parts of the world. The very conditions which prevail in Austi'alia tend to make a man a State socialist in many directions. Ifc is not long since the Honourable Sir William Hareourt was asked whether he did not 'favour the municipalization of certain services in England, fco which he replied"" Gh, now we are all State socialists."" To a certain extent I think we are all State socialists, because we not only favour the municipalization of such services as gas, water and sewerage, fuel and ferries, but we have deliberately enacted that our railways, tramways, telephones, and post-offices shall be under the direct control of the State, a form of State socialism which very few of us would be willing to abolish.",29
64,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Eac h case must be considered upon its merits.,29
65,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Exactly . If it werefchewill of the people that the production of iron should be nationalized I do not think that in bowing to it one would have to swallow much more than he has done in the direction of State Socialism. But if we give a bonus of 20 per cent, upon the production of iron to private individuals, ! See was the probability is that, at a later stage, an attempt will be made to increase it to 30 per cent., and. thereby increase the railway freights to farmers and other primary producers.",29
66,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Oh , no.",29
67,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The right honourable gentleman knows much better than I do what is asked of Parliament upon occasions. I can quite conceive of this Parliament being requested afc some future period when the Tariff is under revision, to increase the bonus proposed to be granted under"" this Bill, and I think that the advocates of such a proposal would be able to make out a plausible case by urging that the encouragement which had been afforded the industry was insufficient. But I should like to point out to honourable members that the possibilities of the iron trade in Australia are enormous. The ordinary requirements of the States themselves are considerable. For example, in connection with the railway which it is proposed to construct between Kalgoorlie ancl Port Augusta, besides the steel rails required, pipes will need to be laid along the whole route- a distance of 1,000 miles. Then the consumption of iron in the construction of the transcontinental railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek will be enormous. I am convinced, from correspondence which I have had with ironmasters in England, that capitalists are quite prepared to establish this industry in Australia without any encouragement being granted to them in the way of protection, provided they are guaranteed the trade of the several States. Knowing that, I am perfectly satisfied that ironworks can be profitably established here without 'any artificial aid. My parliamentary experience, and my observations of the working of a protective system extending over many years, convince me that if we once establish this industry by granting a bonus to private individuals, that bonus, in the form of a protective duty, will not be withdrawn from them in my lifetime, or in that of the Minister - The money that would be paid by the people would amount to millions sterling, and their annual _ contributions would pay the interest upon millions of bonded debt with which they are now ""so heavily weighted. If the iron industry is native to Australia, then it can be established in our midst without any artificial aid. Not a single argument has been adduced to show that it is not native to the Commonwealth. Indeed, there is everything to prove the contrary. The facts that in this young country an enormous demand exists for iron in various forms, and that we possess every metal required in connection with its production - such metals, for example, as wolfram - prove conclusively that the industry is native to the soil, and requires no protection whatever, though it may need some encouragement in the way of 3 guaranteeing. to it the trade of the several States. If the Government would interest themselves to the extent of inducing the States fco give their trade for a certain number of years to any particular firm embarking upon this enterprise upon the lines laid down by the present leader of the Opposition when Premier of New South Wales, the industry would secure all the encouragement that it requires, and the people would benefit to a great extent. Moreover, the iron industry in Australia enjoys a high measure of natural protection, inasmuch as the freight charges upon imported iron, as I learn from the expert who recently came to Australia from London, range from 17s. 6d. to 20s. per ton. Honourable members have been informed that pig-iron is brought out as ballast, and that very little freight is paid upon imported iron. I have it, however, upon the authority of the expert from London, that the freight to Western Australia is 17s. 6d. per ton, whilst to the other States it is 20s. per ton.",29
68,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Has the honourable member contrasted oversea freights with local freights 1,30
69,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I am very glad that the Minister has referred to local freights, because ib seems to me that the rails and pipes required for the great trunk line which is projected from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta might advantageously be taken to the latter place, thus saving the i cost of 200 or 300 miles of railway haulage, - as compared with that which would be incurred if they were taken to Eremantle. Similarly, in connection with the proposed line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, it would be wise to send the rails to Port Darwin, inasmuch as the Pine Creek railway is only 145 miles in length, whereas Oodnadatta is 688 miles from Adelaide. As New South Wales is the State in which this industry is most likely to be established, honourable members will recognise that the local freights would be a very small consideration as compared with the natural advanbages which the industry would enjoy by reason of ibs geographical position. I would further point out that much of the iron ore used in Great Britain is imported from Spain or South America, whilst the wolfram comes from other parts. Altogether, the oversea carriage referred to by the Minister is much greater in England than it would be if we had to import our ore to a very large extent from New Caledonia.",30
70,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,The idea of some people is that it should be brought from Tasmania.,30
71,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I suppose that the expense would not be greater to bring it from New Caledonia. Off the coast of Queensland there is an island which is composed largely of wolfram. That wolfram could be landed in Sydney at a much lower cost than that for which wolfram is selling in England at the present time. We have everything that is required in connection with the iron industry, including the iron ore, wolfram, limestone, and coal, in very close proximity bo water carriage, which is the cheapest; form of carriage available, and bherefore we enjoy nabural advanbages which do nob exisb bo the same exbenb in England. These advanbages are such bhat the indusbry can be esbablished in Australia wibhoub any artificial aid whatever. These are some of the reasons which will induce me to confirm the vote that I gave upon a previous occasion, and to side with those who favour the retention of the provisio in the Bill. I believe in freedom of commerce as far as possible, and I hope that my vote - will be the means of setting aside this measure, seeing that the object of the Government in recommitting it could only have been to. induce honourable members to reconsider their previous decision. If the committee will not reverse their previous decision, we may reasonably expect the Government to cast the Bill under the table, and I shall be very glad if that course be taken.",30
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Parramatta) I feel that I ought to say a few words explanatory of the vote I am about to give. The honourable member for Robertson has' declared that he will adhere to his previous I vote with the express intention of tiying to kill the Bill; find that, I believe, is the tude of other honourable members on my own side of the Chamber. Whilst listening to the honourable member for Robertson and others, I have been wondering whether the reasons - which actuate them also influence the minds of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, the honourable member for Bourke, and other ultra-protectionists. are told that in the opinion of some honourable members the Bill musfc contain a clause as proposed by the Government, in order that it may pass this and the other House; consequently, there is a complete divergence of view amongst honourable members who are taking common action in connection with the amendment. I voted for the amendment of the honourable member for Bland, being of opinion that if a bonus had to be given it - was preferable to give it to a State rather than to an individual. But circumstances have since changed. We have had the distinct announcement by the States Governments, without exception, that they will not undertake the enterprise. Nothing could be more definite or unmistakeable than the pronouncement of Sir John See, who, in addition, has distinctly stated, in response to queries in the Parliament of New South Wales, that his Government have made up their minds to have nothing to do with the establishment of State ironworks. proposal before us is therefore not free from difficulty to one who, Uke myself, does not believe in bonuses, but has an anxious desire to see the industry started. I believe the industry could and would be started even without the aid of a bonus, and if we vote to retain the clause as at present, in view of the expressed intention of the States Governments, we shall not only kill the proposal for a bonus, but also prevent the possibility of outside persons undertaking the for no private company would venture on such undertakings with the menace of a State bonus over them. If the Governments will not undertake the enterprise, the least we can do is to leave the way open for private individuals. I understand that the capital is already at hand, and everything favours the undertaking by private enterprise afc an early date. At any rate we have now an adequate market, and the possibility of production on a competitive scale; and to maintain the clause at present would simply mean the shutting out of any chance of the establishment of the industry, even without Mr Joseph Coo!;. .atti- any aid from the Government. I shall maintain my own principles at the later stages of the Bill, and resist any proposal to kill the enterprise while trying to k ill the Bill.

73,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,. ! understood the Minister to say that he was willing to make a compromise with regard to the period during which the States should have priority of claim for the bonus.,31
74,Mr HUME COOK,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,The honourable member foiBland previously refused to accept a compromise.,31
75,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Certainly ; because I did not think it was adequate. But seeing that we cannot.get all we-want, I am quite prepared to now accept the compromise of giving two years' priority to the States. We ought to have some indication of the presentMinisterial attitude.",31
76,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"When there was some doubt as to whether the States were likely to undertake the iron industry, I was inclined, in the first instance, to fix a period during which they might have preference of claim for the bonus. Since that time, however, we have had the fullest information on the subject.",32
77,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,But the Minister expressed his willingness to make such a compromise .af ter he got the information from the States.,32
78,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I do not think so. f i promise of that sort were made, there is no doubt that an attempt ought to be made to fulfil it ; but the position has been properly and strongly put that such ii provision would, amount to a sort of threat that private enterprise might at any moment be exposed to competition with a subsidized State Government. I am inclined to think that the better course would be not to introduce a limitation of the kind. It would be useless and open to objection as a standing menace to private individuals embarking on the enterprise. - Mr CONROY (Werriwa) - It would be sufficient explanation for the Minister to say that the promise was given to the honourable member for Bland before it was known that the Government would have a majority of six in the division just taken. Now that the voice of the Committee is in favour of the Government no more need be said. Perhaps if the debate continues a - little longer, the Minister may be able to tliink of some other reason than that I have indicated, or he may change his mind with the - same readiness he showed a few minutes ago. Then again, on two occasions last week the Minister said he was in favour of giving bonuses to the States. If he is in favour of that policy, how can he favour giving bonuses to individuals'(I trust that any honourable member who voted i u favour of State bonuses will be careful to give his reasons before he departs from that vote and supports a proposal enabling the bonuses to be granted to private individuals. Iron is the raw material of over twenty trades. Are we to tax the twenty for the benefit of one"" The proposal of the Minister is not only to tax them in this way, but, in addition, to impose a protective duty of 10 per cent Iron is more largely 42 u used than is any other material, and the very fact of imposing this duty will tend largely to discourage manufactures. But I do not think there will be much backsliding from amongst those who are in favour of the State as opposed to private individuals undertaking the iron industry. Let honourable members look at the energy the Minister has displayed in connection with this question. Look at the way he has spoken to his brief! Bufc he has not ventured to state his reason for changing his opinion on the question of the manufacture of iron by States or individuals. This is the man who originally came here with a character for If standing up to his opinions. Apparently, in his view, standing up for one's opinions means only standing up for them when there is a majority in their favour. My objection to the clause as it stands is that we are asked to give a bonus to a set of individuals, and not one, word of argument has been adduced in favour of it. The Estimates are nob yet before us, and we do not even know wherefchemoney is to come from. Mr BBjOWN (Canobolas) - I do not wish to be unfair or uncharitable, but it is remarkably strange to see the Minister for Trade and Customs in the new guise of champion of private enterprise when the other night we heard him so eloquently claiming that the manufacture of iron was a proper subject for governmental control. He then pointed out that his only difficulty was to know whether the States Governments would take the matteiin hand, and he said that if he were assured that they would, no member of this House would be more ready to give them that opportunity and tc assist them in every way than he would. Now the Minister is asked whether he will give the States the reasonable period of two years within which to consider their position. Up to the present the matter has not been seriously considered by the States as States. A hurried decision has been arrived at by different Governments for the time being, but though they control the affairs of the States today they may be gone tomorrow. Because of that opinion the Minister ranges himself under the banner of private enterprise, and is fighting, not for what he professed last week, but for a set of private capitalists. The suggestion thrown out by the honourable member for Bland is not an unreasonable one, and certainly it did not meet with the Minister's opposition last week-that is, that the different should have an opportunity of making up their minds. Why should not a .proviso be inserted in the clause to the effect that it should be open to the States to avail themselves of this provision for the next two years, after which it shall be open to private enterprise 1",32
79,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I have been looking up the remarks I made on a previous occasion, and which have been referred to, and I have found them.",33
80,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The remark was made by wav of interjection, I think.",33
81,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I wish to give honourable members the full benefit of whatever I said, not abating one jot or tittle.",33
82,Mr BROWN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"-The right honourable gentleman should'know whether the principle is .a good one or not, without reference to what he said last week.",33
83,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"As regards the suggestion made, what I am afraid of is that the States will not take up the matter of the manufacture of iron, and the thing will be "" stuck up.""",33
84,Mr BROWN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Giv e the people .an opportunity of saying whether the States Governments should take it up.,33
85,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"This is what I find I said, amongst other things :I do not flinch from the position I previously took up. If the States, are willing to undertake this work, let us give them a reasonable period in which to do so. But do not let us.conserve to them the right for all time, and give the private individual no chance.",33
86,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,-That was after the Minister had received the answers to his inquiries.,33
87,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Yes , it was aud I am reading the passage in .order to make it available to honourable members at the earliest opportunity. Of course, when I was put to it , what I said was this---"" I do not think there is a chance."" I do , not think there is the slightest chance of the States undertaking this work.",33

It is our intention that it should be open to fair competition by a good many. We do not desire to create it for .any particular individual, States company, or State. On that point our idea would be in connection with the schedule to insert a provision that the bonus should not be payable except as regards a future'time, both as to commencement and expiration. Honourable members know that this question .was raised in connection with the date of the commencement of the . Act, and the Government then promised",33
90,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,But that was not what the Minister was referring to.,33
91,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,No ; the question has been discussed from two points of view.,33
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,The right honourable gentleman practically endorsed the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne.,33
93,Mr MATJGER,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,It was my proposal originally.,33
94,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The proposal of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne covered two points-on e having reference to the right of purchase and the other having reference to wages, but, so far as I recollect, the honourable .and learned member did not speak .upon this point at all.",33
95,Mr MAUGER,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Yes , he did.",33
96,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"He was not the one - who suggested it by any manner of means. He directed his attention to the question of the right of purchase and to the question of wages. .1 think that under all the circumstances honourable members have a right to expect us t.o fix a - future date 'for-the commencement of the bonus. That would .give all an opportunity of getting word of the - competition. I am sorry that in view of the improbability of the States taking up the industry, there should be any special condition, of the kind, but I think it is possible to establish a claim for a reasonable time-during which .preference shall be .accorded to the States over a private individual. The Government, therefore, will .not resist a reasonable proposition in the direction. Amendment (by Mr MCDONALD) proposed - That the following words be added, ""Provided, that for two years after the commencement of thisany State Governmenfc.shall have prior claim",33
97,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I do not think the words used by the honourable member wii _ carry out the idea effectually. I shall draft a proviso, if honourable members will agree to that course, which will have the same effect. Honourable members will recollect that I brought forward a clause with the same purpose. What I suggesfc is a proviso fco the effect that if within a certain time any State declares ifcs intention in. a certain way-and I think it ought to be by resolution of both its Houses of Parliament-fc o avail itself of the provisions of this Bill, then its provisions shall apply only to the States.",33

111,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I am inclind to think that two years is, under the circumstances, too long.",34
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Passin g operate in two years' time is ridiculous.,34
113,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I say bhat perhaps a proviso of the description to which I refer should extend for a period of one year,'which should be long enough forfcheStates to make up their minds on the subject. I believe that they have made up their minds, and are not likely to depart from the decision ab 42 £ 2 which they have arrived. We have cerbain informabion onfchafcpoint ; but, as I have said, for the purpose of keeping faith with honourable members infchestrictest sense of the word, I am prepared to submit a proposal to give preference to the States for one year.",34
114,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," This has been a remarkable exhibition of inconsistency. The right honourable gentleman only two minutes ago in dorsed expressions used by one or two honourable members to the effect that if there were any attempt to tamper with this proposal by tying it up, it would be impossible, under the shadow of the bhreab of a Sbabe taking up the indusbry, for any .privabe individual bo 'acb. The right honourable gentleman agreed with that. He admitted that the argument was perfectly sound, and. he said that they had approached the different States Governments, and that each had refused to take action. He also said, that he was perfectly certain that the Stateswhy would refuse to touch it.",34
115,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,That is the reason the clause was recommitted.,34
116,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The right honourable gentleman expressed the opinion, as a responsible Minister, and on the basis of the correspondence with the States Go the vernments, that he was perfectly certain they would not touch it for several year's.. Now he turns absolutely rightabout face and declares that in spite of his own ex-, pression of opinion, he is prepared to agreebo a' cerbain proposal. I say ib is trifling wibh the whole thing. It simply shows bhat it would have been far better, far more conwe stitutional, and far more in accordance with the honour of responsible .govei'nment, if , when this Bill was wrecked before, the* right Government had thrown it under the table. It is a very serious position that this . Chamber is placed in. We are face to face with the question whether there is any responsibility in what we call Ministers of the Crown. Tf this kind of thing is to proceed a Bill to further it will be far better to vobe for a commibbee bo manage the business of bhis. House. The righb honourable the Minister for Trade and Customs, who has some reputation for strength of mind and strength of character, should surely know his own mind' within ten minutes ? We have belittled ourselves not only before the people of Australia, but before the people of the Empire. I shall explain that. We passed a resolution here the other day, and the Government gave its countenance to a proposal by which private individuals would have an opportunity of starting an industry of this kind. That course was taken on the good faith of the Government in the passing of a certain part of our Tariff, and yet the very Government who proposed this have turned round and accepted an absolutely different principle, and have thrown over those people who attached some importance to the faith of Ministers. What are we to expect from responsible government if no one can know what the intentions of Ministers are ? The best thing we can do now is to negative the whole clause, and let the B i ll be at once destroyed. That is the only proper course to pursue. I do think that my honourable friends of the labour party ought really to accept the opinion of this House upon the matter as so far expressed.",34
117,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,""" So far "" is good.",35
118,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"If we suspend this proposal for a year, or for two years, we shall practically be attempting to legislate for the next Parliament. If a year is proposed we shall be then under the shadow of a general election. What private enterprise in the world would attempt to undertake an industry of this kind under those circumstances t I say we are trifling with the whole thing from beginning to end. Let us decide upon one tiling or the other, like responsible people, and not make ourselves the laughing stock of the outside public, as we are doing. I hope no attempt' will be made to interfere with the vote which - has been taken. I intend ' to vote against the clause altogether, in order to save time and have the Bill put under the table. , Mr WATSON (Bland) - It is well enough for the honourable member for Wentworth to talk of accepting the vote of the committee ; but those of us who desire to go a little but of the beaten track in political movements find it rather an unwise thing to accept the vote of the committee, because we do not quite know how soon that vote may be changed. So far as the opinions of some honourable members are concerned, they have changed very considerably within the last few weeks, and the Minister has changed his opinion within the last few minutes. I understood that he was going to stand by the proposal he made last week.",35
119,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,SO did we who voted with him.,35
120,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"If the honourable member for Melbourne had been in his place, and had heard the proposal the right honourable gentleman made last week, he would understand that it was that the States should have priority of claim to the bonus for a period of two years.",35
121,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I never understood that. ' Mr WATSON - The Minister'now puts forward another proposal which, from the point of view of those who desire to see the States given an opportunity of going into this industry, is not worth a snap of the finger. What opportunity is afforded to a minority that may exist at present in a State to become a majority in favour of entering upon this enterprise in twelve months' time 1 There would not be time even to shift a Ministry, clinging limpet-like to their seats, in that period. We cannot expect the people of New South Wales, of Tasmania, or of any other State in which coal and iron are found togetlier, fco give an expression of opinion upon this subject, except at a general election, and no general election is due in any of the States likely fco enter upon this industry for the next two years. Unless we allow a few years during which we may get an expression of opinion from them, it is utterly useless to put forward any such proposal as the Minister now indicates that he is willing to agree to. So far as I am concerned, therefore, I say that I have no option left but to vote agaiust the Bill and the clause. I say, at the same time, that I am prepared to vote for such a proposal if sufficient time is. given. I think the honourable member for Kennedy ought to persist with his amendment seeking to enact a period of two years within which priority shall'be given to the States. Any less period than that is of no value. Two years is even too short, but I am satisfied that we cannot expect any definite expression of opinion on this subject to be obtained from New South Wales in less than that time. The present State Ministry is not likely to take the matter up until the pressure of public opinion is strong enough to induce them to do so. I am convinced that there is every probability of that expression of opinion being given at or before the next general election, but sooner than that one cannot rely upon it . I think, therefore, that the suggestion put forward most recently by the Minister is quite different in spirit from that put forward last - week, - when the right honourable gentleman spoke a second time upon this subject. The Minister proposes now to give twelve months' priority to the States. The minimum period spoken of last week was two years; the period of one year is inadequate.",35
122,Mr KENNEDY,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," I am somewhat surprised at this reversal of attitude on the part of the Government. It is difficult for honourable members to understand where they really are. W it h regard to the proposal to give the States priority for a period of two years, I would point out that those who support it say in the same breath that there is not the slightest chance of the States taking advantage of it .",36
123,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I said quite the contrary.,36
124,Mr KENNEDY,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,The honourable member said there is no chance of a general election taking place in either New South Wales or Tasmania for two years to come.,36
125,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I said that a general election would take place within two years.,36
126,Mr KENNEDY,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,We have been informed by the Governments of those States that they have no intention whatever of taking action towards the establishment of. the iron industry as a State monopoly. Is there any likelihood that their-attitude will be changed until. there has been a general election ?,36
127,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,They may be converted within less than two years. It has taken a shorter period than that to convert other Governments in regard to other reforms.,36
128,Mr KENNEDY,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"But their hands cannot be forced until there has been an election. The sooner we have a decided opinion from the Government in regard to this matter the better it will be for all parties. On a previous occasion, when a provision similar to that now submitted by the honourable member for Kennedy was before the committee, those who now advocate it refused to accept it as a compromise ; they would have nothing less than the complete control of the iron industry by the States Governments. I am amongst those who have no fear that the persons employed in this industry would be injured if it were undertaken by private enterprise, since Parliament can always control the conditions under which it must be carried out; but why do the Government blow hot and cold upon this matter ? I voted for the excision of the proviso because I believed that the Government would abide by the decision of 'the committee, but we had hardly arrived at a decision before they went back upon their own statements. Their action has been unfair to their supporters and to the committee generally.",36
129,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,The Minister for Trade and Customs stated last week that he wasin favour of this proposal. Sir MALCOI.SI MCEACHAKN --Certainl y not.,36
130,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Yes , on Friday.",36
131,Mr KENNEDY,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I clearly understood, that the Government would stand by the clause as it was originally introduced. We have been informed by the Minister that the States Governments refused point plank to take steps for the establishment of the'iron industry. We know that many honourable members voted for the pi ovision, not because they are in favour of it, but because they wished to defeat the Bill, and if the Government are not now going to stand by the clause as it was originally introduced, I shall refuse to countenance the continuance of the present farcical proceedings, and, although I have told my constituents that I am in favour of granting bonuses for the establishment of the iron industry, shall vote against the Bill.",36
132,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," The honourable member for Moira has rightlydescribed these proceedings as farcical. I never knew a Minister to trifle with a committee as the Minister for Trade and Customs has trifled with this committee. If he had had any intention of supporting a proposal for the giving of a preference to the States Governments for any period, he would not have asked the committee to excise the proviso added to the clause on the motion of the honourable member for Bland, but would have moved the addition to it of words which would carry out his intention. The Minister could have saved all the discussion which we have had during the last three daj'S by taking some such course as that.",36
133,Mr HUGHES,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,He has been in favour of our amendment right through.,36
134,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Then why did he get the committee to rescind it %,36
135,Mr HUGHES,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Because he has also been ' opposed to it right through.,36
136,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"He appears to be alternately in favour of it and opposed it. Usually a person allows a decent intera. course. val to elapse between his advocacy of one set of opinions and his adoption of another set. But the Minister shifts from one attition tude to another with the rapidity of a ning-change artist. He opposed the restricwith tion of bonuses to State undertakings against the interests of tlieindustiy and the Commonwealth, aud because hope of any State Government establishing ironworks; but, having got together a majority, and rescinded the proviso of the honourable member for Bland, he turns Fysh. . round and proposes the very thing he previously opposed. Every member i committee has reason to complain of this change ofattitude. No section ""of the committee can form any definite the Minister departs in this way from a policy which he says he will stand by:",37
137,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"It is a little ordinary to hear the complaints of honorwhich able members, some of whom have been away, and therefore do not knowwhat taken place.",37
138,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I have not been away.,37

Then the division took place upon the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bland, and it was carried against the Government by 25 votes to 12, or a majority of 13. How does our position to-night differ in the slightest degree from that we occupied on the 19th June?",37
149,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The Government have reconsidered the question, and have decided to take a different course. N",38
150,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Is not our attitude precisely the same as it was ? There is no doubt about it . We were opposed to the absolute limitation of the bonuses for all time to the States, but we were in favour of a preference being, given to the States for a limited time. Upon both these issues we were beaten, and we had time for further con-r sideration. What did we do when we-were defeated ? We reported progress immediately after the amendment was carried against us. Since then we have obtained further information on the subject, and our first objeit was to remove the amendment propused by the honourable member for Bland, and carried against us.",38
151,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"There is no need to remove it if a preference is to be given to the Statesfor. a, period of two years.",38
152,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The two points were raised in different ways, and we are similarly raising them now. AVe have succeeded in removing the proviso inserted at the instance of the honourable member for Bland, and we nowfind ourselves face to face with a proposal, for which we ourselves voted on the L9th June, giving a preference to the States for a limited time. I admit that there are now stronger reasons for rejecting, that amendment than existed some time ago. I have mentioned these, and 1I have pointed, out the further evidence we have witli regard to the unfavorable attitude of the States.",38
153,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,The right honourable member said it was-fatal.,38
154,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I do not think that I went so far. as that, although X spoke strongly. On .Friday last I saidIf'the States are willing to undertake this work, let us give them a reasonable period in which to do so, but do not let us conserve to themfchelight for allfcime,and give the private individual no chance. That statement was made in the early part of my speech.",38
155,Mr MCCAY,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,That was after the Ministei' had said that the States would not entertain the idea. What is the use of giving them an opportunity of doing something which they say tliey will not do ?,38
156,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"We cannot tell what may be done in the future. There may be a change in the attitude of the States at any time, and, in view of the wide division of opinion upon this subject, it is only fair that we should endeavour to meet the views of those who believe that there is a likelihood of the States embarking upon the enterprise. I should not be treating the committee fairly if I refused to give an opportunity of the character referred to. I have previously indicated that it is not our intention to bring the bonuses into force immediately, because it is inexpedient that we should play directly into the hands of any particular individuals. We have not departed from the lines previously laid down, and we are found today contending foi"" practically the same principles that we fought for six weeks ago.",38
157,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,But did not attempt to embody in' the Bill.,38
158,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,That is hardly worthy of the honourable member.,38
159,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,It is true.,38
160,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Unde r all the circumstances, I . resent the suggestion that there has been any change of front on the part of the Government, and I was sorry to hear the observations made by the honourable member for Moira. He was one of those honourable members who endeavoured to assist us in doing that which we are now proposing to do, namely, to give the States, by way of preference for' a certain period, a chance to earn the bonus. The honourable member did not hold then, because the proposal was negatived when he voted for it - and that was only six weeks ago-that it was hjs duty to support the exclusive application of the bonus to private in dividuals.",38
161,Mr KENNEDY,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I stated my reasons then, and I stated them again today.",38
162,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member has shown by his vote today, for which we thank him, that the attitude we have adopted in resisting the limitation of the bonuses to the States, to the total exclusion of all private enterprise, is the right one. I ask the committee to give fair consideration to this mattei , and to recognise that the attitude of the Government has been consistent and just throughout. Mr HUGHES ' (West Sydney) - The Minister has quoted from Hansard, but it will be apparent to lionorable members when . tliey have the report of the Minister's speech in their hands that on the occasion to which he has referred he wasspeaking, not of his intention, but of his belief. He said that he "" believed "" that the States should conduct such enterprises as that proposed in connection with the establishment of ironworks, and he suggested that we should give the States a chance to do so. That is what he had always said, but in his hand at that particular moment he held a sheaf of telegrams, which he read later, and from which it appeared that the States had not the slightest intention to take advantage of the provisions of the Bill. Therefore what 1 the right honourable member then said with regard to his intention had reference to his past intention. His intention when he spoke was that the whole matter should be left to private enterprise. The right honourable gentleman has referred to his utterances on Friday afternoon, but when honourable members have an opportunity to read the Mansard report they will see that there is not one line of the context that will convey the impression, that the Minister was then in favour of giving the States one or two years in which to make up their minds. When we pleaded for time, he pointed to the telegrams as conveying the final decree of the States, and he said in so many words that the Sbates had no intention of going - on with the enterprise. In the face of that does the Minister mean to tell the committee that on Friday afternoon he was in favour of giving the States an opportunity of reconsidering the matter ? I am sure that when the pages of Hansard come into the hands of honourable* members they will see how utterly baseless such a contention is. The Minister represented that the States had left him in such a position that he had no option but to declare in favour of granting bonuses for the encouragement of private enterprise. Now he has the hardihood to tell us that he has not changed his mind. What was he fighting for ? Why was he so anxious to recommit the Bill? There was no necessity to recommit the Bill if he had held his present view all throughfchepiece.. I utterly deny that the Minister has treated the committee fairly. I have seen a number of extraordinary gyrations on the part of Ministers, but I am sure that no honourable member has ever witnessed or read of anything equal to the last performance of: the Minister for Trade and Customs. The honourable member for Wentworth has referred to the Government as a committee to record the votes of honourable members, but we do not want even a committee. All we require is a sort of automatic push or pull machine into which we can place our motions and then count our votes. There would be, at least, some stability in such a machine.",38
163,Mr MAUGEK,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,What does the honourable member want ?,39
164,Mr HUGHES,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"We are satisfied with what the Government is now proposing, but what guarantee have we that they will not proceed upon another tack by this time tomorrow? Our position is not to be altered by charging some honourable members on this side of the House with inconsistency. Some honourable members who supported the Government today did so for the same reason that actuated them in voting against them on a previous occasion. They wished to k i ll the Bill, and they were perfectly consistent, and were perfectly within their rights in voting as they did. We do not want the Bill, which has been introduced by the Government for its o^yn purposes. The Government have posed as the guardians and saviours of the people, and have professed to be anxious to provide work for the unemployed, and to give private enterprise a chance, but when private enterprise had a chance the Government basely threw it over. I am sure that if any member of the syndicate interested in this matter could be permitted to express his opinion regarding the attitude of the Minister, he would use terms a hundred times more harsh than any employed by us. He says that the attitude of the Government today is the same as it was upon the 19th June last. That is utterly untrue.",39
165,The CHAIRMAN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,The honourable member must withdraw that statement.,39
166,Mr HUGHES,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Ver y well, sir. I withdraw it , and say. that the statement of the right honourable gentleman is not borne out by the facts which I shall place before the committee. Upon the 19fch June, the istry had not communicated'with vernments of the various States in reference to this matter, and consequently were in possession of their determinations as they are today. Upon that date they did not know whether or not the States intended to embark upon this enterprise, and therefore it was perfectly consistent for them to they were in favour of allowing the States Governments a certain period during which they should enjoy exclusive rights to the ment of the bonus. But today the Ministry know that the States Governments are not ready to nationalize the production of iron. Yet they now urge that we should give to the States which they say have no out intention of embarking upon the enterprise a chance fco do so. Jf that is not inconbut sistent with their attitude upon the 19th June, I do not know what is. some lionorable members will see their way newspapers. out of this maze. If they do so it will be more creditable to their ingenuity than to ' The. CHAIRMAN anything else. I shall listen to further nations from those who support the right orders. honourable gentleman with a certain amount' of interest, but not with because the matter is altogether serious a one for mirth. who believes that the State control this industry, I have no plaint against the Government for changing their minds in that direction; but what guarantee have we that they will not again change their minds in the oppomise site direction 1 The Minister that his attitude today is precisely what it was on a former occasion when was defeated by thirteen votes. The amendmitted ment of the honourable member for Bland was rescinded by a majority of six votes. to no more. Surely, with such a majority behind him, the Minister can muster enough courage proceed with the Bill in the form which committee previously determined it should take. I clo not thank heaven for many things; but at least I thank it that I not a Government supporter, because can well understand the feelings of gust, indignation,- and subdued which must animate honourable bers opposite, although it is extremely dimcult, when looking at their amiable countenances, to believe that they could be furious at anything. I can, however, understand that fchey would be furiously indignant at such an extraordinary volte Minface - Take the honourable member for Melthe Gobourne Ports, as an example. On Friday he went away primed with an excellent idea not which he had obtained fresh from the Minister. ' Probably he saw Certain persons upon Sunday or Monday, and told them the position that he occupied in relation to this Bill. Now, however, he finds that he does say not occupy that position. The action of the Minister does not give him a chance. If I were a Ministerial supporter I should paybe very loth to follow the crack of the whip. As, however, I am not a Government supporter, I can only say that we can place no reliance upon the promises of a Government, which, as we have seen times< of number, has no policy but that of the greater number of this House-n o intention that which is gathered from their whip, and no idea of statesmanship other than Doubtless what is seen in the columns of the morning - The honourable explamember is travelling outside the standing",39
167,Mr HUGHES,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"If what I have said is amusement, offensive, I withdraw it - Lacking as they too do all necessary qualities of statesmen, As one the Ministry still essay to lead the first should Federal Parliament, where politics were comto be lifted up to the heavens, and where superior beings were to wander in polished halls of marble to make laws for a glorious Commonwealth. Between the proand reality, I am sure that even the has said most optimistic of men must admit there is a great gulf. I entirely agree with the he honourable member for Moira, who has subto a great deal from this Government, but has made up his mind to submit Sir EDWARD BRADDON to - I confess I am immensely surprised that the the Minister for Trade and Customs, whom I have always regarded as one possessed of considerable backbone and courage, should am have shown himself a mere jelly-fish- a sort I of protoplasmic Minister, who is ready to disyield at any moment, and upon any point. fury I have supported this Bill earnestly, although memwith some degree of reluctance. That reluctance has arisen from the fact that with the passage of this measure we also carry the imposition of certain duties upon iron. However, I have supported it , and now that the States are to be allowed a certain period within which they may determine whether or not fchey will embark upon the produche tion of iron, I can only sayfchafcthe Bill is of no earthly use to capitalists,- and. that cannot effect the purposes-for which it introduced. As I have already announced that Lam opposed to State enterprise in direction, I shall have the dismal pleasure of voting.against the Bill. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Mellieu bourne) - I feel that by the action of Minister I have been placed in a position considerable difficulty. I certainly did understand, nor do I think, now, that by the use of the words which he has-read he intenoccupy. ded, to indicate his determinations to consent, to defer the period when private enterpriseinsist should be able to embark, upon the iron, industry, and. participate-in the proposed bonus. I . feel that if we are going, to allow the States twelve months in which to cide this question, the Bill will be rendered valueless. My reading of the position the Minister is that he came downfcothis House with various telegrams from the States Premiers to show that they had no intention whatever of embarking upon the enterprise, and that hetherefore wished recommit the Bill."" If there had been desire upon his part to give the-Sfcates twelve months in which' to decide'whether*or they would nationalize the productiono f iron, why did he not inform those whom he wished to support the Bill of - that desire Personally, I am in this difficulty- I shall either have to - support the proposal to give the States priority of claim for twelve other months, or else vote for therejection of the measure. I have no desire to adopt the latter course, and yet-1 feel it is equally wrong-that we should be asked to-postpone 1 for - twelve months the period when private individuals shall be allowed to embark upon the iron industry. Had the intention' of the Minister been made clear, I should have known how to act. As a Government supporter, I feel that I . have been misled this matter.",40
168,Mr MCDONA LD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," I sorry that. I cannot accept the proposal of the Minister for Trade and Customs. Upon,a previous.occasion.he told usthathe thought two years was a.reasonablefcimewithin fco allow the Statesto - decidewhether or not they would nationalize the iron industry. If his remarks then weretrue, they are it. equally true today. I must certainly press mj' sympathy with the right honourable gentleman in the awkward position in which finds himself. He i«-apparently prepared to sacrifice any principle infcheB i ll if, by so it doing, he can catch votes. That is the posiwas. tion which he has adopted all through the consideration of this measure. He has got thishimself into an awkward position by suggesting, as a compromise, that my amendment should be limited.to twelve months in of' two yearSj with the result that a the number of supporters have told. him. that of they are practically disgusted with the not action of the Government in. this matter. Thatisnot a'very enviable position for him to I think that'twelve months is altogether tod short a period within which to that the States must decide this question. No one can seriously regard the telegrams received from the Premiers of ' the different States as their final decision dein this connection. I do not suppose that the question of whether the industry should of be nationalized was even discussed in Cabinet before those replieswere sent. I would further remind the right honourable gentleman that it is quite possible for a change of Government to take place in .the to Statesat any time, and for the incoming. any Ministers to hold quite adifferent set of opinions from, those entertained by their not predecessors.. Under such circumstances, he did not treat the committee fairly in accepting, the communications, received from ? the various' States Governments as absolutely final, and in endeavouring, fco reverse the decision arived at by the committee the night. . It is very humiliating for the committee to vote in a certain direction today, and in an. opposite direction tomorrow. Such a practice is becoming common in this Chamber. If . the Minister is agreeable to allow the States twelve months to decide whether or not they will embark-, upon the iron, industry, where is the necessity to proceed with this Bill at the present time 1 He coulddrop the in measure-and revive-it next session;",41

Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN "" (Wentprivate worth) - I do not want to prolong the portunity. debate, but I should like to say that the whole of the speeches clearly show absolute want of determinative opinion all sides of the Chamber: There is absolute chaos of opinion, and neither any State nor any individual will be justified attempting to start this industry until a further period has elapsed in which the real opinion, of the country may be made known. Although, perhaps a little humiliating, would, be far better for the Government, as a matter of common sense, to withdraw the Bill. Public opinion may be matured risk between this and next session, or between now and the election, of the next Parliahonorable ment; but the discussion has been of such a character, and there is such uncertainty as to a possible reversal of opinion in Chamber, that to my mind it would be im* possible for a large capitalist; or even, a State, to undertake ironworks until assured coming.law by the results of another election that their position was sound and stable. Mir. KINGSTON - A . proposal has been made that the period during which - the State shall have preference shall be two years, and I have offered to make it one year. In i that action: I think I have; some extent, gone further out of my way than, perhaps, I should have done on calm deliberation ; but I do so for the purpose giving ful l effect to any words which. I uttered last Friday-that is the position, I cannot get away from it. It was not in mind that an amendment of this sort would moved, but when my attention is <;alled to what I . said, I hold to any promise which may have been made ; no member of the Government would be "" worth, his salt"" that who did not do so.

In the current numand ber of; the Windsor Magazine there apmy ;; pears a most important article, which is written by one who is undoubtedly a 11 protectionist- Mr Ernest E.

The writer reminds us that not merely as the possessors of a little territory which we know as the British Isles, but as an Empire, we have a tremagnetic mendous future before, us, and points out that that our hope lies in the development of its mineral resources. If honourable members read that article they will hesitate very Austraha, much before casting a vote which may lead is to the destruction of the Bill before us. M Williams shows that iron, as the material early for our machinery, is almost the best hut measure of our wealth and power, points oufc that in 1870 England produced 6,000,000 tons of iron, as against 4,500,000 tons produced by the United States, GerThose many, and France combined. But in 1901 England and Germany each produced biggest 7,750,000 tons, while the United States duced 15,878,000 tons. We all recollect that Mr Gladstone ridiculed the idea that the United States, under her Tariff laws, could establish effective means of competing with England in the iron industry. Here, however, is proof of the wisdom of the Tariff provisions of the United States. I should like to read a few words from the article, because it in refers directly to these Australian States. This question does not concern Victoria to great any great extent as an iron producer. Vicin toria can hope to benefit fromfcheindustry gives only as a member of the Commonwealth, construct and, though I take no credit for stance, the votes of the Victorian repreI sentatives will be the most unselfish that can possibly be given in any Assembly.",42

He saysThere is hardly a province in the Empire which does not give signs of rich and extensive iron posits. Australasia is full of it ; in three tricts of .New South Wales alone it is estimated that there are 13,000,000 tons of ore, contain- ing nearly 0,000,000 tons of metallic iron. Speaking of the Cloncurry district of Queensland, Mr R. L. Jack, the Government geologist, has said:-""The most striking features of the country are mountains of pure specula and iron ore. . . Ifc is singular to rellecfc these deposits, which, if they were located in England, would he colossal fortunes to their owners, are at present absolutely valueless, owing fco their geographical position."" In Western so large is the quantity of iron that it impossible to work accurately with a magnetic compass. Tasmania's prolific iron deposits r . ceasedfcobe worked after the discovery in the seventies that the ore contained chromium, fchis assumed defect is now declared, by and specialists to be an advantage.",43
179,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The writer of the article is not very much up-to-date. iron deposits of which he speaks are at Ilfracombe, in Tasmania, whereas the deposit, perhaps, in the world is at prothe Blyth River, in that State.",43
180,Mr ISAACS,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The writer shows that the presence of chromium, so far from being a disadvantage, is now regarded as an advantage. Speaking of coal, he saysAnd coal is in equal abundance. Of New South Welsh coal the world is already beginning to hear ; and one runs little risk of exaggeration sayingfchafcthe present yearly output of some 0,000,000 tons is the merest scratching of the body of coal which lies waiting for the pick New South Wales. Western Australia, again, such encouraging promise of coal that the Goveniment has already found it worthwhile to a railway specially for the purpose' of the circumserving one coal-field. read these extracts for the purpose of emphasizing the necessity of not, by any diversity of opinion on details, losing this valuable measure. I ask honourable members"", whatever they do, not by any inadvertence to lose a measure which will ultimately work to the benefit of all Australia. If we can avoid it , I do not want any money to go out of the Commonwealth to private individuals. I much prefer that any one State should keep in its hands the whole profit arising from its mineral deposits, and I shall do nothing to prevent auy State obtaining such benefit, or nothing to place a State in a disadvantageous position as compared with private individuals. But . every State in which there are iron and coal deposits has the power to retain those deposits so far as the land has not already been alienated. de- Every State has the power to dictate the disterms on which its citizen's may work the deposits, and while that power remains, we run no risk, as a Commonwealth, in seeing that the States have the .same opportunities as are given to private individuals. It is misleading to say that we are going to benefit private individuals. Our great primary object is to benefit the people of the Commonwealth as a whole, and if we can only do that by giving inducements to private enterprise as well as to the States, wiry should we be deterred from taking that course? Why should we deprive ourselves .of great benefits merely because some of our citizens may derive advantage? I hopefchafc,whatever happens, we shall not by any slip or accident prevent the development on this continent of an industry khich is the mother of the arts and the source of most of the sciences.",43
181,Mr BROWN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," I hope that the Minister in charge of the Bill has not given his final ultimatum upon the question under consideration. I am glad to know that he is disposed fco.consider the request that has been submitted to him, and I hope that he will be able to gee his way to consentfcofchewhole of fchafc request which, under the circumstances, is not an unreasonable one. The honourable and learned member for Indi has pointed out the great importance of the iron industry, and the desirableness of doing everything within reason to encourage it. I . agree with him as to its importance, and I am desirous of taking such a course as will permit of its development on lines that I believe will be in the best interests of the Commonwealth. - We have nationalized our railway systems, and the States Governments are the great consumers of iron. Therefore, I hold that it is necessary that the Commonwealth should nationalize the iron industry, and take in hand the work of producing iron from native ores. If the Government simply limit themselves to the mere production of the iron that is required in respect of railways and defence equipment, they will effect a saving in regard fco very extensive works. But it is also within the right of the Commonwealth to endeavour to produce iron, not only for its own special requirements, but for general consumption. Therefore when the question of expending the taxpayers' money arises, and one has to choose between granting bonuses for the purpose of assisting private industry and expenditure through State or Federal channels, as the case may be, I prefer to give my support to expenditure under the supervision of the State or Federal Governments. I should prefer to have a proviso in the Bill limiting the bonuses to the States, so that they should not be made available fco private enterprise. I should be willing to let that stand until such time as the people of the States indicated through their Governments that fchey were not prepared as States, to take up the iron industry. Then I should be agreeable to withdraw any opposition I might have offered to private enterprise taking the matter in hand. But the Minister has asked the committee to rescind the decision deliberately arrived at, and has succeeded in carrying what he desired in that respect. The right honourable gentleman cannot, however, shut his eyes to the fact' that with respect, to this matter we have a very strange combination. On the previous occasion votes were cast against the proposal of the Government with a view of defeating the Bill, and in the hope that it would be dropped. Bufc, asfcheGovernment were not prepared to drop their proposals, the ground has been shifted. A number of votes have been recorded for the Government that were cast against them previously. I want fco know whether the Minister for Trade and Customs expects those votes to carry him through ? If so, I venture to prophesy that when the next division takes place he will find that some of those honourable members who previously supported him will vote against him. That conclusion is warranted by the tenor of several of the addresses that have been given. Possibty, the Minister hopes to counteract the loss of votes in that direction by the support he gains from the labour corner. I want to see the iron industry established under State supervision. Bufc as the proposal which I support has been defeated I have ' to face the new position that presents itself. At the outset, I ask the Minister whether ' he is prepared to insert the two. years' proviso II f so, I am willing to support him in his proposal. But, if he insists upon the twelve months' provision, I consider that he will be simply holding out an invitation to the Statesfchafcwill really mean nothing whatever. I will give my reasons for that opinion. The Minister tells us that the States Governments have indicated that they are opposed to undertaking the iron industry. But so far as I can read the communications that have been received, they are really opposed to taking it up at present.",44
182,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,They do not qualify in any way ; they hold out no hope.,45
183,Mr BROWN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The right honourable gentleman says that the States Governments do not qualify their statements in any way, but the impression conveyed to my mind by the communications was that the States Governments were not prepared to take up the industry at present, and that they preferred to see it taken in hand by private enterprise, and supported by Tariff preferences, as well as by bonuses. But I want to invite the Minister's attention to this phase of the question. The New South Wales Government now has in hand the matter of the expiration of the pastoral leases of the northern division which fell in about a couple of years ago. The question is awaiting legislation in respect to future treatment. That legislation waspromised last session, buthad to give way to other legislation dealing with thewestern division of the State, which occupied the greater part of the time. The promise made by the New South Wales Government to the people is that this new comprehensive legislation upon the land question shall be the subject engaging the attention of Parliament for the corning session. It is well known that the land question in New South Wales is very difficult and intricate, that to deal with it requires a whole session, and ""that there is great difficulty in compressing its consideration even within the limits of a session. If a State Government takes up that question it practically means that the whole of the time at the disposal of Parliament will be occupied for the coming year. It is customary for Parliament to prorogue about Christmas, and not meet again until about May. How, therefore, can the New South Wales Parliament be expected to take any effective step with.regard to the iron industry within the next twelve months? But if the two years' limit is - fixed it will give the-people reasonable time to express - their opinions. Further, I should like to remind the Government that within two years this Parliament will have gone to its masters, who, in the meantime, will have had an opportunity to say whetlier those who voted for State enterprise or for private enterprise being assisted in this way meet with public approval. I am prepared to support the two years'"" proposal, and what is more, I am prepared to assist the Minister in carrying his measure if it be adopted. I am not in the position of being a false friend to the measure. I undertake to give the Bill my support light through if the Minister accepts this proposal.",45
184,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"When the honourable member talks of the two years' period, does he mean for the establishment of the in dustry ?",45
185,Mr BROWN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"No , two years within which a State shall have the right to take the work in hand, and within which to satisfy the Commonwealth Government that it seriously intends to establish the iron industry. If , at the end of two years, the States Governments intimate that they do not intend to pursue-the work, - I am prepared to let it be done by private enterprise. But I want the people of the States to have a fair opportunity of saying whether they want the iron industry to be carried on by the States or by private enterprise. For the reasons I have indicated, twelve months is not a sufficient time within which to get an expression of opinion upon this subject from the. people of New South Wales, whilst two years would, I think, be a fairly reasonable time. If the right honourable gentleman insists upon limiting the time to twelve months, I feel that the greater part of that time will have passed away before the State Parliament will have completed the important work Of land legislation at present .pressing upon ifcs attention. Even if it desires seriously to face this question a session in which it can be dealt with cannot be convened before the twelve months is up, and that will be used as an argument against dealing with it at all. All I ask is, that the people of the State shall have a reasonable opportunity to express their wishes on this matter, and that we shall not be tied down to expressions of opinion received from persons who are Premiers today, but who may not be Premiers tomorrow or in a little fcime hence. If a period of two years is provided for, I shall assist the right honourable gentleman to cany the Bill. But if he refuses that, the position I have to face is whether an insufficient time, like twelve months should induce me to support it , or whether it would be wiser to knock the Bill out and leave it an open question until we can deal with it with a greater amount of information as to the feelings of the people upon the subject than we have at the present time.",45
186,Mr HUGHES,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES, I desire to express my regret that I should have done the right honourable the Minister for Trade and Customs so much injustice as to charge him. with having changed his mind from last Friday. I find that my diatribe in so far as that is concerned was inaccurate and ' uncalled for. I find that it was on Thursday the .right honourable gentleman expressed the opinion which I said he expressed on Priday. I therefore have to withdraw the - statement. I made.,46
187,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I acknowledge withdrawal of the honourable member, but if he looks into the matter a Uttle more he will find that it is necessaiy for him to go still further back.",46
188,Mr CONROY,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"- I should like to know exactly the attitude the Government take upon this amendment. At one minute we are told they are going to agree to it and at the next that they are not. They now appear to be trying to find out from the committee in some mysterious way whether a provision for two years' time can be carried against them or not. Surely Ministers should be able to say what they intend to do 1 Is the right lionorable gentleman going tosfcand by his proposalfor twelve months? Apparently, if he finds that there is not quit? a sufficient number to carry the proposalfor two years, he will urge the proposal for twelve months, and if he finds that there will not be a sufficient numberfcocarry that proposal he will-throw it over also-jus t as before, when he discovered that he had six votes to the good, he found that no explanation was needed as to why he changed his opinion. I may be discussing a proposal for two years when the Government, in order-to - save appearances, will accept one year eleven months and twenty-seven days. The Minister appearsfcobe quite indifferent as to - the fate of the Bill, provided he can retain the appearanee of carrying some - measure which will come under the same - heading. Honourable members who are supporting this proposal for a two years' preference for the State, argue, first of all, that 'from the very nature of it the iron industry would be practically a monopoly, and it should not therefore fall into the - hands of private individuals. If it is in the nature of a monopoly, that is no doubt a sound argument in support of the contention that the - States should take it up, but the Minister says that he has certain replies from the State Governments, and that they are not going to deal with it. It is for this reason the right honourable gentleman proposes to hand it over entirely to private individuals. Honourable members ask for a period of preference for the States, and from their point of viewT do not think the two years asked for is .too long. It will be some months before any State Parliament can discuss the. subject and decide whether or not it will deal with it . If the State Parliaments decide to deal with it, some months will necessarily elapse before the the . undertaking can be got into working order. That is a sufficient reason for asking for a period of two years. There is another argument in 'favour of the proposal in the fact that within the next two years general - elections will take place in two or three of the'States, and it maj' be that a State Parliament which at the present time refuses to deal with this matter will then be ready to deal with it . Another argument may be adduced on behalf of the Commonwealth Parliament itself. When the Commonwealth is being asked tavoteaway a very large sum of money-without authority from'the people 1 and without in any - way .consulting the electors, it is only-right that some care should be exercised. Let honourable members look at the effect upon the men who are engaged in the foundry and machine trades for which iron is the raw material, if the industry falls into the hands of private individuals who determine to make 'the most of the monopoly they will have. If the State conducted the industry arguments could be brought to bear to show why the price of the raw material, pig-iron, should be kept as low as possible. In that case other-States would bring arguments to ""bear upon the particular State in which the industry was being carried on. They would be able-to point out that in the interests of the men engaged in their machine shops and foundries it was absolutely necessaiy that their raw material should be-kept as low in price as possible. I can leave it to the committee to say whether, if the industry were in the hands of a private company, those engaged in the trades to which I have referred could go to the company and say, ""This iron which you manufacture is the raw material for industries employing twenty men where you only employ one."" The answer would be, "" We are established here under an Act of Parliament in which it I was promised that bonuses to the amount of .£250,000 would be paid in connection with this industry, and that promise must be carried out."" I think these people would be entitled to contend that a succeeding Parliament was, to a. certain extent, bound by the agreement made. Holding that view, it is perfectly clear that, though I am strongly opposed to the Bill, I must try to insist upon a delay that will give time not only to one person, but to a great many persons to come in and take advantage of its provisions. Let me give another argument which must appeal to those who hold that private enterprise should undertake this work. I cannot but think that two years is not an unreasonable time within which to advertise in the markets of the world an offer of this kind.",46
189,Mr MAUGER,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,The honourable and learned member is wasting our time and the time of the country.,47

The honourable and learned member may consider the ruling a wrong one, but I am sure that he does not suspect either the motives or the impartiality of the Chairman.",47

212,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," I do not wish to unduly prolong the debate, but there is a principle involved in the action of the Minister for Trade and Customs this afternoon which does not commend itself to my political intelligence, and I therefore, wish to say a few words on the matter. On a former occasion the honourable member for Bland carried an amendment restricting the granting of bonuses to the Governments of States, and this afternoon, after a debate which has extended over some days, the Minister succeeded in rescinding that amendment. Now, however, we are asked to consider another amendment which, though different from, is very similar to the proviso which has just been struck out, ancl the Minister has swung round as quickly as a gale at sea, ancl proposes to accept what the committee thought they had decided, when agreeing to his amendment this afternoon, not to accept. How am I , in this chaotic presentment of circumstances, to exercise my intelligence and experience on behalf of my constituents and my country ? It must be remembered that this is not a Parliament of a State, but a. much higher political body. The kernel of whab I desire to speak aboub-bh e lack of party cohesion and party sympabhy --ha s been the subject of former speeches. Honourable members will remember that I have before called attention to the absence of caucuses. I ask Ministers if there has ever been a caucus held by the party which is keeping the Government in office 1 Not the ghost of one.",48
213,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,They think that they have to do is to crack the whip and the party will respond.,48
214,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I that am the quietest member of this House, but my political vitality and instincts rise bellion against what has taken place in this 42 p chamber within the last few hours. The action of the Minister is an outrage upon those who have consistently supported them in power.",48
215,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,The honourable and learned member should have listened to the Minissatisfied 1 ter's speech on Priday.,48
216,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I did listen to it , and though I have always listened to his speeches with pleasure, I say that this is riot a question of speechmaking. A great principle is involved. The Ministry ask us now to vote for what they were originally opposed to, and therefore I think it is about time thab some of us retired from our present position, as supporters of the Government. ' We have given the Ministry consistent support, and have very frequently abstained from expressing our opinions in order to facilitate business, and many of us find it difficult to comprehend the action of the Government in ignoring the existence of their followers. A spirit of tyranny exists amongst Ministers worse than that which characterized the Cissars. The Emperors of Rome did take some of their supporters into their counsels, but the Ministry treat their followers with scorn.",48
217,Mr GB EDWARDS,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," The amendment proposed by the honourable member for Kennedy affords me an opportunity to place myself in the position which I have desired to occupy from the outset. As I intimated in my speech upon the second reading of this Bill, I am not in accord with those free-traders who consistently oppose bonuses. I believe that they offer the best means of affording assistance to the iron industry, but I am afraid that we may ultimately find that we shall have to pay too dearly for our whistle, in - the shape of the further protection that ib may be necessary bo exbend bo the indusbry. The amend menb will meeb my views far more closely than did the proposal of the honourable member for Bland, under which private enterprise would have been entirely blocked. I do not agree wibh those free-traders who are opposed to all forms of State enterprise of all this characber, nor do I bhink thab the position they assume is an entirely logical one. One honourable member contended the State administration of the railways had not been entirely successful, even in reunder railway commissioners. I think, however, that the railways in some of the States have been very successfully managed in deed ; and so far as tramway management is concerned, I think that any comparison between the private and State-owned systems in operation in Melbourne and Sydney respectively must result in favour of the latter. No tramway enterprise in Australia has been so successful as that of Sydney.",48
218,Sir MALCOLM MCEACJIAKN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The Sydney tramways return only 3 56 per cent, upon the capital outlay.",49
219,Mr GB EDWARDS,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member seems to think that the' Sydney tramways are not successful because they only return 3'56 per cent., but he must mit that they give the cheapest and best travelling facilities in Australia.",49
220,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,That is correct.,49
221,Mr GB EDWARDS,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"It is in the character of the facilities afforded to travelling public that the public of Sydney rive the full benefit. If the tramways return more thansufneient to pay the interest money borrowed for their construction, afford cheap travelling facilities, and tend - to improve the value of suburban properties, they must be regarded as successful.",49
222,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,There is no analogy between providing travelling facilities and establishing the iron industry.,49
223,Mr GB EDWARDS,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"It is rather late in the day to debate the abstract question of State versus private enterprise. I firmly believe that the whole world is progressing in the direction of the State control of all works of general utility, and I do not regret that this principle is being extended, because so long as we develop in that direction slowly enough, no danger need be apprehended. The manufacture of the iron is an enterprise upon which the State Government might fairly embark. U p to the present time, private capitalists have not entered upon it, and as we all - wish to see it established, we might legitimately trust the States to undertake it . By adopting the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Kennedy, we shall, I believe do good in all directions, and I cannot see why the Government should oppose it . The Minister has told us that he has no objection to the States entering upon .this industry, and his only reply ,to those who were content to leave the matter to the States was that the States Governments had intimated that there was no immediate probability of their taking the matter up. Upon this ground, and no other, he declined to restrict the enterprise to State control. It must be admitted, however, that the replies of certain Premiers who hold ofiice at present cannot be taken to represent the voice of the people. If we allow the States two years in which to make up their minds, we can settle the question of whether the people desire that another socialistic experiment shall be made, or that the establishment - of ironworks shall be left to private enterprise. To that extent we are bound to consult the people in each adof the States. The honourable and learned member for Parkes suggested that some constitutional difficulty might arise if we not granted bonuses to certain States and taxed others in order to provide the necessary money. I protested at one time the against the imposition of customs duties dethat were not intended for revenue, hut for purely protective purposes, as being opposed on the to the spirit of the Constitution. The and bonuses now proposed are nothing but the converse of the protective duties provided for in the Tariff; and if it is - wrong to tax the people of one State in order to secure - the establishment of the manufactures in another, it must be equally wrong to impose protective duties upon all the States for the benefit of the manufacturers of Victoria. Another advantage of the proposal which we are now considering is, that if we allow the - States two years within which to decide whether they will embark upon the manufacture of iron, we shall probably not be called upon to provide the funds necessary for the bonuses for at least another year. This delay will enable us to make more suitable financial arrangements than would otherwise be possible. The Government have supplied us witli no data upon which we can determine whether the circumstances of the Commonwealth will enable us to pay these large bonuses. At any rate we might well defer the consideration of this measure for one or two years. I cannot understand how, in the light of his previous utterances, the right honourable gentleman in charge of the Bill can oppose an amendment in the direction of placing the iron industry under State control. H he is sincere in this matter he will surely agree to allow a reasonable time to. elapse within which pressure can be brought to bear upon the States' Governments to induce them to take up this work. If they still decline to do so, our position will tben be no worse, and we shall be able to consider this Bill with a much better knowledge of the facts than we have at present. Mr KIN GST ON - I think that I am entitled to say another word or two for a variety of reasons, one of which is the interest that I have taken in this Bill from first to last, and which I do not think any honourable member will venture to dispute. I have done what I could for the purpose of making the position of the Government as clear as is the noonday sun. Any honourable member who has been in the Chamber during the debates upon this question must agree that we left no room for doubt that above all things we desired to .witness the early establishment of the iron industry. That was the chief object which we had in view. We did not fail, to indicate that we should prefer to see the industry established by a State on behalf of all its people rather than by. any company, which, however large, could not hope to rival the State industry in extent or in the area over which the benefits of the concession would be distributed. ""Does any honorablo member suggest that we did not speak plainly in that connection ? I knownothing which I have omitted to do, and which could have been done, to insure the successful passing of the Bill upon those lines. I ask the honourable member for South Sydney-and I do not speak in the slightest degree with intent to leave any cause for regret-wha t is his position in regard to this matter? To-day he practically reproaches us with the fact that the Bill is not in the best shape. That is the reproach which he ventures to cast upon the Government of the day. I tell him that it is not our fault; it is his. We proposed the very thing which today he advocates, and in each instance he voted against it. Here it is recorded in black, and white, on the 19th of June, page 13941 of Hansard. Upon the division which took place as to whether a preference of two years should be given to the States to undertake the work if they so pleased, the Government supporting it and doing all they could for the' purpose of carrying it , we find it recorded - that the vote of the honourable member for South Sydney was cast against us. * Mr G.<B. EDWARDS - That is right.",49
224,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Of course, it is right as a quotation, but is it right when the honourable member rises in his place and 43 J? 2 reproaches us-as he has done to-nightfor not moving in a certain direction? I say that the fault, at least, is his. We tried to do so weeks ago, and he did his best for the purpose of preventing our desires from being carried out. Similarly as regards the question of confining the Bill to the States. We voted against that proposal, and he voted in favour of it . Under such circumstances, how does it lie in his mouth to reproach us. The honourable and learned member for Brisbane has said that the Government have turned round, and that he cannot conceive of any reason for it. Of course he cannot if he is absent from the Ohamber and does not know what is going on. We have not held caucuses, and I do not know that I believe in them.",50
225,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,The Government are not going bo tyrannise over me.,50
226,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"We have no desire to tyrannise. We believe that open debate is in many respects preferable to secret caucuses, and we plead guilty to the fact that we have not held caucuses of the character to which he referred.",50
227,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,J3u t the Minisber has wribben to honourable members asking them to support him upon this measure.,50
228,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Why should I not do so ? Does that acfc constitute a caucus ? If a Minister is to be refused the liberty of writing bo Governmenb supporters calling bheir attention to arguments in favour of any Bill, we have arrived at a pretty state of things. But I do not think that time has come yet. As regards the statement of the honourable and learned member for' Brisbane that he never heard of our proposal to restrict priority to the States to a period of years, I wish to say that we attempted to give effect to it in this House two or three weeks ago.",50
229,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,And abandoned it .,50
230,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"We did not abandon, it ; we were beaten. As regards those who are really interested in this industry' I sympathize deeply with the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Indi. I put it again-""Le t us be-careful that we do not, upon a matter of detail, Split those who are in favour of the cause, and lose that which we desire to see carried out."" No doubt there are various ways of injuring a Bill. We have had instances in this Chamber of honourable members voting upon the same side when there has been absolutely no sympathy between them in the attainment of a common object. There are mem-, bers who voted to confine the object of the Bil l to the States, but who had not the slightest desire to see it carried.",50
231,Mr BKOWN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Now the Minister.wishes to use those votes to defeat the decision of the committee.,51
232,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I desire to use them to prevent the Bill from being made a farce.,51
233,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Did not the Minister promise that he would put the Bil l through upon the lines of the amendment proposed the honourable member for Bland ?,51
234,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I did.,51
235,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Now the right honorto support it . able gentleman reverses his decision.,51
236,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Yes , when there is no reasonable prospect of the States embarking upon the industry at an early date. When the facts are not found to be as I fondly hoped they would, should be worse than a dolt some extent, alter my attitude to meet the newly-revealed condition of affairs. The Government have given a reason for their actions, and the committee, I have supported them. Ought we now upon mere matter of detail-the question of period within which the States must avail themselves of the privileges conferred by the Bill - to risk losing it altoto them ? gether ? I hope we shall not be guilty of any such egregious folly, and I do ask honourable members who really desire to see enterprise undertaken-preferabl y by the States, but who wish to see it established in any circumstances-no t to lend themselves to the wishes of those who have no symifc. pathy with the measure before us.",51
237,Mr MCDONA LD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES, Through out his remarks the right honourable gentleman has not told the committee what are his intentions.,51
238,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I said before the journment for dinner that I intended oppose giving the States two years' priority, but was willing to consent to granting them one year.",51
239,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The Minister therefore going back .upon his original posal. When he is prepared to accept one year, why cannot he lay the Bill aside t i l next session.",51
240,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,The honourable member is entirely opposed to the Bill - tha,51
241,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I am opposed to allowing any one to embark upon the enterprise other than the States. The right honourable gentleman told us that he would rather see the States undertake the work.,51
242,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I said so, and I do not want to qualify my statement one bit.",51
243,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The right honourable gentleman endeavours to qualify a good many of his remarks. He says he believes in-the States undertaking this work, and adds a "" but,"" which nullifies all his previously expressed opinions. He has been so anxious to get this measure through-for by what reason I do not know-that he has actually gone to the trouble of writing to a number of honourable members, asking them",51
244,Mr BRUCE SMITH,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Did he send a I find that printed circular ?,51
245,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"No , I saw a communication in his own handwriting, asking au honourable member to support this Bill. I . Mr KINGSTON - Who are the men ? Out if I did not, to with the names.",51
246,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The right honourable gentleman does not deny it . A few moments ago he said that he did not believe in am happy to say, secret caucuses. a - Mr KINGSTON - Ou t with it-to whom the did I write? Was it not to Mr Watkins?",51
247,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"That is one, is it?",51
248,Mr MCCAY,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Why should he not write,51
249,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Who are the others ?,51
250,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,The right honour the able gentleman knows to whom he wrote. I clo not object to his writing to them.,51
251,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,The honourable member is endeavouring to make something oufc of Let him show me that I wrote to any one whom I had not the right to address - in terms of the greatest friendship.,51
252,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I only wish to show how anxious the right honourable gentleman is to carry this Bil l in its original form. adYet when the amendment of the honourable to member for Bland was carried, he asked honourable members to assist him in passing the measure in that form, so as to give a knock-out blow to those who had opposed it. is Personally, I was agreeable to do that. proBut there has been a change of front on the part of the Ministei , from what cause 1 unI do not know. Perhaps it is due. to the fact-as was pointed out by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa t some of the newspapers have been successful in influencing certain members to reverse their previous votes. What I complain of is the twisting and turning about on the part of the Minister. Such conduct is being carried so far that we do not know from hour to hour what the Government policy is.",51
253,The CHAIBMAN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I must ask the honourable member not to pursue that line of argument further.,52
254,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I hope the amendment will be carried and that honourable members will not allow themselves to be whipped into line for the sake of certain people who specially desire this concession. I understand that if the amendment is carried it may interfere with certain individuals who have almost floated companies to carry on this industry. Mr.BiicCE SMITH - Floate d them in their own interest.,52
255,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I do not object to people floating companies in their own interest; probably I should do the same if I were in their position. But it is not a proper thing to do; and the passing of the Bil l at the present moment will only assist those people to float their companies to greater advantage. If a company had been formed, and were prepared to carry on the industry straight away, I do not know that I should have objected so strongly; but neither the Federal Government nor the States Governments ought to grant concessions to assist people in floating companies to greater advantage. I gave a fair illustration the other night, which I think can be borne out by the honourable member for Melbourne. The Chillagoe concession was the means of enabling certain individuals in Melbourne to make a considerable amount of money, leaving the "" babj to be nursed "" by others. The Chillagoe syndicate could not have made the thousands of pounds they did had it not been for the concessions from the Government, and similar results will follow the granting of the concession now proposed. Mi'. KINGSTON - It is abominable to have suggestions made, in regard to letters written by Ministers to honourable members, and I cannot understand why such allusions should be made by the honourable member for Kennedy. Surely Ministers have a right to communicate with whom they please. Does the honourable member suggest that the letters were such as ought not to have been written ? References of the kind should not be made unless the documents are produced and some charge formulated. I have written to honourable members, amongst them the honourable member for .Newcastle and the honourable member for Bland.",52
256,Mr AVATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The Minister did write to me, but there was nothing in the letter to which anybody could object.",52
257,Mr KENNEDY,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I am not objecting to the contents of the letters.,52
258,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Then , why should the honourable member talk about the letters 1 These references are indulged in with the object of strengthening the case of the honourable member, and of throwing dirt at the Government, and if they mean anything they mean a .suggestion of infamy, which no man worthy to be called a man ought to make unless he is prepared to produce the letters and sheet home a charge. The reason the honourable member has not made a charge is that he cannot do so. I never held conversations with honourable members, or wrote letters of which I have reason to be ashamed ; and it is too bad that such conduct should be indulged in for the purpose of discrediting Ministers.",52
259,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES, I am rather surprised at the heat shown by the Minister. There is probably more in the letters than honourable members seem to think.,52
260,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Produc e the letter of which you spoke.,52
261,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I have not the letter. , Mr KINGSTON - Then let any lionorable member who has the letter produce it .",52

263,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Who was it ?,52
264,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I shaU not tell the right honourable gentleman. When I said that these letters had been written, I did not impute any motive to the Minister.",52
265,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Then why mention the letters 1,52
266,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I said that the right honourable gentleman was very anxious to get this measure tlirough.,52
267,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I have shown that anxiety in the House.,52
268,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"And as evidence of that anxiety I said that the Miuister had written letters to certain honourable members, and I mentioned the case of which I had knowledge.",52
269,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member means a lot more, but he has not the pluck to say what he means.",53
270,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"There is no need for Mahon, the right honourable gentleman to get so Spence, W. C. heated. I should not have mentioned the MCLean, F. E. letters had the Minister not said he did not Wilks, W . H . believe in secret caucus meetings. It was then I asked about the writing of the lettei-s, which I regard as equal to the holding of anj' secret meeting.",53
271,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Who was the honourable member to whom I wrote ?,53
272,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I shall not satisfy months. the Minister's curiosity. As to manliness, when I do anything of an unmanly character I ask the right honourable gentleman to remind me of it. I do not propose lessons in manliness froni him.",53
273,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,It is not that the honourable member does not need them.,53
274,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"That may be so. was There are some people who need lessons and know it, and others who equally bnt do not know it . Amongst the latter is probably the right honourable gentleman.",53

276,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES, I understood the Minister to say that he would insert some words providing for a period of twelve,53
277,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"What I said, plainly, was that if honourable members would accept a period of twelve months, I would make a fco take proposal to that effect.",53
278,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,What does that mean ?,53
279,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"There was some dispute as to what we should do. A. proposal made for a period of, two years, and I ofiered to make it twelve months, but the need them offer was not accepted . 1",53
280,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I did not understand the Minister to say what he has just,53
281,Mr KINGSTON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,I think the honourable to be member heard what I said.,53
282,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I understood that the Minister was going to be consistent with the attitude he took up on Friday. He is ... 20 reported in the proofs of Hansard, which ... 26 have not yet been published, as saying that he intended to give the States a prior opportunity to take up the iron industry. AYI Now he puts it forward that that statement was merely an-, offer of a compromiseas against the two years proposal. I certainly did not understand it as. such, and I do not know that any other honourable member did. If the Minister has become alarmed at the probable defection of some of his more prominent conservative supporters, it is a different matter, but my impression was that he would give the committee an opNOES. i. portunity of voting for twelve months r M . as the time within which the States could take up the proposal. Further than that he emphasized that view. I fchink I remember the right honourable gentleman saying that he would support a proposal for giving the Statesa twelve months option. Sir WILLIAM : MCMIELAN - If so, he could havemoved an amendment.",53
283,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The proposal could have been made either as an addendum to the clause or as a new clause. The committee should have an. opportunity of voting on the suggestion the Minister put forward. I do not think twelve months is sufficient time to enable the people of the States to: be consulted on the matter, and to express their opinion, clearly and distinctly. Tl the Bill is to go through, I prefer some such restriction as will give the people time bo burn round sooner bhan have the Bill passed in its present shape. It is due to the committee that the Government should express clearly what they meant a little while ago.",53

285,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," When we last - dealt with the Electoral Bill lasb week, I said that I would submit the whole measure to a careful examination, so as to make it as complete as possible before it left this Chamber to be returned to the Senate. I have gone through the whole Bill with the Parliamentary Draftsman, and I shall have to move a good many amendments, which are, for the most part, more technical than otherwise, though one or two are of imbe - portance. The course I propose bo bake is to go into committee again for the reconChamber. sideration of the clauses in which amendments have to be made. I do not think this reconsideration will occupy much time. I moveThiib the Bill be recommitted to a Committee of the whole Blouse for the reconsideration clauses 33, 47, 80, 98A, 90, .1.05, 1J4, 114B, .146, 173, 174, 178, 197, 197A, .197*, 197i, Forms K, M, N, Q, and K, and new clause 19A.",54

287,Mr BATCHELOR,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"South Australia) I move That clauses 43 and 74 and Form P be also recommitted.  amendments to be proposed by the Minister have not been circulated for a sufficient period to give honourable members an opportunity of seeing whether they cover all the objections to the Bill. I am under the impression that the Bill requires two new schedules. I understand that there is no schedule providing for the issue of wribs by eibher the Speaker or the Presidenb of the Senabe. The Consbibubion provides that, ab cerbain times wribs may be issued by either the President or the Speaker, and there needs to be a form for the purpose. I understand also that by certain powers we are proposing to take under this Bill, we are usurping Sbate righbs in connection wibh elections in cerbain. cases. I do nob know whebher the honourable member for Soubh Australia, Mr Glynn, has included the clauses raising that question.",54

289,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"If there is found to anything special to do, it will be easy to further 'recommit before the Bill leaves the  I shall not raise any further objection.",54
290,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," I point 'out to the Minister that bhere was an amendment made in clause 8 permitting of a polling place to be outside of an electorate. 130, This was done for reasons which I gave 1970, before that amendment was accepted, and I understood that the Bill was to be brought into conformity with it. The clauses which for the Minister proposes to recommit do not I decover the clauses which require to be veras bally amended in consequence of the amendment made in clause 8. Does the honourable 213, and gentleman wish that I should move the recommittal of those clauses 1 Sir WILLIAM, LYNE - It is stated to me by the draftsman that clause 26, where the word "" for "" is used, gives the necessary I power to carry out the honourable member's proposal, andfchafcis the reason I have not askedfchafcthe clauses to which he has referred should be recommitted.",54
291,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I am willing to accept that if in committee it is found to be the case, but in the meantime I had better move the recommittal of the half-dozen clauses affected.",55
292,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"If there is found to be any doubt about it, I shall not lefc the Bill go witliout dealing with the matter.",55
293,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The trouble is that I cannot call attention fco tliese clauses in committee unless fchey are recommitted. I therefore move,That clauses 7, 9, 27, 106, 140A, 16.1, and 172 be also recommitted ",55
294,Mr DEAKIN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," If the matter with which the honourable member desires fco deal has reference to the proposal fco vote for an electorate instead of in an electorate, I can assure him that it is provided for. If the honourable member will look afc clause 26 he will see that the expression "" for an electorate "" is used. Under that clause it will be possible to appoint such polling places for each division as may be considered to be necessary.",55
295,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Ye s ; bufc there are other clauses which require to be consequentially amended.,55
296,Mr DEAKIN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"I should like to see them before passing an opinion, but am uncler the impression that clause 26 is ample to cover all the honourable member desires there.",55
297,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Macquarie) The Minister in charge of the Bill promised to recommit clause 151, relating to voting for the Senate.",55
298,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,No . We had a full debate upon that extending over hours.,55
299,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"If the honourable member cares to look. up Hansard, he will find that the Minister promised the - honourable member for Werriwa' that the clause would be recommitted. The matter was decided in a very small House. I move That clauses .151 and 152 be also recommitted.",55
300,Mr WATSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," I trust the House will not agree to recommit clause 151. We debated the question as to how electors should vote for the Senate. during almost a whole day. We finally came to a decision one way, and now the honourable member desires to go into the whole' question again. It is quite fair to recommit clauses in connection with which some matter may have slipped through, or where some necessary consequential amendment has to be considered, but I see no wisdom in going over the whole ground of the Electoral Bil l again. I might with just as much reason ask the House to recommit the clauses dealing with voting by post. It is not fair to recommit clauses involving large questions of principle which have been debated hour after hour, and I shall divide the House on the proposal to recommit clause 151. Question-Thaf c the Bill be recommitted to a committee of the whole House for the reconsideration of clauses 7, 9, 27, 33, 43, 47, '74, SO, 98A, 99, 105, 106, 108, 114,, 114B, 130, 140A, 142, 146, 152, 161, 164, 165, 172, 173, 174, 178, 197, 197A, 1 9 7 E , 197F, 197Q, 213, Eorms G, K , M , N , P, Q, and R of the Schedule, and for the reconsideration of new clause 19A-resolve d in the affirmative.",55
301,Mr CONROY,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," I pointed, out that the Government have already agreed to recommit clause 151, and I trust that the proposal will be' agreed to .without a division. The question was decided when fchere was not a full attendance of members present, and infchisdemocratic country what we are anxious to do is to ascertain the wishes of the representatives .of the people, when there is a full attendance of members present. If the full sense of the committee had been . taken upon this matter I should not urge its reconsideration. I understand that many honourable members are anxious that the question should come beforefchemagain, and I hope an opportunity will be afforded honourable members in a full House to say what they really think upon the subject.",55
302,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES, Ifc is rather an unusual course for the honourable member for-Bland to object to the recommittal of this clause when the Government have given their sanction to ifcs recommittal.,55
303,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,What I said was that I should not oppose it.,55
304,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"When the Minister in charge of a Bill says that he will not oppose the recommittal of a clause, it means that, so far as he is concerned, he agrees to ifcs recommittal. I do not anticipate that there will be any long debate upon the subject if the clause is recommitted. Of coursefchehonorable member for Bland will be quite within his right in insisting upon a vote; bufc it will be very curious treatment of the honourable member for Macquarie iffchereis any opposition to the recommittal of the clause.",55
305,Mr MCDONALD,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," If there is to be no debate upon the matter when the clause is recommitted, we might as well take the division now. If honourable members cannot carry the recommittal of the clause, fchey will not be able to carry the amendment fchey desire to make. I do not altogether object to the recommittal, but it is not wise to recommit clauses merely for the purpose of further discussion when there is no possible hope that any amendment of them will be carried. If fchere is not some probability of the previous decision arrived at being reversed, we might just as well refuse to recommit the clause.",56
306,Mr BATCHELOR,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"South Australia) I join with the honourable member for Bland in objecting altogether to the recommittal of this clause. It involves a matter of principle which was debated here for a whole day. A final decision was arrived at upon it after one offchemost exhaustive discussions which have taken place on this Bill, i There was a good attendance of members present, and even a much better attendance than usual, and allfchevotes were accounted for. I ask whether fchere is going fco be any finality to the discussion of this Bil l about some matters upon which I and those who think with me were defeated, as honourable members can feel aboutfchisclause, bufc I do not ask forfcherecommittal of the clauses in which I am concerned. I think we ought not to be continually debating matters of principle which have been previously discussed and decided, in the hopefchafcsome honourable member will change his mind.",56
307,Mr KENNEDY,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," In my opinion, the whole Bill should be recommitted if it is thought.desirable to recommit clauses which have been fully discussed and dealt with, as fchis has. The only clauses which should be recommitted are those upon which finality was not reached at a previous stage, and in regard to which the Minister promised to bring down further proposals. I shall oppose the recommital, in the interests of despatch. Question-That clause 151 be added to the clauses recommitted-resolve d in the affirmative. In Committee (Second Recommittal) : Clause 7There shall be a divisional returning officer . . . . charged with the duty of giving effect to this Act within his division",56
308,Mr THOMSON,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," I moveThafcfchewords "" or for "" be inserted after the word "" within."" Clause 8 was amended so that in certain cases polling places may be proclaimed outside the division which they are intended to serve. Thus, it may be more convenient to have a polling place for a division in a township which lies jusfc outside the borders of that division than within the division, while the amendment will also provide for a practice which has prevailed in Sydney, where a polling place has been proclaimed afc the terminal jetty for the electors of an adjoining electorate coming from the various river suburbs at which the ferry-steamer has touched. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 9 and 27 consequentially amended, and agreed to.",56
309,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,Perhaps the Chairman will make any further consequential amendments that may be necessary ?,56
310,The ACTING CHAIRMAN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," As I take it to be the wish of the committee, I will do so. Clause 33 (Persons entitled to have their 1 I feel as strongly names on roll).",56
311,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," I moveThatfchefollowing words be added, "" Provided fchafc any senator or member of the House of Representatives shall, if he so desires, he entitled fco have his name placed on and retained onfcheroll for the division in which he lived at the time of his election instead of the rol for the division in 1 which he lives."" 1 This proviso is added so that the names of members of this Parliament who are compelled, in the performance of their duties, to live where it.is in the habit of meeting, may not have their names struck off the rolls for the divisions which they represent. Some honourable members who live in Melbourne have already been threatened with that penalty. - Mr Glynn (South Australia) - The need of this proviso has been brought about by the use of the word "" lives,"" throughout the Bill, in place of the word ""resides."" Sir WILLI AM LYNE - No ; the reason for it arose before the Bill was framed.",56
312,Mr GLYNN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"The word "" resides "" has a very different meaning from the word ."".lives."" A Judge would hesitate to say that a membei resided in Melbourne, although he might live here. The Minister, by this proviso, is giving members of this Parliament the option of having their; names enrolled either in Melbourne or for a division in another State. I appeal to him to substitute the word ""resides"" for the word "" lives"" throughout both this Bill and the Franchise Act. The word ""lives"" is not used in any Electoral Act with which I am acquainted.",57
313,Mr THOMA S,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," I am in sympathy with the purpose of the amend^menfc, but I should like to know how it will work. It will, of course, not affect the State electoral rolls, but suppose that a member representing one of the divisions of Sydnejtook a house in Melbourne and lived here, how would he meet the requirements of the nomination paper in regard to the matter ""of residence ? I take it that he would have to say that he resided in Melbourne, whereas his qualification would be his enrolment in Sydney. Sir ""WILLIAM LYNE - Yes , but a member's name might be struck off the roll for the division in which he formerly resided.",57
314,Mr THOMAS,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Eve n if that happened he could have himself enrolled in Melbourne foi the division in which he resided. Mr HENBY ""WILLIS - Not made application to be enrolled.",57
315,Mr THOMAS,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Of course,, he would have to apply fco be enrolled. If a Member of Parliament will not takefchetrouble involved in making such an application, how can we expect other people to do so?

317,Mr ISAACS,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," I do not know whether this clause will operate exactly as the Minister desires. For the first Parliamenbfcherewill be no difficulty - If a member from. Queensland came to bourne, would he have the right on being re-elected fco retain his name on the roll the division which he represents ?",57
318,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Yes . Mr IS AA CS - There will be many cases such as I have, mentioned, but those honourable members whose rights we specially desirefcoconserve will derive little or no benefit from this clause. What we desire to do is to allow a member to retain his connection with the electorate he represents, and I see no other course open than to provide that a member offcheHouse of Representatives shall be entitled to have his name retained upon, the roll cf the electorate which he represents, whilst a senator shall have a similar right in regard to his State.",57
319,Mr BROWN,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," It is very necessary that some provision, of this kind, should be made. My own case is no doubt similar to that of many other honourable members. I do not quite know where my home is. I regard as my home the electorate I represent, because there lie all my interests outside of politics. I find it necessary to travel-to Sydney every week. Thus I spend three days of everv week in Melbourne, two days in the train, and two days in Sydney, and I am very seldom at home. In New Soutli Wales the point has been raised fchafc a man's domicile is the .place where his wife resides, whilst on the other hand it has been held that the wife's domicile is where her husband lives. If the place where a man's unless he wife resides is fco be regarded as his domicile, it will be necessary for some members of this Chamber to change tlieir' residence every month, if not every week. I am entirely in sympathy with the object of the amendmen t, because in the absence of some such provision a great deal of confusion and difficulty will arise.",57
320,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"In order to meet the objections which have been raised, I desire to omit the word ""the ""before the word "" division,"" witli a view to insert the word ""any,"" and to omit the words "" in he livedat the time of his election "" with a view to insert the words "" he represents.""

342,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Macquarie) In view of the attitude taken up by the Government in connection with the previous clause, it is my intention to move an amendment upon this clause which will raise the whole question, and I therefore ask the Minister to agree to adjourn now, because there will be a debate upon the question. I desire to get an expression of opinion upon a matter which has not so far been fairly dealt with. I do not impute motives to any honourable members, but the vote previously LYNE ) taken upon the amendment moved in clause 151 was decided by sixteen to nineteen, and a there were several pairs, in which the names "" or of members Were given for the amendment by mistake. I move:That the words "" In the case of the Senate the voters shall vote for the full number of candidates to be elected, and "" be inserted at the commenceWhat is an ment of the clause. paraWhat I propose was provided for in clause as originally introduced by the Government, and it was only defeated by three survotes in a thin House. I do not propose to debate the question at length, but I leave honourable members to test the question by a division upon the amendment.",60
343,Mr CONROY,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES," There can be very little doubt that the better place in length. which to have inserted this amendment was ;lt the end of clause 151, where it stood the Bill as originally introduced by the vernment. The clause, as originally introduced, was carried against the Government up? by a vote of nineteen to sixteen, and, including pairs, only 47 members voted, leaving 28 members of the House unaccounted for the question. in the division. It is also asserted that at least two or three honourable members, who were prepared to support as it originally stood, were wrongly paired upon this question of plumping. The Government have been asked to recomi Mr WATSON - Although mit the clause that there might be an opi portunity given to get an - expression of opinion on the subject in a full submit to the Minister in charge of the Bill | that at 11 o'clock it is hardly fair to go with the consideration of this subject This is a very important question, and it was previously decided by 35 members actually voting, and when there were members absent. If a vote had been token on the question in a full House I should not object. I think it not an unreasonable request to ask fhat we should adjourn, commit the clause. because I confess that if we took a vote upon the amendment now there | sight. would be a great many members absent. > I clo not think that fchere should be any plumping for the Senate. While we are perfectly within our rights in arranging the details of elections for the Senate, I doubt the propriety of amending a provision which has already been agreed to 'by that body. In my opinion, electors should be compelled to vote for the full number of candidates to be elected, and the majority should rule. A provision which will allow plumping will provide for the introduction of all the-evils of what is known as the machine system of politics, and then it will be good-byefcofair representation.",61
344,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES,"Macquarie) I am strongly of opinion that a division the vacant seats. should not be taken upon fchis question tonight.
