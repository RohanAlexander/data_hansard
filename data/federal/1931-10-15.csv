STEWART -- tions Mr SCuXLIN (Yarra--Prime Minister [2.32],-It is with very deep regret that .1 announce that the honourable mem-)  died last night. He was with us onlylast week. We knew that he had long; suffered a physical ailment, but to thoseof us who came into close contact with him lately, he appeared in better health than he had enjoyed for some' years, and to have recovered some of his old-time vigour. Therefore, the news of his sudden death caused a shock to everyone of us. How bravely he bore biophysical disabilities is known to those who knew him intimately. He stuck to> his work when many a man would havegiven in ; he carried out his duties to hisconstituency and to the country at largewith unflagging zeal. I think that every raember of this Parliament could claim, him as a friend. The parliamentary career of the latehonorable gentleman reflects credit upon; him and upon the legislatures of which, he was a member. He was first: elected to represent Swan H i ll ins the Legislative Assembly of Victoria in 1917. Two years later he entered' this Parliament as member for Wimmera r and he represented that constituency continuously until his death. Mr.. Stewart held office as Minister for Works and Railways, and was President of the River Murray Waters Commission from the 9th February, 1923,.' to the 5th August, 1924. It was. his privilege to turn the first sod iru connection with the laying of the foundations of this Parliament House. By every one of us he was recognized as an excellent debater, bringing to bear on. every subject a keen analytical mind, and never speaking unless he had something: worthwhile to contribute to the debate. Many a shrewd and forceful blow he struck in political warfare, but never a one. He was an energetic man. despite his illness, and was ever ready topromote the cause of the primary producers, whom he specially represented in. this Parliament. He served the public in many ways, and set a fine example to his fellow citizens, both in and out of Parliament. Apart from his merits as. , a public man, he had personal qualificawhich won for him the respect and sadmiration, and even the affection, of all it who knew him intimately. His death is la national loss, and a great personal loss to each one of us. This chamber will know him no more; but. though men may come and men may go, few will leave such a lasting impression in the hearts and minds of the members of this Parliament as the gentleman whose passing we mourn today. I move-by leaveTliat this House expresses its deep regret at the death of the Honourable Percy Gerald Stewart, member for Wimmera in the Representatives, and a former Minister of the Crown, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, aud tenders its - profound sympathy to his widow in her (bereavement.",10
2,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Cowper) [2.36] I second the motion which has been - eloquently moved by the Prime Minister, - and desire to associate all the members - of the Country party, which has been ""hereft of the services of Mr Stewart, w the expression of sympathy with his ""widow. We deplore the loss his death has caused to the councils of this nation, and especially the councils of the country movements. Mr Stewart was an outstanding country .figure. Ho was one of the founders of t""he Country party in both the Victorian aud federal spheres, and a pioneer memoutstanding iber of it in the Victoria n and Commonable - wealth Parliaments. W it h burning elodisplay quence, which was expressive of his sonal experience of the hardships that are forms of the country. l if e along the frontiers of civilization, organized the pioneers of the Mallee, brought their plight before his colleagues in Parliament, and the public of AusI tralia, in a way that has never been equalled. H is home far tin object lesson to his neighbours. It was a model property, on which cultural experiments were conducted by the DepartUnited ment of Agriculture, with a, view to .demonstrating to the farmers in the .district the results that could be achieved hy the adoption of scientific methods. The physical ailment from which Mr . Stewart suffered for many yearswould have deterred an ordinary man tering public life, but his indomitable will .'and energy drove his f r a i l body to bear the strain of travelling, public speaking, and research, which would have killed ^of less spirit and resolution. ' I had the . privilege of being his colleague i . Cabinet and in the Country party, and . partner in private business. In all activities be displayed great vigour mind, a quick intelligence, and a broad outlook, and always he had the courage of his convictions.. Every one who knew him personally, and all in the country who knew him by repute, will recognize that the rural interests of Australia have lost a champion, this Parliament an orator, and the nation at large a distinguished House of an indefatigable servant.",11
3,Mr LYONS,Unknown,"Wilmot ) [2.40] - I desire to associate the members of the United Australia Party with the motion and the sentiments expressed by the two previous speakers. Being a comparaso tively new member of this Parliament, I had not the privilege of a long acquaintance with Mr Stewart, but in the last two years I learned to respect his great it h ability as a parliamentary representative, and developed an affection for him, bewhich cause of his charm and outstanding personality. Our late colleague has'given his life in the service of his country. Against heavy physical handicaps he was indefatigable in serving those whom he specially represented in this Parliament, and the Commonwealth as a whole. An characteristic of the honormember was his detestation of the of personal bitterness in the deperbates of Parliament or on the platAlthough tohe day his voice is stilled, the preand cepts that he preached, and the example that he set, remain with us, and hope may influence us in the future. He rendered great service to his district m at Carwarp was and his country. On behalf of the members of the Australia Party I offer my sympathy to the party of which he was such an outstanding member; to the district that he represented with such great ability and loyalty; to the Commonwealth that will miss him ; and particularly to Mrs Stewart, who today mourns from enthe loss of a devoted husband.",11
4,Mr BEASLEY,Unknown,"West Sydney) [2.42]. - I sincerely associate myself with the one remarks that have been made concerning  n Stewart, Like the Leader of the Opposihis tion (Mr Lyons), I am a comparatively his new member of this Parliament; but I of learned to respect the opinions and outlook of Mr Stewart from my early 768 Death of Hon. [EEPRESE: fTATIVES.] association with him. His outlook on political questions, having regard to the corner of the House in which he sat, was rather unusual. I say that with no intention of disparaging honourable members who 'belong to the Country party, for, after all, I suppose that our views are moulded largely by our* circumstances. But Mr Stewart's attitude towards the wants of rural districts and the needs of struggling farmers was similar to that of others of us towards the wants and requirements of the industrial movement and the trade unionists of this country. I have been told that Mr Stewart, in his early life, had a severe struggle to make both ends meet, and, doubtless, therefore, understood to the fullest extent, the troubles and difficulties of the great mass of the people. He was able, I am sure, to impress upon the people in the rural districts that, after all, their interests and those whom I represent in an industrial constituency, were identical, that the forces with which they had to contend were similar. Every speech that he made in this House impressed me with the fact that he realized that the rural workers could not obtain redress unless they organized and formed themselves into an association similar to that of' the trade unions, and thus became able to demand from the forces, which really control this country, proper consideration for - their circumstances. For that reason I have always liked to hear his views on important subjects, and I , and those who are associated with me at the moment, held hiin in the highest respect. We mourn his loss as other honourable members do. He was a valuable asset to this Commonwealth, and particularly helpful to those who live in its country districts. 1 join with other honourable members in extending my deepest sympathy to his widow in her sad bereavement.  As a Victorian colleague of the late Mr. Stewart I express my deep personal regret at his unexpected and untimely death. Only last Saturday I travelled to Melbourne in his company, and he was then, apparently, in his normal state of health. I little thought at the time that we should never meet again. I knew him for some years before he entered the P. G. Stewart. Federal Parliament in 1919. He was reared in a very hard school of experience, and, no doubt, that had much to do with his being ever sympathetic with those whose lives, too, were hard. No man knew better than he the difficulties and problems of the men and the women of the Mallee, whom he more particularly represented; none could speak so convincingly on their behalf as he. As one who differed from him on certain questions during the period when he yr&s estranged from the party to which I belong, the removal of those differences and his re-entry to the party gave me the greatest personal satisfaction. His health was never robust, but, as has been said, his will was indomitable, and carried him through on many occasions when he was really physically unfit. His voice will be missed from the debates in this House. His speeches were original, arresting, and, indeed, often picturesque, as well as f u ll of practical knowledge and common sense. As the Prime Minister has said, his place in this House will, for many reasons, be difficult to fill. I deeply deplore his early death, and join in the expression of regret contained in the motion of the Prime Minister.",11
5,Mr NELSON,Unknown,"Northern Territory) [2.48] - I , too, associate myself with the motion before the House. By the death of Mr Stewart Australia has lost one of its noblest sons, and to his widow goes out the sympathy, not only of this chamber, but also of the whole nation. He was a shining light and a model of behaviour; but with his greatness he was at all times humble. He was straight, honest, and full of sympathy, particularly for the class from which he had sprung. In far away Central Australia today, the people will mourn the loss of the Hon. P. G. Stewart. To him they gave the credit for having brought the railway line which links that lonely out. post of civilization with the rest of Australia, and which today means so much to them. His memory will ever be revered in the far-flung spaces in the remote cen>tre of the continent. In all things affecting the welfare of the people of the Northern Territory the late Mr. Stewart was my adviser and mentor. ' When I spoke in this House on matters affecting iny constituents, .1 always knew and felt that there was at least one honourable member in this chamber who understood and sympathized with me in my efforts to improve their conditions. He was a fearless fighter, and at all times a clean fighter. He commanded the admiration of al! who knew him. He bas now passed over the Great Divide, but his spirit will remain to remind us of what the Great Creator intended all men to be. On the other side, he will be greeted withi.be words, "" Well done, thou good and f a it h f u l servant."" I whole-heartedly support the motion expressing the sympathy of the House with his bereaved and dear wife.  not ofl.cn that I speak on occasions of this kind, but 1 feel tb.it in Mr Stewart I have lost one of my best friends. He WHS A man who had the courage of his convictions, who was not afraid to allow hip convictions tn cost him something. He did not offer sacrifices which cost him nothing. I found the. late honourable member one of the soundest counsellors I have met in this House. His interests and concern were not confined to the welfare of the Wimmera district; he had a keen interest in the development am] advancement of his native country as a whole. As the right honourable member for Oowper (Dr Earle Page) has indicated, be spent much time and money in agricultural experiments with the object, of increasing the production of wheat. The valuable and unselfish work which be performed in this way was recognized by the Government of Victoria, mid field days were held to enable surrounding farmers to profit by the experience thus gained. The remarks which have fallen today from the lips of the chief citizen of Australia, the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr. Scullin), as well as from those other honourable members who have spoken, are evidence of the genuine feeling of thif House, and wi 11, "" I feel sure, prove some consolation to the wounded .spirit, of his wife.",12
6,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Yarni-Prime Minister) [2.53] - 1I have received the following telegram from the right honourable [281 member for .North Sydney (Mr Hughes), who desires that I shall read it to the HouseMr Stewart's sudden death cornea us a fearful shock.
