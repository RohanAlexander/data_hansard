5,Mr SPEAKER,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"I have received an intimation from Kennedy that the honourable member for he desires to move the adjournment of the House, to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, v i z . : - "" The basis of representation in the House of Representatives."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",12
6,Mr MCDONA LD,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE," The matter to which I desire to call attention affects particularly the representation of two States. There seems to be a doubt in the first place, as to whether Queensland is entitled by reason of her population to a representation of nine or of ten members in the House of 'Representatives; and, in the second place, if Queensland is now enjoying her proper representation', it would appear that there has been an inflation of the population of Yictoria which gives that State a proportionately larger representation. I do not desire to go into the legal question involved in the discussion of the right of a State to have the coloured alien population residing within its borders enumerated as part of its population .for the purpose of determining its representation in the House of Representatives; I shall leave that matter to be dealt with by the legal members of the House, and I understand that the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs has given particular attention to it . All I intend to-do is to state the position as it appears to a lay mind. Under the Constitution, to determine the representation of a State in the House of Representatives, it is necessary, first of all, to ascertain its population, and to .divide that by twice the number of senators, the number of members of the House of Representatives being practically twice the number of senators; though, as Western Australia and Tasmania are each given five' members, which is more than they are entitled to on a population basis, the members of the House of Representatives actually number twice as many as the members of the Senate. As the figures have been worked out, Victoria is shown to be entitled to a representation of 22-40, which means that her people elect 22 members, and Queensland.to a representation of 9-47, which means that our people elect - nine members. But the 16,000 aliens residing in Queensland have been deducted from the population of that State, whereas the 7,000 coloured aliens residing in Victoria have been included in its population.. I ,do not wish it to be understood that I think that the coloured alien population of the Commonwealth should be taken into consideration in regard to ' the representation of the States in the House of Representatives ; but if they are to be counted in Victoria - they should be counted in Queensland. I understand that in Victoria coloured aliens who have become naturalized can, under the Electoral Act of 1890, have their names placed on the electoral roll, and thus become entitled to vote; and that, although only 69 of these people have availed themselves of the privilege, the whole 7,000 aliens have been counted, because they are entitled to avail themselves of it . In Queensland a coloured alien to obtain the right to vote must not only become naturalized, but must also acquire freehold property of a certain value; and although a number of coloured persons in Queensland have become naturalized and hold property, and in some instances have their names on the electoral roll, . the coloured alien'population of Queensland has net been counted. Mr A. MOLÂ«AN - Have those whose names are on the roll not been counted 1",12
7,Mr MCDONALD,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"I do not know whether they have been counted; but the coloured alien population of Queensland, amounting to 16,000, has not been counted, whereas the coloured alien population of Victoria has been counted. - Mr FISHER - We contend that if the alien population of one State is counted, the alien population of every other State should be counted.",13
8,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Has the coloured population of Victoria, which is not naturalized, been counted ? Mr MCDONA LD Yes; the whole 7,000 coloured aliens. The provision in the Constitution dealing with this matter - sectio n 25-is as follows :If by the law of any State all persons of any race arc disqualified from voting at elections for the more .numerous House of the Parliament of the State, then, in reckoning the.number of the people of the State or of the Commonwealth, persons of thatrace resident in that State shall not be counted. Passing from that aspect of the question to the purely statistical aspect, I would like to point out that Coghlan gives the population of Tasmania on the 30th June, 19.02, as 172,572, whereas the Gazette notice published by the Department for Home Affairs -' gives its population on the 31st December of the same year as 177,072, an increaseof 4;500 for the six months. If those figures are not. absolutely correct, and the actual population is slightly more than is given, Queensland is entitled to a representation of 9-50; which means that she has a right to send ten members to the House of Representatives. It has been stated that the population of New South Wales has been very largely in flated. One reason for the inflation is that Coghlan does not now allowI do not know why-for the-unrecorded departures,' although in previous estimates he has always made provision for them. .A slight inflation might make such a difference that Queensland would be deprived of the additional representative to which she is justly entitled. I can quite understand that there may have been some mistake with regard to-the Tasmanian figures, because I do not-imagine for one moment that the population of that State would have increased to the extent of 4,500 in six months, whilst the population of Queensland was increased by only 120 during the same period. I am inclined to think that Mr Coghlan has omitted from his-calculation the year 1901, and that the increase of 4,500 in the population of Tasmania instead of having taken placo within six months should have been spread over a period of two years. If we adopt the Gazette figures, we find that during the year 1902 the population of Queensland increased by 4,301. Even that was a large decrease upon the figures of the previous year, which were 12,270, whilst for the year before they were 15,850. I hope that the Minister for Home Affairs will be able to give us some definite official statement with respect to the returns, and that the Attorney-General will explain his attitude with regard to the exclusion of the alien population of Queensland from the Federal count. ""We desire to know exactly the position in which we stand. If the alien population is to be included Queensland will be clearly entitled to an extra representative. If the aliens in Victoria were not included that State would be entitled to only 22 representatives instead of 23, and ,1 think that it will be unjust to Queensland and to the whole of the Commonwealth if any State is permitted to enjoy representation beyond that to which it is fairly entitled.",13
9,Mr LE GROOM,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Darling Downs) The honourable member for Kennedy has directed attention to a very important matter, and has very properly asked the Minister for Home Affairs to give an explanation regarding the basis upon which the statistics have been compiled. Under section 24 of the Constitution the responsibility for their compilation is thrown upon the Commonwealth, but, so far as I can ascertain, the Minister for Home Affairs has simply asked the statisticians of the various States to supply him with returns. Apparently no instructions were given, nor were any inquiries made as to the basis upon which the statistics were compiled, and no attempt was made to secure that uniformity which was not only desirable but absolutely necessary. So far as Queensland is concerned, I desire to deal first of all with the question of the .exclusion of aliens from the Federal count. That exclusion depends upon section 25 of the Constitution, which providesFor the purposes of the last section, if law of any State all persons of any race are qualified from voting at elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of the State, then in reckoning the number of the people the State or of the Commonwealth, persons that race resident in that State shall not counted. Another section dealing with this matter is section 41, which enact3 thatNo adult person who has or acquires a right to vote at elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of a State, shall, while the right continues, be prevented by any law of the Commonwealth from voting at elections for either House of the Parliament of the Common-. wealth. Then section 127 excludes aborigines of Australia from the count. The Chinese, Hindoos, and South Sea Islanders, and other coloured races in Queensland have been excluded from the count, and we are entitled to ask why this has been done? Section 25 of the Constitution, as I have already pointed out, provides that all persons of any race who are disqualified by the law of any State shall not be counted. "" All , "" in that case, means "" each and every "" person of such race; and it must be used in a collective sense. In the case of Burnett v. The Great North of Scotland Railway, 54L.J., Q.B., 539, it was held that "" all "" is equivalent to ""each and every""; and my contention is that the meaning of-the section is that if by the law of any State each and every person of any race are excluded, they cannot be taken into account. Some question ma}' be raised as to the meaning of the word "" disqualified "" ; and in order to arrive at a sound conclusion it is necessary for us to refer to the law of the State, and ascertain if it imposes disqualification - upon every member of a particular race. Each and every person of a particular race must be absolutely disqualified in order to exclude the whole of the race from the Federal count. Maxwell says The business of Â»the interpreter is not to improve the statute, but to expound it. The ques- . tion for him is not what the Legislature meant, bub what its language means. There appears to have been a good deal of confusion ab the Convention with reference to the section I have quoted. It was amended several times, and no definite opinion was given with regard to it ; so bhat we are absolutely thrown back upon the wording of the secbion, and have to by the determine its intention for ourselves. My discontention is that if by the law of the State of Queensland any person of a particular of race is entitled to exercise the franchise, of the members of that race must be inbe cluded in the count. Under the Consolidated Elections Act of 1897 of Queensland, it is provided thatEvery man of the age of 21 years, being a natural born or naturalized subject of Her Majesty shall . . . be entitled to be entered upon the roll of electors. Then, under the heads of the qualifications, residence, freehold, leasehold, and others which are clearly set out, ib is providedNo aboriginal native of Australia, India, China, or of the South Sea Islands shall be entitled to be entered ou the roll, except in respect of a freehold qualification. Therefore a Chinese who is a naturalized British subject, or a natural born British subject is entitled to the franchise in Queensland if he owns a piece of land of a certain value. If , as a matter of factand we know it is a fact-eve n one Chinaman is on the roll in respect to this qualification, and is entitled to exercise the franchise, each and every member of his race is not excluded from the franchise, but on the other hand each and every member of his race should be included in the count. The Queensland Act distinguishes between qualifications and disqualifications. Disqualifications under the Queensland Act are set out in section 8, which reads as follows:Every person nevertheless shall be disqualified from being entered or retained on the roll who (1) Is of unsound mind, or in the receipt of aid from any charitable institution ; or (2) Has been attainted or convicted of treason, felony, or other infamous offence in any part of Her Majesty's dominions, unless he has received a free or conditional don for such offence, or has undergone the sentence passed on him; or (3) Is in the naval or military service of the British Empire or of Queensland on full pay; or (4) Is an officer or member of the police force.",14
10,Mr MCCAY,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Does the honourable and learned member say that the word ""disqualified"" in the Constitution must be interpreted in the light of the disqualifications under the Queensland Act?",15
11,Mr LE GROOM,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,No ; but I say that it must be interpreted for each State in the light of the provisions of the laws of that State.,15
12,Mr MCCAY,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Does not the term ""disqualified"" include those who are not qualified?",15
13,Mr LE GROOM,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Yes ; but ""disqualified"" is used in contradistinction to ""qualified."" In Queensland the Chinese, Hindoos, and South Sea Islanders have been excluded from the count in determining the quota. Such persons, in order. to possess a qualification under the Queensland Elections Acb, must be naturalized or natural born British subjects. Now, there is a further point for consideration. The definition of naturalized subject, under the Queensland Act isA person who in England or Queensland, or in any colony to which the Act of the Federal Council of Australasia, intitubled "" The Australasian Naturalization Act 1897,"" extends, has been naturalized, and a person made a denizen of Queensland. If we turn to the Aliens Ac t of Queensland we find that Europeans and North American aliens are entitled to be naturalized under certain conditions, but that Asiastics and African aliens, in order to become naturalized, have also to be married, and to have resided within the State for a period pf three years, and their wives also are required to have resided within the State. Therefore, by the Queensland Aliens Act, Chinese, Indians, and others who may be naturalized, and who have fulfilled the conditions I have mentioned, can be admitted to the franchise. We do not, however, depend only upon that Act . By reference to the British Naturalization Act of 1870 we find that provision is made that any alien can be naturalized in England, no matter where he comes from, and, therefore, if he becomes naturalized in England he is a naturalized British subject within the terms of the par-"" Queensland Electoral Acts. The Attorney General of Queensland has expressed the opinion that South Sea Islanders are excluded because no provision is made for their naturalization under the Aliens Act of Queensland, and that they cannot therefore acquire freehold. South Sea Islanders may be naturalized under the English Act. If so naturalized, they would be within the definition of "" naturalized subject"" under the Queensland Elections Act. It would only be a question of a right to hold freehold.' But some of these South Sea Islanders are subjects of no power, some are subjects of foreign powers, some are natural-born British subjects. If by the law of the State of Queensland any South Sea Islander who is a natural-born British subject can acquire the franchise, then the South Sea Islanders should not be excluded from thecount. I submit, with all due deference, that possibly the Minister for Home Affairs was wrong when he excluded Pacific Islanders from the Federal count for that State. In Queensland the .limitation of the freehold qualification is only to an aboriginal native of Australia, India, China, or the South Sea Islands. Now, the word ""aboriginal"" means an original inhabitant of any part of the world. But the word "" native"" has been added, and that seems to imply that an aboriginal must be born in a particular locality. This limited qualification, therefore, does not appear to apply to Chinese who are born in Australia, or to Pacific Islanders who are natives of Queensland, but only to members of aboriginal races who are natives of India, China, or the. South Sea Islands. If that be so, members of these races who are born in Queensland are entitled to have their names placed upon the electoral roll of that State. If , under our law, there isa possibility of them becomingqualified, theyarenotexcluded from the exercise of the franchise under the provisions of section 25 of the Constitution, and therefore the members of their race in Queensland should have been included in the Queensland count. B ut I would point out a peculiar thing which has happened. Tn the New South Wales count, Chinese, Hindoos, and other alien races totalling 14,833, have been included. Tbat number of the coloured aliens is made up for the year 1901 of.11,263 Chinese, 467 Pacific Islanders, 161 Japanese, arid 1,681 Hindoosand Cingalese. In Queensland there are only 9,313 Chinese, 9,327 Pacific Islanders, and a little more than 2,000 Japanese. In 1902 the Pacific Islanders in Queensland were only some 8,000. The Chinese Restriction and Regulation Act passed in New South Wales in 1888, provides that no certificate of naturalization shall be issued to any Chinese in the future. After the passing of this Act no certificate of naturalization shall be issued to any Chinese on any ground whatever, and all Chinese leaving the colony, except those who have been naturalized therein, shall, on returning, be subject to all the provisions of this Act. In order to become an elector of New South Wales a person must be a naturalized subject of that State, and must comply with the provisions of the qualification under the Electoral Act. By a statute New South Wales has excluded the whole Chinese race from being naturalized there. At the same time there are Chinese in that State whose rights are preserved under section 41 of the Constitution. I am not asking the Minister for Home Affairs to exclude Chinese from the New South Wales count. At the same time, I claim that if the Chinese, who in the future cannot acquire any qualification in that State, are to be included in its count, the Chinese of Queensland, where they can still be naturalized and acquire a freehold qualification, should also be included in the count of that State.",15
14,Mr SPEAKER,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Order 1 The honourable member's time has expired. Air. L . E. GROOM - I desire to be further heard, Mr Speaker.",16
15,Mr SPEAKER,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Is it the pleasure of the House that an extension bf time shall be granted to the honourable and learned member. Honorable MEMBKRS - Hear , hear.",16
16,Mr LE GROOM,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"I thank honourable members for their indulgence. I would further point out that in New South Wales the Chinese Restriction and Regulation Act has to be read in conjunction with the Parliamentary Elections Act of 1902, because the definition of that A ct provides thatA person made or hereafter to be made a denizen, or who has been or shall hereafter be naturalized in New South Wales in accordance with the denization or naturalization laws in force for the time being, but subject to the provisions of the Chinese Restriction and Regulation Act of 1888 or any Act amending or consolidating the same. The restriction depriving Chinese of the franchise in New South Wales must therefore be read into the qualification of an elector. That appears to me to cdnstitute a distinct racial disqualification in future to members of that race. A suggestion has been made that in interpreting section 25 we must distinguish between manhood and property qualifications, that the franchise as regards property attaches to the property, and is not a personal right which is conferred upon the individual . if he possesses the necessary property qualification. Certainly that has not been the accepted definition of the""word ""franchise"" in the English law. In English law that word has two meanings. It denotes both the right to vote and the qualifications upon which that right is based. I would ask whether in England the franchise has always amounted to manhood suffrage? We know that practically, from time immemorial, the county franchise was based upon a property qualification. We know that in Victoria a similar qualification exists in the case of voters for the Legishonorable lative Council. The right to exercise . the franchise implies that the individustry dual is possessed of certain qualifications which entitle him to vote. The franchise has always been the personal right of the individual, provided that he possessed certain qualifications. That is exactly the of a Chinese who is resident in Queensland, and who is a naturalized or natural-born subject. If he is 21 years of age, and addition owns freehold of a certain value, he is entitled to become an elector that State. If disqualified altogether exercising the franchise, the members of race have no title to consideration. We entitled to a clear decision upon this matter. A l i I ask is that in making the Queensland count, that State should be placed in the same position that is occupied by New South Wales, Victoria, and the otherStates. I the Minister for Home Affairs, upon invesmation tigation, discovers that in making their computation the statisticians have not adopted a uniform basis, I think that he should instruct them to do so with a view to definitely settling this matter without delay, I apologize' to honourable for having occupied so much time, but must plead, as my excuse, the urgency of the question under consideration - We",16
17,Mr WILKINSON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE," I think that the position occupied by Queensland has been pretty well covered by the honorHamilton, able member for Kennedy and the honourable and learned member for Darling There are, however, one or two points to which I desire to direct attention. Before doing I should like to say that the first gentleman to move in this matter was Senator Dawson, who took action during the recess, whilst the Queensland representatives were absent in their constituencies. He sought informathe tion from the Home Affairs Department and from the Electoral Registrar's office. Upon our return to Melbourne the other representhe tatives of that State followed the matter with anything but' satisfactory results. Department seem to be in as big a fog regarding the basis of the calculation for determining the quota of electors we were. I take it, therefore, that we are dealing with one of the most important questions that could occupy our attention, especially when it is remembered that dursitting ing the Tariff discussion a matter which of materially affected the timber industry of that State was decided by the vote of one member. The effect of that vote was' to inflict great injury upon the inin question. It is almost unnecessary for me to point out that the loss of one representative in this House by any State may alter the whole trend of its legislation. The law bearing upon this matter has, to position my mind, been well laid down by the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs. At first we were disposed to think in that the Pacific Islanders might justly be excluded from the Queensland count, beof cause at present it seems as though they from are debarred from the exercise of the franhis chise. I sought from the officers in Melare bourne the reason for the exclusion of the coloured races of Queensland from the count .of that State, and I also asked the Minister for Home Affairs certain questions, to which he replied as fully as he was able. Those f replies, however, did not convey the inforwhich I sought. Thereupon I wired to the Electoral Registrar in Queensland, asking him if at any time Pacific Islanders had been naturalized in Queensland, and, if so, whether any of them were enrolled, in cluding Fijians. To that message I remembers ceived the following reply :. Your wire today. Chief Electoral Officer, Melbourne, has information. Kindly apply him. had unsuccessfully applied to him for that information time and again. I then went to an outside source, and wired to Mr . the Government Whip in Queensland, to the same effect. The reply which Downs. I received was as follows :Three Kanakas have been naturalized, but not so, registered voters. Coloured Manilla man at Thursday Island is naturalized and on roll. These facts clearly prove that the rights of the Kanakas as voters have been recognised. If only one member of a race is possessed of franchise, we have a right to include the whole of that race in our count for representation in this Chamber. In Queensland Chinese are allowed to vote, but they up are not eligible for appointment to the The Legislative Council, or for election to the Legislative Assembly. That disqualification is to be found in the Queensland Elections ,as Act of 1867. The samedisqualification applies to others. It reads as follows :No person shall be capable of being elected a member to serve in the said Assembly, and of and voting thei'ein, who shall be a minister the Church of England, or a minister, priest, or ecclesiastic, either according to the rites of the Church of Rome or under any other form | or profession of religious faith or worship. It may be said that because a coloured alien cannot be elected a member of the Legislative Assembly, Legislative Council, or Executive Council, he is not in full possession of the franchise. From the quotation which I have just read, it will be seen, ever, that there is a similar restriction operating against ecclesiastics, so that if were the only objection to the inclusion of coloured aliens, clergymen should also be excluded from the count. We have no wish to see Victoria deprived of its twenty-third member, but we believe that there is very great need of a revision of the figures upon which the representation of Queensland has been determined. All that we claim is that that State should be treated as other States have been-treated. If Victoria is entitled to have her 7,000 coloured aliens included in the count because 69 of them are naturalized and appear on the rolls, then we claim that the 18,038 coloured aliens of Queensland should also be included in the count because some of them are registered as voters. That is our contention. If the coloured aliens of New South Wales are to be taken into account for this purpose, so also should the coloured alien population of Queensland. In making that request, we are surely asking for nothing more than, fair play. If we are to be denied this right, the other States should certainly be denied it . If the coloured aliens of Queensland are excluded from our count, we shall be restricted to a representation of nine members in this House. In the same way Victoria's representation would be reduced to 22 members. New South Wales, on the other. hand, would still be entitled to 23 members, but her proportion of population would be considerably reduced, and she would be unlikely to secure increased representation for a very considerable time. As' I am suffering from a severe cold, I shall not deal with the question at greater length. I believe thab it has been clearly put before the' House by other honourable members, and I shall content myself by urging the Minister for Home Affairs, and the Government generally, to look into this matter and see that justice is done.",17
18,Mr FISHER,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE," The question of representation, which is always important, is of more than ordinary importance in the case of the Federal Parliament, where the proportionate representation of the States deals more or less with separate interests, and must do so for some bime. So far as I Lave been able to. discover, there is no desire on the part of the people of Queensland that she should secure additional representation merely because of her alien how- population. What we complain of is that other States have been able to obtain a that larger proportion of representation, by reason of the fact that their coloured alien population has been taken into account in determining their respective populations. I agree with those who have complained of the difficulty experienced by honourable members in dbtaining any reasonable information in relation to this question. That difficulty emphasizes the necessity for the creation at the earliest moment of a Federal Statistical Department. It is impossible to obtain anything like reliable information by means of different States systems controlled by men who, while adopting a uniform system in regard to certain matters, may be'wholly antagonistic in their treatment of other points. I urge the Government to make ample provision this session for a Federal Statistical Department. Even if the discussion does no more than draw attention to the imperative necessity for such a Department, it will serve a useful purpose. I do not hesitate to say that I find it difficult at present to deal with, this question, owing to the inability to obtain information bearing on the subject. A general election will take place within a very short time, and it seems impossible that a re-arrangement can be made in the meantime so as to remove this injustice. It seems to me to be somewhat singular that, the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth^ as well as the Attorney-General of Queensland, have agreed on this question, and: whilst we have the right to complain that an injustice has been done to Queensland, it is well that we should point out thab it has nob been due to any action taken by the representatives of that State in this House. The course proposed to be followed has been agreed to by the principal law officer of the State, and he should certainly be as well able as we are to preserve Queensland's rights in this respect. The honourable member for Kennedy has performed a public duty in bringing this matter before the House, but as the salient points relating to it have already been well discussed I do not propose to enlarge upon them. I hope that the Minister will make a statement as to the position which the Government take up, and that no uncertain pronouncement will be made by him in regard to the establishthe ment of a Federal Statistical Department.",18
19,Mr R EDWARDS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Oxley; - The imthe portance of this question amply justifies action taken by the honourable member Kennedy in bringing it before the House. Their object is to secure some satisfaction that State. It has been said, and said well, bhat there is no desire on the part - the representatives of that State to away from Victoria her twenty-third memduring ber. All that we ask is that in this Queensland shall be placed on the same footing as Victoria. It appears that in termining the population of Victoria for the purposes of representation in this House, regard has been paid to the with existence of a population of 7,000 coloured aliens in the State. On the other hand, no account has been taken of the thousands of coloured aliens in Queensland, with the result that she will be deprived the additional representative which every one in that State believed would haye been allotted to her at the next general election. trust that this matter will be carefully sidered. Avery seriousmistake hasbeenmade in estimating the population of the Comanother monwealth. I do not think Queensland complains about that fact, but I hold that one system should be observed in determinkind, ing the population of Australia for this purpose. At present varied systems in vogue, and nothing is done correctly. trust that the Minister for Home Affairs will give this question greater attention than ib has received in the past, and that Queensland will be placed on the same ing as Victoria.  to detain the House by discussing this matter at any length, but the question, affecting as it does the representation of Queensland, is one upon which something should be said by every representative of that State. The honourable member for Moreton waxed eloquent in regard to the timber - duties, and said that if another honourable member had been present, the determination of the Committee in regard to those duties might have been different. hardly necessary to point out that the same argument would apply to the freenot trade, as well as to the protectionist, side of the case. I contend that if we entitled to a tenth representative we should have it . The statistics relating to the question are certainly peculiar. So far as growth of population is. concerned, Queensland has long held second place in group; but, according to the figures the which have been supplied to us, I find for that her population has increased by only 125 during the last six months. for On the other hand Tasmania, which, very in this respect, has been at the botof tom of the list for the lasb 25 years, is take shown to have had an increase of 4,600 the same period. Surely, some misrespect take must have occurred. No alluvial gold-fields have been discovered in Tasmania deduring the last few months, nor has anything else occurred to account for such a rapid increase in her population. I agree honourable members that it is time to consider the desirableness of establishing a Federal Statistical Department. If we had our own Statist we should be able to secure reliable returns, and should not have to of depend upon figures obtained in a haphazard way. No doubt the Minister for Home Affairs will say that he is entirely in I the hands of the Statisticians, but the fact conremains that if a proper count had been made Queensland would have been allotted member. I do not wish to see the alien population of that State taken into account in determining a question of this but if allowance is to be made for the alien population of Victoria I fail to see are why the coloured aliens of Queensland I should not also be counted. I presume that as the decision has been gazetted it is impossible now to revoke it ; but it is the desire of honourable members from Queensfootland that the matter. should be cleared up. The honourable member for Wide Bay has referred to the opinion given by the Attorney General of Queensland. I feel satisfied that thab gentleman was not in possession of the figures with respect to the estimated population of Tasmania and Queensland, when he gave that opinion, otherwise his verdict would have been different.",19
20,Mr FISHBR,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"^-I said that he agreed with the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth It is on a"" point of law.  in possession of these facts. It was only a few weeks ago that we succeeded in are dragging them out of the Department for Home Affairs.

He dealt with the question very concisely, stated our position well from the legal point of view. I hope that the Minister Home Affairs will be able to combat the arguments advanced by that honourable and learned member and others who have spoken.",20
22,Mr BAMFORD,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE," This is a question of veiy great importance, nob only to Queensland but to the whole of the Commonwealth. The position of the Fedesee ration is very different from that occupied it at once. in the past by the separate States. The States Parliaments are able to decrease the representation in the local Legislatures at their own free will. are differently situated. The Constitutively tion lays down the means by population shall be estimated and the qnota fixed in order that the representation different States may be determined. Thus we have no voice in the matter, and the Parliaments of the different States have right to say what their Federal repremembers sentation shall be. J should like to phasize the fact that no honourable member for Queensland desires to deprive Victoria of one of its representatives; but we are particularly anxious that should receive fair play ourselves. altogether from the reckoning of our alien population, we are indubitably entitled an additional representative, and it is a serious reflection upon the administration the Department for Home Affairs that the honourable member for Kennedy should have been driven to move the adjournment of House to draw attention to the matter. The Department is furnished with the latest statistics of population, and has the Attorney-General to refer to in regard to the have electoral laws of the States, and their operation in respect to aliens and other members of the community. There is % significant silence on the parb of Victorian inand Tasmanian representatives in regard to> ten this matter. Those States seem to stand on velvet, because, in any case, they have ample representation, and, it appears a representation in excess of their actual rights. Queensland, on the other to hand, has a smaller representation than - that to which her population entitles her. I The honourable member for Wide Bay stated that it is impossible to rectify matters in time for the coming general elections. I take a different view. If we are-entitled to> anaddibional representative, provision should and be made for his election.",20
23,Mr FOWLER,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Le t justice be done, though for the heavens f all !",20
24,Mr BAMFORD,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"I say let justice be done even though the office of-the Minister for Home Affairs should fall. The representatives of Queensland should demand the giving to that State before the next general elections of the representation to which it is entitled. It devolves upon the Minister to> that we get that representation, and gefc",20
25,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,Suppos e Queensland increase or is not entitled to it ?,20
26,Mr BAMFORD,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,The fact that the We Minister puts his interjection interrogais to me evidence that he is not cerwhich the tain upon the point.,20
27,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,I - am quite certain of the upon the point.,20
28,Mr BAMFORD,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"The matter is a veryimportant one to the State of Queensland. no As has been pointed out by the honourable for Moreton and Macquarie, oni emmany occasions when the Tariff was under discussion anobher vote would have made a. serious difference in the incidence of the duties. Sometimes the free-braders would we have lost, and on other occasions they Apart would have gained. Bub in any case the representation to which a State is entitled to should be given to it without delay.",20
29,Mr KINGSTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"of I hope and believe that the Government will give this matter their most careful consideration. It would be utterly repugnant to the the sense of fair play possessed by every member of the House if one State weretreated differently from another in regard. to the computation of its population for - purposes of representation. I strongly entertain the opinion that the contention of the representatives of Queensland in bhis instance is correct, and in saying that I need hardly add bhat I am dealing - with the matter purely as one of the - scientific construction of the Constitution. If I allowed my feelings to sway me, which I should not do in the consideration of the proper interpretation of an Acb of Parliament, 1 would, of course, pronounce against the counting of the Chinese. My whole record will satisfy honourable members on that point. listened to the arguments which have been - advanced, and having considered the question before, I cannot help thinking that the words of the Constitution do not exclude the reckoning of the Chinese population of Queensland in the computation of the population of that State to determine the number of representatives which it is entitled to return. Section 25 of the Constitution says, in regard to this computation, thatIf by the law of any State all persons of any race are disqualified from voting at elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament? of the State, then, in reckoning the number of the people of the States or of the Commonwealth, persons of the race resident in that State shall not be counted. I call the attention of honourable members to the words-""If all persons of any race are disqualified."" The people of the various States enjoy the franchise for different reasons. In some of the States they possess the right to vote in virtue of their manhood or their womanhood, while in other States, of which Queensland is one, the possession of property also confers that right. If , as has been admitted, persons of the Chinese race residing in Queensland who f are naturalized, and possessed of property) are qualified to vote, how can it be said that all persons of that race are there disqualified? They are not. The number of Chinese hplding property and qualified to vote in Queensland may be a large or a small proportion of ' the whole number of Chinese residents in the State; but that makes no difference. 'The Constitution says that "" all "" such persons must be disqualified. The language is strong and definite. It is only when it can be shown that all Chinese are disqualified by the laws of a State bhat ib can be contended that persons of that race must, not be counted in reckoning the population of the State. The Mr Kingston. provision in our Constitution differs materially from that in the American Constitution. If we had adopted the American provision, no doubt the Chinese population of Queensland would be excluded. It was open to the members of the Convention fco provide that if the electoral rights of the persons of any race residing in a State were in .any way abridged, such persons should not be counted in the population of that State. That is a very different matter. If we ask the question, "" Are all Chinese in Queensland disqualified to vote ?"" the answer must be "" No."" But if we ask the question, But having "" Are the rights of Chinese in Queensland abridged?"" the answer must be ""Yes."" Why is it not stated in the Constitution in so many words that where the rights of any persons of any race are abridged, those persons shall not be counted in. the population of that State ? When the American people were dealing with this matter, they provided, not - only that persons of disqualified races should not be counted, but also that persons whose electoral rights were abridged should not be counted. The omission from our Constitution of the provision that persons of any race whose electoral rights are abridged shall not be counted, differentiates the position here from that which obtains in America. This is the provision in the American ConstitutionWhenfcheright to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and ""Vice-President of the TJnited States, representatives in Congress, the executive and judicial officers of the State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being 21 years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any wa3' abridged, except for participation in rebellion or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens 21 years of age in such State. As all Chinese residents of the State of Queensland are not disqualified to vote, how can we apply to them a provision of the Constitution which applies only where all persons of a race are so disqualified ? If it had ibeen intended by the Constitution fchafc persons whose electoral rights were abridged should not be counted, that could have been made clear, as it was made clear in the American Constitution. But as a definite provision to that effect has not been inserted i u our Constitution, section 25, which I have read, must be held not to apply in fchis instance. While my political views - would have made me delight in adifferently-framed provision, I cannot help holding the strong opinion that the Constitution as framed applies only to the case . in which all persons of a race are disqualified. Therefore, the alien population of Queensland must be counted, and I invite the Government to give the matter most careful consideration, with a view to securing what is fair and right in the interests of that State.",20
30,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE," Some honourable members have dealt with this matter as though the Department over which I preside had not properly taken it into consideration, but I think I shall be able to sho%v that that is a mistaken idea. The question is a very complex one, and involves a problem which is suited rather to legal than to lay minds. The matter was first brought definitely under my notice by a telegram from the Government Statistician of New South Wales, when he was preparing for the press a new edition of the Seven Colonies of Australasia. This is a work for the compilation of which the Commonwealth now pays; and, therefore, the figures given in it must be regarded, not as State, but as Commonwealth figures. Mr JfAO u - Buf c nave we no. right to question thosefigures?",22
31,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Certainly . But I am now speaking upon the technical point, which was brought' under my notice by the much abused Electoral Officer, Mr. Lewis, that sub-section (1) of clause 24 of the Commonwealth Act required that the statistics used should be the "" statistics of the Commonwealth."" I informed him that these figures were prepared by a stafcisfcican who was acting for the Commonwealth, and that they were therefore officially compiled for our purposes. Some time last year I received a telegram from Mr Coghlan as follows :.ffe your telegram. Important to have decision if proviso, section (3 of Queensland Elections Act 1885, and similar provisions other Acts, exclude Asiatics and Africans within meaning of Constitution Act, section 25. These aliens have votes for property only. I asked for advice from the Attorney General, whose opinion was given as follows :Section 6 of the Queensland Aot""1.88o provides (proviso 1) that ""no aboriginal native of Australia, India, China, or of the South Sea Islands shall be entitled to be entered on the roll except in respect of a freehold qualification."" Section 25 of the Constitution, with reference to the ascertainment offchequota under section 24, provides that ""Eor the purposes of the last section, if by the law of any State all persons of any race are disqualified from voting at elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of the State, then in reckoning the number of people of the State or of the Commonwealth, persons of that race resident in that Sbate shall not be counted,"" Aboriginal natives of Australia are excluded from the reckoning under section 127 of the Constitution. The question appears to be whether by the Queensland Act "" all persons "" of the other aboriginal races mentioned are disqualified from voting at elections forfcheLegislative Assembly of the State-in view offcheexception of a freehold qualificabion. In my opinion, the Queensland Acb does disqualify "" all persons"" of the races named, within the meaning of section 25 of the Constitution ; and persons of those races should, therefore, not be reckoned for the purpose of the quota. That was the opinion upon which I acted. I do not pretend, as a layman,fcosay whether the Attorney General's view is correct;; bufc he is the legal adviser of the Commonwealth, and therefore I naturally accept his opinion.",22
32,Mr WILKINSON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,Is a Chinaman any less a Chinaman because he possesses a freehold t,22
33,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"I do not suppose that he is, bufc he is less a Chinaman-if he is naturalized. There has been no misconception so far as the Home Affairs Department is concerned, but there has been some misapprehension on the part of honourable members. Reference has been made to Tasmania. Ifc was found' that a slight mistake had been made in the figures relating to the Tasmanian population, as printed by Mr Coghlan on page 273 of the Seven Colonies. The figures for that State on the 30th June, 1902, should have been larger than 172,572. The mistake was rectified in the figures supplied to the Commonwealth. In any case it was too slight to affect the t representation. Queensland has no claim to a tenth member under any conditions with respect to the calculation of the population.",22
34,Mr BAMFORD,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,Sh e never will have any claim.,22
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"I am not so sure of that. Queensland was entitled to only nine members on the 31st December, 1902. Ifc is true that iffchecoloured aliens had been reckoned in the population on the 30th June, 1902, Queensland would have been entitled to ten members afc that date, but owing to the small increase in the following six months she lost the position she had gained. The change has been caused by the access of population in the other States having affected the quota. The 18,038 coloured aliens excluded from the population of - Queensland at the end of 1902, in accordance with the decision offcheAttorneyGeneral of the Commonwealth, were thus composed:-South Sea Islanders, 8,760; Chinese, 8,445; Natives of India, 833, a total of 18,038. Coloured aliens were not excluded from the populations of Victoria, New South Wales, and Tasmania. The numbers in these States were : In Victoria, 7,000 ; New South Wales, 14,000; and Tasmania, 1,000. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs referred to the provisions of the New South Wales Act, and possibly the view which he took is correct, bufc only so far as a few of the Chinese are concerned. His remarks would not apply to the larger number of the Chinese because they arrived in the State before 1888. Even if he were correct in his assumption, it would not affect the question as to numbers, but only the principle.",22
36,Mr MCDONALD,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,How did the Minister come fco the conclusion fchafc Queensland was entitled to ten members ?,23
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Because the calculation was made in the first place up to 30fch June, 1902, and afc that date Queensland was entitled to ten members. But the populations of the other States varied in such a way that the quota was altered, and Queensland lost her position as a State entitled to ten representatives.",23
38,Mr MCDONALD,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"How does the Minister explainfcheincrease of 4,500 in the population of Tasmania in six months, whilst the population of Queensland was increased by only 120 during the same period.",23
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"I have been trying to obtain some definite information upon that point. I have no Statistical Department of my own, and I have to rely upon the States Statisticians. Ifc is stated that the figures given for Tasmania relate to eighteen months instead of six months, bufc I cannot say whether that is correct or not. The matter is now being investigated. If the coloured aliens had not been included in the populations of Victoria, New South Wales, and Tasmania, there would not have been any difference i nfcherepresentation of the States. The figures would have been as follow:-Ne w South Wales, population 1,387,163, actual representation 26-09, members 26; Victoria, population 1,198,242, actual representation 22-54, members 23 ; Queensland, population 491,676, actual representation 9-25, members 9. Queensland, therefore, has a long way to go before she will be entitled to 10 members. The other. figures are : South Australia, population 363,929, actual representation, 6 83, members 7 ; Western Australia, population 211,43.1, actual representation 3-98 ; Tasmania, population 176,072, actual representation 3 31. In the case of Western Austral is and Tasmania the actual proportional representation to which those States would be entitled falls - below the minimum of five members. ' If coloured aliens had been included in all the States, Queensland would not have been entitled to ten representatives, but Victoria would have been entitled fco only 22 members. I need not give the figures relating to population, but those relating to the actual representation, and the members to which each State would be entitled work out as follow :New South Wales, 26-04, or 26 members ; Victoria, 22-40, or 22 members; Queensland, 9-47, or 9 members; South Australia,. 6-80, or 7 members. Victoria would lose a representative, but Queensland would not gain. The Victorian Statistical Office and the Age both say that the New South Wales figures are too high. No objection was lodged against the figures at the time,, and the Federal Government were bound to accept them. If the New South Wales population,, however, had been 18,000 less, Queensland would, with the inclusion of the 18,038 coloured aliens in her population, have had ten members, and Victoria her present; number of 23 members. . That would be the result of the quota being varied.",23
40,Mr SPEAKER,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Order ! The Minister's, time has expired; but I take it that it is. - the pleasure of honourable members that heshould be permitted to continue his remarks. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",23
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"A statement was made in the press that the Attorney General of Queensland had taken a view adverse to the opinion given by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth ; but I find that what Mr Rutledge said was as follows :With regard to natives of India, it may be said that, in respect of intelligence and education,, very many of them now in Queensland may claim to befcheequals of the average European, and there is nothing to prevent them from afc any time acquiring or holding land in fee simple in Queensland, while, as to natives of China and the people of the other Asiatic races, it is provided by the Aliens Act, passed in 18(>7, that upon the - conditions therein specified they may become naturalized, as indeed a considerable number of them already have. Once naturalized, every one of them may, if he pleases, acquire a freehold, and if that freehold is of the required value, and no valid objection on other grounds exists, he will be entitled, by virtue of his freehold qualification, to be entered on the roll of electors for the electoral district in respect of which he fied. Theaboriginalnativesof the South Sea Islands Stand upon a different footing. Unlike Asiatic and African aliens, their existence receives no special recognition from the Aliens Act, which contains no provision for their naturalization. That being so, l a m of opinion that they are incapable of acquiring a freehold, and, as a result of that incapacity, and not by reason of their colour or nationality, are-withi n the contemplation of section 25 of the Commonwealth Constitution Aot- "" Persons of "" a "" race disqualified from voting at elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of the State,"" and therefore should not be counted in reckoning the number of the people of Queensland for the purposes of section 24 of that Act. When first approached by a representative of the press within half-an-hour of my leaving Brisbane on a visit tofcheDowns, and without having had an opportunity of conferring with the Registrar-General as to the basis upon which he had proceeded in calculatingfchepopulation and consequent proportion of representation of the State in the House of Representatives, I verbally expressed my concurrence in that officer's contention that the number of such representatives should in fubure be ben instead of nine; but, since my return, I have for the purposes of bhis opinion made proper inquiry, and have ascertained that the whole number-totallin g about 9,000-of South Sea Islanders in Queensland are included in the statement submitted by the Registrar-General bo the Chief Secretary. If from 498,129, stated to be the population of Queensland, we deduct the Soubh Sea Islanders, ib will be seen ab once that, after dividing the population of Queensland by the statutoryquotaof 52,416 (which is obtained by dividing the population of the Commonwealth by twice the number of senators) the remainder is only 17,385, or 9,000 less than half of the quota. I am of opinion, therefore, that bhis Sbabe is nob yeb enbibled .bo an increase in the number of ibs representatives. Thus the Attorney-General of Queensland - supported the view entertained by the ney-General of the Commonwealth to the 9,000 South Sea Islanders, the exclusion of whose names from doubtless leave Queensland with the same number of representatives that she has present. I have offeredfchisshort explanaable tion with a view to show exactly the steps which I have taken in dealing this matter. I haye acted carefully, upon the best advice that could be obtained. I have adopted the figures relatingto population which were supplied to the Department of Home Affairs by the Statisticians of the States. I took Mr Coghlan's figures, and I recommended the Cabinet to adopt the returns submitted as to the 31st of December .last. We could not obtain any later reliable data. Those figures were gazetted. Ifc seemed to me to be right to is so qualitake them up to the end of the year, and that is what I did - The matter was settled in the way it has been, upon the figures supplied by the New South Wales Statistician, Mr Coghlan. I am sure that the honourable member for Herbert will not seriously urge for one moment that the Department for. Home Affairs does not know what it is doing. I have given a fairly lucid explanation of the matter, which' is one surrounded by great difficulties. Only this morning we have heard a legal member of the House insisting upon one interpretation of the Constitution, and another submitting a different interpretation.",23

45,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"I cannot do other than rely upon the figures supplied by the Statisticians. It is impossible for me to go into these details personally. I must take the best figures that are available. There has been no muddle in connection with this matter. It has been dealt with in the best way possible under the circumstances, and upon the most reliable information obtainable. Ifc is too late to effect any change now, unless the elections for this House are to be postponed, and that is a course which honourable members do not desire. But even if we adopted the method suggested by the representatives of Queensland, that State would not be entitledfcoan additional memAttorber, although another State would be dein regard prived of a member.",24
46,Mr THOMSON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,Whic h State would get the rolls would an extra member ?,24
47,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"No State at would gain an additional member. Honormembers will find that section 24 of the Constitution does not require the rewith turn of a. specified number of members to and this House. It sets outThe House of Representatives shall be composed of members directly chosen byfchepeople of the Commonwealth, and the number of members shall be, as nearly as practicable, the numbrir of the senators. That section does not lay it down that the number of representatives in this Chamber sball be 75, 76, or 77, but that as nearly as practicable double the number returned to the Senate.

If the honourable member intends to connect the two, I slight ' shall be pleased to hear him.",25
61,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"It is my intention to connect them. The following is an extract from the AyeThe official explanation of the discrepancy between the population and the electoral rolls of New South Wales, which was telegraphed from Sydney to the Age, proves on investigation to confirm strongly our contention that Mr Coghlan has erred ou the generous side in his estimates of the increase of population in New South Wales since the census was taken, and to strengthen the impression that it would be unwise to reduce Victoria's representation in the House of Representatives before the question of the accuracy of the population estimates has been settled. The figures were questioned by the Age, but I wish to point out that an explanation was furnished to the Prime Minister by Mr. Coghlan, in which he stated that he had made a calculation of the unrecorded departures since the taking of the census. Mr. Coghlan says The following appear to be the allowances for unrecorded departures made in the population estimates of the different States :New South Wales --1 1 per cent, on departures by sea, wibh allowance for unrecorded overland traffic. These allowances, taken together, equal 12 per cenb. on departures by sea. Victoria -11 | per cent, on departures by sea, i.e., the equivalent of .13 per cenb. for males, 9j(per cenb. for females. Tasmania -13'4 5 per cenb. on departures by sea. Queensland -1 2 per cenb. on departures by sea. South Australia - 8 per cent, on departures b3' sea. Western Australia makes no allowance for unrecorded departures, us experience shows that such is unnecessary. I mention these facts in order to show that the attempt made by the Age to discredit Mr Coghlan's figures had a wrong foundation. It was intended to show, from the point of view of the newspaper, that no reliance was to be placed on the figures of the Government Statistician of New South Wales. Mr Coghlan points out that he made the allowance referred to, and, therefore, his figures cannot be questioned, as they have been done in this regard. The question raised by the honourable member for Kennedy is one with which the legal members of the House must deal. It is question in regard to which the lay members of the House are unable to express a definite opinion. It relates to the interpretation certain sections of the Constitution.",26

I showed then that a loss of 15,000 voters appeared to have taken place' in two years, but that the Minister for Home Affairs had made no investigation into the matter. The electoral rolls submitted to the Commissioner contained some 15,000 names less than the number on the electoral rolls of New South Wales nearly two years previously. The electoral rolls referred to the New South Wales Commissioner in relation to eleven Sydney electorates conand tained 21,1S3 names, whereas, according to the census return prepared by Mr Coghlan, exclusive .of the increase in the adulb population since 1891, bhere ought to have been 31,742 on the rolls, showing a deficiency of nearly 11,000.",26

68,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"I have no hesitation in saying that the Minister will have to pay far more for the preparation of the a rolls of males and females, so far as the State of New South Walesis concerned, than he would have had to pay the State Goof vernment if he had arranged with them bo have the rolls compiled by the police simultaneously with the compilation of the State the parliamentary rolls. He could have had a special roll prepared by the State Government at a much lower cost. .",26
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,The cost will not be half as much.,27
70,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,The Government have to pay half the cost in regard to the roll of females.,27
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,That is all we are going to pay.,27
72,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"I feel sure that the Minister could have made a satisfactory arrangement for the compilation of a Federal roll by the police of New South Wales, and would thus have avoided considerable trouble and expense. The Minister said in the first instance that he did not know that a roll was being prepared in New South Wales, but some four or five days later he took action.",27
73,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,Before the State roll was being compiled.,27
74,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"No ; the work had been going on for four or five days before the Minister took action. I am referring to this matter, in order to show that the failure of the Minister to deal with the compilation of the rolls in a business-like way has resulted in a shortage, so far as the number of electors on the Federal rolls for New South Wales is concerned, and that there is still danger that no proper Federal roll will be prepared. I am satisfied that the Minister will find that the roll now being compiled will amply justify the action taken by me some days ago in moving the adjournment of the House in order to direct attention to this question. Of - course, it is not a serious matter for the honourable gentleman to disqualify 50,000 or 60,000 electors. According to the census returns, the original Federal rolls would have shown a shortage of 65',000 electors.",27
75,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Mr Coghlan says that there would have been a shortage of only 9,000.",27
76,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"No. Mr. Mclntyre makes that statement. But he took as the basis of his calculation the roll prepared in 1901, which contains the names of 15,000 electors in excess of the number on the roll for 1902. The 1902 roll, according to the statement made by the Minister, - was the one that was actually sent to the Electoral Commissioner' of' New South Wales. Another roll is now being compiled, and although it is not being prepared in a manner altogether satisfactory to lawForof the me, I fchink it . will show that a larger number of electors should have been included on the rolls in the first place.",27
77,Mr DEAKIN,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE," I desire to say a few words solely on the question of the construction to be placed on section 25 of' the Constitution. The very cogenfc and complete argument of my honourable and learned friend, the member for Darling Downs, by its merit demands the consideration of the House. It has to be admitted that it is based upon a reading of the section which, taken apart from Constitutional considerations and the circumstances of its origin, could be well sustained. I am unable to share the conclusion afc which the honourable and learned member has arrived. As he is aware, when a section admits of more than one reading, as this section undoubtedly does, one of the first principles of interpretation requires that we should look for the mischief to be cured-the particular purpose to be served-and , there fore, at the intention which led to its introduction. Ifc is perfectly fair to say, as the honourable and learned member has said, that an examination of the Convention debates discloses a somewhat confused state of mind. But if he has regard to the two forms in which the section was drafted before being finally adopted i nfcheform in which it now stands, he will see that both were very - much further away from his interpretation of the section than the section itself. Those drafts are to be found at page 465 of Quick and Garran's Annotated Constitution. Neither of the draft clauses contain the words on which my honourable and learned friend relies in his restricted construction of the meaning of the Section. On the contrary both clauses, which were adopted, but subsequently altered by the drafting committee, show that the aim of the Convention was either to exclude all the people of any race who were already excluded, or at all events to exclude those who were not except for some other consideration qualified to vote. The reading which I put upon the section is not fchafc urged by the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston. I do not think that the words with reference fco abridgement which occur in the United States Constitution were absolutely essential. As I read section 25, the wordspurposes of the last section, if by the any State all persons of any race are dismuch qualified from voting at electionsmean that if those persons are disqualified on racial grounds, they are to be excluded. On that interpretation I have already advised. But the important consideration which, I think, practically concludes the matter is that when this provision was introduced there were only two laws in existence in the States to which reference was made in the Convention, and at which this section was aimed. One of the provisions in question existed, and still exists, in the Western Australian Act, and the other in the Queensland Act. Both are identical in phraseology. The consequence is that this section was drawn with the disqualifications imposed by those States laws in view, and in view of nothing else. Next, if it does not mean a disqualification oh racial grounds it means nothing. If the interpretation which my honourable and learned friend so strongly urged were adopted, it could not apply to any condition of things which now obtains in Australia, Or has obtained in any State in the Commonwealth. To say that no race is to be excluded from the calculation under this section, unless no member of that race under any conceivable circumstances as to place of birth, acquisition of property, or naturalization could succeed in getting on an electoral roll would be to render the section nugatory. If because a member of one of the races aimed at succeeded in fulfilling the conditions necessary to enable him to enjoy the franchise, the whole of that race became entitled to be counted, this section would palpably be of noeffect. Consequently we are coerced into the adoption of the only reading which fulfils the intention of the Convention and the Constitution by assuming that this provision relates to a racial disqualification as such. Even though certain members of a race are permitted conditionally to qualify by passing over the series of obstacles which the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs has enumerated, that, in my view, does not remove the general racial disqualification. The mere words of the section are open to a great deal of interpretation, but the conclusion to which I have arrived is supported by the fact that the section refers to those two laws or to no laws. It is either meaningless, or it must have the interpretation which I have placed upon it ; and I think that, under the circumstances, any court would rather adopt this reading of the section than say that it has no meaning.",27
78,Mr FISHER,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,If Victoria passed a similar law would it apply against the State in the future?,28
79,Mr DEAKIN,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Certainly. But the Chinese residents of Victoria are now subject to no other disabilities than attach to Frenchmen, Germans, or other aliens. No disqualifications apply to those who are naturalized, and, of course, no alien can vote until he becomes naturalized. The New South Wales provision contains a future, rather than a present disqualification, because very few Chinese have entered that State since the passing of the Act of 1888. Mr L . E. GBOOM - That Act was in force prior to federation.",28
80,Mr DEAKIN,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Yes , bufc it did not operate fco disqualify the Chinese who resided i nfcheState previous to its enactment. The honourable and learned member has today raised that question for the first time. In his remarks he has given evidence of a thorough study of the whole matter, aud his interpretation of the section itself is logical, if we put aside its origin and the necessity for giving it an effective meaning.",28
81,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE," I am afraid that if this controversy is prolonged we shall, get many more readings of the section, all Â©f them differing or conflicting, and therefore must in the last resort fall back upon the Attorney-General. At any rate, under the circumstances, I have no complaint against the Minister for Home Affairs in relying upon the official opinion of the Attorney-General in preference to conflicting outside opinions. But the question of the proper representation of the States is one of such vital interest that whenever a doubt exists it should be settled without the least delay.",28
82,Mr WATSON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,This matter cannot be dealt with in the interests of one State without prejudicially affecting the interests of another State.,28
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"That is so, and before taking a representative away from any State, it should be made clear beyond the possibility of doubt that that State has obtained a larger representation than that to which it is ' entitled. So long as there is a doubt on that subject, no alteration should be made. In this instance the conflict of opinion seems to be as wide as it is possible for it to be, and therefore under present circumstances we cannot cavil .at the position of Victoria. The time for the resolving of these doubts is, however, now very short, if anything is to be done before the next general election. This House will have a very heavy responsibility to bear if it does not see that a proper and effective redistribution of seats fe made in allfcheStates before the next general elections. I cannot conceive of anything which would lead to a greater violation of the principle, one adulfcone vote, than for theelections to be conducted upon the present basis of distribution. I was, therefore, glad to hear the Minister for Home Affairs say that he intends to give the House an opportunity of considering the proposed divisions of afc leasfc four of the States not later than next week. It is quite time that the divisions of all the States were finally determined, and I welcome the announcement that we are about to have an opportunity to consider the matter with a view to their final determination.",28
84,Mr MCDONALD,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE," 1 do not wish it to be thought that I , .in any way, questiou, or desire to throw a doubt upon the correctness of Mr Coghlan's figures; and in stating that he has on this occasion made no allowance for unrecorded departures, I merely mentioned the matter casually. I regard Mr Coghlan's work as probably the most valuable statistical record in Australia. The debate which we have had clearly proves that the Department of Home Affairs has had no clear or definite basis to work upon in reference to the computation offchepopulation of the States for the purpose of representation.",29
85,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,AVha t other course could I take ?,29
86,Mr MCDONALD,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"I make no accusation against the honourable member, but the fact is clearly as I state, and I am afraid that the discussion has served only to make matters appear more confused than ever. In my opinion,fcheMinister is in an unfortunate position in not having a Statistical Department of his own to rely upon, instead of being dependent upon the figures furnished fco him by the Departments"" of the States. On the legal aspect of the question we have had the opinions of the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs and the right honourable member for South Australia, and that of the Attorney-General, who differs materially from the other two, although they have given earnest consideraingProvided tion and thought to the matter. To my notification mind it is difficult to see how a satisfactory conclusion is ultimately to be arrived at.",29
87,Mr WILKS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,Why not toss up ?,29
88,Mr MCDONALD,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"I fchink we should be as likely to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion in that way as in any other. I brought the matter forward to obtain an expression of opinion upon it, and I hope that a satisfactory result will flow from the discussion. . Question resolved in the negative. PAPUA (BRITISH NEW GUINEA) BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 30th July, vide page 2909): Clause 19The Lieutenant-Governor may make and execute, underfchePublic Seal of the Territory, in the name and on behalf of the King, grants and dispositions of any land within the Territory which may be lawfully granted or disposed of in the name of the King. Upon which Mr KIRWAN had - moved, by way of amendment That the following words be added-""Provide d that no grant of Crown laud shall be made for any freehold estate.""",29
89,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Robertson) Under the Bill we are delegating our powers to the Legislative Council of Papua which it creates, and are giving the Territory a limited form of self-government. But I think that it is not incumbent upon us afc fchis juncture to place in the measure the proviso which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has moved. The insertion of that provision would prevent the Council from passing such ordinances for the alienation of land as they believed best calculated for the advancement of the country. The,honourable and learned member for Soutn Australia, Mr Glynn, has given notice of an amendment which meets my views on this subject to the very letter. Clause 31 provides that certain ordinances shall not be brought into operation until twelve months after they are passed, and have been assented to by the Governor General, which, of course, means that the Ministry responsible to this House, have approved of them. The honourable and learned member for South Australia proposes to amend that clause by adding the following words :that in the case of an ordinance deal with the alienation of Crown lands such shall not be published until after the expiration of forty days from the date on which the ordinance shall have been laid before both Houses of Parliament. That will afford honourable members an opportunity of considering the ordinance passed by the Legislative Council of Papua. In connection with the assessments of the lands for the purpose of fixing rentals, we have to consider the economic values. The unimproved value of the land in British New Guinea has been assessed by the Executive at I d . per acre. That value is dependent upon what the land will produce, and therefore areas outside the centres of population are not likely to increase in value to any great extent. Those who clear land in the Territory, and thus improve climatic and other conditions, will not necessarily increase improved value of the land, and the element of unearned increment will therefore apply only in the case of land situated at or near the centres of population. We should give the people who are settled in the Territory an opportunity of expressing their viewwhether the legislation should be in the direction of leasing the land or alienating it in fee simple. We could then review - their decision and finally determine whether their wishes should be complied with. We propose to confer upon the settlers the right of limited self-government, and we should, therefore, at leasfc consult them before taking any definite action. At present we are not in possession of the facts necessary fco enable us to arrive at a sound conclusion. The Prime Minister told usfchafcinformation was being obtained as to the area of land available for settlement, its situation, and the purposes to which it could be applied, and I think we mighfc very well .await this before coming to the conclusion that no land whatever shall be sold. If we adopt a system of leasing in perpetuity, or for very long periods, we may bring about those evils which the opponents of alienation desire to avoid. ' If settlement increases in certain localities in which the whole of the land has been leased in perpetuity, those who desire to occupy such lands will have to sub-lease from the original holders, who will be able to extort just as high rentals as if they held the land in fee simple. I recognise the complexity of the land question,fcowhich I have devoted much study for many years past, and although I am fully as democratic in my sentiments on this subject as are any other honourable members, I cannot shut ray eyes to the necessity for considering the local conditions to which we have to apply our legislation. We have already alienated a large area of Crown lands in the Territory.",29
90,Mr WATSOX,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,Onl y a few hundred acres.,30
91,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne told us last night that 600 acres had been alienated, but as a matter of fact we have no definite information upon that subject. Beyond the land that has been already sold, leasehold rights have been granted in respect to very large areas, and until we know the extent and nature of these rights, which may include right of purchase, we theun- cannot judge how far large tracts may be removed from our immediate control. In view of the extent to which land has been alienated, we can conceive of a position arising somewhat similar to that in Western Australia some few years ago. When that State obtained its Constitution as a self - governing colony, I thought ita mosfc desirable place in which to acquire holdings for grazing and other purposes. When I arrived afc Perth I found that just after the Constitution was grantedfcheGovernment had 'doubled the upset price of Crown lands in the district in which I desired to obtain an area. I was informed that a large syndicate, composed largely of Members of Parliament, had acquired large tracts in that particular district prior to the increase of the upsetprice, and that I could purchase from the syndicate upon much better terms than from the Government.",30
92,Mr MCCAY,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,Is not that a very strong argument in favour of the amendment?,30
93,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"The point is that we have already alienated large areas of Crown lands in the Territory. The presumption is that these comprise some of land mosfc suitable for settlement. Therefore, if we now decree that no further land shall be alienated, we shall compel those who desire to secure freeholds to treat with the holders of the alienated land, and we shall thus offer a heavy premium to these persons. This proposal would prove mosfc beneficialfcoland speculators-the very class whom the honourable member does not wish to favour. I hope that the Prime Minister will carry out his intention of ascertaining the area of land in British New Guinea, which is suitable for settlement, its situation, - and the purposes to which it could profitably be devoted. We shall then be in a better position to deal with this question than we are at the present moment. In my judgment no injury could result from postponing action in reference to land settlement in the Territory, if the course suggested by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, were adopted. There is no greater land nationalist in Australia than he is",30
94,Mr KIRWAN,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, is in favour of my amendment.",31
95,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"I had a con- a comparison. versation withhim last evening, and if I understood him aright he intends to adhere to his own proposal.",31
96,Mr KIRWAN,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,There is nothing inconsistent between his proposal and my own.,31
97,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie desires to insert a clause in this Rill declaring that no land shall be alienated. But the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, has pointed out that if we adopt his proposal no ordinance relating to the sale of Crown lands would become operative within twelve months of its being passed by the local authorities of the Territory, because it has to receive the assent of the Commonwealth Government, and would require to lie upon the table of this House. Altogether I feel disposed to support the proposal of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, rather than the honourable member for Kalgoorlie.",31
98,Mr BROWN,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE," The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has suggested that it would be wise to defer action in connection with this matter until further information concerning the area of land in Papua that has been alienated or is in course of alienation, is forthcoming. I think that the Prime Minister promised to make that information available during the course of this debate.",31
99,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,How could I make an inquiry in New Guinea during the course of this discussion 1 There is no cable. It would be a physical impossibility.,31
100,Mr BROWN,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,I am sorry that the information is not available. We have been told that last year the revenue derived from the sale of lands and leases in British New Guinea was approximately Â£700 . Ifc was added fchafc the revenue which it was estimated would be received from the same source during the current year was about .Â£1000. What I desire to ascertain is the area of land that has been alienated or is in course of alienation. I was under the impression that the Prime Minister promised to make the information available. I imaginedfchafchaving all the papers afc his disposal he would be in a position to supply it.,31
101,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"What the honourable member wants is a comparison between the relative success of freehold and leasehold tenure in the Possession, and I do not think there is any report which makes such",31
102,Mr BROWN,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,I do not desire any comparison between the success of freehold and leasehold tenure. I merely wish to know the area of land that has been sold or is under contract for sale.,31
103,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,I have the information for the year ended 1902. Ifc is contained in the report which is before honourable members.,31
104,Mr BROWN,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,But does that comprise the total area which has been alienated ?,31
105,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"No , it refers only tofcheoperations of one year.",31
106,Mr BROWN,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"I desire to know the total area of land that has been sold or has been put under contract for sale since the Possession came under British, occupancy. Sir EDMUNDBARTON (Hunter Minister for External Affairs) - I have not the least objection to obtaining as much of the information desired by the honourable member for Cano*blas as can be secured from the records in my office, which consist of the annual reports and despatches relating to the area of land that has been sold or leased from the date of British occupancy of the Possession. Whafc is specified in the last report published-whic h indicates what was done up to the 30th June, 1902-is that, taking the several divisions together, of which there are six, the largest amount derived from. the sale and leasing of land was in the eastern division, where Â£ 2 8 5 2s. 6d. was received. The central division returned the next largest sum, namely, Â£229 16s. 3d., and in the four other divisions the revenue from this source was, respectively, Â£ 5 1 9s. 10d., Â£ 5 8 17s. 6d., Â£ 1 2 12s. 6d., and nothing- a total of Â£ 6 3 7 18s. 7d.",31
107,Mr BROWN,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,-Can the Prime tell the Committee the area which that tenure. amount represents 1,32
108,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Unles s it is stated in the report, I cannot do so at this moment, bufc I think I can do so by Tuesto day next. As the. honourable member desires the information, I will see that is procured by Tuesday, so far as the areas and the amounts are concerned.",32
109,Mr BAMFORD,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,Is that an intimation that the debate m:*y be adjourned ?,32
110,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"That is a matter which is in the hands offcheComverted .ruittee. I ask honourable members not to agree to the amendment. If they do, trust that they will not attempt to impose conditions relative to land tenure in the simple. Territory until those on the spot have an opportunity of reporting or furnishing us with any ordinance bearing upon the matter, which can then be either allowed or disallowed. I take the amendment in its present form to be a provision that grant of Crown lands for any freehold shall be made. Down to that seemsfchafcthe honourable member for Kalgoorlie and the honourable and learned ber for Northern Melbourne are in accord, although the supporters of the amendment seem to be divided upon the question whether leased lands should be periodical re-appraisemeufcs afc reasonably long intervals or to annual appraisements.",32
111,Mr HIGGINS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"No . I shall support proposal of the honourable member for Kalof goorlie for annual re-appraisements, though I do not regard that portion of it as being essential.",32
112,Sir EDMUND BABTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"But there ment are other honourable members who have spoken, and who are not at one with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie on that point. However, I do not wish to comment upon that fact any further than to say that, if the amendment is carried, it should go further than the present point infcheConI stitution. The debate has covered a very wide range indeed, but, after all, there only two points which I am called upon consider. The first is whether the system of British New Guinea should be one of leasing exclusively, and the second, whether we are in a position to decide that matter at the present moment.",32
113,Mr KINGSTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"If leases in perpetuity at a peppercorn rental are allowed, Minister results may be worse than under a freehold",32
114,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"That does not affect ""the argument which l a m now advancing. It seems to me that one fact has be steadily borne in mind ; andfchafcfact I am adducing not so much as an argument it against the leasing system as against some views which have been urged. Wherever a leasehold system is in operation, it is a singular circumstance fchafc those who hold land under it are always to be found moving heaven and earth to get their leases coninto freeholds. Whether they are right or wrong I do not preterfd fco say. I I know that in New South Wales perpetual leaseholders % are clamouring for the feeThere the leasing system was had embodied in a Land Bill which was introduced in 1896 or 1897 by the present leader of the Opposition int the New South Wales Parliament, Mr CarrUthers, and has operated ever since, bufc it is well no known that the perpetual leaseholders are estate constantly endeavouring to turn their point it estates into freehold.",32
115,Mr SALMON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,Because they would thus memsecure a more liquid asset.,32
116,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Thaf c may be, and I am not quite sure that a man of should be deprived of the opportunity to subject to obtain that liquid asset.",32
117,Mr MCCAY,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,We do not give him the land for that purpose.,32
118,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"The reason the why many of them apply for the conversion their leaseholds into freeholds is that fchey believe that in that event they will so be able to raise money on the security of their land and devote it to the developof their property. Bufc with all respect to my honourable and learned friend, that does not constitute a very strong argument in favour of perpetual and unalterable leaseholds. In the first place, let me deal with the question of whether it is better that no there should be aleasehold system exclusively. am afraid that the information which the honourable member for Canobolas requires, are and which I shall do my besfc fco secure, to would scarcely be sufficient to establish land that proposition or to enable us to deal with it either in the affirmative or the negative. I do not think that the mere figures will prove much, unless they are illustrated by those who have been on the spot, who know what the comparative in the ducements have been, who know how far the locality of various classes of land led to it being taken up under one tenure the other, ""and who can say to what' extent the taking up of leaseholds has' been rebe garded merely as a preliminary to the quirement of freeholds. Those are a points, among many others, on which inforthe mation should be gathered. My opinion that we should either have a report, which am willing to obtain, before action is takenand it would be perfectly open to us to take action after receiving that report-or we should assume that the Executive and Legislative Councils of the Possession know a little more about the.local circumstances than we do. '-If they do not fchey have been there in vain. I could obtain a report before they expressed their opinion in ordinance, bufc an ordinance passed by on the subject, and suggested by the altered circumstances and government of the session, would be a fit subject for the cise of our judgment, notwithstanding fchafc it had been allowed by the Governorin General, because we have power, even that stage, to set it at nought. one with the honourable member for Wentcould worth in saying that we are in danger of proceeding to deal with this matter sufficient information. I cannot say that found it very easy to obtain information. Honourable members know of the time all occupiedin the transmission of mails, and fchey know also, if I may be permitted to say so, that it was hardly natural that should have anticipated that the debate would take this turn in favour of an exclulargest; element. sive system of leaseholds. I have striven see that we should not at present take irrevocable step, that we should be guided by the information obtainable, and that until we obtain further information we should annexation not take any steps which might prevent the settlement of the Possession. Upon, question of settlement I wish to join issue with the honourable member ramatta and others who share view. I do not agree that the sole purpose of the acquisition of British New Guinea was to provide for the better milimembers tary defence of the Commonwealth. the whole course of the debate which took place on the resolution submitted to the House some twelve months ago to provide for the acquisition of the Territory by the Commonwealth it is evident that our minds were affected by other considerations. debate dealt with the class of population Sir Edmund Barton.. has that would occupy British New Guinea, or or which was originally there, the indigenous products, the products acclimatized or fit to acclimatized, and the general question of acdevelopment. These facts show that honorfew able members discussed the question with idea in their minds that the Territory, is if properly governed, might become a fair I and fit field for development and investment. . Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN - Geographicall y that it belongs to Australia;",32
119,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"It was put forward that by reason of its geographical position British New Guinea was fit to be held with Australia. Bufc apart from that matter, and from the influence which, an as the debate shows, was very small, them that the question of defence exercised, there was nothing that distinguished in the Posminds of honourable members the question exerof the acquisition of the Territory from the considerations ordinarily involved such an acquisition, namely, the at development and settlement of the PosI am afc session by our own race so ' far as that be done without injustice to the original holders of the land. That it should on inbe so developed I have always urged, I and in the administration of the Possession I shall do, as I have done in the past, that I can to enforce that consideration. That was the general purpose for which . the Possession was acquired. Defence may I have been an element which weighed with us, bufc it was not by any means the The geographical posito tion of New Guinea; the fact that the any Conference held in 1883, afc which Australia was fully represented by responsible Ministers, had made a - request for the of the Possession, wifchoutlimiting itself to any .question of defence; the fact the also of the natural riches of the Possession which were well known, notwithstanding for Par the limited extent of exploration and prohis specting that had occurred, contributed respectively to the decision at which this House arrived. Therefore, unless honourable have changed the view they held From when we resolved to take over the Territory, these are fit questions for us to entertain today ; and fchey enter into the consideration of the way in which the land should be dealt with. I have already explained that, as a matter of business, I The think that the leasehold system might well . be applied to such an area as the Federal i i territory is likely to be. That territory will he in a somewhat central position, as far as accessibility and the movements of people are concerned. It will be .situated in a population of nearly 4,000,000, and therefore it presents a wholly different aspect from the case presented by British New Guinea. If it be part of our purpose to deal with that Possession in such a way as to lead to its future development, then we ought not, in the first instance, immediately it comes into our hands, and without awaiting further information than we have before ns, to come to a determination that the land system shall be exclusively of one character.. I can quite respect the opinions and feelings of those who think that the leasing system, if possible, should be the only one allowed in any country. But I am not at one with those who hold that opinion. I think that we should have to undo not only much that has been done in the past, but much that has actually entered into the character and nature of the people, if we attempted toenforce that proposition. But I am willing to recognise the principle in a case in which, from obvious business considerations principle, it can be fully applied. The distinction between the Federal territory and British New Guinea is that we are fairly satisfied that the principle can be applied to the Federal territory as a business transaction. The constantly increasing revenue might be fairly regarded as a set-off against the loans necessary in connection with the Federal capital. Those considerations do not apply in the case of British New Guinea. It will be difficult to settle British New Guinea, but I take leave to sa}', as a'matter of illustration, that no difficulty will be experienced in settling the Federal capital. There will be certain causes which must necessarily attract a considerable number of people to it . Experience tells us that a Federal capital, even when created in localities where there has not been much settlement before, has attracted people anxious to pursue the ordinary avocations of mankind. We find British New Guinea differentty situated. It is a place which will not be attractive under any system of land tenure; but we are told now that, without having the means of thoroughly comparing the effects of the two systems, we are to cut ourselves down to the enforcement of the one. Thafc means, so far as I can gather, that in any case, and in all circumstances, no matter what the condition of the country may be, or how much or how little we know of it, the leasing system is the only sound policy. As an individual member of the Committee I am not prepared to subscribe to that view. I do not think that we have reached any stage of even theoretical perfection which enables usfcosayfchafc,in all circumstances and cases, the policy proposed in fchis amendment; is invariably and unalterably the best. One would have to come to that conclusion before he could legitimately vote for the amendment. On the other hand, what is there to hinder the House on another opportunity from expressing its opinion fully and effectively after full information has been placed before it ?",33
120,Mr HIGGINS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,After all the land has been granted.,34
121,Sir EDMUND BABTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,How much would be granted in the meanfcime?,34
122,Mr HIGGINS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"We are told that there are some 206,000 acres being dealt with. Sir EDMUND .BARTON - What will be the difference if we grant leaseholds in perpetuity-o r under such circumstances that the occupiers will obtain a fairly perfect hold of the land-o r grant freeholds? I am speaking of what may take place duringfcheinterim. Nothing thatwould be irrevocable; nothing that would largely affect the enormous extent of that Possession, comprising, as it does, 97,500 square miles, could be done by any sort of alienation which might take place in the meantime. There will be a Government of this Commonwealth-it does not matter from which side-controllin g the affairs of thePossession, and that Government is not likely to lend its assistance fco any kind of illegitimate or enormous acquisition of land. If any one were to tell me that capital could be prevented from exercising its influence under a leasehold system, but could not be prevented from doing so under a freehold system, I should say that that was an opinion expressed without due-thought.",34
123,Mr HIGGINS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,No one has said such a thing.,34
124,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"It has practically been said. It has practically been urged that under the freehold system the acquisition of land by dummying and other illegitimate means is inevitable, but that those practices can be prevented under the leasehold system. In my opinion, what could be done under the one could be done under the other. But that is not the pivot upon which the virtues of either system rests.",34
125,Mr SPENCE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"""We can make residence a condition.",35
126,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"We have only to look at the very country in which we live to see that condition of residence is not a sufficient precaution against the aggregation of land by the capitalist. The leasehold system does not bind a man down to his residence to a greater extent than does the freehold system. It depends upon the provisions of the law imposed upon the occupier. If the law as applied to one system is weaker than the law as applied to other system, that system will become weaker in its withstandment of the influences of capital, and vice versd. I think that this is a case in which the Committee should be appealed to, to hold its hand.",35
127,Mr HIGGINS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,That is all we want.,35
128,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"The continual repetition of the statement that that is all the honourable and learned member wants does not add force to his arguments. If Papua becomes settled under a system of leasing, then upon the extent to which settlement under that system proceeds will depend whether the settlers will remain under a leasehold system. Porfchisreason : If experience shows, as I contend it does, that those who hold land under Crown leasing systems are almost unanimous in their endeavours to convert their holdings into freeholds, then the time when in any country freeholds will take the place of leaseholds will depend merely on the progress of settlement under a system of leasing, and the extent to which the settlers become factors of political influence.",35
129,Mr WATSON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,A large number of the leaseholders in New South Wales are opposing the conversion of their leaseholds.,35
130,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"No doubt some of them are; but a very large number of them have done their best to have their leaseholds converted into freeholds. Does' any one doubt that those who hold land for pastoral occupation under lease from the Crown are always endeavouring, so far as their means will allow, to convert their leaseholds into freeholds 1 This tendency is so universal in practicefchatifc seems almostfcobe a tendency of human nature, and a tendency which will have its effect whatever kind of leasehold may be adopted. I know that; it will be said that this argument applies also tofcheprinciple of reserving the Federal territory from alienation in feesimple. Bufc, until the time comes when there is an irresistible demand for the conversion of leaseholds into freeholds, there will be a period of some years during which the leasing system will be of great advantage in helping us to provide for the payment of interest on money borrowed to carry out necessary work, the provision of sinking funds, and other expenditure incidental to the initial stages of the foundation of the capital. Therefore, there is a good ^businessaspect to the principle as it affects the Federal territory. But it seems to me that. the same considerations will not apply to the land system of New Guinea. If the Committee is of opinion that no land in New Guinea should be alienated, I will, if honourable members consent to hold their hands in the meanwhile, undertake to give instructions that no alienation of land shall take place there until I can procure full information from those who x alone knowfcheconditions obtaining in the Territory. This will prevent what the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has termed "" irrevocable action "" being taken, and when the information, which I am only too anxious that honourable members should have has been obtained, ib will be open to them to lay down on permanent and settled lines the conditions which they think should govern the system of land tenure there. Thafc is, I think, as fair a proposition as I can make. To my mind it would be an exhibition of undue haste, if, in the face of that proposal, honourable members were to attempt fco carry the amendment}. In asking for the support of the Committee in taking this stand, I would also refer them to the fact that the amendment which the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, proposes to move in clauses 37 and 38, and which I have already accepted, afford a, sufficient safeguard against alienation, even without my undertaking. Clause 37 provides that an ordinance reserved for the pleasure of the Governor General shall not have any force unless and u n t i l within one year from the day on which it is presented for his assent, the LieutenantGovernoipublishes within the Territory a notification that it has received fchafc assent. To that provision the honourable and learned member wishss to add the proviso that, in the case of an ordinance dealing with the alienation of Crown lands, such notification shall not be published until forty days after the ordinance has been laid before both Houses of Parliament. He also proposes to amend clause 38 by adding to the ordinances to which the Lieutenant-Governor shall not assent until the signification of the Governor General's pleasure thereon, any ordinance dealing with the alienation of - Crown lands. This is an important matter, and one which, as the Minister within whose Department the administration of the Territory falls, I have greatly at heart. I hope, therefore, that honourable members will come to no definite decision in regard to it until they have obtained the best information upon all the surrounding circumstances which. I can procure for them. I - ask the honourable member for Kalgoorlie not to press his amendment. If he does persist I shall oppose it ; but I further ask him, in the event of the amendment being - agreed to by tire Committee, not to proceed further in tying the hands of those who will be called upon to administer the affairs of this young community by laying down hard - and fast provisions as to the way in which the Government shall receive its rents from the land that is leased; that is, as fco whether the appraisement of values shall be - annual or shall bake place afc other periods.",35
131,Mr HIGGINS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Northern Melbourne) 'The only question before the Committee at the present time is whether land in New 'Guinea shall be granted in freehold. I therefore deprecate the wide range which the discussion has taken. Although the - settlement is not a very live one just yet, we have to deal with a practical matter, which will eventually become of great importance. The object which the Prime Minister has in view seems to be exactly that at which honourable members are aiming. He wishes that no irrevocable step shall be taken in regard fco the alienation of land in New Guinea until we have full information on the subject. That is what those in favor of the amendment desire. We wish to prevent irrevocable alienation in perpetuity until, we are convinced that it is necessary, when, I am sure, honourable members will be willing to cast their theories from - them, and bow to the inevitable. In the meantime, however, we desire to prevent the irrevocable - appropriation of the lands of the territory by speculators, of which there is a present - danger. All this doctrinaire talk about the possession of the fee-simple making men careful not to exhaust the soil, and so forth, is beside the question, which is-Shoul d we not prevent all alienation until we have full information on the whole subject ? I find it stated in the last report on the administration of New Guinea, that. The total area applied for was 202,529 acres, but the bulk of this was represented by two or three applications for very large blocks, which the Government were not able to deal with definitely. So that the sword is actually hanging over our heads, as these applications may be dealt with any day.",36
132,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,The Prime Minister has promised to prevent any further - alienation in the meantime.,36
133,Mr HIGGINS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"If he had made that statement earlier in the debate Ifchinkfchata great deal of discussion would have been saved. There is a greafc deal to be said in favour of not acting rashly, and without full information, though, having hurriedly glanced throughfcheprovisions of the Bill, I do not think that a grant of land in feesimple would be invalid, or that the Prime Minister could put a stop to alienation if the administration which now has control of New Guinea were to assent to it. Therefore I suggest the insertion before the amendment of that honourable member for Kalgoorlie offchewordsUntil Parliament shall resolve to the contrary there shall be no grant.",36
134,Mr WATSON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Thes e words are unnecessary, because that is implied.",36
135,Mr HIGGINS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"No . We can repeal an Act only by formal stages, but it is a simpler matter to obtain a resolution of the two Houses.",36
136,Mr WATSON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,I think that we should make provision for the passing of an Act.,36
137,Mr HIGGINS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"As the Prime Minister has shown a disposition to compromise on the question, I think it would be an important gain to provide that, until - the passing of a resolution by the two Houses permitting the granting of land in feesimple, no such grants shall be made.",36
138,Mr THOMAS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,Le t us fix the principle now.,36
139,Mr HIGGINS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"The honourable member may wish to do that, and I , too, should like to see it done, but it has been said that "" The better is often the enemy of the good."" If we try to get too much, we may get nothing. ,",36
140,Mr WATSON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,We have a majority.,37
141,Mr HIGGINS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"I am glad to hear it , but I should like to have the co-operation of the Ministry.",37
142,Mr WILKS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"What does that matter, if they are in the wrong ?",37
143,Mr HIGGINS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"The honourable member speaks as an out-and-oufc opponent of the Government; but I , as a loyal supporter, feel constrained to adopt a different attitude. The Prime Minister appears t'o think that the proposal to prevent the alienation of land in fee simple is a novel one, but he, surely, must be aware that the Germans have proceeded upon exactly the same lines in Shantung. They have acquired control over a large area of land there, and have adopted the non-alienation principle in regard to it. The amendment does not contemplate the leasing of land in perpetuity at a pepper-corn rental, because the honourable member proposes that there shall be periodical re-appraisements. patience with doctrinaire theories as to the freehold system being the best to apply to all countries, under all circumstances. The honourable member for Gippsland was eloquent in his support of this idea, and stated that the man who owned the land in fee simple did not exhaust the soil. I quite agree with him. He very often does not do any thing with ib. When I was in Tasmariial passed through large areas of country held for the last 90 years by the Van .Diemen's Land Company. The failure of the company to turn this land to any account had bad the effect of retarding the development of the west coast of Tasmania for many years. The same conditions obtain in the Tamworth district of New South Wales, where the Peel River Company hold large areas of land, and in South Australia where the South Australian Land Company occupy a similar position. The granting of land does not necessarily secure the settlement of it. Land grants often retard settlement. If we permit the sale of land in fee simple in the Territorj', we shall find that immediately the miners begin to obtain good results, the land speculators will flock there and buy up land, for which they will make the miners pay afterwards.",37
144,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,But would not leasehe holders round about such mining settlements make their sub-lessees pay higher rentals ?,37
145,Mr HIGGINS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Lessee s as a rule take care to pay rent only for such land as they require for bheir own purposes. The land speculator is not a land settler. A man holding land in fee simple can do what he likes with it, but under proper leasing conditions a lessee does not hold more land than he requires for his own use, especially when the land is subject to re-appraisement at intervals, and cannot be sub-let with any advantage. I realise that immediately we broach the subject of land legislation we touch upon the most complex feature of our civilization. No doubt we could, in connection with this subject, discuss the whole history of civilization. ' I desire, however, to simplify the debate as much as possible. I understand that the Prime Minister is in accord with us, but that he does not wish us to do anybhing that would be irrevocable. We hope bhat the amendment will not commit us beyond recall, and I shall vote for it, because I think we ought to insist that no land shall be alienated in fee simple until Parliament has had some say in the I have no matter.",37
146,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Wentworth). - Since I spoke last night I have become more than ever convinced that, upon broad political grounds, it would be a great mistake for this Parliamenb to irrevocably bind itself, or the Legislative Council of the Territory, to any hard-and-fast principles in regard to land tenure. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne was a little inconsistent. The question before us is not that of the value of the leasing system as against alienation. That is not the point at all. It is possible that, when f u ll information is placed before us in an official manner, I may support the extreme attitude taken up by some honourable members.' It is admitted, however, that, at present, we have insufficient information regarding the land, and the conditions under which it could be successfully occupied. It is proposed that there should be no alienation of land, but, in order to make such a proposal perfect, it is necessary to provide for leaseholds, and to specify the periods at which appraisements shall take place, and other conditions. No wholesale alienation of land is how taking place, and we have the word of the Prime Minister that will give instructions that no land shall be alienated. But what is proposed 1 Not merely that we shall assert the principle of non-alienation because we believe in it, bub that we shall absolutely tie the hands of the Government. If the amendment is incorporated in the Bill, it will, in effect, give the Lieutenant-Governor and the Council New Guinea to understand that in any land proposal they may have to make there must be no alienation. Honorable MEMBERS --Hear , hear.",37
147,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,That our may be the ultimate decision of Parliathe ment.,38
148,Mr WATSON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Hear , hear; that is what non-alienation, we want.",38
149,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Yes , no doubt. But there are three parties in this Chamber in regard to this question.. There are those who believe in alienation, those who do not under any circumstances believe in alienation, and those who desire to stop any attempt at alienation or any drastic dealing with the lands of the Territory until Parliament can fully consider the question. The proposal that we should legislate upon the land question in a mere machinery Bill of this kind and tie the hands of those who could give us valuable informaand tion and assistance is absolutely opposed to my ideas regarding the province of the monwealth Government. We have the word of the Prime Minister that the information at present available is incomplete, and as a matter-of courtesy, and in order ourselves right before the people of the monwealth, and in the eyes of those from whom we derive the control of this TerriGuinea tory, we might stay our hand. We have the express word of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth-and if that is not good enough he is not fit to occupy his positionthat no alienation of land shall take place until we have had an opportunity of legisyet, lating upon the subject, and if we accept that assurance, and rest content for the time being, we shall place ourselves in a far better position before the country, and before the people who gave us the Territime tory, than if we forthwith make drastic regulations applying to a territory which few of us have ever seen, and to which now none of us have any desire to go. It is very clear thatthose honourable members who are so strong])' supporting the amendprinciple ment are afraid of an investigation. Why should they be so anxious to embody a prothe vision of this kind in the measure before Surely they are not afraid of the matter placed before us in a concrete shape after all possible information has been obtained. I have no feeling in this matter, and not now entering into the relative merits the freehold or leasing systems. I do not 7o of care very much about that; but I have some concern for the corporate honour of this House, and I do not think we should legislate upon a matter relating to a distant territory which we have taken under control until we are in possession of all facts which will enable us to deal with it in a sensible manner. Even if I believed m I should still, in consideration of the surroundings of our position as a legislative and deliberative body, accept the Word of the Prime Minister, and leave the matter in abeyance until Parliamenb could arrive at a sensible and judicious decision. .",38
150,Mr KIRWAN,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Kalgoorlie^ - I am sorry that the Prime Minister could not see his way to accept the amendment. Having considered his representations, and all the arguments advanced in support of his view, I utterly fail to see why there should be any delay. The amendment involves a principle which is either right or wrong, I do not see how any information subsequently obtained can affect that principle.. ComW it h me, therefore, the question is one of asserting a principle now or at some future time ; and I cannot conceive that surely in the case of New Guinea any timeto set would be more opportune than the preComsent. Some honourable members seem to think that the future prospecbs of New are not very bright, but they seem to forget that large areas ofland in, Australia, which were at one time regarded as utterly worthless, now possess a very high value. I represent a district extending over thousands of square miles, and within the memory of every honourable member-te n or eleven years ago-the whole of the land in that district was utterly worthless; it could not be sold for a farthing an. acre. If a proposal had been made at bhat to apply the principle of non-alienation to all the Crown lands of Western Australia, arguments exactly similar to those used would have been directed against it, and yet since that time the land referred to has increased immensely in value. If the of non-alienation had been applied to the Crown lands of Western Australia, settlement upon the gold-fields would us ? not have been affected in the slightest being degree. The people who went there were attracted by the gold, and they would have been quite indifferent to the conditions of I am land tenure. Many prospectors, whom I of know to be good judges, have told me that, sooner or later, there will be valuable gold finds in New Guinea, and, if their pro phecies should ever be fulfilled, the history of the ""Western Australian gold-fields will be repeated in the Territory. In Western Australia it was not the men who opened up the country who derived the benefit of the added value given to the land as the result of their work, but a number of speculators, some of whom never even visited Western Australia. Purther, whilst New Guinea is 'at present an unhealthy country, its future may be altogether different. The time will come when .its forests will have been cleared, and the Territory will have been drained. Then climatic changes will be sure to occur. In addition, there is land in the interior at a considercarried. able elevation, which might easily be made a sanatorium, so that a large population may eventually settle in New Guinea. Por that reason I think that the present is a singularly opportune time to submit my proposal. In reference to an interjection by the right honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, it is quite true that a leasehold might be granted at a peppercorn rental for 999 years. In granting a lease which extended over that period, the terms of the amendment might be complied with, but to all intents and purposes such a lease would be equal to a freehold. It will be necessary to prevent that, and for that reason I think the leases should be subject to an annual re-appraisemen t.",38
151,Mr WILKS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE," The debate last night and today has passed through many curious phases. The arguments advanced by the Prime Minister do not support the position which he has taken up. The right honourable gentleman desires delay in order that we may be supplied with further information. Yet honourable members have before them the fact that applications have been made for the freehold of many thousands of acres of land in the Territory. Even those who ask for further information admit that only the fringe of the island is populated, and that comparatively few acres have been alienated. That is an argument in favour of those who advocate the leasing system rather than of their opponents. The Prime Minister declares that he has never yet heard of a lease-holder who did not wish to convert his lease into a freehold. That is always the case. The individual is ever anxious to make his land a more negotiable asset. It should be remembered, however, that we are not legislating for the individual, but for the community. What information can we obtain beyond that-which is already in our possession 1 We are aware that applications have been made for the freehold of 200,000 acres in New Guinea. In my opinion delay in deciding the system of land tenure' to be adopted in that Territory will only accentuate existing difficulties. Possibly, if we wait t ill the facts are cold, some honourable member will then suggest the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the matter, and the next Ministry may not be prepared to deal with it . I am extremely glad that the amendment has been submitted, and I trust that it will be Mr A . PATERSON (Capricornia) - As I am one of the very few members who are sorry that we ever had anything to do with New Guinea, I can approach this subject with a perfectly open mind. But the satire of the situation appears to me to be very full of sting. Here we have a democratic Australian Commonwealth, and yet upon the first possible occasion the Government propose to create a class of ground landlords. As I read the signs of the times, there is no class in the world which has produced so much misery and depression as have the ground landlords. There is a great advantage in being a ground landlord. The Prime Minister spoke very strongly upon this matter, and pointed out that lease-holders universally desire to become landlords. Of course they do. But we desire that the nation shall become the landlord, and then our difficulties will disappear, because the profits made out of therentals will be appropriated forthegood of the Commonwealth. Expressed in a phrase, I think that the proposal of the Government to sell the freehold is a partial wealth idea. It elevates one class. But the amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is a Commonwealth idea, because it makes for the common weal. We should lose no time in settling this matter, because we cannot tell what influence may be brought to bear in the future. Of the 200,000 acres which have been applied for in New Guinea, only about 3,000 acres have been granted. But the fact remains that there were only two or three applicants for that enormous area of land. We talk about Australia belonging to the Australians. Nothing of the kind. The finest parts of it belong to the landlords. We cannot do better than to alter this system by insisting upon the substitution of a leasehold system. I feel very strongly upon this point, and I shall support the amendment.",39
152,Mr BAMFORD,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE," Before this question goes to a division, I should lik e to point out to the honourable member for K a l goorlie that there is one very importan t matter which mighb have been dealt with in his amendment, but which has been entirel y overlooked. No provision has been made either in the Bill or in the amendment to preserve to the Commonwealth Government the mineral rights of the terr it o r y .

Clause 24The Lieutenant-Governor shall alone be entitled to submit questions to the Executive Council for advice or decision ; but if the - Lieutenant Governor declines to submit any question to the Council when requested in writing by any member so to do, that member may require that his written request, together with the answer of the Lieutenant-Governor thereto, be recorded on the minutes.",41
161,Mr HIGGINS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Northern Melbourne) I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he considers that there is any need for this very stringent provision that the Lieu tenant Governor shall alone be entitled to submit questions to the Executive Council. This clause will give him the absolute power of initiative. It must be observed that under the following clause he will be ablefcoact independently of or against the advice of the other members of the Council. Having regard to the fact that it is a Crown colony, and that in Western Australia the Lieutenant-Governor used to have a Council, but was free to act against its advice, I do not think that the provisions of clause 25 are unreasonable. As the Lieutenant Governor is the person from whom this Parliament will require the proper administration of the Territory, it must place it within his discretion to act; in contravention of the advice of his Executive Council. But T ask the Prime Minister what need is there for clause 241 In my opinion, the office of Executive Councillor ought to be filled only by men of initiative and activity, who have ideas to bring forward for the development of the country in the interests of the settlers there. There may be reasons which I have not heard, and which have not entered my mind, for the retention of this provision, but at present I see no sufficient reason for it, and therefore propose to ask honourable members to negative it . No matter how valuable an idea may be, a member of the Executive Council cannot submit ifcfcothafc body for consideration ;fchesole initiative is with the Lieutenant-Governor. But if there is one thing which is always in evidence in connection with the administration of Crown colonies, it is the tendency of Governors to inertia. They do not want to be bothered. They consider persons who submit questions more or less of a nuisance, and regard, with the kindliest eye, those who are prepared to leave things alone. The members of the Executive Council, .however, should be more than mere dummies. It may be right to allow the Lieutenant-Governor to refuse to act on their advice, but I do not see why they should not be allowed to submit questions to the Council for consideration.",41
162,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"There is a distinction between the position of a member of an Executive Council in a Crown colony and the same position under responsible Government, bufc even under responsible Government it is technically the Crown that submits questions to the Council. The provision to which the honourable member objects is a usual one in the Constitutions of Crown colonies. The Lieutenant-Governor of Papua will have a much more real and actual power, with a commensurate responsibility, than is given to the Governor of a country which enjoys responsible Government, and it has always been thought advisable to give those holding such positions the sole power of initiation in the submission of questions to their Executive Councils. I know of one case in which the Governor of a Crown colony refused to submifc to his Executive Council a question raised by a member of that Council, and the Minister for Defence has some recollection of' the matter, too. He will, however, bear me out in the statement that it would be an extraordinary thing for a Governor to take that course, and that no Governor knowing the ordinary trend of events, would refuse to submifc to his Council, unless it would be manifestly outrageous to do so, any question which a member of the Council desired to have submitted. It is thought that, as the Lieutenant-Governor has the responsibility, he should have the reins of Government in his hands to this extent at least. The provision is strongly safeguarded, inasmuch as a member of the Executive Council, if his requestfcohave a question submitted is not granted, can require that the terms of that request shall be recorded in the minutes, and, as a copy of the minutes will be always accessible to the Governor General and his Ministers, the whole circumstances will be known to us. Therefore, the Lieutenant Governor would refuse at his own risk to submit a reasonable question. I think that honourable members may well consent to leave in the Bill what is a very ordinary and usual provision, which will work good rather than harm.",42
163,Mr WINTER COOKE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Wannon) There is one point which I should like to bring before the Prime Minister, and it is this : AVhereas under the Royal Instructions the Administrator of a Dependency is bound, when a capital sentence has been pronounced, to ask for a report upon the case from the Judge, and - to submit it to his Executive Council, there is no such pro- vision in this Bill. The Lieutenant-Governor might fchink it inadvisable to bring such a case before his Executive Council, and it would be too late to do any good for a member of the Council to have it recorded on the minutes that he desired to have the case brought forward for consideration. I therefore ask the Prime Minister if he can amend the Bil l so as to compel the LieutenautGovernor to bring such cases before the Executive Council.",42
164,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,There is no risk of a Lieutenant-Governor allowing a man to be executed before he has brought the case before his Executive Council.,42
165,Mr WINTER COOKE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"But it was thought well, in preparing the Royal In structions, to require him to do so.",42
166,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"The practice which exists in Crown colonies in this respect is similar to that which exists under responsible government. These matters are always brought before the Executive, to whom the Judge reports.",42
167,Mr WINTER COOKE,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,Dol understand that the Lieutenant Governor will be bound to bring these cases - before the Executive Council 1,42
168,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Undoubtedly . He would incur grave censure from the Federal Government if he did not. It is as certain to be done as it is certain that the prerogative would not be exercised or withheld in England, except on the advice of responsible Ministers.",42
169,Mr HIGGINS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Northern Melbourne) I am grateful to the Prime Minister for his explanation ; but he has not referred us to Constitutions in which this provision obtains. Sir EDMUND ' BARTON - It is a usual provision in the Constitution of Crown colonies, and my recollection is supported by the Minister for Defence, who was for a long time a member of the Executive Council of a Crown colony.",42
170,Mr HIGGINS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"All the world knows of the part which the Minister for Defence played when a member of an irresponsible Cabinet. I am sure, however, that when he was an Executive Councillor he was brimming over with ideas which were of much value to the administration of the colony, and I cannot see why, when such men are appointed to the Executive Council of New Guinea, they should not be allowed to bring their ideas before the Council.",42
171,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"The Lieutenanfc- Governor would not dream of refusing to submit a question, unless it would be absolutely wrong to do so, and in that case his refusal could be recorded. The underlying idea is that responsibility should rest where the power rests.",43
172,Mr HIGGINS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Unde r clause 25 the Lieutenant-Governor can act in opposition the advice of his Council, and, that being so, I see no reason why he alone should have the initiative in the questions to the Council. I hope honourable members will negative the clause.",43
173,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Robertson) It seems to me that no harm would be done by striking out clause 24, because, as honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has pointed out, the Lieutenantfore Governor is not bound to accept his Executive Council, though, if he refuses to accept it , the fact must be reported to head-quarters, and would therefore come under the notice of the Federal Ministry. But if the Lieutenant-Governor declines to submit the question to his Council, and that fact is merely recorded in the minutes, although the minutes will be available to the Federal Government, they may not ""be read. We know, indeed, that minutes are very rarely read. But, even if it happens that they are read, these records may have very little significance for Ministers. As a matter of fact, members of the Executive Council who are continually asking to have questions submitted to the Council which the Lieutenant-Governor does not wish to submit will be regarded as obnoxious individuals. High officials would not be at all likely to regard such persons with favour. The object which' the Prime Minister has divided. in view would still be achieved if the clause were struck out, because all that is necessary is embodied in the following clause.",43
174,Mr THOMSON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE," I can conceive that the Lieutenant-Governor might have good reason for declining to allow certain matters to be brought before an Executive Council composed of Government officials. There mighb be a certain movement on the part of these officials to reflect on the Lieutenant-Governor, and an opportunity might be taken to bring forward motions which might have the effect of temporarily discrediting him. I do not think it desirable that such motions should be discussed by the Council.",43
175,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,It would very often result in unseemly proceedings.,43
176,Mr THOMSON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"Undoubtedly. So long as a record has to be made of any refusal by the Lieutenant-Governor to allow a motion to be brought forward, I think that the case will be met. I understand that this is not an absolutely new to clause, but that it has been adopted from other enactments of a similar character.",43
177,Sir EDMUND BARTON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,It is the usual submission of Crown colony clause.,43
178,Mr THOMSON,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"That being so, I am quite sure that good reasons must haveexisted for adopting it, and I do not think that we shall incur any danger in retaining it in the Bill. The power of initiative on the the part of members of the Executive might be used in a very improper manner, and thereI think that the clause affords a very the advice of necessary safeguard.",43
179,Mr FOWLER,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE," I take a view exactly opposite to that entertained by the honourable member for North Sydney. I do not apprehend any misuse of the power of initiative, but, on the other hand, I can conceive of grave injustice being done through the refusal of the Lieutenant Governor to allow motions to be discussed. It is true thab the members of the Executive have the power of protest, but mischief might be done before the protest could be dealt with by the Federal Parliament. It is only reasonable to give the power of initiative to the members of the Council, and I sball therefore support the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned memebr for Northern Melbourne.

180,Mr FOWLER,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE," As the Minister representing the Postmaster-General is now in his place, I desire to ask him the following formal questions standing in my name:1. Ia-ita fact that in the Western Australian Postal Department there are young women Who, under the name of cadets, have been giving, their services, in some instances for a period of nearly two years, without any payment whatever ? 2. If such is the case, when may this system be expected to come to an end.? NOES. 3. Are such officers, when formally appointed, not justly entitled to back pay from 1st January, 1903, the beginning of the operation of the Public Service Act, and on which date they should have been appointed or their services dispensed with ? 4. Is the initial salary of Â£30 per annum regarded by the Postmaster-Geueral as fair remuneration for the work of these officers?",44
181,Sir PHILIP FYSH,BASIS OF REPRESENTATION INTHE HOUSE,"I am sorry that I was absent from the Chamber when the honourable member was prepared to ask these questions at the commencement of the sitting. The answers to them are as PAIS. follow :1. Yes; an arrangement existed before the transfer.of the Department to the Commonwealth by which persons were permitted to' come in as learners without pay, on the understanding that permanent appointments would follow as vacancies occurred, and the employee had proved suitable for the work. 2. There is no provision under the Commonwealth Public Service Act for the employment of unpaid cadets, consequently no such appointments, have bepn made since the proclamation of the Act. 3. The officers'were taken on as ""unpaid"" cadets, and under the conditions of their engagement they are only entitled to pay from the date they receive permanent appointment to the service. As a matter of fact, they have no legal claim / to appointment, but the Commissioner considers that they have an equitable claim, and it has been conceded to them. Fourteen female cadets have recently been appointed to the permanent staff, and the remaining number will be provided for as opportunity occurs, provided they pass the qualifying examination and are favourably reported upon. i . The amount stated iB the minimum salary paid to male aud female telephone attendants throughout the Commonwealth. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.3 p.m.",44
