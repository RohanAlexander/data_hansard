2,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) will be absent from question time this week. He is visiting Geneva and Israel on government business. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) will answer questions on his behalf. The Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) is also absent. He is unwell and will be represented by the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop). NA",13
3,The SPEAKER,SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS,Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl has drawn my attention to a question which the Leader of the Opposition directed to him in his capacity as Acting Speaker in relation to supplementary questions. I have pursued the Hansard report of the question and the response of the Acting Speaker and indicate to the House that I am in general agreement with the remarks of the Acting Speaker. NA Immigration,13
4,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen a letter in yesterday's Daily Telegraph from a Sydney mother who wrote: I was extremely concerned and ashamed when my six-year-old son returned home one day from school to proudly tell me he had told an Asian classmate to leave Australia. When I asked him how he could say something like 'That's what that lady on TV said: Has the Prime Minister also seen reports of comments by the New South Wales upper house Liberal member Mrs Helen Sham-Ho calling on the Prime Minister to make a strong statement supporting the Asian community and cultural diversity because after living here for 35 years she felt quite personally attacked by the views of the member for Oxley? Will the Prime Minister now agree it is time for him to exercise leadership on this issue and state clearly and unequivocally that the member for Oxley's views on racial issues are hurtful to a great many Australians, are damaging to our interests in the region and do not reflect the kind of society that Australia is or wants to be?",13
5,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a serious question from the Leader of the Opposition, and I hope the House will enable me to give it a serious response. Can I say in answer to the Leader of the Opposition, no, I have not seen the letter to the Sydney Daily Telegraph but I have no reason to doubt that the Leader of the Opposition truthfully referred to it. Have I seen the remarks attributed to Mrs ShamHo? Yes. Have I generally followed the debate? Yes. Do I have a few things to say about it? Yes. Let me say at the outset that I do not believe it is appropriate for the Prime Minister of this country or senior political figures in leadership positions on either side to define the policies of the government or the party by reference to a maiden speech of an Independent member of parliament. However, seeing that you have given me, by this question, the opportunity of saying a couple of things, I will do so. I might remind the Leader of the Opposition that I have already forcefully restated the non-discriminatory character of Australia's immigration policy. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that I did so when asked a question about it on the highest rating current affairs program in Australia, and a report of those remarks was carried as a lead item in the Australian newspaper and all around this country in that he replied, other newspapers. Let me take the opportunity of saying to the honourable gentleman that the Liberal and National parties will yield to nobody, no political force in this country, in our commitment for racial equality and racial tolerance. Let me make it very clear to the Leader of the Opposition that, no matter what arguments there may be about immigration policy in this country, once a person has come to this country that person is entitled to the respect that is due to every other Australian irrespective of that person's background. In my view there should be robust debate in this country about the size of our immigration policy. People are entitled to attack the present immigration levels without being branded as bigots or racists. That was the point that I made in my speech to the Queensland division of the Liberal Party. I also made another point which my detractors have sought to ignore, and that is that people who exercise free speech have an obligation to do so in a sensitive and caring fashion. That has always been my credo. I make no apology for that. But it has also been my credo that, if someone disagrees with the prevailing orthodoxy of the day, that person should not be denigrated as a narrow-minded bigot. That is basically what has been happening in this country over a very long period of time. It has been happening",13
6,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about Hanson?,14
7,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Denison interjects. When you had people who dared to disagree with your version of how to handle Aboriginal affairs, when you had those people being branded as racists and bigots, then you have a perfect demonstration of the SOlt of MCCarthyism that was creeping into Australian politics under the leadership of the former Prime Minister. MCCarthyism was creeping into Australian politics. I can remember early in 1992 when unemployment went to a very high level, and the minister at that time was the current Leader of the Opposition. The former opposition leader, John Hewson, and I both called for a reduction in the overall level of immigration because of its link with the level of unemployment. For our pains, we were bucketed by the former Prime Minister as racist. He actually used that expression. That is the kind of behaviour that I regard as absolutely unacceptable. Let me return to the first part of the honourable gentleman's question. I will always denounce racial intolerance. I will always defend the non-discriminatory character of Australia's immigration policy. I believe that the contribution that Australians of Asian descent have made to this country has been immense. I want to place on record, as I have on numerous occasions, the high regard in which the Liberal and National parties hold Australians of Asian descent. They have brought to this country many skills, they have made a contribution to our society and they have brought their commitment to individual freedom, their commitment to small business and their commitment to the strength of the extended family. They have brought those values with them and they have made a valuable contribution. I have said that on numerous occasions. It passes very strange that the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite-this is the party, after all, which has made a sleazy preference deal with the Australians Against Further Immigration; Graeme Campbell",14
8,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,14
9,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order on relevance. There can be no relevance in this. There was no preference deal made with this bunch, and you were the beneficiaries of their preferences at the last election.",14
10,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your point of order? Resume your seat.,14
11,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, can I just say again that this government a couple of months ago",14
12,Mr O,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Connor-Why don't you show some leadership on this?,14
13,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Corio will show some demonstrable movement in a minute.,14
14,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government a couple of months ago made some changes to Australia's immigration intake and to Australia's immigration policy. Those changes were made in the national interest. It was the view of the Liberal and National parties that for too long under the former government immigration policy was not driven by the national interest but driven by the desire of sections of the former government to unduly placate vociferous sections of the Australian community. We have introduced a new approach to immigration, but a cornerstone of that new approach is that the policy remains absolutely non-discriminatory. That is our policy, that has always been our policy and it always will be our policy, because it is morally and economically and politically in Australia's interests that we maintain an absolutely nondiscriminatory immigration policy. I have enunciated that on numerous occasions. I might say to the Leader of the Opposition that a couple of weeks ago I visited Jakarta and Tokyo. In the latter city, after meeting the Japanese Prime Minister and attending a news conference which was attended, so I am advised, by a record number of local media representatives for an Australian Prime Minister, not one question was addressed to me about Australia's immigration policy. The reason one was not addressed to me is that it is accepted in countries such as Japan that a nondiscriminatory immigration policy is now and has for many years been a bipartisan given of Australian politics. Native Title Act",14
15,Mr WAKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question addressed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will recall that during the election campaign he promised to make the Native Title Act more workable. I therefore ask: what action is the government taking to amend the Native Title Act to ensure that Aboriginal communities, pastoralists and miners can operate with greater certainty? Will the amendments ensure that there is greater focus on providing benefits for those directly involved rather than simply providing new avenues for lawyers to continue arguing?",15
16,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is true that during the election campaign we made a number of commitments in relation to this issue. Let me remind the parliament that they were, firstly, to retain the Native Title Act; secondly, that we reserved the right to amend the Native Title Act to ensure its workability; thirdly, that we promised to respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act; and, finally, that we would ensure that any amendments to the Native Title Act were preceded by wide consultation. I am happy to inform the House that the further amendments to the Native Title Act, which were approved by the government parties this morning, comply in full with those four commitments. These amendments are the result of very extensive consultation. We remain committed to retaining the Native Title Act, but we want to make it more workable for the benefit of all people affected by it, and we will do this in a manner that completely respects the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. We have, as I am sure all members interested in this subject know, undertaken very extensive consultation with all of the groups that are concerned and involved. We want to achieve a fair balance between the legitimate interests of government and industry and also the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. A number of proposals included in the amending bill introduced into this House at the end of the last sitting occurred after extensive consultation with a wide variety of interest groups. Further extensive consultations have been undertaken since that is time on the contents of the bill in the three major areas that were not covered: firstly, the right to negotiate; secondly, the role of representative bodies; and, thirdly, the recognition of agreements with native title holders about mining and other development activity. In relation to the right to negotiate, that process will be streamlined in the new amendments to ensure that it is only necessary for a mining project to go through the process once and that negotiations with native title holders for that purpose focus on the actual impact of the mine on their native title. To prevent a repeat of the Century situation, the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs will be able to ensure that a project of major economic benefit to Australia can proceed if it appears that that benefit will be lost if a decision is not made urgently. The registration test is being revised to prevent a repetition of the situation where multiple claims are made over the same area and registered without satisfying any real test as to the likelihood of establishing the existence of native title. Tightening up of the mediation provisions will address the practical problems which arise when a claim is made over a large area, such as the case in the Yorta Yorta claim in the Murray region, which is now under way in the Federal Court with its 400 respondents. There are also important amendments relating to representative bodies and voluntary agreements. The details of the amendments will be available in the form of an exposure draft. I believe these amendments will contribute significantly to a more positive and cooperative approach in the area of native title. The parliamentary secretary, Senator Minchin, who has assisted me in these matters, will be releasing a detailed statement and the details of the exposure draft this afternoon. Aboriginal Children: Separation from Parents",15
17,Mr MEL HAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister endorse the statement by his Minister for Aooriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on the separation of Aboriginal children from their parents when he said, 'What we must recognise is that a lot of people have benefited by that'? Further, does the Prime Minister endorse the statement by the member for O'Connor when he said, 'Many were no worse off socially than those white children who went to boarding schoo)'? Will the Prime Minister outline to the House his government's position on the separation of Aboriginal children from their parents?",16
18,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I welcome opportunity which the member for Banks has given me to say something about this. I start by telling him that the government does not in any way endorse the separation practices of earlier generations in relation to Aboriginal people and at no stage, according to my understanding of what he said, has Senator Herron ever said so. Mr Latham-Oh! He did not endorse it?",16
19,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He asked me quite a serious question and I take him seriously because he treats his job a little more seriously than some of his colleagues on the front bench. According to my understanding, Senator Herron never said that. In fact, in the interview which was the basis of the story in the Australian he described the practice as horrific. Yet in all the reporting that has gone on since, in all the comments that have been made about him and in all the criticism that has been levied against him, there has been no attempt to acknowledge the fact that the comment he made in relation to his understanding of what particular individuals had said to him was against the background of having regarded the practice as horrific. If we are interested in accurate debate on this issue, if we are interested in a fair assessment of what people say and what they contribute to the debate, I think that ought to have been acknow ledged. Can I take the opportunity of saying of Senator Herron that he is a person for whom I have an immense personal regard. He has my complete confidence. I think the contribution that Senator Herron has made to the relief of suffering of less fortunate people in this world far exceeds that of most people on both sides of this House. I really think there should be a rather more careful examination of what the man really said before people hop into him in wild, misguided situations. In relation to the inquiry which was established by the former government, it is true that, as the press reports, I wrote to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory in July, saying that the government had reservations about the practical benefit of the inquiry. That was not the first time. I had given voice to that discussion. In fact, in a the meeting between myself and Mr Michael Dodson, the Social Justice Commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission which was held on 22 April this year---{)nly about seven weeks after the government had been sworn in-he raised the question of the inquiry into the separation of Aboriginal children. I will read from the record of the meeting which was compiled not by a member of my staff but by the deputy secretary of my department. It reads: The chairman had written to the Prime Minister about terms of reference and tinancial difficulties. The Prime Minister said he could not give any commitment on funding and there was a ques-ion in his mind over the long-term value and practical contribution of the inquiry. He stood ready to meet Mr Wilson and Commissioner Dodson before a final decision was made on future funding. He was not unsympathet.ic, but the coalition did not have the same attItude to the issue as the former government. Commissioner Dodson spoke of the circumstances of those affected, the importance of this iss,!e and t-e injustices encountered to understandmg. today s problems for the indigenous comm-ll1ty.. The Prime Minister said he understood the mtensity of feeling, but even people of goodwill may for- the judgment that there was not a lot to be. gamed from an expensive inquiry on long past polIcy. I think those practices, by the standards of today, whatever your politics are, would be quite unacceptable. I have absolutely no doubt that they caused immense trauma and immense unhappiness to the people concerned. I have, equally, no doubt that it is always a difficult exercise in our kind of society to impose the standards and attitudes of today on the conduct of yesterday. I think it is also fair to say, although it is probably, the current climate of debate on these issues, difficult to do without being jumped on, that some of the people who were involved in the maintenance of those practices genuinely at the time believed that what they were doing was right. I think that must be borne in mind. The view that the government takes is that the additional resources that might otherwise be devoted to this inquiry, additional to those that were devoted under the decisions of the former government, would be better employed in contributing towards improving health, education, housing and employment opportunities of Aboriginal people. That is a legitimate point of view. It is not an insensitive point of view. I have a completely sensitive understanding of the feelings of the Aboriginal community on this. But I do not apologise for the fact that we have a different policy on this issue from that of the former government. One of the things that ought to be understood about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs is that the policy of the former government and the policy of t-e new government are different. The comrrutment of the new government to the welfare of Aboriginal people is not less than the commitment of the former government, but our way of achieving that commitment is different. We do not make any apology for that, and we never will. With regard to this idea that some group of politicians in Australia, namely, those who belong to the Australian Labor Party,. have a monopoly on concern and compaSSIOn, do you know what makes the Australian people angry about Aboriginal affairs? The fact that for 13 years you spent hundreds of millions of dollars and the condition of the indigenous people appears no better. That is what makes people all around this country very unhappy. I just have to say again to the member for Banks, and I say again to the Leader of the Opposition, when it comes to concern about the welfare of disadvantaged Australiansand I have said this repeatedly-of all identifiable groups in the Australian community none are more disadvantaged than the Aboriginal people. That is why in this budget there is provision in relation to in health and housing and all those other things. We are not going to cop a situation that, just because we do things differently, every time we announce a change in policy that gives a rhetorical licence to those o- the other side of this parliament and others III the community to brand us as insensitive or racist. The days of that kind of smearing are over. That was the significance of what I had to say to the Queensland division of the Liberal Party. We are simply not going to cop any more of this phoney moral outrage from the Australian Labor Party.",16
20,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, pursuant to standing order 321, I require the Pri-e Minister to table the document from WhICh he was quoting.",17
21,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Could I just have a look to see if it is confidential?,17
22,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,17
23,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my left!,17
24,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a confidential document, but I would be very happy to show it to the member for Banks after question time.",17
25,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is not prepared to table that document but will see you outside the chamber-with your coat on. Nobel Prize for Medicine,18
26,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware that an Australian scientist Professor Peter Doherty has been announced the joint winner of the Nobel Prize for medicine for research done at the Australian National University here in Canberra? What does this achievement say about the quality of biomedical research in Australia? Can the minister assure the House of the government's strong commitment to supporting our national medical research effort?,18
27,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I am sure all members of the House will join with me in congratulating Professor Doherty who becomes the third Australian citizen to win the Nobel Prize for medicine and the fourth Australian born. He joins Howard Florey, John Eccles and Frank Macfarlane Burnet. Professor Doherty staIted his career in veterinary science with the Queensland government. He went overseas and did his doctorate and did his early research in the sheep disease scrapie. Dr Rolf Zinkernagel is a Swiss scientist who came to the ANU to do post-doctoral studies with Professor Doherty. Together they were looking at propelties of cells in the body and the response of the immune system. What they discovered was that when a virus infects a cell of the body a protein on the surface of that cell changes and that leads to the development of the body's response to the foreign virus. This formed the basis of a number of vaccines that are in use today. It is interesting to think that this seminal piece of research was published in the Lancet in 1975 when Peter Doherty was 34 and Rolf Zinkernagel was only 31. Professor Doherty left Australia in the late 1970s and came back between 1982 and 1988. Then he went overseas to further his studies at the University of Tennessee in Memphis. He has received a number of awards, including the Fellowship of the Royal Society of London and the Paul Ehrlich prize for medicine in Germany. The honourable member also asked about biomedical research in Australia. I think that this, our fourth Nobel Prize, shows how incredibly strong we are in biomedical research as a country and how this is something that has lasted over a long period. I am pleased to tell the honourable member that funds for the National Health and Medical Research Council were not cut in any way. We did not even seek to take an efficiency dividend from them. In fact, the amount of money we will be providing in this and other years is increased over and above the forward estimates. I am also pleased to tell the honourable member that when I was in London a couple of weeks ago I had discussions with the Wellcome Trust. I believe we have agreement whereby we will be able to access funds from the Wellcome Trust that will further increase Australia's research and development effort. Small Business",18
28,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs aware that the department of industry now requires industry impact statements from potential suppliers for contracts worth $5 million instead of the previous threshold of $10 million? Given that all Commonwealth agencies are required to make at least 10 per cent of their purchases from small businesses, how does this requirement reflect the coalition's pre-election promise to reduce by 50 per cent the compliance and paperwork burden imposed on small business?  member for Moore for his question. Firstly, the government has a commitment to reduce the red tape and compliance burden on small business by 50 per cent. I will be presenting to the Prime Minister the deregulation task force report in that area. Mr Latham-When?  shut you up, Simon, didn't it! We have had several hundred responses to the consultations we have had nationwide and, I might add, very good support from small business-both individuals and organisations. In regard to government policy requiring 10 per cent of government purchases to go to small business, we are committed to ensuring that that is happening. The task force report that will be handed to the Prime Minister also addresses the burdens that are in place in that regard and the attitudinal changes required to ensure that government purchasing officers give a major commitment to purchases towards small business. Families: Taxation",18
29,Mrs ELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of an independent analysis that has undertaken since the budget of the government's family tax initiative? What does the analysis reveal about the equity and progressive nature of the government's measure to assist families with children?,19
30,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM) based at the University of Canberra released a study on Friday called 'An examination of the impact of the family tax initiative'. The report indicates that the initiative has very favourable equity and social justice impacts. For example, the report indicates that almost 71 per cent of all eligible families will benefit from the implementation of the initiative, with the greatest average percentage increase in disposable incomes going to families with lower incomes. Mr Martin Ferguson-Tell us about jobs.",19
31,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member Batman.,19
32,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Over half the total cost of the proposal will be spent on families with taxable incomes below $38,700. This is a specifically targeted measure to benefit low and middle income families. The report highlights the significance of benefits being provided to single and sole parent families. Overall, single income couple families and sole parents will receive greater average percentage changes in their disposable incomes than dual income families. Single income couples with children the will have an average increase of $10.50 per week, while dual income families will gain on average $5.30 per week, and sole parents will gain $8.30 per week. Mr Martin Ferguson-Is this something that you have leaked to the 'Fin' Review too?",19
33,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Batman.,19
34,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me make it entirely clear that the family tax initiative was an initiative of this government which was focused on low and middle income earners. The reason why it was done as an increase in the tax free threshold was that it distributes the benefits to those at the lower been end of the income scale first. With the amounts that they get from the change in the tax free threshold, they get an equal benefit to people who are at the upper end of the income scale. It is clear that this government has a commitment to families. It is clear that this government's family tax initiative will benefit low and middle income families the greatest. That is why it has been designed in the way that it has. Treasurer: Visit to the United States of America",19
35,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Did the Treasurer say in New York last week that in his original briefing on his discussion with Dr Greenspan he had not been reporting Dr Greenspan's views or giving 'any special information' about them but rather reporting his own 'assessment of indicators', his own for 'assessment of what the situation is'? How does he begin to reconcile that with the tape of that original briefing in which he says of Dr Greenspan: He indicated to me that he saw no threats to inflation down the track.... So heDr Greenspanindicated to me that there was no reason to ex pect a change on the current scene, as he sees it ... He's very optimistic. How do you begin to reconcile those propositions?",19
36,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let me clear,20
37,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,20
38,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,20
39,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not possessed of any special knowledge on what will happen to monetary policy in the United States. Nobody who knows how these things operate would think to the contrary. It should be entirely clear that comments that I make should not be understood as relying on special knowledge .. I might s-y that, w-en this matter was dIscussed wIth AustralIan journalists, only one Australian journalist thought it was significant enough to report, because they did not think it was a story, in any event, either. Can I make it entirely clear that obviously comments on these matters are viewed sensitively; obviously, interpretations can be put on them; obviously, they are open to various constructions; obviously, levels of meaning can be ascribed to them. That being the case, I accept the criticism that one should not comment on those conditions, and I certainly will not be doing that further. Drugs: Fantasy",20
40,Mrs SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of the fact that 10 young people were recently hospitalised in Queensland, apparently after taking a drug popularly known as Fantasy? Can the minister inform the House of any action being taken by the government to respond to this situation?",20
41,Dr WOODRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am honourable members will understand that details are still emerging about what happened in Queensland last weekend. I do not want to say anything that in any way may affect the apprehension of those people responsible. That said, I can say a few things. I understand the substance known as Fantasy, which caused the illness at the nightclub in Queensland, probably contained a substance called sodium oxybate. It is called sodium gamma hydroxybutyrate. Sodium oxybate is an anaesthetic agent that make it is available and used in Germany and France. It is not a registered therapeutic good and no approvals for its registration have been sought or given. For this reason, importation of sodium oxybate into Australia for supply to others is an offence under the Therapeutic Goods Act. I understand the chief health officers of Australia are going to be meeting on 14 and 15 October. They have jurisdictional responsibility for action regardin- sodiuhydroxybutyrate. They will be looklllg at thIS as a matter of urgency, and I certainly endorse this response. This morning I received a letter from the Queensland health minister, Mike Horan. He talked of the threat that he sees from Fantasy in his state, particularly given that the end of school is coming up. I will be replying to him and I will be telling him that the Commonwealth will cooperate with his government in any way that is possible I am aware that the Queensland health minister has made comments about the importation of sodium oxybate, but as a go-d that is not registered under the TherapeutIc Goods Act its importation is effectively prohibited now. But I am prepared to look at supplementary options, including is prescription only use in Australia. I am sure all honourable members are concerned about the popularity of these party druos and what little is known about them am;ngst young people and how what is happening on the Gold Coast may refl-ct what is happening in other parts of AustralIa. As with all drugs that are the subject of abuse, it is important to try to balance supply sure side measures with measures that will minimise harm and measures on the demand side as well. The availability of gamma hydroxybutyrate, or Fantasy, by my. department is being considered a matter of urgency by the TGA. We also have an education strategy under way, called the 'dance party project'. That .is targeting particularly young people III nightclub venues. It was looking at Ecstasy, not Fantasy, and it is planned to be released later this year. I have asked my department to change this project so that it can include information on a variety of other drugs, such as Fantasy. The medium term measure that we can look at is putting in place a collaborative approach to ensure that this sort of entertainment, which is going to continue, is at least legitimate and undertaken safely. To this end, protocols are going to be considered at the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy in March next year. Treasurer: Visit to the United States of",20
42,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again directed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen, along with many similar reported comments from money market figures in New York, a statement from the chief economist of Standard and Poor's, Mr David Blitzer, that he was unaware of any similar comments by a finance minister on private discussions with a federal reserve chairman-'It is not the thing to do if he wants his telephone calls returned' and 'There would be a huge storm if the US Treasury Secretary had done the same thing'? How can the Treasurer claim in these circumstances that neither his own nor Australia's international reputation or credibility with decision makers has been unaffected by last week's debacle?",21
43,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I made entirely clear, I take as a valid point that any comment on these sorts of matters can be misinterpreted. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition invites me to comment on these matters and to keep matters going and indeed criticises us for commenting. We see his little trap and we do not intend to fall for it. HumeLake",21
44,Mr LIEBERMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question IS addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I refer to yesterday's announcement by the Murray Darling Basin Commission that there has been a shift of five millimetres in the wall in Lake Hume and that the commission needs to drain about 900,000 megalitres from the lake to relieve pressure on the wall. Can the minister inform the House about action being taken to ensure that the dam is repaired urgently? Will the minister ensure that people affected by prolonged flooding, due to the major release of water, will be contacted to see what can be done to assist them to cope with the prolonged inundation?",21
45,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Indi for his question. I understand that it is very important to him and the people in his electorate as well as very important to the people in the Deputy Prime Minister's electorate of Farrer. The Murray is currently experiencing high water levels as a result of America recent rains and some moderate downstream flooding has occurred. It should be noted that those current water levels have been reached or exceeded during 10 of the last 30 yearsmost recently just four years ago. The Murray Darling Basin Commission has advised that the additional releases from the dam will not result in increased flows of water above the current level, but that the duration of the flooding which will exist will be extended for some period of time. I am assured-and I know this is of real concern to the members involved and people who live in that area-that the shift which has occurred in the dam wall is not the result of the recent high water levels. In fact, a program of investigations and remedial works at Hume Dam has been under way for a number of years. We did announce in the recent federal budget that we would be providing $5.9 million over the next three years for the necessary works to be undertaken. The cost of construction of the Hume Dam was, in the first place, contributed to by New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia as well as by the Commonwealth. Under present alTangements, the New South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation maintains the structure pursuant to an agreement with Victoria and the storage in accordance with directions from the Murray Darling Basin Commission. It is a split responsibility. Recent work carried out on the dam has revealed movement of some five millimetres in the core wall at the junction of the concrete spillway and the main embankment. Following an engineering report by the New South Wales constructing authority, it was felt that the work should begin without delay and that the water level should be reduced by two metres in the next two weeks and by a further three metres by the end of the year. That would substantially increase the safety margin from the cun·ent IS per cent to around 35 per cent. Fifty per cent is regarded as the normal accepted benchmark for dams in general. I am assured by the commission that there is no immediate cause for concern. They are taking the precautions of lowering the water and bringing forward the remedial works to ensure that the dam meets contemporary safety standards. I am advised that a detailed community information program is currently being developed. Treasurer: Visit to the United States of America",21
46,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Why did the Prime Minister say nothing to defend his Treasurer last week after he was caught out breaching a confidence and then making misleading statements about what he had done? Can he confirm that one government adviser was reported as stating, 'It was because the case against the Treasurer was unanswerable?' In particular, can he confirm the accuracy of this reported minder's statement-the reported minder was allegedly from his office-that 'the lights came on and their trousers were around their ankles?' Do you consider, Prime Minister, the case against the Treasurer is unanswerable?",22
47,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,May I make a couple of comments. I had a few days leave last week and I was not making comments on anything. Can I just say a couple of other things. The Treasurer has my total confidence. The Treasurer did an absolutelyOpposition members inteljecting,22
48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my left!,22
49,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You can bay as much as you like, but you know and I know you know that he did a very good job with the budget. He did a very good job with the budget and you know that to your cost. I do not think I have anything to add to what the Treasurer has already said. He retains my complete confidence. Budget Strategy",22
50,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen reports that the budget could have reached underlying balance within the life of this parliament by cuts of no more than $1 billion this year and a further $1 billion in each of the next two years? What would be the impact of such a budget strategy on average Australians?,22
51,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me make it entirely clear that I have seen such comments. We saw the member for Holt writing in the Australian newspaper that the Labor Party actually supports balancing a $10 billion deficit. The way they would do it is by taking $1 billion off expenditure over the next three years. If you took $1 billion off expenditure over the next three years, you would find the situation where, in order to balance, you would need an additional $3.4 billion in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Where would that $3.4 billion come from if it were not coming from expenditure reductions? It would come from new taxes. Let me give the House some idea of some of the new taxes that would be required under Labor to achieve a balanced budget. To get $3.4 billion, you would have to increase personal tax rates on low income earners from 20 per cent to 23 per cent, a three percentage point increase, or a 15 per cent increase in the marginal rate. To get $3.4 billion, you would have to increase the sales tax by five percentage points: the 12 per cent rate to 17 per cent; the 22 per cent rate to 27 per cent; and the 32 per cent rate to 37 per cent. Or to get $3.4 billion you would have to increase petroleum products excise rate by 20c per litre. This is an opposition that is going to balance the budget without expenditure reductions. They have three alternatives: an increase in the marginal tax rate to 23 per cent; an increase in sales tax by five percentage points; or an increase in petroleum excise by 20c per litre. This is no mere fancy. I want to make this entirely clear to the people in Lindsay, because we found that the member for Holt on 1 October 1996 went on to try to explain his economic proposals on the Neil Mitchell program. He said this: I think since we are so undertaxed by any relevant international standard there is a case for having some overall revenue increases. We know what they are: three percentage points on the marginal tax rate and five percentage points on the sales tax rate. Which one of them are you going for? Why don't you come clean to the people of Lindsay and tell them which one of these taxes you are going toMr MCGauran-He went straight to bed.",22
52,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"After that admission, as my colleague says from behind me, he went straight to bed, feeling sick that he actually let out the secret of Labor Party policy in relation to taxes. I think the people of Lindsay are very interested in the tax plans of the Labor Party. I just want to refer the House to one other item, lest it should be thought that this was just the meanderings of the shadow Treasurer.",23
53,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And you heard what the putative senator from New South Wales said?,23
54,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We had the putative senator from New South Wales, Mr Campbell. But we also had the assistant shadow Treasurer quoted on AM from the Labor Party conference. This is what he said about the Labor Party tax plans: We should be the party that recognises that if you tax family trusts in Australia they would be paying $2 billion extra. Mr Latham-I didn't say that.",23
55,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You did, I am afraid. You said it on AM . Mr Latham-At the full rate.",23
56,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You went on: If you wiped out primary industry concessions that attract the Pitt Street farmers, if you wiped out all other instances of business welfare, you could be funding infrastructure. You would be funding job creation. You would be funding the cost of distance. You would be funding the active role of government. It is time to give the big end of town a bit of stick, a bit of old-fashioned Labor stick, when it comes to tax policy. We know what old-fashioned Labor stick is when it comes to tax policy, don't we? It is increased income taxes; it is increased sales taxes; it is increased petroleum excises. That is what the Labor Party stick to the big end of town is. What confusion we now see in relation to tax policy, because the assistant shadow Treasurer wants to give stick to the big end of town whilst the member for Hotham wants to bring back tax shelters for high income earners in the form of R&D tax syndicates. He wants to bring back concessions.",23
57,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the point of order goes to relevance. This fellow takes a feather duster to the big end of town on tax avoidance and he knocks off the dental program. He is in here proud of it.",23
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,23
59,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have the member for Werriwa who wants to give the Labor stick to the big end of town and we have the member for Hotham who wants to give the Labor benefits to the big end of town. He personally wants to bring back R&D syndicates to make it optional for high income earners to pay tax. That is what he wants to do. He has made it entirely clear that he is going to oppose the removal of R&D tax syndicates whilst, at the same time, the member for Werriwa is going to get the Labor stick out to the big end of town. The Labor stick for the big end of town was R&D tax syndicates. That is what it was. The Labor stick for the big end of town was improved concessions on employer deductible superannuation. The Labor stick for the big end of town was not any increase in the Medicare surcharge for high income earners. This was the side of the House that had the policy response to deal with this. This was the side of the House that had the courage to engage in it. That is the side of the House that has secret, undisclosed tax plans, which they will not be letting out until that by-election in Lindsay is over. Treasurer: Visit to the United States of America",23
60,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is again to the Treasurer whose exuberance is a little premature.,24
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Just get on with the question.,24
62,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Has he written to Dr Greenspan apologising for his appalling indiscretion in revealing publicly details of highly sensitive views that Dr Greenspan put to him? If he has not apologised, doesn't that compound even further his original felony? If he has apologised, doesn't that make a nonsense of his continued public denials that he has done anything wrong?",24
63,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have indicated in my first answer that I will not be speculating on these matters and giving rise to any further stories. But I do want to make one observation. Mr Lee-I rise on a point of order. The question was specifically not about specula tion but about whether the minister would issue an apology.,24
64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure the Treasurer is aware of the nub of the question, and is in the process of answering it.",24
65,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But all of this episode has not been without its upsides, because it did get the member for Holt out of his sickbed. School Leavers",24
66,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Given the difficulties young people in my electorate are facing gaining a real job following the failure of the economic policies of the previous government, can the Minister outline what action this government is taking to assist school leavers in finding employment?",24
67,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Page for his question. I know that he is very concerned about the difficulties that young people in his electorate have found in getting jobs over the last few years. No group in the Australian community was more seriously disadvantaged by the failures of the previous government in economic management than school leavers. The fact is that Labor essentially deserted school leavers. The 65 per cent of young people who were not going on to university or full-time study in TAFE had very few options before them apart from the dole. When the former government introduced the Working Nation program and told young people that they were going to get jobs, there was absolutely no shift in teenage unemployment over the whole period of Working Nation-from its introduction until the election. Youth unemployment had skyrocketed up to 32 per cent during the recession caused by the previous government. The apprenticeship scheme was left to wither on the vine. The number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships was at the lowest level for three decades. This government is putting into place policies which will create real job opportunities for these young people by keeping taxes down, by getting small business moving, by bringing the budget back into a responsible balance. We are reviving and putting new life into the apprenticeship system. We are bringing small businesses in the local communities and schools close together for the first time in a century. We are bridging the gap between communities and schools in a way that the previous government was never able and never prepared to do. is Last week I announced the first school based traineeships under the government's apprenticeship reforms. Under these school based traineeships, students will be able to combine their secondary school certificate with a nationally recognised qualification in office administration, leading to careers in management, marketing, sales and full-time accounting. New school based apprenticeships are on the way, and they will be here as soon as the opposition passes the workplace relations legislation in the Senate. Young people will be able to have the opportunities that are presently being denied to them by the Labor Party, fully in accordance with this long tradition. Last week I also announced details of the jobs pathway program, for which the government has allocated in the budget some $5.9 million in funding over the next two years. We will be contracting with job brokers to help secure employment and make the connections between students doing vocational education courses in schools and local employers. In the recent budget, the government set aside $187 million to expand vocational education in schools. We have entered into an historic alliance with the secondary school principals of Australia. We will be working on a working party with secondary principals right around Australia to make sure that these opportunities which the previous government failed to deliver will be delivered to the 30 per cent of young people who are leaving school before year 12. Australia's young people hold the key to the future of this country, and this government is going to make sure that school Ie avers have a clear and solid pathway into employment and quality training which they were denied by the previous government. Treasurer: Visit to the United States of America",24
68,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Will he exercise leadership now on the Greenspan matter, if nowhere else? In the interests of salvaging at least some of Australia's reputation from the wreckage of last week, will he now direct the Treasurer to write a letter of apology to Dr Greenspan?",25
69,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I just say that I think the Treasurer dealt with the matter adequately, and I have nothing to add. Motion of Censure",25

78,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Move the motion. Mr Gareth Evans-Are you giving me leave to move the motion now? Mr Lee-So you're saying no now, are you?",25
79,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Deputy Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith that this House censures the Treasurer for the embarrassment he caused Dr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, United States of America. by disclosing the contents of a confidential conversation on a highly sensitive matter; for the damage he has caused thereby to Australia's international reputation and credibility with senior decision makers; and for his subsequent persistent and deliberate attempts to mislead the public as to what he had done, in clear breach of his duty under the Prime Minister's Code of Ministerial Conduct.

80,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,I second the motion for the suspension of standing orders because we have asked questions time and time again today which the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have refused to answer. We have no recourse except to moveMotion (by Mr Tim Fischer) proposed: That the member be not further heard.,26
81,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The question is that the member no longer be heard. All those in favour say aye-the member will resume his seat-to the contrary no. Opposition members-No!,26
82,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I think the ayes have it. Opposition members-The noes have it.,26
83,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The ayes have it. The question is that the motion be agreed to. All those in favour say aye, to the contrary no. Opposition members-Aye! Government members-No!",26
84,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I think the ayes have it-the noes have it. Opposition members-The ayes have it.,26
85,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,The ayes have it.,26
86,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The noes have it. Are there any further questions? Mr MCMullan- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I thought under the standing orders that when we dissented in the numbers we did, from your decision as to the outcome of the motion that you might then see whether a division is required, which it was, and then call a division. I understood that to be the standing order.",26
87,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I have made my decision. Mr Crean-You have not answered the question. Mr Lee- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I can understand there was some confusion around the table, but the Leader of the Opposition clearly stated that the ayes had it, and I also stated the same.",27
88,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The noes have it. Literacy and Vocational Training  Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training.  order: in your calling of the vote, you yourself made a mistake which, after a couple of attempts, you corrected. The Leader of the Opposition then indicated quite clearly, as did a number of opposition frontbenchers, that a division was required. Mr Speaker, given that you yourself may have unwittingly added to the confusion about whether or not a division was required, would you be prepared to consider the request for a division?",27
89,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I have made my findings and rulings appropriate. I have called the honourable member for Sturt. We will go on with the rest of question time.  Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. In view of the previous government's failure to address the problems of illiteracy and declining numbers of apprenticeships, can the minister outline to the House what reforms have occurred in policies regarding literacy and vocational education in schools since this government came to office?",27
90,Dr KEMP,PAIRS,"I thank the member for Sturt for his question. There is of course a dramatic difference between this government and the previous government in addressing some of the key educational issues facing young people. When this government came to office, the first consultation we held with major business organisations indicated that illiteracy and lack of numeracy skills were the biggest single obstacles to young people getting jobs after 13 years of the previous government. I have already commented on the decline in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force, and of course hardly any progress at all was made during the period of the previous government in providing vocational education opportunities for young people in schools. I suppose in the minds of many members of the House the questions that arise are, 'Who was responsible for policy in this area? Who was responsible for the vast policy vacuum in the Labor Party?' The answer is the previous minister in that government for schools, vocational education and trainingnone other than the previous member for Lindsay, the Hon. Ross Free. Ross Free gave new meaning to the notion of transparency in policy. He was totally invisible; the invisible minister.",27
91,Unknown,PAIRS,Opposition members interjecting,27
92,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The minister will resume his seat. There is too much noise from my left. Question time will continue when you settle down.,27
93,Dr KEMP,PAIRS,"Just let me detail some elements of this policy vacuum represented by the former Labor member for Lindsay. As the apprenticeship opportunities for young Australians declined, he uttered the word 'apprenticeship' only 10 times in this House in three years-that is three times a year. The parliament was fortunate if he managed to address literacy in this House three or four times a year, if he cared to do so, and he addressed the issue of numeracy on only four occasions in this House over the whole three years. Civics education and vocational education rated barely a mention. The fact is that this former minister turned invisibility and policy lassitude into an art form. It is no wonder that on 2 March the voters in Lindsay decided that he should disappear. When you tried to turn up the contrast to see him, you realised it was already on high. Mr Tanner-Why don't you doorknock?",27
94,Mr KERR,PAIRS,When the full moon is out.,28
95,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member for Melbourne! The honourable member for Denison.,28
96,Dr KEMP,PAIRS,"By contrast, this government has already got the agreement of all the states and territories to a national goal in literacy. We are going to establish national literacy benchmarks for years 3 and 5. We have the unanimous agreement of the states to a national literacy survey. We apprenticeship reforms which in the area of office administration alone",28
97,Mr KERR,PAIRS,They will not answer the door to you.,28
98,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I warn the member for Denison.,28
99,Dr KEMP,PAIRS,"Which I launched last week, will produce some 10,000 traineeships. Jackie Kelly, who lost her seat for Lindsay and is now standing in the by-election, has been strongly committed to this educational agenda. She has been strongly committed to this and she has been active in this parliament in pursuing it. That is a contrast with the invis ible former minister who is standing against her; the bad sport who cannot accept the decision of the people in Lindsay. I have no doubt whatever that the voters for Lindsay will require an active member on their behalf in the by-election on 19 October. Treasurer: Visit to the United States of",28
100,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"My question addressed to the Prime Minister. Do you recall that your guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility, which you issued publicly in April 1996, says at page 10, 'Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the parliament or the public'? Did you also see the editorial in the Australian Financial Review, after your Treasurer's shenanigans in Washington, stating, 'The real problem remains the impression Mr Costello gave by denying the integrity of the initial report. If it is important for him to keep faith with Dr Greenspan, it is even more imperative that he keep faith with the voters who elevated him to a position of trust'? What action have you taken with regard to your Treasurer to ensure that he upholds his ministerial guidelines?",28
101,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,The Leader of the Opposition asks me what action have I taken in relation to the Treasurer. I have listened to what the Treasurer has had to say today. I think he has covered the matter more than adequately.,28
102,Unknown,PAIRS,Opposition members interjecting,28
103,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The Prime have Minister will resume his seat. This House is unnecessarily unruly. You are asking important, serious questions and you are getting a decent, sensible response.",28
104,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,Can I simply add that the only take-out of question time today about the Treasurer has been your hopeless tactics. France,28
105,Mr MUTCH,PAIRS,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What is the state of Australia's relationship with France following the minister's recent visit? Can the minister explain the importance of this bilateral relationship to Australia?,28
106,Mr DOWNER,PAIRS,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I made an official visit to France on 16 September and had discussions with the French Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, Herve de Charette, and the ministers for overseas affairs and cooperation. I also spoke with America French and Australian business leaders while I was in Paris. is The key objectives of my visit were to give effect to the government's commitment to giving increased standing to its relations with Europe and keep bilateral partners in particular; to deliver a positive, forwardlooking message on our bilateral relationship; and to reiterate the government's positive attitude towards France in the Pacific and our wish to work cooperatively with France in the region. These messages were, I believe, well received and appreciated by ministers and business leaders alike. I am pleased to report that our bilateral relationship with France has moved on to a new and positive footing. Mr Giffin-Did they laugh at your jokes?",28
107,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The member for Bruce.,29
108,Mr DOWNER,PAIRS,"As Prime Minister Juppe said, 'We have a new basis for a new relationship between Australia and France.' Mr Tanner-Did they laugh at your jokes?",29
109,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I warn the member for Melbourne.,29
110,Mr DOWNER,PAIRS,"The time is indeed right to move forward in our relationship with France. Importantly, Foreign Minister de Charette and Prime Minister J uppe agreed that our relationship had great potential for growth and progress. Foreign Minister de Charette noted that my visit 'allows us to tum the page and write new ones'. I can only agree with those sentiments. There are positive foundations to build on. Our trade relationship is a good one, as is our investment relationship. We have a long history of cooperation in international affairs. The most recent example of that was the cooperation between Australia and France to bring about a comprehensive test ban treaty, which was open for signature in New York on 24 September. We do have very extensive people to people contacts with France. While I was in Paris, I took the opportunity of raising with the French government the establishment of visa-free travel for Australians in France. I know the requirement to obtain a visa to visit France is a significant irritant for Australians who want to go to that country, be it for business or pleasure, and many of course do. The French government, in light of the introduction of our electronic travel authority, is giving consideration now to providing visa-free travel for Australians into France. I very much hope that that will take place. The final point I would like to make is that Australia and France do have mutual interests in our own respective regions. France is a welcome and valued partner of Australia in the Pacific, and I think there is further scope for cooperation. I also welcome France's growing interests in the economies of the Asia-Pacific and the fact that many French companies are now using Australia as a base for their Asia-Pacific operations. Given that France is a significant member of the European Union, our work with France in that context too is of great use to us and I think is of value to our bilateral relationship. So, Mr Speaker, after what you might call the down period of our relationship with France following French nuclear testing last year, that relationship is now on a very positive and a very sure footing. I think it is a relationship that will be developed to France's and Australia's advantage. We do have very extensive people to people contacts with France.

111,Mr GARETH EVANS,PAIRS,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Does he recall stating to Michael Glason on ABC TV last week, in defending his original briefing, 'What you should understand is that I am not making comments about US interest rates'? Treasurer, how does that statement of yours sit with the taped statement you made just the day before when you said in answer to a specific comment about US interest rates, 'I don't think there is any expectation at the moment that rates are going to rise'? If the Treasurer was not talking about US interest rates in his original briefing to Australian journalists, what on earth was he doing? What was he talking about? Pot smoking?",30

113,Mr NEVILLE,PAIRS,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Minister, at a recent ministerial council meeting, consumer affairs ministers discussed the issue of banning non-child resistant cigarette lighters. In view of horrific household fires and in the general interests of young children, what action, if any, do you propose to take to address the safety risk to small children posed by these disposable cigarette lighters? Further, have you read media reports claiming that the ban on nonchild resistant cigarette lighters would lead to the greater use of matches, which allegedly are more dangerous? Do you agree with this assessment? Government members-MCGinty's out.",30

Since 1988 there have been 42 recorded cases of injury to children under the age of five linked to the misuse of disposable cigarette lighters. Last year alone two young boys died in Victoria in a house fire caused by the misuse of cigarette lighters. Earlier this year I was surprised to discover that no national safety standards apply to disposable cigarette lighters. The United States introduced mandatory child resistant safety standards some two years ago in regard to this product. At the ministerial council meeting in Darwin on 27 September, mInisters responsible for consumer affairs agreed with me that current arrangements are inadequate. A draft statement in regard to the products will be released for comment later this year. Also, as the minister responsible for Customs, I can inform the House that the importation of such non-child resistant lighters will be prohibited from 1 March next year. Ministers agreed that, in addition to that, the sale and supply of non-child resistant lighters will be banned from 1 July 1997. I am aware of the claims that one importer has made that a ban on the sale of non-child resistant lighters will lead to greater use of matches. I reject that argument. In fact, that argument is not supported by the facts. I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. The danger that disposable cigarette lighters currently pose to small children is of concern, and the government has acted on that matter.",30
117,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, that being the 20th question, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Answers to Questions on Notice",31
118,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, pursuant to standing order 150, I ask that you write to the following ministers and ascertain reasons for delays in answering questions. The first is to the Treasurer about questions 191 and 193 asked on 20 May. The second minister I ask you to write to is the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism about questions 262 to 266 inclusive asked on 23 May.",31
119,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I shall so write. Member for Watson,31
120,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"On the last sitting day of this House, 19 September, which was I note a day of constant disruption to proceedings, the honourable member for Watson spoke from the dispatch box rather than his assigned place to call a division. I understand that the member for Watson, in addition to holding the position of Chief Opposition Whip, is Deputy Manager of Opposition Business in the House. I also understand that, when the member for Watson is acting as Manager of Opposition Business in the House-that is, when the leader is absent from the House-it is in order for the member for Watson to speak from the dispatch box. However, on the date of the incident in question, the member for Hotham was in the House and assumingly exercising his control over the opposition. Mr Speaker, I seek your ruling as to whether or not the member for Watson is in order speaking from the dispatch box when in fact his senior colleague was in the House.",31
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"As the honourable member would be aware, I was not here on the said date. I will review the incident but remind the member for Watson that, in the absence of the Manager of Opposition Business in the House, we always extend to him the courtesy of addressing the chamber from the dispatch box when it pertains to opposition business. In the normal course of events when he is addressing the chamber as the member for Watson, he will do it from his place. Member for Watson Mr LEO MCLEA Y- Mr Speaker, you might recall that, when this matter was raised with you by me originally, it was put to you that because of my position as Deputy Manager of Opposition Business you were agreeable to me addressing the chamber from the dispatch box in that capacity. If the point of view that the member for La Trobe is putting to you is not a nonsense, it would mean that at any time the member for Gippsland wished to address the House as the Deputy Leader of the House when the leader was sitting in the House or anywhere in the vicinity of the House you would probably have to sit him down. I suggest that the proposition put forward by the member for La Trobe is a nonsense. Indeed, when the member for Gippsland addresses the House in his position as Deputy Leader of the House, it is just as reasonable that I should be allowed to address the House in my position as Deputy Manager of Opposition Business. The deputy in any of these areas is not just in the House when his leader is. On that nonsensical proposition of the member for La Trobe, the Deputy Prime Minister would not be able to come in here at question time and claim that title at any time.",31
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Order! Nonsense seems to be spreading across the board. I will revisit the matter and declare a policy on it tomorrow. Member for Watson,32
123,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I will be very brief, Mr Speaker. It is my view that the member for Watson ought to make any contribution that he has to the House from his seat like any other member. A member of the front bench is entitled to the dispatch box. Until the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor caucus think that the member for Watson ought to be so elevated, he ought to stay in his place.",32
124,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,The debate on the issue has ceased. Divisions,32
125,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I want to ask you a question relating to your decision not to call a division earlier in response to my point of order at that time. I understand that the standing orders do not allow that matter to be challenged now, and I am not therefore seeking to do so. But I am asking you to review it in the light of standing order 168 and House of Representatives Practice on page 306, neither of which in my view confer on you the discretion to act as you did or to make the decision that you did. I ask you to review that and to report to the House accordingly against that standing order.",32
126,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I take that in the spirit with which the member raises the question. There was a great deal of boisterous noise at the conclusion of the division. Inadvertently, I contributed to the confusion by miscalling the results of the division. That I regret. The business now has moved on, and I will not revisit it. NA",32

131,Mr TUCKEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"During question time the member for Banks (Mr Melham) part read a press release I issued regarding the historic fact of the forced separation of Aboriginal families.

133,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"For the orderly management of the House I should advise the House that I said to the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean), in accordance with our undertaking given, that we will take the censure motion today, but there is first the ministerial statement which we propose to now deal with. The opposition will have their opportunity to speak to that. After that, we will have the censure motion and that will be in lieu of the MPI, which is how it should have been treated in the first place.",32
134,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS," Mr Speaker, this is completely unacceptable. You are supposed to be trying to improve standards in this place. You got up in question time and said, 'We'll take this at the end of question time.' That is the point. Those were your words. It is the normal course of events to take a censure motion immediately upon it being moved. Having decided that you would not take it immediately upon it being moved and to take it at the end of question time, there is precedence for that. For simply pushing it further and further back in the afternoon, there is no precedence. If this is persisted with, it will be the first time that a censure motion taken during question time and accepted has been pushed beyond the end of question time to some other time in the afternoon. That is unprecedented. It is a step away from the way in which governments have normally considered themselves accountable. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) has humiliated this nation overseas. Mr Costello-Who asked you to make a speech?",32
135,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"This is on indulgence, thank you very much, and I got it. The Treasurer has humiliated this nation overseas. He has been a source of derision and commentary in every editorial in every paper in this country. He has beenMr Costello-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. What the Leader of the Opposition is trying to do now is move his censure motion. He is standing at the dispatch box not on any procedural motion but slinging absolutely indefensible propositions across here. These are the propositions he can put in his censure, propositions which will be thoroughly demolished, but he cannot stand at the dispatch box on a matter of indulgence and have a censure under these circumstances.",33
136,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS,I thank the Treasurer. The indulgence is tenuous.,33
137,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"I am speaking on indulgence as to why we should take this thing now. You will have your opportunity to defend yourself on that censure motion. The point is that it is unprecedented to take a censure motion and push it back later in the afternoon, having given an undertaking that it will be taken immediately after question time. It is not for him to get up and defend himself on these points of order, as he tries push himself back in the afternoon so that nobody else gets to watch him when that comes around. It is a piece of self-interested pleading that will not go unnoted when we discuss this later. There are supposed to be some standards in this place, according to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and the standard would require at a minimum that this censure debate come on forthwith.",33
138,Mr HOWARD,BUSINESS,"On indulgence, I say to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) that this is really passing strange from the man who ran government business in this House for years and time and time again not only deferred censure motions but refused to take them. Time and time again you pushed them back, you put them back into the evening and you refused to take them. Your former Prime Minister, on three occasions that I can remember in his last 12 months as Prime Minister, literally ran from the parliament rather than face a censure motion. He ran from the parliament like a political coward rather than take it. The reality is that the Labor Party has had a very bad question time and no amount of catch-up is going to alter it.",33

142,Mr SHARP,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I will be tabling in parliament today the Commission of Inquiry report into the Relations between the Civil Aviation Authority and Seaview Air. This inquiry was established following the crash on 2 October 1994 of Seaview's Aero Commander VH-SVQ, with the loss of all nine lives on board. This inquiry highlights how a litany of lies and incompetence led to the deaths of nine people. This report is a damning indictment of the CAA and reveals Seaview as an unsafe organisation, a slipshod and often wilfully non-compliant organisation in which breaches of regulations and unacceptable practices were commonplace. The report found that the aircraft was significantly overloaded and that the pilot's licence was not valid. The flight in question was estimated to be overloaded by between 261 and 288 kilograms. That is the equivalent of three adult male passengers in an aircraft whose maximum capacity was nine passengers. Even on the most favourable calculation to Seaview, the extent of the overloading was estimated to be some 220 kilograms. The commission found that Seaview's pilots regularly overloaded aircraft primarily due to the subtle but unmistakable pressure exerted by Seaview's management. And where was the regulator? The safety watchdog? Despite repeated warnings, Seaview was allowed to continue to fly. On 13 January 1994, the district airworthiness manager at Coffs Harbour, Mr Bob Hoy, urged the suspension of the company's air operators certificate. On 16 April. that year he went to Canberra to see the then chief execpapers: utive of the CAA, Mr Doug Roser, to press his concerns. Yet his warnings were ignored. Mr Hoy was trying to do what he was paid to do and what the public expected of him-ensuring the safety regulations are complied with. He insisted on standards and he was right to do so. Yet he was perceived by his superiors as being out of step. He subsequently suffered persecution within the organisation. The report shows how, as in the Monarch case, the CAA had placed commercial considerations ahead of the safety of passengers. The commission found: In its efforts to please and appease industry, the management of the CAA, and certainly those who managed Mr Hoy, seemed to regard standards set by the regulations and orders as negotiable. In the face of a determined operator, such standards were sacrificed or moderated in order to neutralise a complaint. Aviation is not like any other industry. When operators break the rules and when those people entrusted by the public to keep the skies safe don't do their job properly, innocent people lose their lives. When Seaview's Aero Commander crashed into the Tasman Sea en route from Williamtown to Lord Howe Island-a flight which should never have been allowed-nine people lost their lives. Honeymooners Leeca and Anthony Atkinson were setting out on the first day of their new life together. Reg and Pam Drayton were setting out on what was for them a second honeymoon; Stephen and Carol Lake and two of their five children, Judith and Benjamin, were setting off on a family holiday. The report paints a picture of the young pilot, Paul Sheil, as also being a victim of this unsafe organisation. These are the tragic consequences of wanton operators and an incompetent and timid regulator. They are not just statistics. The report I will table today specifically looks at the appropriateness of decisions and actions of officers of the CAA and Seaview in the discharge of their responsibilities, and the effectiveness of the management and communications systems of the CAA as they related to Seaview. The commission has made a specific recommendation that papers be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions in order that consideration may be given to possible prosecutions. On legal advice, I will refrain from naming individuals about whom the commission makes specific recommendations lest it prejudices any future legal action. The commission also recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority should, having regard to the evidence before the commission and its own investigation, take disciplinary action where appropriate. The commission identified lying and covering-up by staff within the former CAA, as well as by people involved with Seaview. There could be no more fundamental criticism of the behaviour of the regulator. The integrity of those individuals in positions of responsibility is essential if the public is to have confidence in the regulator. The report also makes a number of recommendations as to how CASA should carry out its regulatory role when faced with operators who deliberately or repeatedly flout the rules, or compromise safety and appropriate levels of surveillance. The commission strongly supports the Plane Safe report recommendations on providing better information to consumers on the nature of airline operators in different sectors of the industry. The commission also makes specific recommendations in relation to: the appropriate level of delegation for the issuing of an air operators certificate, - employment selection processes for safety inspectors which emphasise and identify candidates with integrity and strength of character, - the use by one operator of another's AOC and cross hiring arrangements. The commission makes important recommendations in relation to the vital roles of the maintenance controller and chief pilot in the running of an airline. The commission reminds Airservices Australia of the need to ensure its officers monitor the progress of flights strictly in accordance with the specified procedures and that from time to time independent inspections of Air Traffic Services groups be carried out to ensure uniform high quality operations. It is important to remember that this report provides only a snapshot of the behaviour of the regulator and the operations of just one small airline. The parallels with the Monarch case are obvious. The CAA was warned that Monarch was flying in breach of safety regulations and yet failed to act on a recommendation from an airworthiness inspector that Monarch's air operators certificate be either revoked or suspended. In his report on the Monarch crash released in June this year, the coroner spoke of an atmosphere of intimidation of officers who sought to take such action and he concluded that had CAA management paid more attention to the law and less to accommodating its 'customers', then Monarch would have been grounded and those deaths avoided. In July last year, the commercial air traffic services operations of the CAA were placed with a government business enterprise, Airservices Australia, and the safety regulatory functions vested in a separate statutory authority, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. But changing the name does not solve the problems. While there have been some worthwhile changes, particularly at Airservices, I am not satisfied that sufficient change has taken place within the safety regulator. I expect, and the public will demand, that CASA take strong and swift action in response to the recommendations of Commissioner Staunton. I reiterate my concerns about the lack of aviation experience on the board of CASA. Since their appointment more than 12 months ago, I am not aware of the board having made any serious attempt to change the culture of CASA, and I cannot think of a CAS A nonexecutive board member having ever addressed an industry meeting or conference outlining a vision for reform of CAS A. There is a need for strong leadership and a knowledge and understanding of the industry by board members to enable them to keep ahead of the bureaucracy. I remain dissatisfied with the performance of the board in this regard and this report reinforces the importance of appointing to the board of CASA strong individuals with relevant aviation experience and the drive for reform. The role of the board is to lead and not merely rubber stamp or monitor. In light of my concerns developed through my investigations into the Monarch disaster, and now equipped with the findings of Commissioner Staunton, I am totally convinced that substantial change within CASA is absolutely essential. This can best be achieved by having in charge of CASA a board with appropriate skills and relevant experience. I appreciate that individual members of the present board are highly qualified in their respective professions. But, just as it has taken them years of diligent effort to gain those qualifications, it will also take them years to become aviation experts. The millions of Australians who climb aboard an airplane each year can't afford to wait for them to gain that expertise. It is for this reason that I for them to step aside; to enable people who are expert to take charge; to implement change; to make CASA a better safety regulator; to make flying safer. I am not empowered under the legislation to remove board members who lack appropriate skills. As the minister responsible, I am required to assure the safety of the Australian public. And yet I cannot state that I have confidence in the skills of the board to ensure that their statutory responsibility to protect the travelling public is carried out. I find this personally distressing, particularly when I know there are many fine and capable people within the Civil Aviation Safety Authority who are desperately awaiting the right leadership and vision from the board. I can only hope that Commissioner Staunton's report will have sufficient impact to motivate the board to resign and make way for others. I will table this two-volume report with the knowledge that the tragic events that took place involving Seaview Air in October 1994 occurred despite warnings that I made in this House in May 1994 about this specific airline's operations. Those warnings were quite clear and can be summarised by the following statement. I made about Seaview in parliament on 4 May 1994 which indicated that 'this airline, which was operating so dangerously and which was putting people's lives at risk, continued to fly'. It gives me no satisfaction to know that those concerns were subsequently, and most sadly, proven correct. The parallels with the Monarch tragedy in 1993 are all too evident. Once again, here was an operator who, despite showing all the signs of breaching regulations and who should not have been flying, continued to fly. Again we had a safety regulator that, instead of taking decisive action against safety breaches, acted indifferently and, even worse still, went out of its way to ensure that the airline continued to fly. Commissioner Staunton described it as the 'institutional timidity of the CAA'. The commissioner's summation of the former CAA's oversight of Seaview was 'in three years it did very little and discovered almost nothing'. No statement could better sum up the absolute incomperepeat my request tence of the CAA. Since its commencement on 25 October 1994, the Seaview inquiry process has been a long one, with extensions of time required to allow the commission to complete its inquiries. The inquiry had 142 witnesses, received over 900 exhibits and sat for 224 days of hearings and produced almost 17,000 pages of transcript. The financial cost, in the order of $20 million, takes no account of the huge emotional cost and strain on the friends and relatives of those lost in the accident as the commission's hearings unfolded. On behalf of the government I wish to thank Commissioner Staunton and his staff for the enormous amount of work they have done over nearly two years and for providing such a detailed and comprehensive report. They have at times shown enormous patience Commissioner Staunton has highlighted the following areas of concern which he believes warrant further consideration: - an attitude that characterises breaches of the Civil Aviation Act, regulations and the orders as 'aviation trivia'; - a practice of cross-hiring that enables an operator to use an aircraft of a type not endorsed on the AOC by 'borrowing' the AOC of another operator; - a practice of pilots overstating flying hours in their log books so they might accumulate more quickly sufficient hours to obtain work with large operators; - a suggestion there is widespread disregard by general aviation maintenance organisations for manufacturers' requirements; - the adequacy of pilot training; - allowing a pilot with only a few years' experience to pilot aircraft alone-while carrying passengers-when he or she has little more than the minimum required hours for endorsement on the aircraft type; - the maintenance release system for recording flying hours is unsatisfactory; - the concept of district offices, where there are few operators and few officers, raises the issue of 'capture'; and - the adequacy of the regulatory authority's information about operators and pilots. Not surprisingly, many of the key findings and recommendations in the commissioner's report complement the conclusions of two previous reports on aviation safety. In December last year, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure conducted an extensive inquiry into aviation safety, particutragedy, larly in the commuter and general aviation sectors. As a member of that committee, I can honestly say that it revealed a number of aviation safety issues which had been left alone for far too long in these sectors of the industry. The result of the committee's work was the release of the Plane Safe report which identified the following four key features of aviation safety: - the absence of robust indicators on the safety of aviation or the performance of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority; - the paucity of information on low capacity RPT and the general aviation sectors; - an inadequate approach to those sections of industry that exhibit the characteristics of destructive competition; and - rampant distrust between the regulator and certain sectors of the industry and within CAAICASA itself. The Plane Safe report went on to make a number of recommendations, many of which have already been acted upon by the government. While I will be announcing the final government response to the report in the very near future, I can indicate today that in a number of key areas, such as consumer information, safety indicators and corporate planning, work is already well advanced to put into effect many of the specific recommendations of the Plane Safe report. The release of the Monarch coronial inquiry report in June this year also focused attention on a number of issues related to air safety and aviation insurance. Back in May 1994, I had reported in parliament my absolute disgust at the fact that the grief and pain suffered by the families of those killed aboard the Monarch aircraft was compounded by their being denied access to insurance. As I said then: Insurers apparently use every means to evade their liability and are unmoved by the distress of the families or victims. ' An insurance policy was in existence then, but the airline's breaches of regulations were being used by the insurer to escape liability. More than three years after the Monarch the relatives and families of those who died are still waiting for acknowledgment and settlement of their claims against the insurer of the operator. I would be appalled if this disgraceful situation were to recur in relation to the victims of the Seaview disaster. Since the Monarch and Seaview accidents, we have seen the introduction of mandatory insurance for airline operators and no-fault payouts by their insurers, with a significant increase in the limit of compensation payment to $500,000 per passenger. Amendments to Commonwealth carriers liability legislation and regulations affecting domestic and international flights to and from Australia became effective from 20 January this year. The government expects and strongly urges all the states to have their complementary legislation to cover all intrastate flights in place by the end of this year. I have said before that most regional and commuter airlines serving rural Australia maintain a high standard of safety and, having spoken to many reputable regional operators in recent years about these accidents, I can assure the community they are just as concerned about anyone in their industry who brings the sector into disrepute. The owners of all passenger airlines have a primary responsibility and duty of care to ensure that their passengers are carried in well-operated and well-maintained aircraft. It is not a duty that can be left to one individual such as the chief pilot or the maintenance controller, although each of these office holders must, in the performance of their duties, always put the safety of the passenger first. Therefore I believe that owners should also be held equally liable. Commissioner Staunton's report has clearly shown that Seaview's owner was not up to meeting these fundamental responsibilities. I have written to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority Director of Aviation Safety, Mr Leroy Keith, seeking his written assurance that a charter operator, Kentia Link, which may have connections with the former Seaview Air, is now, and has been since its inception, under full and appropriate safety surveillance, including ramp checks and any other audit or operational inspections necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements for its continuing status as a charter passenger carrier. I have asked Mr Keith to inform me which officer is accountable for ensuring that Kentia Link complies with the air safety regulations. CASA staff from here on in will be held accountable for their actions. The role of CASA in oversighting this sector of the aviation industry has to be addressed. CASA is reviewing the safety of low capacity regular public transport operators and their support organisations through programs such as the safety systems assessment of passenger carrying operations. In June this year, following the release of the Monarch coronial report and foreshadowing the need for reform following the Seaview inquiry, I announced the most far-reaching safety regulatory review in this country's history, with the establishment of a complete overhaul of civil aviation regulations and a close examination of the role of CASA. This review will be overseen by a program advisory panel, reporting directly to me each month. The review is about achieving outcomes capable of implementation and is not another committee or forum for just discussing safety issues. The panel has been drawn from the most senior and distinguished levels of the aviation industry and will be chaired by Mr James Kimpton, the Manager of Aviation Policy at Ansett Australia, and the immediate past chairman of the Australian Air Transport Association. Of the other representatives of the panel, who come from a diverse cross-section of interested parties, I am most pleased to have John Laverick, the father of one of the Seaview victims and a person who has taken up with considerable and admirable determination the consumer issues arising out of this accident. The government is looking towards all major industry organisations and leaders to support the regulatory review process and for CAS A management to work with the advisory panel in a positive and constructive manner. The government expects that the regulatory review will produce substantive recommendations next year which could be implemented in 1998. There needs to be a clear understanding that the review of itself will not solve all CASA's problems. It will help, but I return to my earlier point: the best way to solve these problems is to have a board that is capable and expert, coupled with a determined government, working with industry to produce an effective safety regime. The former CAA has been the subject of strong and adverse comments in both the Monarch and Seaview accidents. Thirteen years ago, it was criticised by Sir Sydney Frost QC, who had inquired into the Advance Airlines crash that killed 13 people in 1980. The failures of the then regulator, the Department of Transport, are remarkably similar to those highlighted by the Monarch and Seaview disasters. The time has come for CASA to respond to these recurring criticisms of aviation safety regulation through rebuilding its reputation by taking appropriate action against those who bring the aviation industry into disrepute, including its own staff. I will be insisting on a full and detailed response from CASA and the full cooperation of the CASA board, management and staff in ensuring we move forward to a more effective and efficient system of air safety regulation in this country. My aim as the minister responsible is to foster and promote the shared safety goal. The government is determined to achieve it. The travelling public expect nothing less from the government and, through it, the safety regulator. There is nothing, however, that will bring back to life the victims of the tragic Monarch and Seaview accidents. My heartfelt wishes go out to all the relatives and friends of those who lost their loved ones in these two disasters. I am determined to ensure we learn the lessons from their deaths to save other Australians from a similar fate. I recommend that this report be compulsory reading for all CASA staff. It will highlight to them how easily things can go wrong and how dire the consequences can be. I table the two-volume report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Relations Between the CAA and Seaview Air. I ask leave to move a motion to authorise the publication of the report. Leave granted.",34
143,Mr SHARP,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I move: That this House authorise the publication of the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Relations Between the CAA and Seaview Air, volumes 1 and 2. Question resolved in the affirmative.",39
144,Mr TANNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I first wish to join the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) in expressing my sincere condolences to the families and friends of those involved in the Seaview disaster, and in commending Commissioner Staunton for his work in investigating the causes of this disaster. The conclusions that· Commissioner Staunton has reached with respect to the Seaview disaster can perhaps best be summed up in the phrase that appears a couple of times in his report: 'the institutional timidity of the former Civil Aviation Authority'. It is quite horrifying when you read through the list of non-compliance by the operator and read the things that were permitted to occur because of the failure of the CAA officers to take action when they should have taken action. They include the case of a flying operations inspector who failed to conduct appropriate inspections; who took excuses at face value from the operator for defects; who was aware of the fact that an illegal regular passenger transport operation was being flown and did nothing; who, when complaints were received from the chief pilot of Seaview, actually disclosed the identity of the complainer to the operator when he raised the complaints with the operator; who failed to investigate problems that had been raised with the CAA by customers through complaints; and who presided over the upgrading of Seaview to regular passenger transport status, in spite of all the obvious things that were wrong with the operation. Then there was the regional manager who failed to adequately supervise the flying operations inspector and wrongly imposed restrictions on another inspector who, quite properly, was seeking to point to the deficienreal cies in the Seaview operation and the failure of supervision that was occurring. There were also more senior officers who had been asked by the then CEO of the CAA, Mr Doug Roser, to do a proper audit of the Seaview situation in response to complaints, and who failed to do so not on one occasion but on two occasions. It would appear that Mr Roser failed to follow up his own request in this regard. The conclusion reached by Mr Staunton a was that 'CAA saw its role as satisfying the customer rather than regulating the operator' The factors that appear to have led to the disaster include: the flight was overloaded at least 260 kilograms; the pilot may have been affected by antibiotics currently taking and possibly analgesics; the pilot did not have a current medical clearance, his previous medical certificate expired some three weeks previously; and, perhaps most significantly, the flight plan provided for flight altitude of 12,000 feet which was ignored in spite of the obvious icing risk which was the subject of a prohibition. There are some background points that I will make which are relevant to the minister's response today. The first is the battle that minister has engaged in with the CAS A board since he has become the minister and which he reiterated today in his comments on the report. Very early in his term as minister he of loyalty. asked by letter, by telephone and in a meeting the CASA board to resign. This was despite the fact that they had only been in office for nine months and had not taken office until some considerable time after both the Monately arch and the Seaview disasters. His reason for doing so, which he reiterated today, was that they lacked relevant aviation experience. board comprises: Mr Justice Fisher, who is the chief judge of the Industrial Court of South Wales; Mr Geoff Molloy, a retired Qantas pilot; Ms Clare Pollock, who is systems safety expert; and Ms Gabi Hollows, a consumer advocate. The minister has more or less implied in various public arenas that the role of the CASA board is very much hands on and that it more or less checks the planes itself. role of the board is to ensure compliance with the act. Its responsibilities include legal, accounting and management issues as well as aviation issues. It administers the organisation. The minister has submitted legislation, which has gone through the House but not the Senate, to extend the size of the board by two and to create a deputy chair position in order to partially achieve the objectives he set himself. There has been wide speculation that strong financial supporter of the coalition in its last election campaign, Mr Dick Smith, the . former president of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, would be one of the two by appointees. This is speculation that Mr Smith has certainly fostered and the minister has that he was done nothing to quell. In a ministerial statement on 25 June, which today's statement reflects and does not greatly add to, the minister claimed that the board of CASA had been putting its own interests a ahead of the interests of aviation safety in Australia. That is a very strong and serious charge. He did not produce any evidence to support this claim other than their refusal to accept his request to resign. The chairman of the board, Mr Justice Fisher, then put out a the press release denying this accusation, as I think he was entitled to do. The minister then put out a press release in response to Mr Fisher's press release accusing him of a lack Leaving aside the obvious peculiarity of a minister engaging in a war of press releases with his own statutory authority head, the fact remains that the minister has been inappropritargeting the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority for matters that it cannot be blamed for because it has only been in office The for a relatively short period. The path the minister is proposing to follow cannot be seen New as the solution to the problems that are manifestly apparent from both the coronial a inquiry into the Monarch disaster and the report that he has tabled today. This rather cavalier approach to the admin.: istration of safety regulations can also be seen in the minister's approach to the matter of electronic locator transmitters. This is a very The complex issue. There has been a very lively debate on this between CASA and particularly AOPA as to the respective merits of fixed ELTs as opposed to hand-held ELTs. The best that can be said with respect to this debate is that neither is universally better than the other in terms of safety. There are some situations where it would be preferable to have fixed ELTs and other situations where it would be preferable to have hand-held ELTs. It is worthy of note that when the minister overrode CASA's advice mandating fixed ELTs-which was in line with the International Civil Aviation Organisation's standard-and requiring them to allow handheld ELTs as an alternative, the general manager of flying operations at CASA, Mr Holger Von Muenchhausen, wrote a memo to his superiors on 16 May 1996 which stated: The decisions are detrimental to the safety of survivors of aviation accidents and do not have the support of technical specialists within the flying operations branch. As I have expressed before, I sincerely hope that we are not in this House at some point in the future examining a report from a coroner which concludes that somebody has died in a search and rescue situation because there was no fixed ELT in the aircraft. If that is the case, it will be on the minister's head because he has overridden his own safety experts and imposed a different decision on them, running very strongly the agenda of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and Mr Dick Smith. There is no better illustration of the extent of his association with the AOPA agenda than the recent fiasco surrounding the regulatory review that the minister referred to in his comments today. As indicated, he appointed an II-member program advisory panel to oversee the review of civil aviation safety regulations. This panel is representative of the different elements within the industry. It elected Mr David Wiltshire, the chair of the Aviation Industry Council, as its chair. The minister rejected this and said, 'No, I want Boyd Munro from AOPA as the chair of the program advisory panel.' When this was made known, Mr Munro sent out a fax on 17 September styling himself as the chairman of PAP. Many other industry representatives responded by saying that they would not work with Mr Munro and they rebelled. On 19 September, Mr Munro sent out a fax, calling a crisis meeting at Tullamarine airport. In it he stated: CASA has managed to stuff itthe PAP, the Program Advisory Panelfull of people who sing the CAS A song. And also: As an industry we have licked CASA's boots for years and CASA has responded by kicking us. The boot licking approach has been well and truly tried and has well and truly failed. On 20 September, the day after, we had backdown No. I from the minister when he issued a press release stating that Mr James Kimpton from Ansett would now head the Program Advisory Panel. The minister stated in the press release: I have asked Mr Boyd Munro to chair the Regulatory Framework Advisory Committee. A few days later, on 26 September, we had backdown No.2 when Mr Munro was demoted from the main panel to be chair of one of the subsidiary panels. The press release stated: Captain Bill Hamilton, the technical director of the Aircraft Owners' and Pilots' Association, will chair the Regulatory Framework Advisory Committee. In effect, the minister had tried to impose his own favourites, representing a relatively small part of the total aviation industry, onto the critical process of industry consultation with respect to the aviation safety regulatory review. The industry rebelled, and the minister was forced to make a humiliating backdown. What does this tell the minister about what may happen if he does go ahead and appoints Dick Smith to the CASA board? What it should tell him is precisely what the opposition has been saying to him, that is, it will be a recipe for brawling within the organisation; it will be a recipe for major conflict and for the board becoming a battleground for competing factions within the industry; and, ultimately, very much not in the interests of aviation safety in Australia and not in the interests of passengers. I should hasten to add that the Program Advisory Panel process and the consultation process is commendable. There is a good spread of industry representation. I note in particular one appointment to the panel that is commendable, although it is somewhat at odds with the minister's attitude to the CASA board, and that is the so-called consumer interest advocate, Mr John Laverick. Mr Laverick's daughter was a victim of the Seaview disaster and he has taken a very keen interest in these matters. I applaud his appointment; I think it is a very worthy appointment. But it does give rise to a question. Mr Laverick's title is 'consumer interest advocate'. As I recall, that is a title that Gabi Hollows on the board of CASA also carries. This question occurs in my mind: why is it that, in the quite technical and complex process of reviewing civil aviation safety regulations, it is appropriate to have a consumer advocate represented, but it is not appropriate to have a consumer advocate represented on the board in the more general process, which involves other issues aside from technical aviation issues such as administration of the organisation? There is a core contradiction in the minister's position on aviation safety issues. He has taken a very strong position-and I think a commendable position-with respect to the disasters that have occurred and the fact that aviation safety regulation by the former Civil Aviation Authority was clearly at fault in that it should have been much more stringent, much less mindful of commercial interests and much more mindful of the interests of passengers and of the safety of the travelling public. But, in contrast to that, the minister has strongly identified himself with the very strongly deregulatory approach being pushed by Mr Smith and by AOPA as an organisation. The significance of this is nowhere better seen than in the comments of the coroner in  he actually attributed a significant degree of responsibility for the lax administration of the Civil Aviation Authority to its former chairman, Mr Dick Smith, for the so-called pro customer approach or the slack regulatory approach that the CAA had taken. There is an inherent contradiction in these positions, and at some point that contradiction is going to hit the minister in a very hard way. He is running wi th a deregulatory, affordable safety agenda pushing particular issues that ultimately will diminish the degree of aviation safety in this country, but at the same time he is makingappropriately-a strong play on issues such as the report we have before us today. I will conclude with a couple of references to the statement that the minister has made today on the detail of the report. He repeats his call for the board of CASA to resign. He notes that the non-executive board members have not, to the best of his knowledge, addressed any industry meetings or conferences, which is hardly the basis for condemnation. I think there is a question mark as to what extent that really is their role. He states: There is a need for strong leadership, and a knowledge and understanding of the industry by board members to enable them to keep ahead of the bureaucracy. That again raises the question: is it their role to second-guess technical advice or technical decisions made by the technical experts in CAS A ? I think not. The minister also implies that the board of CASA is somewhat to blame for the things which led to the Seaview and Monarch disasters. Quite clearly, it is not because it was not in place at the time when those disasters occurred. He then said: ... there are many fine and capable people within CAS A who are desperately awaiting the right leadership and vision from the board. Again, effectively implying that this is all the fault of the new board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. All the minister gives us, both on 25 June and today, as evidence in support of this is vague statements about the culture in the Civil Aviation Authority, as it then was, and with no supporting evidence about what is currently occurring. There is no doubt that change is required and that change is occurring. I have full confidence in the CEO of CASA, Leroy Keith; I know the minister has confidence in him. Why he sees the board as such an obstacle to that process of change, I do not quite understand. The most extraordinary thing about all of this is that last week in the media we were promised that we were going to have the world's greatest aviation safety statement this week and that all sorts of incredible things were going to occur. Yet all we have had today from the minister is simply the recycled attack on the CASA board, which is entirely off the point, and the reiteration of the Program Advisory Panel process with respect to the regulatory review. That has already been announced and explained to this House. What is particularly peculiar in this response is that there is actually one very significant point of the Staunton recommendations with respect to the broader questions aviation safety regulation, of reference were amended in about May 1995 requiring a much broader consideration of the general administration of aviation safety by the commission. Its response has Chairman been to recommend further inquiry on a confidential whole range of issues with respect to aviation safety regulation including: the lax attitude to the importance of breaches of civil aviation with safety regulations; the practices such as persistent overstating of flying hours by pilots; the his adequacy of pilot training; the sole pilots being allowed to fly in spite of very limited experience; the adequacy of the maintenance release systems; and the structure of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. So we do have a recommendation which deserves some serious consideration, although there have been, as the minister mentioned, number of inquiries, including the plane safe inquiry, that suggest that broader examination of these things is required. That also raises the question of why he can condemn the board of CAS A-which was not in control and not in office at the time these disasters occurred-and what knowledge and what information he has on which to base his condemnation of that board and his cowcomment boyish attempt to force them to resign over some months when his own inquiry, which he and I both commend, is saying that further examination is needed of these general questoday, tions about the future of civil aviation safety regulation and how CASA should operate. last week. Yet he sees fit to continue to attack the board without justification. I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, very much for the opportunity to speak on the report today. I reiterate that I commend the work of Commissioner Staunton and reiterate my condolences to the families concerned. Motion (by Mr Sharp) proposed: That the House take note of the report. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. NA Motion of Censure",39
145,Mr GARETH EVANS,TREASURER,"by because the terms leave-I move: That this House censures the Treasurer for the embarrassment he caused Dr Alan Greenspan, of the Federal Reserve Board, United States of America, by disclosing the contents of a conversation on a highly sensitive matter; for the damage he has caused thereby to Australia's international reputation and credibility senior decision makers; and for his subsequent and deliberate attempts to mislead the public as to what he had done, in clear breach of duty under the Prime Minister's Code of significance of Ministerial Conduct. It is no wonder that the government has used its numbers today to delay the bringing on of this matter and to ensure that the debate commences in a relatively empty chamber. It is no wonder because the behaviour of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the United States a last week has to be one of the most egregious and indefensible pieces of misbehaviour by an Australian minister in living memory. So much has been effectively admitted by the Treasurer today when in his first answer in question time, in his humble, chastised, pale and pasty mode that we last saw after the Premiers Conference debacle, he conceded that it had been inappropriate for him to on the subject matter of his discussion with Dr Greenspan and that it would not happen again. It was evident also in the Prime Minister's dash for cover in question time maintaining his record of effective silence on this matter that persisted through It is the case that no parliament could possibly rest content with this matter without proceeding to a motion of this kind, because what we have seen in the last week has been extraordinarily highly censurable behaviour in at least three ways: first of all, in breaking faith with Dr Greenspan, an official of the utmost significance, on an issue of the utmost sensitivity in breach of all rules of protocol and practice in international discourse of this kind, in a way causing immense damage to our credit, our reputation, our credibility and our access to senior decision makers not only in the United States but elsewhere-a folly that was compounded, of course, by the failure to apologise to Dr Greenspan, if indeed there has been a failure to apologise. It is not surprising, I suppose, that the Treasurer ducked and weaved, as did the Prime Minister, on this issue today, because if there has not been an apology to Dr Greenspan that only compounds the offence already committed. And if there has been an apology, of course, it makes absolute nonsense of the campaign of denial that has been maintained right through the last week that nothing was done or said of any public damage to Australia that needed that sort of response. The second matter at issue here is the initial denial of the Treasurer that he had said anything at all on the subject of Dr Greenspan's views, dismissing any such report as fanciful. Thirdly, after the tape was played, making that defence inoperative, he embarked on the extraordinary course of denying that he said what the tape makes clear he said on at least two further major issues. We have seen a move in the last few days from an initial appalling indiscretion to an appalling exercise in dishonesty, combined with a further appalling exercise in dishonesty and untruthfulness based apparently on a deluded assumption of invulnerability that he could get away with it. Let us take each of these issues in tum. First of all, the initial indiscretion. It came to light with the Australian Financial Review front page article on 2 October, making it perfectly clear that the Treasurer was disclosing Dr Greenspan's views on a crucial issue or series of issues relating to the setting of the United States interest rates. The impact of that Financial Review report was immediate. It was picked up by an AP-Dow Jones reporter. It was flashed around the world and resulted in an immediate surge, sustained over several days thereafter, in the international bond market. The impact was described, for example, by Mr Haralabopolous, the Chief Economist of GIO Australia, in these terms: He shifted the global bond market to the tune of many hundreds of millions of dollars-every debt in the world, private and corporate, you are talking billions of dollars of financial action. Not only was this news in Australia, as Mr Costello tried to tell us, as reported on the AAP wires last week, but there was a flood of international responses to this disclosure. We were told that there was a flood of calls to Australia's Washington embassy by traders keen to confirm their accuracy. We are told by the International Herald Tribune that bond prices rose in direct response to those comments. We are told similar things by the Knight-Ridder report of that day. We are told that in a whole series of reports in the Wall Street Journal and other outlets, including the CNN web site, available internationally, which led with the brilliantly credible headline for Australia 'Aussie gaffe stirs markets' . What was the reason that these comments, this report, had so much impact? The reason is not hard to discern. It is because the utterances of Dr Greenspan are watched as closely as those of the Pope. It is because, at the same time, Dr Greenspan is normally as inscrutable on these issues as the oracle of Delphi. He is in fact famous for a line that he uttered once to the United States Senate when he said to the senators, 'If I have said something you can understand fully, then I probably made a mistake.' This is the way Dr Greenspan conducts himself in the public domain. He is not someone who believes in transparency; he is not someone who believes that it is appropriate for a central banker to layout in the public domain every dimensiorr of his current thinking on the issues that matter to his interest rate decision making. Under those circumstances it is an extraordinarily significant matter for Dr Greenspan's views to be put into the public domain in this way. That, Treasurer, is simply in international affairs what you don't do. When you come out of a meeting with a senior figure of this kindMr Costello-And you know!",43
146,Mr GARETH EVANS,TREASURER,"I do indeed know because I did it for years without any problem of this kind. You state what you said, you don't attribute views to the other side unless you have the express or implied authority of the other party to do just that. You occasionally can generalise about the views that you have heard from a number of interlocutors, a number of parties; you can conclude as to the general pattern of a response on an issue in a country but never, ever without the authorisation-express or implied-{)f someone do you disclose the subject matter of those conversations. It was not unexpected, as a result, that the reaction in the international sphere to this disclosure by the Treasurer was as severe as it was. The US Federal Reserve was very selfdisciplined in its response. It maintained what was an icy-clear view by saying simply that the communication was a private matter and that Dr Greenspan did not comment on private meetings. They left it at that but the message was unmistakable and I do not think that anybody, even the Treasurer, mistook it. Others were less constrained in the way they expressed themselves. At question time. I quoted from David Blitzer, the Chief Economist for Standard and Poor's, who was saying that this was 'not the thing to do if he wants his telephone calls returned', and there would be 'a huge storm if the United States Treasury Secretary had done anything like that' . We heard on the airwaves Mr Josh Fineman, the Global Markets Economist with Bankers Trust, saying: This is really kind of unique. I cannot remember a time where a foreign government official was quoted as saying he had a meeting with the Federal Chairman and the Federal Chairman suggested such and such about the economic outlook. He then, with masterly understatement, said, 'I don't think they would view this all that favourably.' Mr Bill Dudley of Goldman Sachs said this was considered 'sort of bad form'. Was it ever! Of course, the Australian media was, as you would expect, less constrained in its assessment of the impact of this. You had the Age saying 'Costello gaffe echoes around the world' . You had the Sydney Morning Herald talking about 'Costello's global gaffe', making no bones about the implications. Even Mr Kennett said, with the economy of expression for which he is sometimes famous, 'The world now knows that Peter Costello is Treasurer of Australia.' And indeed they do! The editorials were absolutely devastating so far as the Treasurer was concerned. The Australian Financial Review in its editorial of 4 October referred to his 'remarkably poor judgement'. It said: . . . the episode leaves him looking naive and unprofessional, apparently disrespectful of the protocols that attend private chats with the world's most influential banker and-incredibly for an international Treasurer-insensitive to the fact that the slightest hint of Dr Greenspan's intentions can move the markets. The Herald-Sun said: Australia's reputation may well have been tarnished in the heady world of international banking. Will another banking chief share confidences with an Australian Government Minister? .. It is not unreasonable to believe that on future trips to the US capital, Mr Costello may not be given access to the most informed and powerful man in the world's economy. The Canberra Times editorial of 4 October said: It is probable that the gaffe will reflect on all Australian Ministers travelling overseas, at least for a time. The flow of information will not be as free, to the detriment of the national interest. The Courier-Mail editorial said: It will be some time before anyone on the international scene trusts him again. He might as well stay home for the next few years, because no-one of any consequence in international circles will confide in him. In all of this we have seen a lot of speculation about the motives which might have led the Treasurer to go down this spectacular track, none more damning than the speculations of that person normally very sensitive to the role the coalition and the Treasurer play, Mr Michael Pascoe. On the Channel 9 Daybreak program on 3 October, Michael Pascoe said: Dear Peter, surely you were taught that a gentleman never discloses what he does behind closed doors with a consenting adult? Or were you just bragging a bit? A few minutes later, on the Today program, Michael Pascoe said: Here's Peter Costello, his first time overseas, and it's a big time in the US, it is the IMFIWorld Bank meeting where they get to hang out with the big boys ... It's certainly naive ... It sounds, from the tape recording-we've all heard of it-a little like boasting, 'I've been talking with the big boys, I'm the Australian Treasurer now. ' This is Michael Pascoe, your mate on Channel 9. Imagine what your non-mates are saying. Michael Stutchbury summed it up beautifully in one phrase in the Australian Financial Review on 4 October when he referred to 'this disastrous bit of big noting'by a Treasurer who cannot help himself. Whatever explanation there may be for this appalling indiscretion, whether it was big noting or whether it was just naivety, whether it was ignorance of the protocols that attend these meetings or whether it was anything else, there is no doubt about the damage that has been done to this man's credibility and to Australia's credibility and reputation in any dealings we may want to have with world leaders in the future. Then we moved from the indiscretion to the denial of it, the dishonesty. His first reaction was to describe the Financial Review report as fanciful. It is all there, spelled out, in the Dow Jones report of 2 October. It said that Peter Costello had called 'fanciful' reported remarks that were attributed to him and made about US monetary policy. Mr Costello, when the Federal Reserve confirmed that he had met with Mr Greenspan on Monday, repeated a number of times that such a report was fanciful. He said, 'I don't comment on US interest rates,' and when read a portion of the text of the Financial Review report, he said, 'That's fanciful.' That particular defence did not last long because a tape had been taken of the meeting and Mr Costello not many hours afterwards was comprehensively sprung with the tape recording of the exchange. Let me put it on the record. It went as follows: Costello: On the record, okay. Questions? Journalist: ... After speaking to Greenspan, what would be your expectation in the US, as far as interest rates go? Costello: Well, I don't think there is any expectation at the moment that rates are going to rise. A little later he said: He indicated to me that he saw no threats to inflation down the track. A little later: So he indicated to me that there was no reason to expect a change on the current scene, as he sees it. .. he's very optimistic. Mr Costello-Keep going. Absolutely dishonest.",45
147,Mr GARETH EVANS,TREASURER,"You can quote the rest of it. I am happy to put it in the Hansard. It proves nothing whatsoever that helps your case. It proves absolutely nothing. You make it absolutely clear. You are clutching at straws. No wonder the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the government's minders were speechless in the absolute absence of any credible defence. You need to explain why there was a minder in your own office or the Prime Minister's office or somewhere else in the government saying that the government's case was unanswerable on this. When the lights came on there you were 'with your trousers down around your ankles'. That was the assessment, the characterisation, the understanding other people had. The media editorial reaction in Australia all had available the full text, every sentence, every nuance, every huff, every puff, every grunt, every hiccup-they had the lot in front of them. Every single one of them was absolutely damning in their condemnation of your false denial of this matter. 'Costello takes out fib of the week award' says the Canberra Times. In its editorial of 4 October, the Financial Review said: The real problem is the impression that Mr Costello gave by denying the integrity of the initial report. If it is important for him to keep faith with Dr Greenspan, it is even more imperative that he keep faith with the voters who elevated him to a position of trust. Again on 4 October, on the same theme, the Sydney Morning Herald editorial said: By attempting to deny the undeniable, Mr Costello has made a bad situation worse ... Mr Costello has done himself lasting damage ... by his patently untruthful response when taken to t-sk abo-t it ... very hard for him to shake off t-e ImpreSSIOn, which he himself has created, that In a tight spot he is all too ready to deal loosely with the truth. As the editorials of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Financial Review said, there has been a breach of trust with the Australian people. And a breach of .trust with the - us­ tralian people is somethmg that the - nme Minister told us was absolutely not gomg to be tolerated under the new whiz-bang ministerial code of conduct. He said: Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the Parliament or the public. That is exactly what you have done and that is why you deserve censure. Then we had the further compounding of the untruthfulness. The saga did not stop there. We had the Treasurer in denial mode'This isn't a tax, this is a tariff.' 'This tax it's a surcharge.' This is a tariff, it's not at-x.' - as he was sprung successively with a further series of exchanges. 'Were you saying something about US interest - ates?' 'Me talking about interest rates? Nothmg of the kind.' But then the tape is played again and it is obvious that he is talking about US interest rates. Then again the further denial that he was not saying anything about Dr Greenspan's views. He was simply recording his own assessment. Then again we had, as was put on record in question time today, the exact quotes from that particular initial media briefing making it absolutely clear that he was doing absolutely nothing of the kind. O-e denial, two denials, three denials. The cock IS now crowing for you, sport, just as it did for your biblical namesak- before you. Thr-e strikes and you are out m baseball. If there IS any decency in this government, with all its pretences to decency in public affairs, then you would be out too. You would be right out on your ear and no longer purporting to be the Treasurer of this country. We have seen all this before from the Treasurer. We have seen this extraordinary capacity for denial, bordering in fact on delusion when we see him in some of these modes-'This is not a tax, it is a tariff.' 'This is not a tax, it is a surcharge.' 'This is not a tax, it is simply a charge that is rebatable on conditions.' Whenever he is sprung clearly, directly, unanswerably with a statement of his on the public record, his mode is to retreat to denial and to do so in a way that is manifestly untruthful and seems to depend on some psychological assumption of invulnerability. I sometimes feel in these situations that he is not so much a suitable case for censure as a suitable case for treatment because of the way in which he responds. He thinks he can get away with all this because he sees himself-and this has been much remarked upon by every commentator in .the country--s a new Paul Keating: confident, aggressive, flamboyant, carrying all before him in this parliament and elsewhere. The trouble is that to do that, to play that particular role as another Paul Keating, you isn't a have to be good. You have to be not only experienced but you have to have ability; you have to have judgment; you have to have vision; you have to have integrity; you have to have respect. Let me tell you: I knew Paul Keating-we all knew Paul Keating-and, Peter Costello, you are no Paul Keating. In this Treasurer we have a down-market, cutrate, discount house Paul Keating. We have a K Mart Keating. On all the evidence of last week; in all the appalling indiscretion; with all its appalling legacy for the reputatio- and the.credibilit- of Australia overseas; with all ItS appallIng implications for the accessibility of this man to high level decision makers for so long as he remains in office and seeks that access; with all that it reveals last week about his appalling untruthfulness in the original den-al, the original dismissal of the Financial ReView report as 'fanciful', comp-unded a-d rep-ated to the point of pathological delUSIOn With a whole subsequent series of further denials; we have someone who is demonstrably not fit to be Treasurer of this nation and manifestly deserving of the censure of this House.",46
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,Mr Jenkins)Is the motion seconded? Mr Crean-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,47
149,Mr COSTELLO,TREASURER,"Higgins-Treasurer) (4.45 p.m.}-On few occasions would you see a censure in this House which was as weak as that and which aroused no passion. Where was the passion in the censure? With a censure you should at least be able to fix on some misdemeanour, you should be able to develop a credible argument, you should be able to disclose some new material. But we saw here somebody who is very obviously failing in his attempt to transfer to the House of Representatives and who stood up in order to try to justify himself to the troops who were all brought in here. What did the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), do essentially? Essentially he read out a whole lot of newspaper articles from last week. He built to the crescendo of his speech, which was the cheapest imitation of Lloyd Bentsen I have ever seen. Do you remember the Lloyd Bentsen put down: ' Mr Senator, you are no John Kennedy'? He built, as it were, to the great crescendo of a censure which was to say, 'You are no Paul Keating.' Thank you; I could not have wanted a better conclusion. In fact the meanest thing you actually said in this censure, apart from all of those adjectives that you go on with as you read out the prepared text, was that I wanted to be a new Paul Keating. That actually did cut me. I found that to be the most devastating thmg you said during the debate. When you came to your crescendo, the cheap imitation of Lloyd Bentsen, to say, 'You're no Paul Keating,' all I could say was, 'Gee, I've been cleared.' What a wonderful clearance we got from the shadow Treasurer in relation to that. But let us try to get to the crux of the argument, because it can be dealt with very quickly. The guts of the argument from the opposition is that on sensitive matters of monetary policy in the United States you should not talk. As I said earlier, if that in fact your charge, why do you get up and invite further comments right throughout question time? Why would you, except to try to keep flogging a dead horse? As I said in question time, I readily accept that you can put various interpretations on comments, and that is why it is much better not to comment and I will not be commenting. But let us have a look at the parliamentary attack. How did the parliamentary attack on this moment of great principle develop? It developed on a separate subject altogether. You started off in question time today on the issues of Aboriginal affairs. That is how big this censure was-it was not even worth the first question; it was not even worth the second question. After this weak, lame performance during question time, having run out of questions, you tried to move a censure during question time. How did you finish up? You finished up with the devastating point, 'Were you pot smoking?' That is how you finished up your parliamentary attack: 'Were you pot smoking?' - undergraduate, juvenile humour. And now you try to make out that there is some kind of serious point to be gained here. The other point is that, if this was such a big moment, where is the front page of the New York Times? Where is the front page of the Washington Post? Where was the CBS newscast? Where was this international great event? The best that he could tum out was the CNN web site. 'All over the place,' he says. Where is the New York Times? Where is the Washington Post? I was over in the United States and I decided that I would keep a reality check on all of the press. On 2 October the thing that was thought to be important in the United States was the National Association of Purchasing Management, which reported that its competent index of manufacturing activity fell to 51.7 for September, a lower reading than . many economists had anticipated. As was said in relation to that, the National Association of Purchasing Management index of manufacturing activity was expected to come in at 53. It fell to 51.7 in September from 52.6 in August. It was said that a reading above 50 were often signals an expanding economy; a reading below 50 signals a contraction. That was the most significant news in relation to the markets on 2 October in the United States. But, of course, you would not know that, would you? Nor would you want to actually investigate it. Nor would you try to prove any significant effect in relation to these matters at all. This was the laziest, weakest and most inept censure that you will ever see in this parliament. Someone gets up and reads out last week's newspaper articles. All of us can read last week's newspaper articles. We do not need a struggling, battling shadow Treasurer to stand up here and read out last week's newspapers. What we would like to know is some hard economic fact. But there was not even a pretence to try to put together any hard economic fact. The other proposition that was said with great hilarity from the Labor Party backbench was that you would know what to do in international affairs. Let me let you in on a secret. It is almost like clockwork: when you walk into an international forum and you say that you are from Australia, the first thing that is always said to you is, 'Oh, we are so glad Mr Gareth Evans is no longer attending these conferences.' It is almost like clockwork. It is generally somebody from the Asia Pacific region. They come up to you and they say how glad they are that you are no longer on the international stage. It happened most recently again in Washington. They come up to you in a beeline and they say, 'We are so glad there has been a change of government.' I must say to you that other ministers would have experienced this as well-that the best asset any Australian has on the international stage is not having the name 'Gareth Evans'. This is the best asset that you can possibly have. This proposition that you can come into this parliament and tell us how to conduct international affairs is a bizarre proposition. We are finding out quite a bit about you on the international stage. We are finding out quite a bit about what you used to get up to. We are finding out quite a bit about how you conducted our relationships. Of course, we know that you were the master of discretion! You never made any comments about puppies, did you? No, you were the master of discretion; I am sorry! You were somebody who was fitted out to be UN Secretary General. The only trouble is that the best you can do is the member for Holt, and you are not doing that very well. Let us come to some propositions that the Australian public is probably interested in. The Australian public is probably very interested in your plans for new taxes. The Australian public would be very interested to know what the Labor Party intends to tax and how. This will be a critical issue in the Lindsay by-election. The Labor Party believes that taxes are too low. The Labor Party believes, therefore, that taxes should be put up. Mr Gareth Evans interjecting",48
150,Mr COSTELLO,TREASURER,"After the Labor Party disclosed this, you had to go to bed, sick. You said on the airwaves, 'We believe that taxes are too low,' and you then went to bed, sick. As I said in question time, if I had done nothing else, I got you out of your sickbed. It was a bit like Lazarus: take up your bed and walk. I was very pleased to contribute to your rehabilitation, but that is about the only substantive or lasting effect that this will have had. Why don't you come clean in relation to your tax policy? I will tell you why: for you, this is a massive distraction which you want to use to take attention away from your taxation policy. I suppose it was so good that that is what got you out of your sickbed. Kim Beazley would have said, 'We are back in business. Get out there and do whatever you can to build it up to take the attention off taxes,' because it is about taxes that the people of Lindsay are really worried. I venture to make this prediction: in the Lindsay by-election, the US bond rate is not going to be a major issue. I venture that proposition. I may be proven wrong, but I just have this inkling that in the by-election the US T-bond rate is not going to be on the minds of all of the voters. We now have an opposition that is trying to re-engage itself with blue-collar employees in Australia. The way in which they are going to re-engage themselves with the blue-collar employees in Australia is by worrying themselves sick about the US T-bond 30-year rate. I hope you keep this up day after day. I noticed that the shadow Treasurer has called for my resignation. Let me make this pledge to you, Mr Deputy Speaker: we will never call for his resignation. He is right where we want him, and we want him to stay there as long as possible. But I must say that I am rather concerned, because there is one thing that is always an indicator of political mortality in the Labor Party, particularly the Victorian division of the Labor Party. Just as in the African desert a dead beast's carcass can always be located by circling vultures, in the Victorian branch of the Labor Party a dead political carcass can always be identified by ethnic branch stacking in an electorate. I refer of course to the fact that, in the electorate of Holt, Labor Unity has been shoring up its numbers by aiming at Bosnian, Albanian, Turkish, Cambodian and Vietnamese communities. This was reported in the Oakleigh, Springvale, Dandenong Times, which has catalogued the branch stacking in Holt in recent months. When the member for Holt was asked why his faction might be shoring up its numbers by aiming at Bosnian, Albanian, Turkish, Cambodian and Vietnamese communities, this is what he said: I think quite a lot of it has actually got to do with the fact that there is quite a strong migrant community down there, many of whom have some enthusiasm to be associated with the party now that I am here because of my foreign minister connections. Very touching. Down in Dandenong all these Albanian, Bosnian, Turkish, Cambodian and Vietnamese communities are flocking in, limited to 13 per month in each branch, to join the Labor Party because of his foreign ministry connections. As I said at the outset, just as the circling vultures disclose a carcass on the African savanna, so too do the warlords of the Victorian ALP disclose with their ethnic branch stacking a carcass that is in desperate need. But I do give this pledge: as I said earlier, on the basis of what the member for Holt has put in this censure motion and of his performance over the budget, we will never call for him to resign from that position. We believe that he has found his metier in that position, and we encourage him to continue just as he is. The shadow mInIster relied on another quote but did not complete it. He asked what I was referring to when I made a quote in relation to US interest rates. I make it entirely clear that what I referred to was a public meeting by the Federal Reserve which everybody knew aboutMr Gareth Evans interjecting",49
151,Mr COSTELLO,TREASURER,"And that is why you did not finish that quote. What I said was they had their meeting. When was it? Last Tuesday. And they did not move the rates. It was a public meeting. It provided the best indication that you will ever get in rdation to interest rates. It was an outcome that was known by the world. It was the outcome that I was pointing to. The reason why you did not finish the quote, the reason why the full quote was not read, is that it would have made it entirely clear what I was pointing to: essentially the public record. As I said earlier, these are areas which I concede are enormously sensitive. These are areas where you can have layers of understandings and hypothecation. As a result, I do not intend to contribute to keeping that going any further for one more day. (Time expired)",50
152,Mr CREAN,TREASURER,"The only element of truth in the submission of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) today was that these issues are sensitive. Sensitive they are, but he seems to be the only person in this place that does not think they are. He is trying to shift the onus and the burden away from everything that he said last week and is now trying to deny it. An indication of how concerned your side of the parliament is is the fact that you would not take the censure motion at the appropriate time. We all know that Peter Reith would love to have a censure moved against you. You talk about rivalry on this side. Let us talk about the sorts of developments between you and Penthouse Pete. He would love to have the censure motion moved against you, but in defence of the team the best he was prepared to do today was to delay it. This is a debate that should have been held earlier today. It is one that the Treasurer has tried to run away from. His pathetic response to the first question from the shadow Treasurer was in particular the demeanour. Lost is all the cockiness, lost is all this repartee. Here have the Treasurer sullen faced reading a prepared text for fear on his side that he would blunder again; blunder as he did last week by compounding the problem, not only mentioning the conversation he had with Dr Greenspan but then pretending it did not happen. The reason they wanted to delay this debate and move it later into the day so that it would miss the listening audience and the news deadlines was that you are an embarrassment. You are an embarrassment not just to this nation as Treasurer of the country but also to your party. You have built yourself up as the person with the promise and the future in this place, and you have proved yourself a dud on two big occasions at least. First of all, you have the state Premiers comprehensively skewering you in relation to your ill-timed comments about sales tax on cars. You were comprehensively defeated on that. Secondly, on this occasion you betrayed a trust and then tried to cover it up. Your defence today sought to attack the shadow Treasurer on the basis that he simply read out articles. You wonder why you have a censure motion against you when you have a litany of statements not just from Australian newspapers but from international newspapers talking about your gaff, your embarrassment. You say in your defence that in terms of that which you said various interpretations could be put on it. There is only one interpretation the market put on it. The market saw that you had betrayed a confidence and it reacted accordingly. You sent the bond market into a spin. It is the judge of your comments. As Treasurer of the nation, you cannot go around with the glib lines of trying to run the argument here. You have a responsibility in terms of the financial markets. The markets rated you so badly that ever since there has been damage control. Mr Costello interjecting",50
153,Mr CREAN,TREASURER,"They went up. He thinks it was the right thing to do now. He is compounding the problem. He is proud of the statement that he made. That is not what the markets think. Not only are you an embarrassment to your own party, with your own party we gleefully recognising your discomfort yet again, you are also an embarrassment on the international stage. You blustered about where were the comments in the international papers. Let us take the International Herald Tribune. Let us take the Chicago newspapers. Mr Costello-Oh, Chicago.",51
154,Mr CREAN,TREASURER,"Oh, Chicago. Chicago does not matter either. We do not have markets operating in Chicago! Haven't you been to that place? I am sure they would have withdrawn the invitation after your last performance. Having said that this did not even rate a mention in international newspapers, what does he refer to in terms of the shadow Treasurer-the Oakleigh, Springvale, Dandenong Times. This person has been wandering all around the world saying nothing appears in international papers when in fact it does. It says that Dr Greenspan told Treasurer Peter Costello of Australia that there was no immediate risk of inflation in the United States according to the Australian newspaper. They were quoting the Australian newspapers. You think they are not important in the international scheme of things. The international papers were actually quoting them. They were quoting the Financial Review, quoting the comments, quoting the gaffs because the markets were reeling all around the country. You say that there was not any passion in terms of the contribution. Let me just ask: where is the honesty in terms of your position? The voters of Lindsay are not looking for passion. They are not looking for the big noters. They are looking for honesty and for people who can represent them. As for your gratuitous statement that internationally people are pleased to see Gareth Evans off the international stage, name one of them. As far as we all know, he has achieved accolades all around the world for the contribution he has made. Certainly-not that he is anyone that you would want to measure him by-they do not want Alexander Downer. He is the person who has wrecked Australian industry opportunities, the person who has misled this parliament in the first few months of operation, the person who has overseas and Asian economies not wanting to deal with him because there is no trust and no confidence. He says one thing to them and does the other. Now you are confirming it. You are going into meetings ostensibly on the basis that they are private and confidential. You are given access because of the position that you hold in this government. You have that access on the basis that that which is said is held confidential and is used for your own purposes, but you cannot help yourself. Just as you like to perform in this parliament time and time again, you cannot help yourself. Mr Bevis-You want to big note.",51
155,Mr CREAN,TREASURER,"You want to big note. You want to get that sneer across your dial; the sneer from ear to ear in your case. You revel in the circumstance of having the media, the cameras and the attention but you do not know how to handle it.",52
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,Mr Truss)Order! The honourable member shall address his remarks through the chair.,52
157,Mr CREAN,TREASURER,"The Treasurer does not understand how to handle it, Mr Deputy Speaker. He has been an enormous embarrassment in regard to this issue. There are two sides to this shameful episode. The first is the incompetence of the Treasurer in betraying that confidence and throwing the international markets into a spin, thereby causing acute embarrassment for this country. The second is honesty in public life. Either one of these would deserve a censure, but taken together they constitute a clear case for dismissal. I will come to the code of conduct of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). On the first matter, the behaviour of the Treasurer has been so appalling it is almost comic. If it did not have such a serious impact on our international reputation, you could almost laugh it off. Tongue in cheek, the Victorian Premier has now said, in defence of you, although you would want a better defence of yourself than this statement: 'The world now knows that Peter Costello is the Treasurer of Australia.' Is that not a ringing endorsement of these statements that have sent the markets into a tailspin! We all know what the Victorian Premier likes to label the Treasurer as: he is referred to as 'dog'; not 'the dog' or 'a dog' or 'bad dog' or 'cruel dog' or 'vicious dog', just 'dog'. After his last foray the Treasurer is 'the loaded dog' . Do you remember the dog in the Henry Lawson story in which a group of mates wanted to find some way in which they could fish without getting their hands caught? They decided that they would develop a cartridge, used in mining operations, to blow the fish out of the water. The trouble is that the dog got hold of the lit cartridge and was running around causing mayhem for everyone. The description of this dog in the Henry Lawson classic is very interesting-and we should ask the Victorian Premier whether he has this in mind in his reference to the Treasurer: They had a big, black young retriever dog-or rather an overgrown pup, a big, foolish, four-footed mate, who was always slobbering around them and lashing their legs with his heavy tail that swung around like a stockwhip. Most of his head was usually a red, idiotic slobbering grin of appreciation of his own silliness. Never could there be a more apt description. I urge the Victorian Premier to read this short story and see whether the description fits his view of the Treasurer. The dog in the story runs around creating mayhem all over the place-just as you did when you broke the confidentiality of Dr Greenspan's commentand, at the end of it all, the story concludes: For half an hour or so after the explosionyour gaffethere were several bushmen round behind the stable who crouched, doubled up, against the wall, or rolled gently on the dust, trying to laugh without shrieking. That is your colleagues. They are the people on your side of the parliament who know the extent of your gaffe, but many of them like the fact that you have done it-not because you have embarrassed the nation but because you have diminished your own standing. Just to conclude this point on the analogy with this book, when the men got back to camp the description of the dog continues: And the dog that had done it all, Tommy, the great, idiotic mongrel retriever, came slobbering round Dave and lashing his legs with his tail, and trotted home after him, smiling his broadest, longest, and reddest smile of amiability, and apparently satisfied for one afternoon with the fun he'd had. Does the Treasurer believe that he has had fun at the expense of the international money markets? Does the Treasurer believe that he has represented the interests of this nation? I hardly think so. On the issue of honesty, let me go to the denial that the Treasurer made when he was caught: I never quote other countries' interest rates. fanciful if [the report] suggests to the contrary. But when the tape was provided, there he was dissembling. We all saw him on TV saying, 'No, no, no, no. I was reporting my assessment,' and saying that it was not what Dr Greenspan had told him. If you get the transcript of the recording he goes on to say: He indicated to me that he saw no threats to inflation down the track so hethis is Dr Greenspanindicated to me that there was no reason to expect a change on the current scene as he sees it. That is not you coming to your own view; that is you reporting him. Do you deny that? You were given the opportunity in this parliament today on three occasions to deny it. You were given a further opportunity in the censure and you have not done it. You have a responsibility as part of your obligations as the senior economic office holder in this country to tell the truth and you have not done it today. You have been caught out. There is enough evidence to hang you on this. But we know that you will not give up and we know that you will persist. The real issue is what the Prime Minister is prepared to do. Let us go to his code of conduct and his expectations of ministerial standards. On the matter of ministerial conduct, this is what the Prime Minister made great play about in his very first speech as Prime Minister in this parliament: Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the Parliament or the public. Any misconception caused inadvertently should be corrected at the earliest opportunity. You have misled the public and you have not corrected it. You have tried to avoid it, you have tried to obfuscate and, in the process, you have done great disservice to this country. If the Prime Minister stands for anything in lifting standards, he should have moved on Alexander Downer and he should be moving on your disgraceful performance. You have been out of the country for one week and look at the damage that has been caused. None of those doors will be open to you and That is a whole lot of your phone calls will not be answered. You have not had the decency yet to apologise to Dr Greenspan. How are the posts overseas dealing with this circumstance? The fact is that Australia's reputation is diminished and you are responsible for doing it. This rests fairly on your shoulders and it has come about because of your arrogance and your cockiness. You are sneering at those who criticise, you are not prepared to face up to the responsibilities of office and, in the process, Australia suffers. This is something you should be thoroughly ashamed of but, more importantly, it is something that the Prime Minister should act upon and upon which he should seek your resignation. (Time expired)",52
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,"Mr Truss)Order! Before I call the honourable member for Gippsland, I remind all members that, even though this is a censure debate, they must address their remarks through the chair.",53
159,Mr MCGAURAN,TREASURER,"The only thing to come out of this pale imitation of a censure motion will be a renewed flurry of branch stacking in the seat of Holt, because the current occupant of that seat is on his way out. That was the poorest, most ordinary performance, on the most serious type of motion that can be moved in this chamber, by the member for Holt and Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). Talk about devaluing the censure-they have written it out of the proceedings of this place as a serious weapon of censure by the opposition. Of course, what would you expect, given their performance at question time? We were in opposition for far too long-some 13 years. I can assure new members on the government side that we know something about opposition tactics-sadly, too much. But we never, at worse moments, during our worse days, connext ducted a question time as they did. It was obvious that they ran out of questions. They could not even call for divisions. They lost the opportunity on two occasions to call for divisions-the most simple task that an opposition could possibly have. Then they not even have a censure motion or a motion for the suspension of standing orders preobviously pared. They were busily writing it out during the chamber. the one and only division. They are a disorganised rabble, and that is reflected in their presentation of policy-as much as we know what it may be. We give them the opportunity to ask 10 questions day during question time and they are still unable to prepare for it. They come in with only a handful of questions and wait until question No. 4 or No.5-this very grave matter which must occupy the time of the sition? national parliament-to ask the Costello) about this incident. That is how seriously they take it. We have just seen from the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) how seriously he takes the matter. He started quoting at length from Henry Lawson. Where is the seriousness this issue that we must put aside all the business of the day? You did not take it seriously during question time and, sure as Evans. anything, you are not taking it seriously now. There are some winners from the extraordiin narily poor performance of the member for Holt today. Firstly, there is the member Bruce (Mr Griffin). I do not know anybody noticed him sitting back there, did, because he is the next member for Holt. He wants to shift from the seat of Bruce, Sodawhich is marginal and very likely-if I might be slightly overconfident, certain-to fall to the Liberal Party at the next election. As as he is concerned, the member for Holt, former Senator Evans, cheated him out of the seat of Holt when his seat of Corinella was went on to say: abolished in a redistribution in Victoria prior to the last election. He is grinning very delicacy. broadly. The other winner, of course, is the member for Hotham, the aspirant for the deputy leadership of the opposition and, soon after, our the leadership of the OpposItIOn. He is the shadow Treasurer; of that there is no doubt. He has all the bluster, the bluff and the overconfidence reminiscent of Paul Keating; not the shadow Treasurer. He should receive the accolade of being a Keating impersonator. So there is no doubt there will be a fundadid mental realignment in the leadership of the other side before very much longer. It is reflected in their performances in One cannot help wondering, given their inept tactics, so blatantly incompetent, whether or not the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Hotham, with his designs on a the shadow treasurership and eventually on the leadership of the opposition, is running dead. Is this all part of his grand plan to embarrass the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Deputy Leader of the OppoIf it is not, he is still achieving his Treasurer (Mr same objective. One of the hard things to accept is criticism of any member on this side, particularly the Treasurer in an international forum, by the former Mr Bean of foreign affairs, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, former Senator of Evans. If anybody should be accused of other letting down his country and committing diplomatic incidents, it is former Senator Who will ever forget his extraordinary gaffe 1992, as reported in a Hong Kong newspaper? He had a meeting with Chris Patten, for the Hong Kong Governor. Afterwards, he had whether this to say to journalists: but I The Govemor's totally preoccupiedwith the loss of the Governor's pet dog, the subject entered our conversation three times. far That is insulting enough-accusing Chris Patten of being concerned, in this bilateral meeting, only with discussing his lost dog. He The Governor's dog is probably a supreme They'll tum it into hors d oeuvres for Deng Xiaoping who I'm told eats four puppies a day. You want to know about shaming your country! That is a calculated insult of the leader of the People's Republic of China. Where was the apology then? Where was the criticism by his colleagues at that time? The list goes on and on. It is just extraordinary. It was all nicely summarised for us by a senior journalist, Don Woolford, on 14 June 1991, writing in the Canberra Times. He listed all the gaffes, mistakes, insults and errors of judgment by the member for Holt. I will just pick a couple of them. There is a whole list; I am happy for anybody to check it as a matter of record. In 1991 he created a diplomatic incident in South Africa when he leapt out of his car and tackled a South African security guard in Cape Town. I cannot use the language here or anywhere else, frankly, except perhaps down on the waterfront. He accused him of being 'something useless' because this security guard had committed some transgression-we never knew what it was. Perhaps it was similar to a problem he had when he visited Berlin in .1989 when he decided to detour to a monument on his way to the airport. He got caught in a traffic jam which threatened to make him miss his plane. He leapt out of his Mercedes, strode down to the vehicle carrying his staff, which was caught two cars behind, and roundly abused the uncomprehending German driver for not keeping up. The list goes on. He might like to advise the House what he said to a Pakistani television crew in 1990 when they asked him for a comment after he arri ved at Lahore airport-at the end, admittedly, of a long, hard day. There was similar sort of language, an obscenity and a blasphemous comment, to what he said to the South African guard. Former Senator Evans, as foreign minister, was no great representative of our nation. He did not represent the hopes and aspirations of our people. He had a foul, hair-triggered temper and time and again he created diplomatic incidents. Even his mistakes, his appalling judgments, which led to enormous strain with a number of countries, pale into insignificance beside the former Prime Minister's comment in late 1993 about Dr Mahathir, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, whom he called recalcitrant. Where was the member for Holt, the member for Hotham and the Leader of the Opposition at that time? That was a diplomatic incident which led to the loss of trade, so important to our future and the future of Malaysia in the region, and to an estrangement between our two countries. His performance on the international stage is something for us to be genuinely embarrassed about instead of this completely false charge against the Treasurer. Has anybody mentioned this to you out in the electorate in the last week or so as you have been wandering around? How out of touch does the Labor Party have to get before they finally wake up and realise what the concerns and expectations of the Australian people really are? They do not relate in any shape or form to the US bond rate. They relate to the issues we are tackling as a government on a day-today basis: economic growth, micro-economic reform, industrial relations reform and the like, all of which have been blocked in the Senate. We know that the shadow Treasurer has no credibility on these major issues, the issues that will determine the living standards and the way of life of all Australians. Two days before the budget on Meet the Press, on 18 August 1996, he said: What we should be targeting is balance in three years time not a massive surplus in two. Who is doing that? Who is reducing, eliminating, the budget deficit over three years as demanded by the shadow Treasurer? The government, of course. Who is frustrating us and blocking us in the Senate? To a large extent, the Labor Party. The day after the budget, the shadow Treasurer again repeated the gist of those remarks when he said on the Peter Couchman program on 3LO: The budget deficits were getting too big again, they had to be brought back, but that was a medium term task that we believed could have been accomplished with infinitely less pain over a three year period. He said this only 24 hours before the government had delivered its budget achieving exactly the target the shadow Treasurer was setting for his own side of politics and for the government of the day. What credibility does he have? No wonder there is a complete dearth of information from him about Labor's alternate economic policy. That is what you would expect from somebody with relevance deprivation syndrome. He has run up the white flag. Everybody knows it. His branches know it; they are being stacked. The member for Bruce knows it. The member for Hotham hopes it to be true and will encourage it in whatever way he can. He was a senior cabinet minister for 13 years and within weeks of going into opposition he caved in. So much for his commitment to the Labor cause. How does he explain his timidity, his failures to engage in public policy debate in this country to the grassroots, the rank and file of the Labor Party? They have been good to him-very good. He swanned all over the world on 120 to 150 overseas trips, whatever it was, on government business, of course. He owes the Labor Party, but he does not address their fundamental concerns, let alone their hopes and aspirations for the future. He comes into this place with trumped up charges against the Treasurer who was able to do in his first budget what no Treasurer since John Howard in the Fraser administration was able to do. For all the bluff, bluster, exaggeration and overblown rhetoric of the member for Hotham, the fact is that this is a nonsense censure motion moved so early in the life of the opposition as to render all following censure motions irrelevant and meaningless. This opposition are desperate. They completely bungled question time. They think they have a minister on the ropes. We come in expecting the Labor Party to show their full strength, their full political wit and have some idea of their strategic ambitions. Instead, we got meandering questions from a former senator who is still unable to reduce his questions to 50 words. We are still getting these one minute or 11/2-minute questions which are self-answering or even rhetorical. In any event, they are totally ineffective. It makes you laugh. I have been in this place since 1983. I have seen the giants of the Labor Party on the floor of this parliament and the Old Parliament House. What would Mick Young think of a censure motion of this kind? What degree of importance would he afford it? Mr Nairn-He would be embarrassed.",53
160,Mr MCGAURAN,TREASURER,"He would be embarrassed, as the member the Eden-Monaro says. It is a diversionary tactic because the member for Holt, who moved this censure motion, wants to increase taxes. He does not hint at it. He does not suggest it. He actually comes out and says it openly on the public record. Mr Reith-In black and white.",56
161,Mr MCGAURAN,TREASURER,"1t was a radio broadcast, but it was reproduced in black and white. This is what he said on 1 October on Melbourne commercial radio 3AW: If you are taking seriously the revenue problem, I think you've got to go a bit further than the business community had done and simply say that it's a matter of rearranging the existing taxes. Since we are so undertaxed by any relevant international standard, there is a case for having some overall revenue increases. He does not talk about tax reform; he talks about tax increases. Did he stay around to defend his position, to justify his claim for high taxes? No. He retreated to bed with the flu. Seventy-two hours later he had a miraculous recovery, did press conferences and was available to every journalist, every interviewer in this country. It is a new technique. Go to bed with the flu when you really stuff up. In that case, we will not see Gareth Evans again for the rest of this week because he will have to go to bed again.",56

NA Resolution of Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly",56
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EUTHANASIA LAWS LEGISLATION,I inform the House that Mr Speaker has received a copy of a resolution passed by the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory on 25 September 1996 relating to the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. The resolution is as follows: NA That this Assembly endorses the findings of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in relation to the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. NA Treasurer: Visit to United States of America,58
164,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"- Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The damage caused to Australia's international reputation and credibility with key decision-makers by the Treasurer's disclosure of sensitive financial information. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their placesMotion (by Mr Reith) agreed to: That the business of the day be called on. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders PAIRS Mr REITH (Flinders-Leader of the House) (5.53 p.m.)-I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the following arrangements applying in relation to the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 unless the House otherwise orders: (1) Order of the day No. 15, private Members' business, namely the motion for the second reading of the bill, being called on immediately prior to grievance debate on Monday, 28 October 1996, and debate continuing for 1 hour and 30 minutes; the mover of the motion for the second reading of the bill and the next 5 Members speaking each speaking for a period not exceeding 15 minutes and the debate then being adjourned; (2) at the conclusion of the proceedings on the bill in the House on Monday, 28 October 1996, the bill being referred to the Main Committee for the remainder of the second reading stage up to but not including the putting of any questions at the conclusion of the debate; (3) in speaking to the motion for the second reading of the bill in the Main Committee each Member speaking for a period not exceeding 10 minutes; (4) during consideration of the bill in the Main Committee the quorum of the committee being three Members comprising the occupant of the Chair and two other Members; and (5) the Main Committee continuing debate on the bill regardless of any unresolved questions. This is purely a procedural motion to facilitate debate on the euthanasia legislation of the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews). Mr Stephen Smith- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Paragraph (5) of the motion proposed by the Leader of the House is out of order. It is out of order because its effect is to override the capacity of one voice in the Main Committee to refer the bill back to the House. That attacks the fundamental basis on which the Main Committee was established-namely, that it would deal with non-controversial matters. Embedded in standing orders 270 and 276 is the fact that one voice is sufficient to send the matter back from the Main Committee to the House. The effect of paragraph (5) of the motion proposed by the Leader of the House destroys the basis on which the parliament established the Main Committee and changes fundamentally the nature of the Main Committee. If the House wishes or seeks to do that, it can only do so by way of substantive motion and changing the standing orders. If the Leader of the House wants to make a fundamental change to the basis upon which the Main Committee has been established, he needs to do so by coming into this House and, by way of substantive motion, effecting a change to the standing orders. He cannot, by way of seeking to establish this precedent by suspending standing orders, effectively establish a precedent which destroys the basis upon which this House established the Main Committee.",58
165,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"Mr Truss)Order! The honourable member cannot debate his point of order. Mr Stephen Smith-I am not debating it. Paragraph (5) is out of order, and I ask that you rule accordingly.",59
166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"I recognise the sincerity of the honourable member in raising this issue, and I recognise also the validity of some of the points he has made about the conventions observed in the Main Committee and its method of operations. However, I have to say that it is always open to the House itself to suspend the operation of a particular standing order and, subject to any constitutional limitations, to determine how particular matters are dealt with. This is not a matter for determination by the chair. The Leader of the House gave notice of the motion he has just moved, and it is now a matter for the House itself to determine whether it wishes to adopt the arrangement which the motion proposes. Debate interrupted. NA",59
167,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,DISSENT FROM RULING," Mr Deputy Speaker, with great reluctance, pursuant to standing order 100, I move: That the Deputy Speaker's ruling be dissented from.",59
168,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The motion is being prepared in writing.,59
169,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Deputy Speaker, pursuant to standing order 100, I have put my motion of dissent to your ruling in writing. I indicate in advance that the honourable member for Barton (Mr MCClelland), of counsel, proposes to second it. Mr Deputy Speaker, the fact that you gave me a considered ruling made me somewhat reluctant to move dissent from your ruling. I also make the point to the House that when I carefully considered raising this point of order and considered very carefully moving dissent from the chair's ruling, I took the opportunity of advising the Speaker of my proposed course of action so as to ensure that the chair would have an opportunity to give serious consideration to the fundamental point that I raised. I move dissent because it is clear that paragraph (5) of the motion moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) is out of order. Why is it out of order? It seeks to do, by way of suspension, that which the House can only do by changing its standing orders. The effect of paragraph (5) of the motion moved by the Leader of the House is to destroy the basis on which this House established the Main Committee. We will not find any precedence for this in Browning or Erskine May. Why? Because on this matter we are effectively the masters of our own destiny. A couple of years ago, in 1994, members of this House established the Main Committee for particular and limited purposes, quite clearly, on the basis of recommendations made expressly by the Procedure Committee which were clearly adopted by this House when it received the report and when it adopted the standing orders. If we are looking to the basis on which the House ought to consider my motion to dissent from your ruling, we need to look at what the House had in mind when it adopted the Main Committee. The first step in this process is the report of the Procedure Committee About time: bills, questions and working hours. At paragraphs 44 and 51, you find the intention of the Procedure Committee when it made its report to the House. Paragraph 44 stated: To avoid unproductive consideration of controversial bills in the Main Committee and to minimise time being taken up at the report stage in the House, the guiding principle for the selection of bills should be that only bills on which there is potential for agreement to be reached should be referred to the Main Committee. That is further reflected by paragraph 51 of the report which said: The additional legislative time would open up opportunities, in the House, for debate on and controversial items ... The clear intention of the Procedure Committee when it made its recommendations to the House-which were ultimately adopted and saw the establishment of the Main Committee-was that the Main Committee would deal with non-controversial matters. When the then member for Bonython and the now High Commissioner for London, Dr Blewett, presented the report to the parliament and referred, on 28 October, to the recommendations to establish the Main Committee, he said: . . . this recommendation would in effect establish two parallel and coincident streams of legislation. One would be in the main committee-for noncontroversial matters-and the other in the House, for more controversial bills. Speaking in the same debate, the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), who was a member of the Procedure Committee, on the same day said: I reject the proposition ... that it will become the place to which the government will shunt contentious legislation. The member for Watson, further in his contribution, said: The proposal that the government would shunt contentious legislation to that committee is groundless. The House so embraced that comment from the member for Watson that they immediately gave him an extension of time. When the then Prime Minister came to the House in February 1994 and presented the then government's suggested changes to the standing orders to effect the Main Committee, after the appropriate procedures had been gone through, the Procedure Committee doing a report and the presentation of the Procedure Committee report to the parliament, the then Prime Minister in presenting the report said in respect of the Main Committee: First, the handling of legislation-particularly the need to free up chamber time for the proposed consideration of legislation by providing a main committee, or second chamber, for handling routine and uncontroversial bills. The now Prime Minister, the member for fuller Bennelong (Mr Howard), who was then the the major Manager of Opposition Business, in his contribution on that debate said: A lot of people on both sides of this parliament have a great respect for this institution. Some are less enthusiastic about it, but a lot care about it a great deal. I am certainly one of those people ... He went on to say: I am genuinely worried about the decline in public esteem for the parliament. All of us share some of the blame for that. We take our share of the blame. The government must take its share of the blame. In respect of the Main Committee he went on to say: Our attitude is basically to give it a go. But to give what a go? To establish a subservient committee, the Main Committee, which would deal with non-controversial matters. How did the standing orders embed that principle? The standing orders embedded that principle by the first proviso, standing order 270, and then by standing order 276. Standing order 270, the first proviso, says: Provided that a bill or other order of the day may be returned to the House for consideration at any time during its consideration in the Main Committee by agreement to a motion which may be moved without notice by any Member (no seconder required) ""That further proceedings be conducted in the House"" which motion shall be determined without amendment or debate. Standing order 276 goes on to say: Every question in the Committee shall be decided on the voices and if any Member dissents from the result announced by the Chair, the question shall recorded in the minutes as unresolved. So what did the House have in mind when it established the Main Committee? The House had in mind a chamber that would deal with non-controversial matters, in which one voice--one member--could move the motion and, by the recording of that voice, have the matter sent back here. Why? It was because the parliament only ever intended that the Main Committee deal with matters that every member of this parliament regarded as non-contentious, that every member of this parliament conceded, agreed and thought it was appropriate to send to the Main Committee to debate and discuss it, to free up time in the House for other, generally controversial matters. In the report of the review that was conducted by the Procedure Committee, Time for review: bills, questions and working hours, presented in June 1995, the committee gave an analysis of the way the Main Committee had been working. At page 14, paragraph 4.4.5, the Procedure Committee said: The committee concurs with the Leader of the House the now Leader of the Oppositionwho commented that 'Clearly, (the Main Committee's) creation has enabled additional opportunities for Members to debate non-controversial legislation and to consider issues of concern to the '!I and their - onsti.tuents. The scheduling of busmess for conSideratIon by the Main Committee has been constructive and, consequently, a wide range of subjects have been raised and debated. In its subsequent paragraph the committee said: The committee does not propose any change to the standing orders to increase the range of business referred to the Main Committee. Why? It was because everyone believed that the Main Committee was acting and operating appropriately. The submission presented to the Procedure Committee by the then opposition manager of business, the now Leader of the House, did not even refer to the Main Committee, such was the general satisfaction with and acceptance of the basis upon which the Main Committee had been established. How was that process of dealing with nonbe controversial matters, items on which every member of this chamber agreed, embedded? It was embedded in the capacity of one voice, one member--one voice of conscience or one voice of dissent-to go to the Main Committee and refer the matter back here because a conscience view of a member of parliament dictated that it was not appropriate to be conducted in the Main Committee, as he or she took the view that it was a controversial matter. How does the motion by the Leader of the House by way of suspension seek to attack that? Paragraph (5) says: the Main Committee continuing debate on the Bill regardless of any unresolved questions. What is the sleight of hand? It is to override the clear and precise intent of the first proviso of standing order 270, combined with standing order 276. If you want to override, attack, destroy and undermine the entire basis upon which the Main Committee rests, if you want to destroy or seek to destroy the foundation upon which the Main Committee rests, you cannot come into this House in respect of one particular bill and try to do it by sleight of hand. If you want to do that you must come into this House and move a substantive motion by way of amendment to standing orders to change the basis upon which the Main Committee is constituted. If the House believes that this paragraph is not out of order then what can the Leader of the House come to this chamber tomorrow and seek to do in precisely the same way? We might discover that the convenience of the Leader of the House sees a motion to suspend standing orders to enable the Main Committee to continue meeting while a division of the House is in progress-substantially the same point. We could also have before the House, if the House does not agree with my motion to dissent from the chair's ruling, a motion way of suspension which would have the effect that the Main Committee could continue to meet when the House had adjourned. This is a fundamental attack on the basis upon which this House, in 1994, established the Main Committee. What does paragraph (5) of the motion moved by the Leader of the House seek to do? It seeks to destroy the bulwark that holds the Main Committee together. What bulwark holds the Main Committee together? One voice. If this House is not unanimous in its view that it is not appropriate for a matter to be dealt with in sideshow alley-the Main Committee-then one voice sends it back. If you want to attack the fundamental basis of the Main Committee established by this House, then you have to come into this House and move a change to the standing orders to have a substantive base. You cannot attack the fundamental basis of the Main Committee by a motion to suspend standing orders. Mr Deputy Speaker, with the greatest of respect to the chair, paragraph (5) is out of order because it overrides the capacity of one voice to refer a matter back from the Main Committee to the House. To accept that attacks the fundamental basis upon which the Main Committee was established, namely, to deal only with non-controversial matters. That is embedded in standing orders 270 and 276. The Leader of the House, by suspension, seeks to destroy the basis upon which the Main Committee is established. He wants to fundamentally change the nature of the Main Committee. You can do that only by substantive motion. Paragraph (5) of the motion moved by the Leader of the House is out of order. The House should consign paragraph (5) to where the Leader of the House proposes to consign the euthanasia debate, namely, the dust bowl. I urge the House to support my motion.",59
170,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,Is the motion seconded?,62
171,Mr MCCLELLAND,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Barton) (6.09 p.m.)I second the motion dissenting from your ruling in your formal position as Deputy Speaker. The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) raised a number of very valid points. by The proposed motion by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) proposes a fundamental variation to the structure and purpose of the Main Committee. With respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is our argument that it is for you to enforce the spirit and intention of the standing orders and not something to be left to a majority partisan vote that would occur. Hence, we say that you can rule the motion out of order. The fact of the matter is that section 1 of the constitution says: The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate and House of Representatives ... That is this House which we are in at this very time. It makes no mention at all of a main committee. The Main Committee was initially set up as an experiment by the House of Representatives to facilitate efficiencies in the way it undertook its business. But it was set up in very limited circumstances where there were matters of a non-controversial nature and that was the fundamental premise upon which it was based. The member for Perth referred to a number of extracts not only of speeches of Dr Blewett and the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) but other sources. I refer, for instance, to a speech delivered on 6 February 1994 by the then Prime Minister when foreshadowing the Procedure Committee report. He said: The procedure committee report dealt with three main areas: . first, the handling of legislation-particularly the need to free up chamber time for proposed consideration of legislation by providing a main committee or second chamber, for handling routine and uncontroversial bills. In no way could the euthanasia bill be regarded as routine and uncontroversial. We have all been inundated with correspondence indicating the intensity of debate in the community on that proposed legislation. It is perhaps one of the most controversial and intensely felt proposals that I have seen in this parliament not only in my very limited lifespan here but also from my immediate recollection. In addition, the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), the member for Swan at that stage, in presenting amendments to the standing orders, again stressed the fundamental premise when on 10 February 1994 he said in respect of the amendments regarding the Main Committee: make it as simple as possible, with a quorum effectively requiring in place only a chairperson, one government member and one non-government member. He noted that the use of that description was deliberate. I will say something about the quorum requirements presently. He also said: If the main committee is to work as envisaged by the Blewett committee and by the government, it ought to have before it legislation which is effecly tively non-controversial but which does require a bit of detailed attention from the House, in the spirit of bipartisan cooperation. Again, I trust there will be cooperation in the debate on the euthanasia legislation but that debate will be very intense. To continue to underline the significance of the point that I am making, in addition to those examples referred to by the member for Perth, I refer to comments by the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) when, on 10 February, he said: We are worried about the proposal for a main committee. This could mean a further reduction of the importance of the role of the House of Representatives in the government of this country. Unfortunately, despite assertions that the government is here to restore or foster representative democracy, its actions do not match its words. This is a classic example of where the government will be demeaning the significance of the House of Representatives, which we are all in now, that is connected to the Australian public by way of media networks and of course by virtue of the Australian public being able to come in here and sit in the galleries. The main chamber simply will not access the Australian public or, stated in reverse and more correctly, the Australian public will be shut out of this debate if it is referred to the Main Committee. I underline the point even further by referring to a comment made by the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when he was in opposition. He made the comment with respect to the Blewett committee proposals on a radio broadcast on 3 June 1994. With respect to the Main Committee, he said: My approach is very much trial and error, wait and see. We agreed in principle with a second Chamber; we are prepared to cooperate with the Government to try and make it work. If it does work, then that's good. If it does allow for more intense debate in the main Chamber, if it means that the major issues are debated in the main Chamber, if it results in a higher quality of debate in the main Chamber, that's better. The motion proposing to send the euthanasia bill to the Main Committee does precisely the opposite. It does not allow for the more intense debate in the main chamber. It literalis shunting the debate off. I, for one, have not as yet formulated my views as to how I will vote on the euthanasia legislation. I certainly want to pay very careful attention to that debate and it simply will not be possible if I have other matters to attend to here in the House of Representatives. These are matters which were considered quite clearly when the Main Committee was established through the standing orders. In addition to paragraph (5) of the motion, which was referred to by the member for Perth, clearly the thrust of what the government has in mind is also underlined by paragraph (4), which purports to amend the quorum requirements which are set out in standing order 272.",62
172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I remind the honourable member for Barton that he must confine his remarks to the ways in which he considers the Deputy Speaker's ruling is inappropriate, not the substance of the motion which may be considered later.",63
173,Mr MCCLELLAND,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Certainly. The Deputy Speaker's ruling is inappropriate because the motion purports not to suspend the standing orders but effectively to amend the standing orders, and that is something it cannot do. As the member for Perth said, that has to be done formally through the appropriate mechanisms and debate. For instance, standing order 272 provides that the quorum of the Main Committee is three-being the chair, one government member and one opposition member. Paragraph (4) of the motion seeks to, in a backdoor fashion, amend that by saying that the quorum is three, certainly, but of the chair and two members; there does not have to be an opposition member. Clearly the purpose of the original requirement would have enabled the opposition to, aside from relying upon standing orders 270 and 276, ensure the debate returned to the House; it could simply have abolished the quorum by leaving the Main Committee. That will no longer be possible as a result of graph (4) of the motion. As mentioned, this is in addition to what is being proposed in paragraph (5). The unworkability of paragraph (5) is clear on its face. The member for Perth indicated that there is a possibility that the Main Committee may continue to sit even when the House does not sit. On one argument, paragraph (5) would require that to occur, because it says that the Main Committee continues debate on the bill regardless of any unresolved questions. Arguably, that is a direction to the Main Committee to continue sitting whatever. In that context, it is again clearly contrary to the purpose of the standing orders and, for that reason, out of order. I refer, Mr Deputy Speaker, to standing order 274, which enables the chairman of the committee to suspend the committee to enable a member to attend a division. Paragraph (5) arguably would preclude that occurring, because it is a direction to continue rolling on ruling. in the Main Committee come what may. In standing order 282, if any sudden disorder arises in the Main Committee, the chair may on motion without notice by any member forthwith suspend the sitting and shall report the disorder to the House. Arguably, again, paragraph (5) of the motion deprives the chair of that opportunity or means of enforcing discipline because paragraph (5) can quite clearly be construed as being a direction to the Main Committee to continue the debate come what may. Indeed, one infers that is the intention of the motion, because the government does not want debate in the Main Committee interrupted as a result of any action by the opposition. So, for these reasons, the motion proposed by the manager of government business is out of order. In conclusion, much of the government of this country, as is the government of Great Britain and indeed other Westminster nations, is determined by convention. Once people, no matter what their office is, start to depart from those conventions, we start to get into very dangerous water. As was indicated in comments by the then opposition members, now government memparabers, they were very concerned that the establishment of the Main Committee might diminish both the standing of the House of Representatives and the substance of debate proceeding in the House of Representatives. That clearly is the convention which was developed in the establishment of the Main Committee, that convention being that the Main Committee is only to deal with uncontroversial matters which were referred to it with the consent of both parties. Indeed, as the member for Perth rightly pointed out, standing orders 270 and 276 ensure that to be the case. This motion, while it may appear expedient in terms of getting through some degree of workload-and I do not exaggerate the point-is very dangerous because it is a direct challenge to the fundamental rationale and convention behind the establishment of the Main Committee. For that reason, Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the dissent from your",63
174,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"The last speaker has canvassed a lot of the issues which obviously form part and parcel of the motion which is before the chair, in addition to the dissent matter. Can I therefore just attempt to sort of pick up the broad issues in response so that the government's purpose in this is quite clear. As I said in my opening remarks, it is a procedural motion to facilitate debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill proposed by the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews). It is, of course, entirely a matter for the parliament to order its own affairs to suit the circumstances as the parliament sees fit. For that reason, essentially, you have ruled as you have. The government, obviously, would support that and I thought that the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) effectively acknowledged that he took advice on the matter and he appreciated the advice that the Deputy Speaker would receive. I do not think thisMr Stephen Smith-I did not say that at all. That is not true. I said I am giving you the courtesy of letting you",64
175,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Sure. Mr Stephen Smith-Well, say it.",65
176,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I am happy to say that, when you moved the dissent motion, you appreciated that the matter had been very carefully analysed and, taking into account the points that you had made, the Deputy Speaker made the ruling that he did. Mr Deputy Speaker, although this is a private member's bill, the government is conscious of the strong interest that many members have in the bill. Regardless of the wide range of views for and against and otherwise in respect of this bill, there is no doubt that it is a matter of national importance and it does raise very difficult moral, social, political and constitutional issues. government, therefore, has made it clear that we are prepared to make available government business time to provide the opportunity for members to debate the bill. These are, of course, the budget sittings. Chamber debate time is at a premium, with first priority being given to the consideration of budget related bills. Even with the extra sittings associated with President Clinton's arrival in Australia, we are still very pressed for time. Nevertheless, the government by this motion will provide at least an hour and a half of chamber time for debate on the euthanasia bill. The intention is",65
177,Mr FILING,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: earlier you brought the attention of one of the other speakers to the fact that he ought to circumscribe his remarks to the dissent motion. I would urge you to enforce the same on the Leader of the House.",65
178,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Truss)Obviously, the debate does have to be confined to the nature of the Deputy Speaker's ruling. Those proposing dissent did stray somewhat and used the general terminology and the conventions as a part of their argument. It is probably reasonable, therefore, for the Leader of the House to respond to those matters. However, I do caution the Leader of the House to speak to the precise nature of the motion.",65
179,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I am happy to do that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I only broadened the matter out for the convenience of the House. I said that I was going to do so. I heard the previous speaker, the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland), talk about the media shutting people out, that it was not constitutional, and a range of other matters. I thought that, if we were to have a sensible debate about this, then I would not expect a point of order to be made. But if people want to play technical points of order, they are entitled to do so. I do not",65
180,Mr FILING,DISSENT FROM RULING,I am actually opposing the dissent.,65
181,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I appreciate that but, to properly canvass all the matters that have been raised in the dissent motion, I was trying The to do justice to the points that people have raised. The government does not see this as some party political point scoring exercise. We would like a reasoned debate; we would like to provideMr Latham-What do you see it as?",65
182,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"It is unfortunate that we have this sort of interjection because that is exactly the sort of party political point scoring that some peopleMr Latham-No, it's not.",65
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,Order! The Leader of the House should be heard in silence.,65
184,Mr KERR,DISSENT FROM RULING,It is simply a different view.,65
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,Order! There are far too many interjections.,65
186,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"In that vein, the fact is that this is a private member's bill. But the government, recognising the importance of debate in the national parliament, felt that should provide adequate time for people voice their point of view. But for this proexact cedural motion, the opportunities for members to speak would have been very limited, if non-existent. So it is not a question bers otherwise having opportunities to speak on this bill. The fact is that, unless we move a motion to provide people with an opportuniprivate ty to speak, they will not have that opportunievents, ty. Consistent with the public statements of Prime Minister (Mr Howard), it is such an important issue that we felt that there should be a reasonable process by which these matters could be canvassed. We have attempt the ed to discuss these matters with members from all sides of the chamber. We did have an agreement between the Government Whip and the Chief Opposition Whip that this would be Mr Lee-That is not true and you know is not true.",66
187,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"We did have an agreement. No, I am sorry: the fact of the matter is there was an agreement. Let me put it on the record. Then, as I understand it, the Labor Party decided that it would be conscience vote and, therefore, such a matter was irrelwould evant. Mr Lee- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order",66
188,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,This is not a point of order.,66
189,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Order! Is this a point of order in relation to procedure? Mr Lee-That is not true, and you know it is not true.",66
190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,That is not a government's point of order.,66
191,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,I have said these things before in the House. They have not been contested because it is the truth.,66
192,Unknown,DISSENT FROM RULING,Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8,66
193,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Prior to dinner I was responddoes ing to the motion of dissent moved by the in this chamber. member for Perth on your ruling as to whether or not you can put the motion which stands the in my name on the Notice Paper. In doing so, we I have attempted to reasonably canvass the to issues without straying too much from the and defined matter in the substance of the dissent. I have also been aware that some not of the previous speakers have canvassed the of memissues a bit more generally. The point I was making was that this is a member's bill. In the normal course of the opportunities for members to debate a private member's bill are very limited indeed. Under those circumstances, the and given that this is a matter of national debate and interest to many people, the government felt that it was appropriate that there be time provided for any member to speak on issue. To facilitate giving members this opportunity to speak, the government's proposal is that the matters be first discussed and debated in the chamber for an hour and a half with three speakers a side. From the government side there would be essentially the it mover of the motion, a second member who would presumably speak against the motion and the third member being the member for that Northern Territory (Mr Dondas), having a specific interest on behalf of his constituency. Likewise we would expect the opposition to be able to put together three speakers who canvass the issue. The issue would then be referred to the Main Committee. We understand that something like 45 members have indicated their intention to speak. I dare say that, as the debate is undertaken, there may well be more who wish to speak. The government in this budget session has a series of legislative proposals for which it has a mandate from the Australian people. We have tried to essentially compromise the legislative program with the right of members to speak on this issue. There has been a lot of airing of views about the Main Committee, and I refer specifically to the fifth part of my procedural motion. Those views have suggested that, being the second chamber, only secondary bills are dealt with p.m. there and that debate in the Main Committee not enjoy the same visibility as debate The Main Committee has come a long way since its inception under the previous government in 1994. There has been bipartisan cooperation in maximising the benefits of the second chamber in a sensible, constructive manner. Very important bills are dealt with in the Main Committee, including the annual appropriation bills which were first referred to the Main Committee in 1995 under the former Labor government. Indeed, the appropriation bills for 1996-97 are at the present time being considered in the Main Committee, allowing the many members who wish to speak the full opportunity to do so. Honourable members would appreciate that, from the government's point of view, the first coalition budget in 13 years is a rather significant issue.",66
194,Mr KERR,DISSENT FROM RULING,We have given you the courtesy of allowing that to occur.,67
195,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"And so you should have provided that opportunity, as we provided you the same opportunity in 1994. Proceedings in the Main Committee are recorded in Hansard. There is no question about their being visible. There is provision in the Main Committee room for attendance by the public, and we have television monitoring which ensures that members can keep a track of proceedings there. This procedural motion will allow the government to program the debate subject to the demands of its legislative program. Let us not lose sight of the reality that it is a private member's bill, which, under normal circumstances, could not expect to receive an airing such as is proposed by this motion. Moreover, the private member's business selection committee did not allocate any time for the second reading debate on the euthanasia bill, and accordingly without the passage of this motion the bill would not be debated at all. Accordingly, this motion facilitates rather than restricts debate on the bill. Mr Stephen Smith- Mr Deputy Speaker, I have been imbued with a generosity of spirit immediately after dinner, but the Leader of the House is reading his speech to his motion. He has not touched upon the dissent motion since we resumed. He says other speakers prior to him swayed from the dissent motion. That was not the case-and I moved it-in my own respect. I suggest that, as the defender of your ruling, he speak to the motion.",67
196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Truss)The point of order is valid. There is a requirement to speak to the dissent. I have allowed some latitude, but obviously that latitude has to be limited somewhat.",67
197,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I appreciate that, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I think what I am saying is entirely relevant because the intent of the mover of the motion of dissent is that these matters should all be in the chamber. Our response is not only to deal with the technical issues that he has raised but also to respond to the policy issues that he has raised. I make the point that this is providing people with an opportunity to be heard that they would not otherwise have had. It is private member's business, not government business. We are not restricting debate. We are allowing debate. We are providing for debate. The Prime Minister made it very clear in his public statements that, on an issue of national importance, raising the very grave issues that this legislation does, members are entitled, and the public at large would expect the parliament, to address the issues regardless of the differing points of view that people may have. We did encourage the proponent of the bill to seek agreement and there was some agreement. That agreement is not now forthcoming and, under those circumstances, the government has taken the view that to discharge its obligations and the commitments it gave it was necessary to set up a procedural motion to protect the right of members to so speak. That is simply all that we are doing. We are providing 10 minutes per speaker. Again, that was discussed at the time with the opposition members. It is consistent with the time provided generally for second reading debate of private members' bills during private members business time. The motion also varies the quorum arrangements for debate on the bill to require the presence of the chair and two members and, in so doing, it drops the normal requirement for one government member and one nongovernment member to be part of a quorum. This is a temporary measure simply reflecting the fact that the major parties have agreed to their members having a conscience vote and that it is not a government bill. Mr Stephen Smith-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I do not wish to be in any way overcritical or to appear churlish but, despite your upholding my previous point of order that the Leader of the House was not in any way speaking to the dissent motion, he has proceeded to continue to read the notes of his speech for the motion itself. . Mr D-PUTY SPEAKER-Certainly, there IS a reqUIrement, as I said earlier, to speak on the nature of the dissent. I understand that the leader of government business is concluding his remarks.",67
198,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I am, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I have attempted to fully respond to all of the issues that have been raised. I do not intend re-entering the debate upon the completion of this dissent matter but I thought it was important to have a sensible, reasoned, considered and tempered discussion and that the government's position generally should be on the record. (Time expired)",68
199,Mr FILING,DISSENT FROM RULING,"-I merely want to oppose the dissent motion on the basis that, quite clearly, standing order 399 has the following provision: In cases of necessity, any standing or sessional ord-r or orders of the House may be suspended, on motIon, duly moved and seconded, without notice: Pro.vi-ed that such motion is carried by an absolute maJonty of Members having full voting rights. The Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has moved: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the following arrangements applying in relation to the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 ... In summary, that is the nub of the argument against the dissent motion. Quite clearly, you have acted rightly in ruling that this motion is in order. It cannot be out of order as it complies with standing order 399. Mr MCClelland-Where's the necessity?",68
200,Mr FILING,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Necessity is obviously a matter of opinion of the House. The House is supreme in making judgments about its own bus-ness. In the final analysis I will speak against the motion when it is available. I raised a point of order in the leader's speech because I wanted him to canvass the issues that would rebut the arguments of the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) that supported the dissent motion against the Deputy Speaker's ruling. In my view, there was no substantive evidence or argument in favour of that. In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, quite cle-rly you have acted correctly and your rulmg on this matter is in order. Motion (by Mr Reith) put: That the question be now put.",68
201,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Truss)Before I accept that motion, I wonder whether the House would give me leave as the person who made the ruling to comment on my reasons for making that ruling. Obviously, the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the honourable member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) have commented very eloquently about the conventions associated with the operations of the Main Committee. It is widely regarded in this House that it has worked successfully for the benefit of the debate in this chamber. However, that is not the issue at the core of my ruling. The question is whether or not it is competent for this House to seek to suspend the standing orders which this House itself put in place for the operation of that committee. It would seem to me that standing orders 399 to 401 make it abundantly clear that the House does have the capacity to amend or suspend its standing orders for the operation of that House if it chooses to do so. Whether or not that is wise is a matter for debate by the House, but my ruling is that it is competent for the House to decide whether or not it wishes to suspend standing orders. Tha- is the reason I have made that ruling. Havmg made that comment, I will accept the motion of the Leader of the House. The question is that the question be now put. The House divided.

202,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Mr Truss)The Leader of the House has moved the motion relating to the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996 in the terms in which it appears on the Notice Paper. The question is that the motion be agreed to. I call the honourable member for Denison.,70
203,Mr KERR,BUSINESS,"There has been no more dishonourable assault than this on the integrity and processes of this House in the nine years in which I have been a member, and I suspect in the memories of all members of this House. Let me say to members that not only do we believe that this would have been an offence against the standing orders-a matter which has been resolved by the vote-but also, in my mind, NOES there is a very significant constitutional question of whether the processes that are proposed for adoption will take this matter beyond the legitimate capacity of this parliament to legislate. Section 40 of the constitution of Australia provides that questions arising in this House shall be determined by a majority of votes. The process that has been proposed by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) is that the Main Committee debate shall continue regardless of any unresolved questions. That means that in that place, which purports to be this parliament in action, there will be no votes. A parliament which has no votes is not a democracy. It is not a parliament under this constitution. So we have a full frontal attack on one of the fundamental tenets that this House is obliged to uphold by the prime law of this country-the constitution of Australia. The dignity and respect of members is so undermined that I believe that each and every PAIRS member of this House ought regard this with abhorrence. We have heard some people suggest that this is a convenient way of dealing with a controversial measure. What absolute nonsense! This is one of the most significant and controversial measures ever put before the parliament. What about the attempt to make a distinction in this debate between matters that are brought forward by private members and by government? Orders We have the government saying that they will give priority in this parliament to their legislative program and, because this is merely a private member's matter, it will be shoved into a back room with no attention, with a quorum that has been reduced to three to hear debate on one of the most contentious bills that has ever been before this parliament. It is not unique that private members bring in controversial bills. MCKenzie-Lamb brought in the Family Law Bill. That private member's bill again divided members not on any basis of party line. That debate was had in the House and in the Senate. It was not shoved off to some room where the people of Australia are excluded. Most importantly, it was not put off to an environment where the concerns and wishes of members participating in a debate count for nought. If it is lawful for this parliament to suspend the right to vote in a parliamentary debate, it is lawful in this parliament by a simple majority, through a government member, to exclude any debate on any issue of substance. What more contemptible process could emerge? The second chamber was established in such a way as to make sure the power of this House was not removed. There can be discussion in that chamber, but whenever a controversial matter arises it must be brought back to this House so the House can vote on it. That is to be overturned. This parliament has had plenty of opportunities in the past to debate controversial matters brought forward by private members. What is this case of necessity that is to be made out? Is there any urgency facing the government's business? Let us look realisticaIly at the government's legislative program in the Senate. The Senate has before it some 61 packages of legislation which the government seeks to give priority to. There are 25 budget and 36 non-budget related measures. Even with the cooperation which has been extended by the opposition in an unprecedented waythat is, aIlowing two extra weeks of debate in the Senate-and forgoing all the rules that the previous opposition insisted upon in relation to allowing debate in the same session of parliament, there is no realistic prospect of these measures coming before the parliament. Would that chamber treat its members with the same contempt that the Leader of the House is proposing to treat members of this House with-that is, to suggest that members of that chamber would not be heard by their colleagues in this debate? This is one of those rare debates in Australian political history where I believe at least a substantial number of members of this parliament would be interested in following the debate. Most of the debates in this place are set piece debates. We know the outcomes. The government proposes legislation and its members are bound by a caucus. The Labor Party also binds its members by a caucus. The outcomes of those debates are predetermined. With the difference in numbers between the parties, the Independents will have no significance in terms of the outcome. There may be an element of theatre in the debate, but for practical purposes we know the outcome before the debate starts. That is not the case with this legislation. I have no idea how this debate will emerge and who will vote for what position. I believe there are a number of members-and I have spoken to a number of them myself-who are waiting to see how this debate emerges before they determine their views. How can they do that in this situation? This afternoon I went to the Main Committee during the censure debate in this chamber. In cooperation with the government we permitted debate on the appropriation biIls to move to that place. We did that for the convenience of the government. Not one member objected to that. The quorum for that chamber is three. When I was in that chamber there was not a quorum. There was no government member there. They adjourned for 10 minutes and then I had the respectable audience of three. The whole focus of that chamber is, as every member knows, to euthanase debates, to bury debates, to put them into the darkest recesses. Why can you do that? You can do that because it is convenient for the House. Not one member dissents from that idea. The second chamber was introduced in a climate of some concern for the then opposition. The then opposition said that we must be wary lest this be abused. What an irony that the abuse has been brought on by the Leader of the House. What an irony it is that the opposition has all owed its members a conscience vote not only on the substance of the matter but also on all matters associated with it-procedural and otherwise. It is ironic that the government still insists on holding a caucus over its members when it seeks to rort this institution and undermine the fabric and foundation of this institution. How can it be that I can listen to important contributions? I wait with great interest not so much to hear what the zealots who will take the first four or five speeches on either side have to say but to hear the people who are actually grappling with these issues and to find out how they will debate and think through these complex issues. I wait with great interest, for example, to hear the contribution of my colleague the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) who I believe will have some interesting reflections. I wait with some interest to hear what the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) will say in this debate with his experience of the parliamentary process. I wait with great interest to hear how some of the newly elected members reflect on these matters. For my own part, I say frankly to you that, although I come into this debate with a pretty clear idea of how I am going to vote, I am not so arrogant as to say that I might not be influenced by the course of a debate where people are free to speak their minds. But how will I hear that; how will I know that; how will there be any colour to this debate; and how will it matter to the Australian people? This is a matter which both sides regard and recognise as being of fundamental importance. It is truly a matter of life and death. What are we seeing? We are seeing debates on the flags bill and other trivial matters, which are of no significance in the national interest, being proceeded with in a farcical way in the House while this contentious and controversial bill is removed from the spotlight of public attention. This will take away the capacity for members to play a responsible part in parliamentary debate, to listen to what their colleagues say and to take part in one of the few debates that will actually be conducted seriously and in which every member will be examining their conscience, making decisions on and speaking according to their hearts. The one issue on which the Australian people wish to see their members responsibly living up to the charter that they have imposed on them by giving them their trust as members of this parliament is going to be shunted off and subsumed in an environment where there is no adequate reporting of those debates and where the normal coverage of this House simply is not available. This offends against every convention. It is not true to say that those of us on the opposition side, who share my opinion that this is a contemptible way to deal with the parliament, have stood idly by-there is no whip on this-and made no practical suggestions. We have offered our willingness to participate in an extension of the sitting times of this parliament even though, if this legislation were to pass this House, it would come into a situation where the government has made no arrangements for time in the Senate anyway. The sponsors of this legislation must now know-my having referred to this nowthat there is at least more than an arguable case that, even if this legislation passes, it is subject to constitutional challenge. That is not a light matter. It is referred to in the House of Representatives Practice, and section 40 of the constitution is plain on its face. There have been issues previously in which this has been debated but they have never been material in a way which could be litigated. Here now is a matter which will be capable of litigation. Here now is the case where, even if the Andrews bill does get through, it will be capable of challenge by the Northern Territory government. Those people on that side who are lining up to say that they are interested in a conscientious vote on conscientious grounds but who are supporting this repellent abuse-this precedent-that diminishes the rights of individual members of parliament are going to find themselves actually diminishing their capacity and putting at risk the very legislation they are sponsoring. I am appalled by this and believe that it is one of the most fundamental abuses that has occurred. As an individual member of this parliament, I have always taken a great sense of responsibility for my contributions-good or bad. However, because I am not one of the principal protagonists in this debate, I will participate in it in the secrecy and the confines of the Main Committee room, in an environment where those matters are not subject to vote and where democracy has been excluded. I regard it as contemptible. My colleague, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), who holds a different vie..y on the substance and merits of the Andrews bill, is equally outraged. He will be moving an amendment which reflects our willingness to give time to debate in this House, recognising the importance and moral weight that the Leader of the House has said is attached this legislation. When we address matters moral weight, it is not a matter of whether is government business or private members business, it is the substance and weight legislation that counts; that is, whether controversial and whether the precedent is an work. abuse of the principles that this House should uphold.",70
204,Mrs SULLIVAN,BUSINESS,"Moncrieff) (8.50 p.m.)I would not rush to enter this debate except I think it is necessary that a few words be said in response to the previous contribution, lest some new members of parliament think that what the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) said is fact, and lest any member of the public, who might have been listening debate or indeed might read it in the Hansard, might also think that it was fact. As a member of the committee which brought in the report that recommended the introduction of the Main Committee, I claim some expertise on the subject.",73
205,Mr FILING,BUSINESS,"I well remember the debate, Kathy.",73
206,Mrs SULLIVAN,BUSINESS,"I was co-author member for Moore (Mr Filing) of a dissenting report in which we indicated some fears about the Main Committee. However, I have said more than once since then that I was wrong. I believe the Main Committee has proven itself very well. My reaction to much of the substance of speech by the member for Denison was that he must never have been in the mittee. I am reminded that he went up this afternoon. The member for Denison was horrified to find that you have to have a quorum of three in the Main Committee. In fact, the Main Committee is one step ahead of this chamber in that sense, because if there is not a quorum of three in the Main Committee and if that quorum does not include at least one government member and one oppogetsition member then it is automatically suspended. There have been occasions when I blush to admit there may not have been three people in this chamber-certainly, if there were three, then not one government and one run. to OpposItIOn member-and there is no such of automatic suspension. The quorum requireit ment ensures that the Main Committee is not some backroom and that it cannot be run by of that the government without the opposition's it is knowledge and active presence to make it Mr Latham-How can you support this motion?",73
207,Mrs SULLIVAN,BUSINESS,"I am no shrinking violet when it comes to speaking in here, but we did listen to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Denison, in silence. The issues are real, and I think for once the member for Werriwa might be able to sit with his mouth shut for 10 minutes and listen. I am coming to this to the point that he raised. The issues that have been raised by the member for Denison would be serious were they true. He has made some very serious allegations. He said that, if we proceed according to the motion moved by the Leader of the House, this parliament is not a democracy. He said that things are being shoved off into a backroom, into the secrecy and conwith the fines of the Main Committee.",73
208,Mr FILING,BUSINESS,That's what you and I said.,73
209,Mrs SULLIVAN,BUSINESS,"That is what we feared. The member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay)-we were told by the member for Denison that he is not acting as a whip on this issue; I am not surprised, because he the would have to disown everything the member for Denison said-assured us that would not Main Comhappen, and it has not. For the benefit of the member for Denison-I think everybody else in this parliament must be aware of this-the Main Committee is broadcast within this parliament with exactly the same status as the House of Representatives chamber. They are equal in status. Tum to channel 5 or 6 and you will Mr Latham-That's not status-a broadcast!",73
210,Mr KERR,BUSINESS,What an appalling thing to say. I can see where you're going. I'm going to see what sort of parliament you're going to,73
211,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Mr Truss)Order! The honourable member for Denison!,74
212,Mrs SULLIVAN,BUSINESS,"They are available to any member. They are broadcast on the television. There is a full Hansard of the Main Committee. It is open to the public. The Main Committee is open to members to listen, either in person or on the internal broadcast.",74
213,Mr KERR,BUSINESS,"Oh, what rubbish!",74
214,Mrs SULLIVAN,BUSINESS,"For members of the Labor Party to suggest that if something is not available on radio that means it is not a democracy, why don't they look in the Mr Latham-Where's the radio in here? Where's the big screen? Where's the TV here?",74
215,Mrs SULLIVAN,BUSINESS,"Come to my electorate and you will not hear parliament on the radio. There is not a single constituent, outside people in capital cities, who can hear parliament broadcast-thanks to the Labor Party. You took it off the ABC; you took it off the full broadcast. Mr Latham-If you're in this House you can't hear what's happening in the Main Committee.",74
216,Mrs SULLIVAN,BUSINESS,"Do not complain about the Main Committee not being available on radio. For a lot of people in Australia, nothing from parliament is available on radio. I remind the House that the member for Denison did not raise that point. He did not have the galI to raise that point in the course of his own speech. It was only raised by that other disruptive fellow who, it appears, cannot sit quiet for five minutes. I admit that there are some important issues at stake, but I want to assure anybody who might have believed the nonsense that the member for Denison spoke about that it is just not fact. He made the statement that 'a parliament which has no votes is not a democracy'. We will vote on the bill. We will vote on it in here, which is where he wants the vote to happen. There are a couple of reasons-some of them were in the About Time report of the Procedure Committee-why votes are not taken in the Main Committee. If the two chambers were functioning-giving the additional time for debate that backbenchers want-and both could have divisions, we would run the risk of divisions happening in both chambers at the same time. That is the first reason. If we are going to have two debating chambers, then it is an insurance that the vote can happen in only one of the chambers, and it is in this chamber-the chamber that the member for Denison was so hot and strong about. The reason that this motion is framed so that other divisions cannot be raised up in the Main Committee is to give people full opportunity to debate the bill. It is to facilitate the bill. It is so that people cannot wantonly and mischievously keep on aborting the debate up in the Main Committee. There were good reasons for putting into the initial standing orders what went in in relation to the Main Committee. We have had a bit of experience of the Main Committee since then, and not as much goodwill has reigned at alI times as we might have hoped. On the whole, it has been fairly successful.",74
217,Mr FILING,BUSINESS,Not recently.,74
218,Mrs SULLIVAN,BUSINESS,"However, it is possible, if a member is sufficiently bloody-minded, to put it off the rails. I will admit that to the member for Moore. If somebody's pride is at stake because the matter they want to speak on is not being debated in here-this great empty cavernous place versus a smaller chamber",74
219,Mr FILING,BUSINESS,A more intimate chamber.,74
220,Mrs SULLIV AN,BUSINESS,"The more intimate chamber. I feel sorry for those people. However, the thing that really sticks in my neck is to have Labor members, particularly former ministers, getting up and saying how important it is for people to be in here to speak.",74
221,Mr KERR,BUSINESS,We are not speaking as Labor members. I'm speaking as a member of this parliament on a free voting issue.,74
222,Mrs SULLIVAN,BUSINESS,"I am going to remin9 you of what you did as a minister. I am very pleased to see the member for Fadden, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr JulI), at the table. For the benefit of those who were not members of parliament under the Labor government, I have to tell you that if it had been a Labor minister at the table tonight this is something you would have taken a photograph of and kept for your grandkids.",74
223,Mr FILING,BUSINESS,What's that?,75
224,Mrs SULLIVAN,BUSINESS,The rarity of having a minister at the table.,75
225,Mr KERR,BUSINESS,What's that got to do with this debate? You've been here too long.,75
226,Mrs SULLIVAN,BUSINESS,"What I am saying is that you, as a former minister, were not in here when there were debates even on your bills. You did not introduce your own bills; you had parliamentary secretaries read them into the record.",75
227,Mr KERR,BUSINESS,"That's exactly the point I'm making. Let's have one important debate here, where people actually haven't got predetermined outcomes.",75
228,Mrs SULLIVAN,BUSINESS,"Oh, I see! Opposition has been the Labor Party's road to Damascus. They are converts to people being present in the House of Representatives chamber now. I will say this for the member for Denison: when he was the Minister for Justice, he turned up once in the Main Committee to reply to a debate on a matter that concerned him. I do not remember him doing it here. The reason I remember him doing it in the Main Committee is that it was such a rarity for a Labor minister to do that. Nobody from that side of parliament can get up here tonight and say that we have a trammelling of democracy because debates are being moved off, not to some alleged secrecy and confines of the Main Committee room but to a fully public chamber, as much on the record--every syllable and every minute of it-as anything that is debated in this chamber. In all cases, controversial matters come back here for resolution. There are a few bills that are going to come into the parliament this week. We already have a number of budget bills to debate. We also have the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill. That is on the Notice Paper and will be debated here. We have social security legislation, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill, the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill, the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill, the CFM Sale Bill, the Statute Law Revision Bill, the Native Title Amendment Bill, the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill, the Family Law Amendment Bill, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996-97 Budget Measures) Bill, the Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill, the Income Tax Assessment Bill, the Income Tax (Consequential Amendments) Bill, the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Bill, the Flags Amendment Bill, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) and the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Amendment Bill. They are the bills that are on the Notice Paper now. The member for Denison picks out one, the Flags Bill, and refers to it with derision. We will remind the member for Denison what he said tonight about the Flags Amendment Bill when we are debating that bill. We will remind him of his derisory attitude tonight towards that bill. The simple fact is that the budget and the government's legislation must go through this chamber in good time, this session. A large amount of it must be dealt with also by the Senate in good time. That is the government program. We are talking about the precedence that is being given to a private member's bill and whether its debate should be in this chamber. The government has the House of Representatives sitting for an extra week, over and above the program we already had, to enable us to get through the budget session legislation. The government is the government; it is going to get its legislative program throughand it must, logically, give precedence to its o,wn program over a private member's bill. But it is not shuffling the private member's bill out of sight. It is not saying, 'We won't give it time.' There would be no sittings of the Main Committee to debate this bill if the government did not want the Main Committee to sit to debate it. The government is making provision to enable us to have all of those debates, including what would normally have the lowest precedence, that is, a private member's bill.",75
229,Mr KERR,BUSINESS,That is not true. The MCKenzieLamb bills were given priority. The government can give priority any time it wants.,76
230,Mrs SULLIVAN,BUSINESS,"I cannot at this stage of the debate, when I have only two minutes left-and I was around when the MCKenzieLamb bills were in this parliament-run through the facts of how that got any time",76
231,Mr KERR,BUSINESS,I move that the honourable member be granted an extension of time.,76
232,Mrs SULLIVAN,BUSINESS,I haven't finished my allotted time yet.,76
233,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,You cannot move an extension until time has expired.,76
234,Mrs SULLIVAN,BUSINESS,"Welcome to the standing orders of the House of Representatives. If you did a comparison of the amount of legislation before parliament and the number of members of parliament then, you would get an indication of how those bills got debating time. Not only that, you should also do a comparison-if you are going to start comparing our parliament with parliaments of 20 years ago-of the use of the guillotine. The big argument in favour of the Main Committee was that we hoped it would do away with the need to use the guillotine, so that members could get to debate all the bills they wanted to and have the due amount of time. There are still times when the program comes under pressure at the end of the session where we may voluntarily agree to reduce the length of our speeches from, let us say, the 20 Grace, E. 1. minutes we are entitled to under the standing orders to approximately 10 minutes. These things are done by agreement. But the fact is that if you go back and look at how many bills were guillotined under the previous government, particularly in previous parliamentsMr Leo MCLeay-In the last three years? In the previous parliament-none.",76
235,Mrs SULLIVAN,BUSINESS,"I will give the member for Watson due credit for his idea. The Main Committee enabled us to avoid guillotines in the last parliament. That is the point I am making. If we had not had the Main Committee operating, we would have had what we had in previous parliaments; that is, a great raft of bills guillotined through this chamber. That was an abrogation of the democratic process and our democratic responsibilities. So to talk about the Main Committee as if it is some Star Chamber, in a little cupboard off somewhere-and someone has to give you a map to find it; and you have to have been here for 10 years before someone will trust you with the map; and the lights are turned off the whole time-is just nonsense.

NA (F AMIL Y TAX INITIATIVE) BILL 1996 Cognate bill: FAMILY (TAX INITIATIVE) BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 September, on motion by Mr Costello: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Gareth Evans moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (I) notes that only a limited proportion of family types receive the full benefits of the so-called Family Tax Initiative; (2) expresses its concerns that other Budget measures leave the average Australian family substantially worse off; (3) notes with concern that the Government is only returning to PA YE taxpayers a small proportion of bracket creep/fiscal drag revenue collections via this Bill; and (4) expresses its concern that this and other Budget-related measures have established very high Effective Marginal Tax Rates for nonworking parents returning to the workforce"".",76
236,Mr BILSON,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"The fairness of the coalition government's family tax initiative was brought home in today's release of a report from Gillian Beer of the its University of Canberra's National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling. I referred to the centre's director, Ann Harding, in my earlier contribution, reflecting on the concluthe sions of some of her earlier work that families were far more vulnerable under the previous Labor government and that a far greater proportion of families were ending up in poverty statistics. The centre's Ms Beer found that lower income families will gain the highest percentage increases in income and most of the benefits from the family tax initiative, with 40 per cent of the benefits going to families in the bottom 30 per cent of the family income distribution. In other words, the coalition's 'cash for kids' measure favours the families in 'Dunkley by the bay' who need it most. Ms Beer points out that well over half of the $1 billion worth of spending on the family tax initiative will be received by families with taxable incomes of less than $38,700 a year. A majority of families in 'Dunkley by the bay' earn below this figure. (Quorum formed) Clearly the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) is a little upset about how apparently good this family tax measure is for average families in Australia and he does not like to hear about it. So I will just commend to him the report from the University of Canberra. Perhaps it is very good reading for the member for Isaacs. I guess the interesting contrast is how we are making solid ground on improving the tax situation for Dunkley's families while those opposite are slipping and sliding around. It is clear from what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said today that half of Labor's front-bench either have a favourite new tax or a tax they would like to increase. The interesting contrast is that the coalition is helping families in Dunkley while Labor still thinks it knows best how to spend the income that is available to Dunkley's families. Ms Beer's report concludes: It is estimated that almost 71 per cent of all eligible families will benefit from the implementation of the family tax initiative. This family tax initiative means good news for Dunkley and I commend it to the House. I particularly commend the report to the member for Isaacs. (Time expired)",79
237,Mr WILTON,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Far from what the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) would have us believe, what we are dealing with tonight-(Quorum formed) Mr Slipper, who called the quorum, must be somewhat confused, given that he was formerly with the National Party and is now with the Liberal Party. One wonders which party he is trying to hurt the most. Mr Lindsay-I raise a point of order. A member must refer to another member by his electorate.",80
238,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,That's true. I ask the honourable member to abide by that standing order.,80
239,Mr WILTON,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"The government today have been trumpeting the fact that the two opposition. family tax initiative bills before the House underpin their initiatives to assist the lot the Australian family. Of course, the coalition made great play during the election campaign of the wondrous things they would do for the family, including the families of Dunkley, of course those in the neighbouring electorate of Isaacs. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) explained in his second reading speech, these bills will-according to him-give effect to the centrepiece of the government's election commitment to Australian families, that being the so-called family tax initiative. I am sure the Treasurer deliberately used the word 'centrepiece' because there are a other initiatives affecting families which spring from the government's budget for 1996-97 which the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) would rather that and the Australian populous at large did not focus on, which goes to prove, as I am sure any magician will tell you, that this is nothing more than a great conjuring trick, a great magic trick, shamelessly perpetrated upon the Australian electorate. As we address the bills this evening, in which the government appears to be giving something to Australian families with one hand, the debate on this year's appropriation bills in the Main Committee clearly demonstrates that it is taking away from Australian families with the other hand, with some glee. I quote from the Treasurer's second reading speech: The government recognises that providing an economic and social environment in which families can achieve their full potential is crucial to maintaining a strong, cohesive and compassionate society. Further, he said: Providing financial assistance to those families with the greatest need is an investment in that economic and social environment. I am sure those are fine sentiments-there is a lot of glib rhetoric such as we heard today from the Treasurer in question time-and I assure the House that whenever the government genuinely seeks to improve the lot of the Australian family it will always receive the wholehearted support of the These bills propose measures to recognise of the cost of raising dependent children through the income tax system. But many of my colleagues who have spoken today have pointed out in some detail that only a very and small proportion of Australian families will benefit at all from the measures which the government proposes. There are many deserving families and hard working Australian families who live in areas such as Frankston North in Dunkley who will miss out on any so-called family tax initiatives altogether. As the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) so lucidly pointed out earlier in his contribufew tion to this debate, when closer scrutiny is paid to the figures in this year's budget, it becomes clear that the $147 million allocated for the family tax initiative is far more than we offset by the massive increase in general taxation revenue for that financial year. Of course, individuals will pay some $5.5 billion more in tax in this financial year, of which $1.8 billion can be attributed to bracket creep-meaning that for every dollar received by the government through the family tax initiative almost $13 is removed through that insidious process called bracket creep. This is yet another of the government's nifty conjuring tricks. This side of the House has always been happy to support any measures under which families are better off, but the measures that are outlined in this document cannot be considered in isolation. The Treasurer also said in his second reading speech: The family tax initiative is a clear example government's commitment to giving families greater choiceI emphasise those words 'greater choice'in how they spend their hard-earned cashand I also emphasise those words 'hardearned cash'and in how they juggle work and family responsibilities. He went on to say: Each family is the best judge of what it needs, and the government's program of reforms reflects that approach. When you consider that amongst the government's program of reforms which the Treasurer referred to are increases in HECS fees, an increase in charges for pharmaceuticals, the downgrading of the public health system, reduction of funding for legal aid, the scrapping of most labour market programs, cuts to child care and, in particular, the abolition of a large part of the dental health program, which had such a significant impact upon working men and women in Dunkley, only then can you begin to understand exactly what the Treasurer meant when he referred to giving families greater choice. That is what he said: he referred to giving families 'greater choice in how they spend their hard-earned cash'. The Treasurer referred to choices for Australian families, but the choice is to pay more for a whole range of basic services or to go without. That is the choice they are faced with. I am sure that is not the choice he was referring to in that budget speech but that is the choice that many people are faced with. The truth of the matter is that families, even those who may gain some financial benefit from the tax measures in these bills, will receive no choice at all. As I have alluded to, many will miss out on basic necessities of life-and I cite dental health care and the opportunities for further education for their children. The words of the Treasurer in his second reading speech provide evidence that the coalition government's so-called family policy stems not from the homes, the workplaces, the communities or the lives of ordinary Australof the ians but rather these sentiments find their genesis in the driest of the dry economic rationalist textbooks and theories. In my electorate of Isaacs we have the suburb of Cranbourne. As I said in this place before, it is part of the city of Casey, the fastest growing municipality in Australia, and could be described as being fairly typical of middle, rapidly growing Australia. The government would have us and the good people of Cranbourne believe that the tax and other initiatives that the Treasurer referred to during his second reading speech are aimed fairly and squarely at those Cranbourne residents and that they will be so much better off because of them. Let us look at some fairly objective and fairly informed local commentary to see what prospects these reforms hold for the people of Cranbourne. I can do no better than quote the district commander of the Salvation Army, Envoy Derek Linsell, who on 5 October last year hosted the then Leader of the Opposition on a tour of Salvation Army facilities in Cranbourne. He summed up rather succinctly the fear and despair that this government's measures which impact on families have placed upon ordinary Australians. I note that the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) is leaving the House. He interjects constantly until such time as I am about to cite some local evidence of the impact that your government's so-called initiatives are having on families in Cranbourne, one of the hardest working, newhome buying areas in Australia today. In the 3 September edition of the Cranbourne Sun, Envoy Linsell, the head of the Salvation Army in Cranbourne, said: Cranbourne is all about achieving the great Australian dream of having a family and owning a house. Many people come here expecting to get on the housing ladder and find they can't. Envoy Linsell warned that Cranbourne was 'facing a welfare crisis which could push many recipients into a permanent underclass'. He had never said those sorts of thingsMr Bob Baldwin-That's what happened under the previous government. It happened under the previous government. Unemployment! Poverty! Remember 'No child shall live in poverty'?",80
240,Mr WILTON,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I notice that perhaps the greatest oncer in this place today, the member for Paterson, who certainly will not be here come the next parliament, interjects about what has happened in the past 13 years. Envoy Linsell had made no such comments about government programs in the past 13 years until he reflected in recent days on initiatives that have been taken over the past few months when he stated-and I repeat for your benefit: Cranboume is facing a welfare crisis which could push many recipients into a permanent underclass. We can see some very worrying signs. The member for Paterson might not be able to see those worrying signs but on our side of the House we can see them. We realise that we will always have poor people. We acknowledge that. There will always be people who are worse off than others, but tile beauty of Australia in the last 10 or 15 years has been that we, Labor, put a safety net in place. That is the answer to your question. The danger right now is that that same safety net will disappear. Mr Bob Baldwin-You did not do too well. Look at the bankruptcies-not just business ones but personal bankruptcies. You've got no idea, pal. You're a bootbead.",82
241,Mr WILTON,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I ask that the member withdraw that comment, Mr Deputy Speaker.",82
242,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,You take exception to it?,82
243,Mr WILTON,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I do indeed. Mr Bob Baldwin-What is offensive about it, Mr Deputy Speaker?",82
244,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,Order! The speaker has taken offence at your remark. Would you please withdraw it? Mr Bob Baldwin-I withdraw it.,82
245,Mr WILTON,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Envoy Linsell's fears are well-founded. Despite the government appearing to give some support to families through the tax relief measures contained in these bills, the services that will be taken away in the budget will do nothing for those in our community who are struggling to raise their families, as they are in Cranbourne, run their businesses and achieve their goals in life. Mr Billson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 81. Perhaps the member for Isaacs is confusing these bills with the appropriation bills which are being considered by the Main Committee. I suggest that you bring him back to the subject of the bills.",82
246,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,There is no point of order. Continue.,82
247,Mr WILTON,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Clearly, there was no point of order. How facile! The financial assistance which families receive under these bills will do little to compensate for the $320 million which has been cut from grants to the states over the next four years, in addition to the $600 million pro rata health reduction announced at the Premiers Conference-something that I am sure the Treasurer, who had a memorable question time today, would again shudder to recollect. This will dramatically increase hospital waiting lists for those who depend on public hospitals. Families whose doctors used to bulk bill but have now decided that due to the government's changes to the indexation of the Medicare scheduleMr Billson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I again draw your attention to standing order 81 and suggest that you ask the member for Isaacs to draw his remarks at least vaguely towards the bill, or draw him a map to room 2R3, where the Main Committee is debating the Appropriation Bill.",82
248,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I draw the member's attention to the bill that is being debated, the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill, and ask him to confine his remarks to that bill.",82
249,Mr WILTON,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I was referring at some length to families whose doctors bulk bill. In fact, I would see that as being a fairly critical component of any bill that relates to the question of families, be it of an income tax or a general financial nature, because those same doctors who, due to the government's changesMr Bob Baldwin- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: again, drawing your attention to standing order 81, I think mark. Apart from the fact that the content of his remarks is totally irrelevant to this bill, what he is speaking is a load of rubbish. I think you should be bringing him back again to the point that he must speak to this bill not digress from it.",83
250,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,Order! There is no point of order. Continue.,83
251,Mr WILTON,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"We see that these measures that I have basically outlined in summary will ""esult in a huge impost for Australian families. It will mean that students from low income backgrounds will need to think very carefully about, for example, the financial risk involved in attempting one of the more expensive courses such as medicine. As the member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) will know, given the government's attack on Medicare provider numbers, how many students will contemplate studying medicine? I know that students and their families in my electorate are genuinely concerned about these changes. As I have said before, I have recently been presented with petitions from two high schools expressing the concerns of parents and students from families in the electorate about cuts to education. Dr Southcott- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Further to the point raised the member for Dunkley, understanding order 81, we are debating the family tax initiative. He is not talking about families, he is not talking about tax and he is showing no initiative. I draw your attention to standing order 81.",83
252,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,I believe that the member is speaking about families. I ask him to continue and also to stick to the bill in question.,83
253,Mr WILTON,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,I refer in my closing remarks to another matter of similarly critical importance to families-the government's decision to force those in need of nursing home care to find money to pay up-front fees. Government members-- Mr Deputy Speaker,83
254,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,Order!,83
255,Mr WILTON,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I am underwhelmed, Mr he is way off the Deputy Speaker.",83
256,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Who is taking the point of order? Mr BiIlson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a and point of order under the same standing order. I have not met too many people in nursing homes who have children under the age of 16, or particularly under the age of four, which are some of the key elements relating to this bill. I again encourage you to ask the member for Isaacs to respect your earlier ruling and come back to the bill that is currently before the House.",83
257,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,I will once again ask the member to confine his remarks to the bill under consideration.,83
258,Mr WILTON,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"With respect, I suggest that the member for Dunkley should visit the Mount Eliza nursing home, where there are many people who have children under 16. I know that for a fact. It shows how well some of those on the other side know their own electorates. In conclusion, we do not appreciate the disingenuous nature of the government's rhetoric in its support for the family, particularly when in its first budget it has made the lot of the average Australian family so much by more difficult. It will not take long for Australian families, as has been demonstrated in a recent by-election in Queensland, to see through the government's charade, once they become aware of the government's lack of understanding and compassion for their needs and their struggles. I commend the bill and the amendment by the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) to the House.",83
259,Mr NEVILLE,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I would like to speak tonight on these two important areas of the budget where the government has delivered unequivocally on its election promises. It has delivered unequivocally to that section of the community that for too long has been treated as second rate. For too long the families of Australia have been an afterthought. They were put in that position by the previous Labor government over 13 years. For too long they have been drowning, choking and struggling in a sea of loud-mouthed minority groups and ill-conceived and ill-targeted Labor budget strategies. For too long this group to which I refer came way down the list of priorities of the previous government. I am speaking tonight, of course, of the family. This government has recognised the pre-eminent place of the family unit in Australian society. While the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) might have been giving the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) a bit of a rough time, I was quite surprised that the member for Isaacs was 14 minutes into his address before he mentioned the two billsthe Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill and the Family (Tax Initiative) Bill. It seems to me that he wanted to skirt the key issue, and that is that some real and genuine aid has been delivered to the middle and low income families of Australia. This government has recognised that the family is the core social unit of our society and has made it a priority to relieve the financial pressure on low and middle income families bringing up children. This government has recognised that just because hard working average Australian couples with their 2.3 children, their mortgage, their school books, their school uniforms, their car repayments, their registration and the food on their table do not jump up and down and make a lot of noise does not mean that they do not deserve to be this government's No.1 priority. This government has made them their No. 1 priority. We articulated that in our headland speeches. We articulated that in our election promises. In this measure we have delivered. We have delivered to them a family package that will put extra money in their pockets in real terms. More than that, this government has delivered a tax package which will reach families who need that money most. Before I outline the measures and initiatives which the government will deliver to families, let me take you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on a short trip down memory lane to the time when the Labor Party-the party supposedly with a reputation for representing the battlers of this country-turned their backs on those average parents of whom I speak, those same families of Australia. As painful as it might be for those opposite to listen to this, just bear with me for a moment. What happened under Labor? Under Labor, household debt rose over $200 million or an equivalent of nearly 70 per cent of household disposable income. Under Labor, home loan repayments rose to 27 per cent of medium monthly family income, up from just 19 per cent under the Fraser government in 1983. Under Labor, sales tax revenue rose from $9.2 billion in 1992-93, the year before the Keating government took office or the last term of the Keating government, to $12.95 billion in 1995-96. That is a staggering increase of 40 per cent over the full three years of the last term of the Keating government. The member for Isaacs talked about bracket creep depriving the battlers of Australia, although he did not specify how it would affect the battlers of Australia, of $1.8 billion. I would have thought the $1.8 billion would have applied broadly across the whole spectrum of government initiatives. But, if we take up that $1.8 billion, what about this measure here-and that was just one aspect of Labor taxation-that over a short time took $3.7 billion from the Australian battlers? We can see that in a whole range of matters. It crept in over a period of time. The more important items went from 10 per cent to 11 per cent to 12 per cent. The next range went from 20 per cent to 21 per cent to 22 per cent and so on. We also had two episodes of fuel excise increases, to say nothing of the five per cent sales tax on motor vehicles. Under Labor, the Medicare levy ended up at 1.5 per cent. The member for Isaacs chastised us over pharmacy charges-that the co-payment has gone up to $20 for most Australians and up to $3.20 for those on benefits. As much as I would have liked those co-payments to have stayed at a lower level, I remind those opposite that those co-payments were introduced by the Labor Party. They progressively increased them, in the case of underprivileged Australians, to $2.70Ms Macklin-And compensated for it in the pension, which you haven't done.",84
260,Mr NEVILLE,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Just wait a minute. I am coming to that. It is also interesting to note that the previous Labor government raised the safety net to $600. Bearing in mind that it was $300 not so long ago, now after five years of Labor you have to be twice as sick as you were before to qualify for the safety net. I think the shadow minister would do wellMs Macklin-Pensioners, we're talking about. That's not their safety net. Their safety net is a lot lower than that. Yeah, get the facts right.",85
261,Mr NEVILLE,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"The shadow minister knows that the safety net figure remains unchanged. The only difference will be that anyone on regular medication will get to that figure one or two prescriptions earlier than they did before. You know that is correct. Ms Macklin-Not for pensioners it doesn't. It goes up $26 for pensioners. Mr AbboU- Mr Deputy Speaker, could you restrain the shadow minister, please.",85
262,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,Order! I ask that the member be heard in silence.,85
263,Mr NEVILLE,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Under Labor, the PA YE taxes for small business were increased to bimonthly payments. In 1993, the Keating government delivered tax cuts with the greatest proportion of savings to people earning $50,000 per year-a figure which at the time was 67 per cent higher than average weekly earnings. As Ross Gittens so aptly put it in the Sydney Morning Herald on 19 August: So the champion of the poor defines the middle as 67% above average. That's the crux of Mr Keating's betrayal of the Labor battler. The tax cuts are biased in favour of people earning way above the average. Mr Gittens went on to say: We're always being told that the tax cuts are directed to people earning $20,700 a year and $50,000 a year but often don't realise just how heavily the tax cuts are slanted towards people at the top end of that range. I think that was a very timely expose of the general philosophy of-(QuorumJormed) As I was saying, in quoting Mr Ross Gittens at the time, Labor's philosophy seemed to be to aim those cuts at the top end of the middle range. During this period, the lower middle income earner has been the most disadvantaged. As recently as the 1995 budget the best Labor could do for families was a $4 increase in the guardian allowance f'Jr sole parents, a $5 increase in rent assistance and some vague reference to 'measures to help families in crisis and through difficult times', as the Australian of 10 May 1995 so exquisitely put it. I suppose you could say that this legacy of Labor has been a pretty sorry tale. It has shown that the previous government had no soul. In contrast the current government does have a soul. It is looking to the bread and butter issues that Labor so wilfully neglected. Is it any wonder then that at the last election the blue-collar workers deserted the Labor Party in droves? Is it any wonder when the Labor Party had deserted the battlers trying to make an honest living and raise a family? Is it any wonder that middle Australia will continue to desert them in the face of a tax package from this government that offers real benefits of a substantial nature-money in their pockets? The government has not and will not betray middle Australia. I was interested to hear the member for Isaacs say that very few Australians will benefit from these tax measures. That is strange, because the budget papers show that two million Australians will benefit from them. I would have thought that that number is quite substantial and considerably more than the number who benefited from Labor during its term of office. The family tax initiative will deliver to Australians in two different ways. Part A will provide assistance through an increase in one parent's tax free threshold of $1,000 for each dependent child. Assistance will be available to families whose combined taxable income is up to $70,000 for one child, plus $3,000 for each additional child. These benefits will be available through the Australian Taxation Office. They are also offered with the flexibility of being able to be claimed either during the income tax year through reductions in PA YE deductions in tax or when lodging a return at the end of the financial year. Part B of the family tax initiative provides further assistance to single income familiesincluding sole parents-with at least one child under the age of five. The initiative increases the tax free threshold of the breadwinner by $2,500. This assistance is available where the taxable income of the breadwinner is less than $65,000 and the annual income of the nonworking spouse is less than the income cut-off for the basic parenting allowance, currently $4,535. Here again the $65,000 threshold is increased by $3,000 for each child after the first. You can see that this measure has been clearly and unambiguously enunciated by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), and I commend him for his work. Certainly one of the strengths of this tax initiative is its simplicity and clarity. There is no deception, no sleight of hand, no smoke and mirror tricks like those which we saw so often during the Keating budgets. What you will get in the coalition budget is a tax initiative which has been delivered in full and will provide genuine assistance for families. Unlike the old style Keating-Dawkins-Willis budgets, this budget does not rely on deception and rhetoric to trick the public into thinking that they are really better off. Unlike those days, this budget really .means - oney in the pockets of real Austrahan famlllesespecially, as I said before, those on lower and middle incomes. Allow me to be a little more specific about these benefits. As I have said, the tax free threshold increases by $1,000 for one parent for each dependent child for families with combined taxable incomes of less than $70,000, with an additional $3,000 added to the income threshold for each additional child. When you start translating that into some examples, you see that a family with one dependent child on a family income of less than $70,000 will be $7.70 per fortnight better off. A family with two dependent children and a family income of less than $73,000 will be $15.40 a fortnight better off. A family with three dependent children and a family income of less than $76,000 will be $23 per fortnight better off. A family with four dependent children and a family income as high as $79,000 will be $30.80 per fortnight better off. It must be remembered that under the coalition government a dependent child includes all dependent children up to the age of 16 as well as dependent secondary school students up to the age of 18 years. In keeping with the Howard government's commitment to making the tax system more sympathetic to single income families, the second aspect of the tax package initiative focuses exclusively on this group. In real dollars and cents, the second part of the tax initiative will be worth an additional $19.20 per fortnight to those people who are eligible. A family with four dependent children which meets both part A and part B criteria will receive total assistance of $50 per fortnight. I might interpose here .that that would be in addition to health Insurance rebates which might return to that family anything up to $9 a week. or $18 a f-rtnight. So that family I quoted In the last Instance could be up to $68 a fortnight better off as a result of the combined measures. This might not sound a great deal of money to people who are living in some of the better suburbs of the capital cities, but I can assure you it means plenty to the working men and women in some of the provincial towns and cities in my electorate-places like Biloela, Monto, Bundaberg, Gladstone and Childerswhere people work hard in industry or on the land for average or slightly above average weekly earnings. This tax initiative means plenty to these people as they battle with the mortgage and the never ending expenses of raising a family increase. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will probably find it difficult to believe but this government has delivered still more benefits to families. The family tax assistance initiative which I have outlined is available to all families with sufficient taxable income to benefit. However, this government has also made allowances for around 900,000 low income families who will have the alternative of fortnightly cash assistance benefits, called the family tax payment, to be delivered by the Department of Social Security. In conclusion, I think this emphasises the generosity of the government across a whole range of sectors. I am surprised that members of the opposition have not looked at the detail of this and have been all too willing to be doctrinaire about it. The member for Isaacs talked about the Treasurer being the driest of the dry. I wonder whether he and his colleagues have lost sight of average Australians and have become the doctrinaires of the doctrinaire.",85
264,Ms MACKLIN,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Jagajaga) (10.10 p.m.)These bills which seek to implement the family tax initiative purport to be of benefit to Australian families. They were the cornerstone of the Liberal Party policy promises during the last election campaign. These are said to be bills that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) takes great pride in. These bills, to my way of thinking, are a classic example of the way in which this government has approached a whole range of policy areas. Its whole approach is based on the premise of give with one hand and take back with the other. We have seen produced here tonight figures which show how much families will apparently benefit, how much they will earn, as a result of these initiatives. What they do not show, and also what the material presented earlier by the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) does not show, is what is being taken on the other hand: what families are being given with tax breaks on the one hand are being taken away in a whole range of other areas. We had a bit of description about the higher prescription costs-$20 per script. There are higher child-care costs and greater difficulty finding affordable places for babies and children with special needs, increased costs of supporting children who are students and no longer eligible for Austudy and increased costs supporting unemployed children under 18 who would otherwise have been eligible for a minimum rate of youth training allowance or sickness allowance. So the taking hand of this government I would have to say is much busier than the giving hand. It is not the case, as the previous speaker, the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), said, that the smoke and mirrors tricks do not apply. They certainly do apply here. What I want to concentrate on tonight is particularly those families who are using child care. Over half a million children in this country are in Commonwealth funded child care. Child care is of critical importance to a great number of Australian families. An overview in a recent EPAC task force report stressed the importance of 'child-care services for Australian families and the importance for government to get child-care arrangements right'. Under Labor, we had the growth of a world-class system of child care that was high quality and affordable. Most importantly, it was introduced to meet the needs of working women. We recognised that women cannot work if there is not adequate child care. Tonight I want to go through five important things about this budget and child care and what it really means for families and explain how, as a result of these changes to child care, the family tax initiative goes nowhere towards meeting increased child-care costs. The operational subsidy for community based long day care has been abolished 'to encourage services to become more efficient and cost competitive with the private sector'. This is the level playing field argument of the economic rationalists from the other side. It is also the argument that conveniently forgets that community based long day care provides services such as more places for babies and children with special needs, and extended opening hours, just to name a few of the things it does. It is the case that some private sector services do provide these services but, on the whole, the community based services provide more in these areas because of the operational subsidy. This operational subsidy equates to $14 a week for a child over three and $21 a week for a child under three. Fees for community based long day care are likely to go up by this amount. The alternative to raising fees is cutting services. I just want to read from a little pieceMr Bob Baldwin- Mr Deputy Speaker, a point of order under section 81: we have heard a lot of drifting tonight away from this bill, and I ask that you",87
265,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Mr Nehl)There is no point of order. I would suggest to the newer members of this place on both sides that they should understand that the appropriation bill is one of the few bills in which members can speak about any thingMr Bob Baldwin-With all due respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is not the appropriation bill. That is in the Main Committee.",88
266,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I have just come from the Main Committee; I accept what you are saying. The Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill is the bill before the House, and the member for Jagajaga will restrict her remarks to the contents of that bill.",88
267,Ms MACKLIN,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"In talking about the family tax initiative, what we have to take account of-as all the speakers on both sides have done-is the effect on families, which I am trying to do. I want to draw attention to the effect of the removal of operational subsidies which will not be compensated for as a result of the family tax initiative. I want to quote from a community based long day centre called Scallywags in Bathurst which I visited recently. What they put forward to me were alternatives to fee increases: first, no longer provide cooked meals for the children; second, reduce or cease to provide care for the under two age group; third, reduce the numbers of staff or their hours; or, fourth, re-evaluate the after-school program and incorporate these children into the long day care program, which would put an age limit on the number of children who could come. Community centres are, of course, more likely to be found in rural and remote areas as well as in low income areas. As part of the smoke and mirrors trick, this government is making much of the $8.3 million that they are providing to help community based centres manage the loss of operational subsidies. But, once again, it is $8.3 million on the one hand and $100 million taken away on the other. Mr Bob Baldwin-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker",88
268,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Order! If you are repeating the point of order, I thank you very much. Do you have a different point of order? Mr Bob Baldwin-I just wish to expand",88
269,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"You do not have to expand on a point of order. If you are raising the same point of order that you raised before, I accept it. I say to the member for Jagajaga that, while these are sometimes very wide ranging debates, the subject of this debate is the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Family Tax Initiative) Bill. I know that what you are attempting to do is to say on the one hand there are these benefits for families but they are being offset by others. Just be careful how you make those analogies.",88
270,Ms MACKLIN,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"The second point I wanted to make is that families in more remote areas are going to be very seriously affected and not compensated for as a result of this family tax initiative. In fact, today I have received 38 letters from families with children in Alice Springs who use community based long day care. They certainly do not for one minute think that the family tax initiative is going to compensate them for the large number of children who are completely dependent on community based long day care in Alice Springs. Secondly, there are the number of children who no longer will be able to access places because of the absolute removal of community based long day care. Mr Bob Baldwin- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: with all due respect, I fail to see what the child-care debate that she is running here has to do directly with the bill that is before the House and being debated.",88
271,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Thank you, I take your point of order but I would point out to the House that we are debating the amendment to the bill and not just the bill. The amendment expresses its concerns that other budget measures leave the average Australian family $700 per annum worse off. The member for Jagajaga is in order: please continue.",89
272,Ms MACKLIN,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was saying that the demand for child care in this country will not be met as a result of the changes in this budget because 5,500 places that were part of Labor's goal of meeting the demand for child care will no longer be met because of this budget. I quote the words of the New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, who said: Mr Howard is reneging on a Commonwealth-state funding agreement that would have created 1,600 new child-care places in New South Wales alone. The disappointing thing for families in New South Wales is that a significant number of the places were going to go to high need areas, including westem and south western Sydney. The third point I want to make is that, if you do not qualify for this much trumpeted family tax initiative that gets completely wiped out by the increased costs of community long day care, your child-care cash rebate is going to be slashed by a third. The introduction of the child-care cash rebate by Labor recognised that the cost of child care is a work related expense and that it can be a significant disincentive for women thinking about taking up employment. Like other tax concessions for work related expenses, the rebate was not means tested. Despite a specific promise not to touch this rebate-another broken promise that we have from this government-what we have seen in this budget is that the government has in fact applied a means test to the child-care cash rebate. Fourthly, changes to child-care assistance, which many parents know as fee relief, mean that all parents will have higher out-of-pocket expenses for child care. The fee ceiling has been frozen, but the minimum fee will continue to increase thereby squeezing the amount of fee relief they might get. The income cut-offs for families who have more than one child in care have been reduced, meaning that anyone with more than one child will pay more. The $30 a week of income for each dependent child, which was not taken into account to work out how much fee relief you got, will now be taken into account. You will now have to pay the full costs of any child care you use over 50 hours a week. Let us have a look at an example of what these changes to child-care assistance actually mean for a family. A couple on a combined income of $35,000 a year-say, he is a mechanic on $25,000; she is a sales assistant-with two children in care for 50 hours a week will be paying $29.16 a week more for a community based long day care centre. How much do they get from the family tax initiative? Some $7.70 a week. So they are a lot worse off under this budget. This family tax initiative is certainly not going to compensate for the increase in their child-care costs. There are many thousands of other children and their families who are going to affected in this way. Let us just remember what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) actually said during the election campaign about child-care assistance and the family tax initiative. He said that there would be a family tax initiative, but he also said that a Liberal-National Party government would maintain the system of child-care assistance. But what is going to happen under this budget is that 330,000 families will pay more for child care because of these changes-much more than they are going to get from this family tax initiative. Fifthly, parents who use long day care or family day care can now choose to have their child-care assistance paid directly to them rather than to the service provider. Child-care centres will no longer have the certainty necessary to employ quality staff who provide children with the continuity of care that they need-a very serious matter for families. I do not want to labour too much the volume and tone of the letters starting to arrive from families protesting at the attacks on child care, but I thought I might just hold up some of the colourful things sent by young children that have arrived in the post today, such as these letters from Jacob and family, Nash and family, Melissa, and a number of other children. You can see that the children themselves have put together some very colourful letters trying to get me, people on our side of the House and, I am sure, those on the other side of the House to really try to understand the effect of the combination of the family tax initiative with these very serious increases in fees for child care. The reason the smoke and mirrors are really starting to emerge is that these details have not been clear to parents. It is only as the real picture begins to emerge that the costs are actually starting to be felt in parents' pockets, and we would hope to see a reevaluation of this budget from the other side of the House. This is called a family budget with its family tax initiative as its centrepiece, but I would have to say that families-particularly families with children in child care-are just starting to see this budget unravel. The Prime Minister has tried to woo families with this family tax initiative, but as they start to add up the numbers we can see that the small benefits it will give families on the one hand will be taken away on the other. The bonus of the family tax initiative will largely, for most families, not offset the costs that families will face as a result of the rest of this government's cuts. The Prime Minister said in the election campaign that this was going to be a government for all of us. What he really meant, particularly when it came to families, was that it is for families where one partner is at home caring for children and not for families where both parents work. Let us make this particUlarly clear. This is a very important point in this debate tonight. This family tax initiative is a direct transfer from families using child care to families where one person is at home caring for children. What it says loud and clear to working women-and we are now in the majority, in case those opposite have not worked it out-is, 'Don't work or we will penalise you; we will take away your childcare assistance.' That, I think, is the full extent of the coalition's attempt to solve the unemployment problem-get women out of the work force. Families should not be dazzled by the dollar signs in the family tax initiative. It is the case that if your family depends on public health, public education or child care, or if you have somebody at TAFE or university, or a family member in a nursing home, or if you are trying to find a job, you just will not have those extra dollars, the $7.70-which will not go very far against all those increased costsfor very long, let alone have the time to enjoy them. I might just draw attention to fact that it is the case that we know that this will not be the end of the cuts to child care. We have seen in the EPAC child-care task force many of the proposals that we know the government is considering, and we have no doubt that there will be further cuts to child care in next year's budget; further cuts to the impact of this family tax initiative. It is a very serious matter when the voters in the federal seat of Lindsay are now having a unique opportunity to show the government a cautionary sign. Today I was sent a copy of the flier that the Liberal candidate has just put out on child care. She does not mention a few facts, which I might just put on the record, particularly as they take away from the family tax initiative. This budget actually takes $500 million out of child care. It delivers increased fees for parents. None of these things were in her flier. All parents with children in community based child care--of which there are a very large number in Penrith-will be paying $20 a week per child more. Mr Bob Baldwin-That's not true.",89
273,Ms MACKLIN,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"You go out to Penrith like I did last week and talk to them. That is exactly what they will be paying, because the operational subsidy for community based long day care has gone. The 50-hour-a-week cap on fees is going to mean, particularly for the people of Penrith, that their fees are going to rise. If you have two children in care, your fees are going to rise. And they have taken over $100 million away from community based long day care. You cannot expect the councils of Penrith and Blacktown to make up the differences, because that must be what the candidate for Lindsay expects. There is no other way in which the costs to parents cannot go up-unless she is expecting to do what the people of Bathurst do not want to do, which is to take away the meals from the children in child care and take away all the other important things that make child care a high quality service. This is a government by trial and error, particularly when it comes to families. It is a very serious thing that this budget does to families: giving them tax breaks on the one hand, but very significant increases to their child-care costs on the other. They are deplorable cuts to child care, and ones that we will certainly be fighting very hard against. Debate interrupted. NA",90
274,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Rugby League",91
275,Mr ALBANESE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to raise a concern which has been echoing around certainly New South Wales and, indeed, around Australia over the weekend. That concerns the disastrous Super League decision handed down by the courts last Friday. I do not think this is just a battle 1968: between two entrepreneurs and billionaires in Kerry Packer and Rupert Murdoch. Indeed, this is a battle between the history of the game and the public ownership of it, versus the private domination of this game by an individual. It is not just a matter of Friday's decision being un-Australian because what it says is that it is okay for a few greedy individuals to withdraw from their contracts, their honour of the game and their commitment to their communities, clubs and supporters in the interests of the dollar. I think it goes beyond that because it goes to the use of our leisure time and the way in which a great many of the fans wish to see the game go ahead. The distinction is that I happen to be a proud supporter of the South Sydney Rugby League Football Club and the South Sydney Rugby League Football Club belongs to its members. The ground certainly belongs to the community. The Sydney Football Stadium is a publicly owned ground. I did not see Rupert Murdoch waving around cheques worth millions of dollars to contribute when the Sydney Football Stadium had to be built. I am the Vice-President of the Friends of Public Football Grounds and we are an organisation which has pointed out that most grounds are not owned by individuals or by Super League. They are the product of the hard work by and large of working men and women in support of their local teams. Super League future club Penrith relies upon the use of Panthers Stadium or Penrith Park, as it was then. In 1988 it refurbished the ground with a $500,000 grant from the state government. Further, it got $350,000 from Footy Tab funds. I suggest that if Rupert Murdoch is buying that club he should pay back that money into the public revenue. I am very proud that a local council in my electorate, Leichhardt Council, has banned Super League from using Leichhardt Oval at any future time. Indeed, the distinction is very much historical. Andrew Moore, the President of Friends of Public Football Grounds, quoted Bill Buckley, the former Chairman of the New South Wales Rugby League, who argued in The NSW Rugby League is ... a truly socialist body because it has amassed very little in the way of profits over the past 60 years. The money has all been distributed to the people who make the game-players, juniors and schoolboys. What we have seen in sport in general which will impact on the quality of life of the people we in this parliament should represent is more and more funding at the elite level, at the risk of funding at the lower levels. This places at risk the development of the game, which certainly the ARL has been responsible for and in which the ARL, I believe, has done an outstanding job in recent times. It is symptomatic that this is occurring at the same time as the push of the dollar is trying to knock over a number of AFL clubs. The Sydney Swans have been very successful in their move to Sydney, but I certainly support the right of members of clubs such as Melbourne and Hawthorn to oppose the mergers. What we are seeing is the development of a real people's movement in support of their local communities and that tradition, and against the profit motives. I am pleased to end my comments tonight by saying that the spirit of these clubs and communities cannot totally be broken. As evidence of that I give the fact that the Newtown Jets, the mighty club, are premiers for 1996 in the Metropolitan Cup in Sydney. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome",91
276,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I take the opportunity to welcome you back to your first adjournment debate after what I am sure was a very successful parliamentary delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Beijing. This evening I want to raise an issue not only as the member for Groom but also as the patron of a local community support group for those affected by myalgic encephalomyelitis-a big word-or ME. I am sure the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson)-I think I have got it right-would agree with me on this. ME or chronic fatigue syndrome-CFS as it is also called-is a potentially disabling and chronic condition affecting the immune and central nervous systems. There is no known single cause although for many it may be a viral trigger. Some patients may have a sudden onset whilst for others it may be a slow and gradual process with no easily identifiable trigger. It can vary greatly in severity and duration. There is no specific diagnostic test. It complex illness and the list of symptoms can be extensive and profound in the more severe cases. Some of the main symptoms are an inability to concentrate; memory disturbance-perhaps a couple of those might be appropriate for some members of this House-spatial disorientation; chronic sore throat, often with recurrent flu-like illness; tender and swollen lymph nodes; muscle pain; headaches, which often are very severe; and non-refreshing sleep. Other symptoms may include numb or tingling feelings, twitching muscles, sensitivity to noise, blackouts, depression, anxiety, emotional mood swings, shortness of breath from exertion, intolerance of alcohol, decreased libido and occasional impotence. Current research suggests that a dysfunction of the immune system and the central nervous system are involved. The complexity of the illness means that the prognosis can be very difficult to predict. Some patients will make a slow and gradual progress over several years to a full recovery. The majority will make variable progress with relapses which may be severe and prolonged. They may reach 70 to 80 per cent of their former functions. Others remain severely disabled with little progress, needing help with their personal needs. A smaller percentage may deteriorate and be bed-bound for much of the time. Peak incidence appears to be in the 20 to 40 years age group, with a slight predominance to females, and cases in young children are increasing. Tonight, Mr Speaker, I am wearing a blue ribbon awareness of ME badge and I hope that such an awareness badge, which has its origins in the United Kingdom, will assist with a better understanding of ME, and an acknowledgment that it is a very real and, for many, a very debilitating illness. The consequences of living with ME for the sufferer, the carer and the whole family unit need to be understood. I want to pay particular tribute to two pioneering local Toowoomba women, Joan Sheath and Lyn Wilson, both as sufferers and as support group leaders, without whose is a persistent efforts the community group would not be what it is today. I am pleased also that the government is now starting to do something substantive about the problem and that Australia was an active participant in the international CFS awareness day earlier this year. To illustrate, I quote in part from a recent letter to Ms Wilson on behalf of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge): The Government is aware of the concerns of people such as yourself for those who have been afflicted by this debilitating condition and is taking immediate steps to address those concerns. He goes on to outline the fact that the government is now involved in funding, to the extent of $200,000 over the next six months, a series of studies involving various colleges throughout Australia. Let us hope that we have left behind unreasonable perceptions that this is a condition of the mind rather than the body. This is a debilitating illness which we cannot and should not ignore. Rugby League Lindsay By-election",92
277,Mr LATHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"Werriwa) (10.39 p.m.)This evening I join with my colleague the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) in saying that rugby league teams in the western and south-western suburbs of Sydney should be given a future. I believe that this parliament can do something to secure that future. The Penrith team should not be forced to amalgamate with the Parramatta team. They are very different communities, very different districts. Penrith has a great record in rugby league and it deserves its own club. Of course, the Western Suburbs rugby league team in my electorate of Werriwa is a great inspiration to young people in the Macarthur district. I want to see this parliament consider an access regime whereby media barons like Rupert Murdoch and Kerry Packer are not allowed to carve up the game of rugby league according to their commercial interests. We should have an access regime for the broadcasting rights to major sporting events so the codes are in the driving seat. According to the antics and strategies of Murdoch and Packer, any good that comes to rugby league out of this controversy is merely an accident; it is merely coincidental to their commercial interests. They would put profit ahead of the best interests of rugby league in the western suburbs of Sydney and the great Penrith club and in the south-western suburbs and the great Western Suburbs rugby league team in my electorate of Werriwa. I rise this evening to congratulate the government on its announcement just 48 hours ago of the effective removal of the M4 and M5 tollways in Sydney's west. I note with interest that in this House on 28 May the former member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, spoke about Bob Carr. She said, 'He literally handed the seat of Lindsay to me on a plate.' The plate has gone, the plate has been removed. The only plate she has now is her phoney publicity stunt to position herself in this by-election as a fish and chip shop lady. Is it not interesting that the Liberal Party say that they have no truck with Pauline Hanson and her bigotry? But how does Jackie Kelly present herself to the people of Lindsay? As a fish and chip shop lady! That is a phoney publicity stunt, an attempt to associate herself with the views of Pauline Hanson through the media-an appalling tactic for the Liberal Party to deploy in this by-election. The people of Lindsay should see through those phoney media tactics. They should also understand that when Jackie Kelly says, 'Send a message to Bob Carr', the message has been received. Anyone in the seat of Lindsay in March who voted in the federal election to send a message to Bob Carr on state matters would have appreciated that their message has been well and truly received. The tolls have effectively gone. The Carr government, according to the resolution of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party, is doing the necessary things to guarantee the proper distribution of funding for health services in Sydney's west, despite the vandalism of the Howard government in taking $800 million that out of the public health system. It is only Labor that fights these things. It is only Labor that does the decent things for the Nepean Hospital and the Liverpool and Campbelltown hospitals in my electorate. We are doing it to fight off the anti-public hospital views of the Howard government in ripping $800 million out of it all to subsidise private health insurance and build up the already bloated coffers and reserves of the private funds. Earlier in the House today we had the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education Carr and Training (Dr Kemp) talking about Jackie Kelly's commitment to education. Anyone in the Penrith district knows that that is a sham. Do you know what Jackie Kelly said to a group of school students at a school in her electorate? At their school assembly presentation she said, 'A third of you will be unemployed when you leave school.' I can understand why she said that. It was a streak of honesty. Under the policies of the Howard government of ripping away labour market programs, ripping away spending power and ripping away the supporting role of the public sector in employment, of course they have a diminished opportunity for employment when they leave school. But this is the same former member who had the hide in this House to talk about her military leadership style. What sort of leadersuppress ship does she give to young people in her electorate when she says, 'A third of you will be unemployed when you leave school'? What a stunning admission of the failure of this minister and the Howard government to do something positive on employment. What a stunning admission of the failure of this government and her failure to give hope, aspiration and expectations to young people in the seat of Lindsay. She has no leadership style, no capacity to deliver and, of course, no capacity to send any sort of message to Macquarie Street. She needs to be judged on federal issues: the abolition of university funding for the University of Western Sydney; abolition of the western Sydney orbital road; and the massive loss of operational funding for child-care centres. She deserves to be rejected. (Time expired) Umbilical Cord Blood",93
278,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,Robertson) (10.44 p.m.)After the negativity of the,94
279,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,Tirade.,94
280,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"The tirade of the speaker opposite, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), I would like to talk about something constructive and positive. I would like tonight to take the opportunity to highlight the wonderful benefits of the Australian Cord Blood Bank. One of the greatest medical breakthroughs in recent times has been the discovery of the benefit of umbilical cord blood. Treatment of serious blood diseases such as leukaemia rely on the transplant of blood stem cells, which are the ultimate grandparents of all blood cells. These stem cells are very rare and are found in high concentration in bone marrow. Because of the difficulty in isolating stem cells, whole marrow is used for transplants in the treatment of leukaemia. This procedure is difficult for many reasons. Firstly, finding a compatible match is expensive and at best has a one in four chance of finding a suitable donor. Then, if a suitable match can be found, the risk of rejection remains high. Patients have to be prepared for the transplants with heavy doses of chemotherapy and radiation to the body's immune system and to help reduce the possibility of rejection. A bone marrow graft typically involves a team of seven medical staff in an operating theatre. Tragically, all these distressing procedures are more often than not being endured by very young children. All this suffering will soon be a thing of the past. The discovery that umbilical cord blood contains the essential blood stem cells in large numbers brings new hope to thousands of people awaiting bone marrow transplants. A cord blood graft can be done by a single nurse and does not have the difficulties of finding a compatible donor. Tragically, at present over 50 per cent of children with cancer have no matched bone marrow donors. At present there is no cord blood bank in Australia and the cost of searching for and transporting suitable product from the USA currently stands at around $28,000 per person, far out of the reach of most Australians in desperate need of this procedure. The Australian Cord Blood Bank has been established at the Prince of Wales Children's Hospital to collect, store and freeze stem cells from babies' umbilical cords to be used in lieu of marrow transplants. Under the guidance of Professor Vowels AM, the Director of the Department of Haematology and Oncology, and the Rotary Club of Northbridge, the aim is to establish a cord blood bank of 5,000 frozen cord blood collections within three years and to make the stored blood available without cost nationally and for a fee internationally. Once a cord blood bank is established with 5,000 donors, the running costs would be minimal, as only regular donor replacements and replenishments would be required to maintain the 5,000 blood collections. To establish the Australian Cord Blood Bank initially $500,000 is required. The previous Labor government showed no interest in this magnificent project. But I am pleased to say that on 13 June this year the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) wrote to Professor Vowels pledging a grant of $200,000 to assist in the development phase in the establishment of the bank. This major commitment from the coalition government, a government which has shown great integrity and compassion, will now allow this dream to become a reality. There is still a long way to go and $300,000 has still to be raised. The Rotary Club of Northbridge has embarked on a major fundraising charity dinner and auction on Saturday, 16 November 1996 in the Banquet Hall of the Sydney Convention Centre at Darling Harbour. This event will be opened by His Excellency the Hon. Gordon Samuels, Governor of New South Wales, and Mrs Samuels. It is anticipated that 1,500 people will attend at $100 per head and will have the opportunity to bid on a large range of magnificent goods. I believe that range of goods is growing daily. They will range from antiques to holiday packages. Even new cars will be on offer at that auction. It is hoped that over $300,000 will be raised from this one event, and I urge all honourable members to support this function. The Australian Cord Blood Bank will save hundreds of young Australian lives and it stop the suffering and anguish of their families. This event will make the Cord Blood Bank of Australia a reality. Townsville City Council",94
281,Mr LINDSAY,ADJOURNMENT,"Herbert) (10.49 p.m.)Prior to being elected to the federal parliament, I was a councillor with the Townsville City Council for some 11 years. During that period, I faced four elections and was elected as an endorsed Liberal candidate. On election to the federal parliament, I was required to resign my position as a councillor. The council then had the choice under the Local Government Act of Queensland to appoint a replacement for me, because it was within 12 months of the normal three-year cycle election. It is provided in the Local Government Act of Queensland that a Liberal councillor be replaced by a Liberal. But the Labor Townsville City Council replaced me with an Independent. I was shocked at the time. In fact, on Tuesday, 7 May 1996, I certainly read this into the record of the Australian parliament and made an appropriate comment. The situation since then has been that an Independent has sat in division 9, the division formerly occupied by me. That so-called Independent, I am advised, has on every occasion voted with the Australian Labor Party.",95
282,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Is she a Labor stooge? Mr LINDSAYI would assume so. That person has voted on every occasion with the Labor Party, and it is such a shame that that should happen. The Liberal Party challenged the decision of the Townsville City Council in the Supreme Court of Queensland. It took quite some time for that hearing to be heard and at the end of the hearing the judge found for the council. The Liberal Party was not satisfied with that finding, because we believed that the element of fairness and common sense was not evident in the judge's decision. So the Liberal Party appealed that court decision. Today the appeal court found in favour of the Liberal Party and some six months later we now find that the so-called Independent is no longer a will member of the Townsville City Council.",95
283,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"She's still a stooge, though.",95
284,Mr LINDSAY,ADJOURNMENT,That is quite likely. That is a disgraceful situation where the people of division 9 have been denied proper representation for some six months now.,95
285,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,They'll get it now.,95
286,Mr LINDSA Y,ADJOURNMENT,"They will. I thank the member for Fisher. This is certainly very concerning for the people of division 9, but finally common sense and fairness have prevailed. I believe that this raises serious questions now for the leadership of the Labor Townsville City Council. Labor Mayor Tony Mooney was clearly playing politics in appointing an Independent for division 9. I believe that he must now explain how he can justify the council spending thousands and thousands of dollars of ratepayers' money to pay court costs for both parties following the overturning of that political decision today. It is a decision that should never have had to be made in the first place. When the council is prepared to put politics ahead of the wishes of the people of any council division, then it is time for the council to change at the next election. I understand now that that puts the current mayor in a very difficult position. My understanding is that he is under threat from the deputy mayor. My understanding .is. that, following the defeat by Frank Tantl m the Mundingburra by-election, the mayor's position is very difficult indeed. My understanding is that the current Labor caucus in the city is considering that perhaps the deputy mayor, Councillor Ann Bunnell, should be the mayoral candidate at the next city council election. If that were to be the case, it would make a very interesting contest. I believe that it is very likely that we will not see the current mayor as the mayoral candidate at the next election. The Labor Party, for some reason or another, are taking quite some time to endorse their candidates. I call on them to settle that matter as soon as possible so that the people of Townsville can decide whether there may well be a change of council at the next election. Mr Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to put that. on the record tonight. I wish you a good evenmg. Child Care",95
287,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, welcome back. I wo.uld like to speak this evening about a very Important matter for families in my el--torate and to Australia generally: the provlSlon of quality community based long day care centres and the provision of Commonwealth funds for operational arrangements for community based child care. Many members of the House would be aware that very often relevant local authorities have the responsibility of managing and operating very many of these community based long day care centres. In my own electorate of Perth, I have a number of local authorities. They include the City of Bayswater, the Shire of Swan and the Shire of Mundaring. All those local authorities operate community based child-care centres in their area-. The Shire of Mundaring operates the MIdvale Child-Care and Neighbourhood Centre, which caters for very many families of lower socio-economic demography in Midvale. The withdrawal of the Commonwealth based operational subsidy for that child-care centre is of course very distressing for local families. That community based child-care centre in Midvale is in the vicinity of the electorate of the Minister for Family Services, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan). More of the Shire of Mundaring is in her electorate than in mine. I know that very many members of families from that particular child-care centre have attempted to wait upon her office to get some indication of hopefully a change in the government's attitude in this respect. Very many people in the community generally have waited upon government members, government ministers or former government members in this respect. When I was checking the details of local authorities, I was frankly surprised to learn that the local authority which has the largest number of community based long day care centre places in Australia is .the City .of Penrith. The total grant to the CIty of Pennth local council for the 17 long day care centres that the City of Penrith operates is $738,056.80. It is proposed that that operational subsidy be withdrawn. The calculation that is being done on behalf of the City of Penrith is that, if that operational subsidy were withdrawn from 1 July 1997 and the direct cost were to be transferred to families through child-care fees, there would be an increase of between $20.35 to $23.50 per child per week. I am told that, when families in Penrith became aware of the massive slug and the massive increase that the government's decision in the budget in respect of community based long day care centres would have on families, a rally of thousands of local family members marched upon the erstwhile member for Lindsay, Miss Kelly, trying to find the mythical shop where Miss Kelly allegedly works to make the point to her that this is a massive burden which the government is proposing to place on families in Penrith and on families throughout Australia. The figure is quite staggering. The council of the City of Penrith has 17 long day care centres. The operational subsidy is over $738,000. This government and its candidate at the Lindsay by-election propose to place that burden on families in Penrith, to their great cost. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.59 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Reith to move That for the sitting on Thursday, 10 October 1996 so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the routine of business being as follows, unless 1.

(2) Will the Government support legislation to resolve the delays.",136
315,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995 was introduced by the previous Government without adequate consideration to the administrative burdens imposed by the legislation. For example, in New South Wales the Health Insurance Commission predicted 25000 claims in the first year. In the first three months alone almost twice that number of claims were received. To address the backlog the Health Insurance Commission has put processing staff on overtime and engaged additional (temporary) staff. (2) Yes. Amending legislation, supported by all parties, was passed in the current session of Parliament. The amendments to the Act introduce provisions which enable an insurer to release 90 per cent of the compensation amount payable to a claimant, provided the insurer pays over to the Commonwealth the remaining IO per cent and that the HIC receives the completed Notice of Charge.

As a result, figures have been provided for calendar years rather than financial years. Funding levels for calendar years 1990-1996 are shown in the table below.

The invitation was received on 31 January 1996, and a reply requested no later than 15 February. Dr MCEwan contacted members of Australia's oceanographic research community, but no one was able to attend due to a combination of the short notice, funding considerations, and the concentration of the meeting on matters pertaining to the south-eastern Pacific.

Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (Question No. 542) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) Did the previous Government increase the safety net threshold under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from $407 to $600 with effect from 1 January 1996. (2) Has his attention been drawn to claims that the size of the increase has caused significant concern and hardship particularly amongst pensioners. (3) Will he re-examine the increase with a view to linking increases to changes in the CPI.",147
317,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The previous Government did increase the safety net threshold for general patients (non card holders) from $407 to $600 with effect from 1 January 1996. (2) The threshold applies to general patients (non cardholders), not to pensioners or other concessional patients where the threshold is 52 times the copayment (currently 52 x $2.70 = $140.40). (3) The threshold and the copayments for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are indexed by the Consumer Price Index. This occurs on 1 January each year. Where changes have occurred in the Budget to date from 1 January 1997, the levels will not be indexed until 1 January 1998.

(2) What is the sum of the grant or substance of the other form of assistance provided with respect to each case referred to in part (1). Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Under the Grant-In-Aid (GIA) scheme the following grants were awarded: (i) Australian Lebanese Welfare Committee Inc, Dr Richard Abicair, President, 287 Sydney Road, Coburg, 3058. The Committee was awarded two Level 2 grants, the first effective from 1 October 1994 and the second from 1 October 1995. Both grants are due to expire on 30 September 1997. (ii) Greek Welfare Centre (Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia), His Grace, Bishop Ezekiel of Dervis, Director, 221 Dorcas St, South Melbourne, 3205. Although this organisation is recorded under the agency's main addre8s in South Melbourne, it operates one of its two grants from its sub-branch in 29 Victoria Street, Coburg, 3058. The Coburg sub-branch was awarded one Level 2 grant effective from 1 October 1994 which is due to expire on 30 September 1997. Under the Migrant Resource Centre (MRC) program, Northern Metropolitan Migrant Resource Centre (Broadmeadows) operates a sub-area office, known as the Moreland Outreach Service, which is located at 536 Sydney Road, Brunswick 3046. (2) The sum of the grants/forms of assistance are as follows: (i) Australian Lebanese Welfare Committee Inc was awarded $44,973 for each grant, totalling $89,946 for 1995-96 and a similar amount for 1996-97. (ii) Greek Welfare Centre (Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia) was awarded $44,973 for 1995-96 and a similar amount for 1996-97. (iii) Moreland Outreach Service was funded $6,700 for rent and rates in 1995-96 and 1996-97 funding is currently being considered. M2 Motorway: Ramps (Question No. 554) Mr Ross Cameron asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) Has his attention been drawn 26 February 1996 from a former member for Parramatta advising constituents in Winston Hills NSW that discussions between the Federal and State Governments had led to an agreement on equal funding for the Western facing ramps from Windsor Road to the M2 motorway and that the then Minister for Transport had transferred $8.7 million in Federal road funding on one condition that the new ramps were built. (2) Did the Federal and NSW Governments enter into the agreement referred to in part (1) if so, (a) what is the status of the agreement, (b) what are the terms of the agreement, (c) what mechanism was used to ensure that the funds would be directed to the construction of the ramps and (d) have the funds been spent. (3) If the funds were spent, was it on a purpose other than contained in the agreement; if so, what action will the Commonwealth take to recover the funds and ensure that the terms of the agreement are met. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of statements made by the former Member for Parramatta about ramps to the M2. (2)(a), (b) and (c) There has been no agreement between the Commonwealth and the NSW Government to fund ramps from Windsor Road to the M2. The M2, from Seven Hills to Pennant Hills Road, forms part of the proposed new National Highway route between Liverpool and Hornsby (the so-called Western Sydney Orbital). However, because the M2 is privately funded it has not been declared part of the National Highway System and is therefore ineligible for Federal funding. The former Government had announced, but not committed, substantial funding for the section of the Western Sydney Orbital from the M5 to the M4. There was no commitment to funding the Western Sydney Orbital north of the M4 or any additional work on the M2. (2)(d) and (3) No funds have been paid by the Commonwealth to NSW for this project. Job Seeker Diary (Question No. 565) Mr Crean asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) Has the Minister received advice on the impact upon businesses of the proposed requirement for unemployed persons to maintain a job seeker's diary; if so, will the Minister provide a to a letter dated copy of the advice. (2) At which stages will businesses approached by job seekers be involved in the new processes. (3) What actions will business be required to take. (4) Has the time involved in meeting the requirements by each business been calculated; if so, what were the results. (5) When the Minister's Department reviews a job seeker's activities recorded in the diary, will the onus of proof rest on the job seeker or the business involved. (6) What action will be taken to assist employers who feel obliged to keep additional records to ensure that job seekers are not unfairly penalised when they are unable to prove that they approached an employer. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) There is no requirement of employers to take any action with the 10bseeker Diary. The Diary is simply a record of the customer's job search which will be used by the Department to assist in determining whether a customer is satisfying the activity test. Employers will not be required to fill in entries in the Diary. (2) In a small number of cases, the Department may contact an employer to verify that the customers did in fact contact that employer. (3) Employers may be asked to supply information on whether they had a vacancy and whether the customer applied for that job. Business will not be required to maintain records in order to comply with requests from the Department. (4) The Department anticipates that the amount of time employers spend dealing with requests to be minimal. Only the employer contact details of a small percentage of customers will be followed up, usually by a short phone call. The Department has recently introduced the Employer Contact Unit which provides a single point of call for employers to quickly and more easily provide information to the Department. (5) The Diary will be accepted as being a true record of the customer's job search activity. Employers may be contacted if the Department has doubts regarding the authenticity of the job search. If the employer cannot confirm or deny the contact with the customer, the Department would, in most cases, continue to pay the customer, but may reissue them with a Diary. (6) Employers may wish to discuss this matter with the Department's Employer Contact Unit which may be able to provide helpful advice. Job Seeker Diary (Question No. 567) Mr Crean asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) Has the Minister received advice on the impact upon businesses of the proposed requirement for unemployed persons to maintain a job seeker's diary; if so, will the Minister provide a copy of the advice. (2) When the Minister's Department reviews a job seeker's activities recorded in the diary, will onus of proof rest on the job seeker or the business involved. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I refer Mr Crean to the answer provided to Question 565. Job Seeker Diary (Question No. 568) Mr Crean asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) With respect to the proposed requirement for unemployed persons to maintain a job seeker's diary, to what extent will regional factors be taken into account in determining the number of jobs for which a job seeker must apply each fortnight. (2) Will individual benchmarks be set in each departmental region; if so, what are the details. (3) How will benchmarks be applied to determine an individual's job searching requirements. (4) What factors will be considered in determining benchmarks and what weighting will be given to each factor. (5) Have all area consultative committees been consulted to ensure that specific conditions applying to each departmental region are taken into account when determining regional benchmarks. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (4) Benchmarks are derived from Australian Bureau of Statistics and (ABS) and Department of Employment, Education, Training and (4) Youth Affairs (DEETYA) labour force data and from the ABS business register. The benchmark is designed to reflect the state of each Department of Social Security Regional Office's local labour market. A nominal benchmark ranging between seeking 2 and 8 jobs per fortnight was set, based upon the size of the Region's labour force. The greater the labour force, the higher the benchmark. This was then adjusted up or down depending upon the level of unemployment in the Region. Regions of low unemployment were scaled up, high unemployment Regions were scaled down. Regional Managers may adjust their benchmark up or down to take into account regional factors that may not be evident in the the data used to derive the benchmark. For example, a major employer may open or close or there may be seasonal influences such as fruit picking and the like. ABS employer data was also supplied to Regional Managers to assist them in assessing the state of their local labour market. (2) Benchmarks are developed for each Department of Social Security Regional Office. These are shown below. Regional Managers have the authority to change their benchmark, therefore, the benchmark in use by a Region may vary from that supplied. (3) The benchmark is the starting point for calculating a customer's minimum job search requirement. The customer's job search requirement is then increased or decreased depending on their degree of labour market advantage or disadvantage. Factors that may increase the job search requirement include year 12 or post school qualifications, work skills and recent completion of a labour market program. Factors that may reduce job search include minor disabilities, aged over 50 years, little education or nollimited access to public transport. (5) The benchmarks were developed by the Department of Social Security using the data detailed in (1) DEETYA area consultative committees were not involved.

(2) What environmental issues at the proposed Holsworthy site must the Government take account of under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. (3) Does the Minister endorse the Prime Minister's announcement referred to in part (1). (4) What recommendation will the Minister provide to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development if the EIS now underway recommends against both the Holsworthy and Badgerys Creek sites. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) I have directed that an environmental impact statement (EIS) be prepared in relation to the proposal for a second major airport at either Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy. The Administrative Procedures under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 specify the contents of an EIS and the procedures for determining the matters to be dealt with, and the extent to which those matters shall be dealt with, by an EIS. Draft guidelines for the EIS were released for public comment from 22 July 1996 to 2 September 1996 and submissions received will be taken into account in preparing the final guidelines. (3) I will ensure that the assessment conducted under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 is adequate, open and transparent. Broader questions related to aviation policy and the issue of a second airport should be directed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. (4) It would be inappropriate for me to pre-empt the outcomes of the environmental assessment process. 3 Chicken Meat Processing Industry (Question No. 605) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 22 August 1996: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a very successful chicken meat processing industry within the electoral division of Greenway, conducted by several companies and employing many persons; if not, will he ensure that his department apprises him of the extent of this industry in the electoral division of Greenway. (2) Is he able to say whether persons involved in the chicken meat processing industry will not be affected in any way by the opening up of imports of chicken meat into Australia. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) If the honourable member would like to provide me with briefing on the chicken meat processing industry in the electorate of Greenway I would be happy to receive it. (2) I have gone to great lengths to consult thoroughly with the chicken meat industry in considering both the quarantine and economic impacts on the domestic industry of the proposed import of cooked chicken meat under the proposed Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) protocol. Following discussions I held with industry in May and June this year, I established two joint Industry/Government Working Groups. The first Group considered the potential economic impact of cooked chicken meat imports as well as any transitional adjustment measures which might be considered. While recognising the difficulties of assessing the economic impact without historical data, the Working Group has estimated that imports could represent from 2% to 5% of total Australian chicken meat consumption. The second Group is enabling industry to have technical consultation on the draft quarantine requirements published by AQIS. This Working Group is in the process of concluding its work. All responses and industry concerns will be considered carefully by the Government prior to the finalisation of the quarantine policy process.",148
