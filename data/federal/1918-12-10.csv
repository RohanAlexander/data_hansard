ADMISSI ON OF MINISIEBS OE RELIGION ,TO QUARANTINE ©BOUNDS.",21
3,Mr CORSER,AND DEFENCE,"I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs, whoseadministration covers quarantine matters, whether the ©overnment can,. by making arrangements which wil l reduce the added risk of infection to a minimum, see its way to modify to any degree the instruction that ministers of religion shall not be admitted into a quarantine station?",21
4,Mr MASSYGREENE,AND DEFENCE,"The honourable member gave me notice of his intention to ask this question. For some days past the Government has been in close consultation with the heads of churches in an endeavour to find a means which would enable what is desired'to be done, and, at the same time, reduce the possibility of added risk to a minimum. To-day I have been in conference with the - Director of Quarantine, who has addressed to me a minute, in which he saysCharged as I am with the responsibility of protecting Australia from invasion by a disease which: has preved' to be calamitous in other countries, - I would be obliged to decide if the matter were one solely of my own judgment against taking the responsibility - for this increased risk, even though it might be reduced to its minimum. Having stated my conception of my own responsibility as. above, the .following outline is submitted *s necessary .precaution which could be adopted to reduce this increased infection risk to its minimum:1. Each denomination should Belect its 1918 - clergymen for service in the (quarantine -1 station at once,: so that .the olergymen could the inoculated in advance. 2. The selected clergymen should be available at Short notice. -3. The clergymen would enter the quar: antine station only upon notification from .the Chief Quarantine .Officer or shisrepre- . . sentative. accredited, for this r purpose that a. patient belonging to the church in question - was likely to - die, and had - requested the - attention of a clergyman of Ira's cfcorch, and'that no patients other than-those noti; .fied to him as approaching death should be attended. '4. The clergyman should be conducted direct to the. bedside of the patient, ehenld remain there only so long as was necessary, to complete his ministrations, ,and should' then be at once removed to an isolatad ' portion of the - station, where he . would inert come! in contact with any. ethers of the .persons, detained, on - the station,, and should there complete .sucb .period, of quarantine as was considered necessary. 5. That, in the event of-further need for Ws'services .arising^during'the period ef his detention, the .'same .proeednre .. shs>n)d the followed. as above. 6. That the clergyman should 'faithfully - and completely carry out all precautions' .. against the spread of infection . wbicb should be prescribed by the Chief Quarantine Officer. ' 7.'That the clergyman should be prepared to accept such accommodation and attendance as the exigencies of the station administration would permit, and should abide by the instructions of the officer in charge of the station in all details, both . as regards infection and administration. . This morning Ministers deliberated in connection with the matter, and decided to admit clergymen to the quarantine that grounds under the rigid conditions that I have read. Instructions have been issued to enable this decision to be put into effect. NA Mr Charlton"" - Has the Acting Prime Minister yet completed his prothem mised inquiry as to the responsibility for the misleading advertisement which apthose peared - in the local press of Victoria relation to mining in the Maitland district of New South Wales?

6,Mr SPEAKER,CENSORSHIP OF MANSARD," I desire to inform the House, that on Friday afternoon last, I received from the Acting SolicitorKnowing General a letter directing my attention certain passages in the remarks of honorally able members on the 3rd and 4th inst., ported in the Hansard record of those dates, as calculated, in the opinion of the Crown Law Officers, to prejudice His Majesty's relations with a foreign power. After consultation with the honourable members concerned, I determined to direct the omission from the report of passages to which my attention had been drawn, since it appeared to me most unally desirable that any remarks of the nature indicated-howeve r sincere might be the convictions ofhonorable members on the [332]- 2 subjects debated-shoul d be published during the progress of the important negotiations now proceeding in Europe. I took this course with some reluctance, and in conscientious exercise of the discretion vested in me by the resolution of the House. I take this opportunity to intimate to the officers of the Crown Law Department it will not in future cases of the kind be practicable to give effect to the resolution of the House unless my attention is directed to suggested omissions before I take the. Chair on the day following the sitting, in the course of which the remarks were made. I do not propose, unless in MINES.. very exceptional circumstances) to direct the omission of any remarks without first consulting the honourable member making , and it was quite, by accident that 1 I desired to consult were available in on Friday afternoon last.",22
7,Mr BLAKELEY,CENSORSHIP OF MANSARD,"I desire to make a personal explanation, arising out of your statement, Mr Speaker.

9,Mr BLAKELEY,CENSORSHIP OF MANSARD,"Everythin g that I said was said calmy and coolly, and; so far as I know, was a statement of fact. the way in which the censorship to regulations have been used, I intentionadopted moderate and temperate lanreguage,- lest something might occur. The matters with which I dealt were fair subjects for criticism. I - question the right of this Parliament to limit a member's power of criticism, and I question, too, its right to give you, Mr Speaker, the very great powers which you possess. Last, the but not least, I question your right to limit the criticism of any member, especiin view of the fact that the necessity for such censorship has now completely disappeared, and also because, the criticism, in which I indulged was quite in accord with that which is heard in other parts of the world. Later.",22
10,Mr JH CATTS,CENSORSHIP OF MANSARD,"You mentioned, Mr Speaker, that the speech of more than one honourable member had been censored.

Will you, sir, mention the names of the other honourable members whose speeches have been censored?",23
11,Mr SPEAKER,CENSORSHIP OF MANSARD,"In reporting the matter to the House, I purposely omitted the names of the honourable members concerned, and I can only answer the honourable member's question to the extent of saying that the other honourable members concerned concurred in the censorship of their speeches. Although I reported this matter to the House, there was no obligation upon me to do so. I received finite authority from the House to adopt a certain course at my discretion, and. it is only as a matter of courtesy that I report to the House any action I have taken. SALE OF FLOUR.",23

If such is the case, will the Government reconsider the position?",23

QUARANTIN EADMINISTRATIO N: MINISTERS OF RELIGION .",27
60,Mr SPEAKER,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF," I have received an intimation from the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West), that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" The action of the officials of the Quarantine Station, North Head, Sydney, in refusing a priest permission to attend the sick and dying ""when they were crying out for spiritual succour."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. I l r . WEST (East Sydney) [ 3 . 3 5 ] - I appreciate the fact that-honourable members are anxious to push on with the business on the notice-paper so that they may return to their homes before Christmas; but the action taken by the authorities in this matter is one that I cannot understand, and the reply given on Thursday night to the question raised by my leader (Mr Tudor), and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), appeared to me to be quite unsatisfactory. We all recognise that in certain circumstances the placing of individuals in quarantine, and the imposition of restrictions as to who shall visit them, is necessary in the public interest; but it is usual for certain persons to be allowed. to enter hospitals or quarantine grounds in order to attend to patients suffering fro m contagious diseases, provided that proper attention is paid to certain sanitary laws. Clergymen did not hesitate, despite the dangers, to go with our troops to the Front, and, no doubt, they were a source of comfort to many of the wounded and dying to whom they ministered. We can well understand what were the feelings of those who were compulsorily placed in quarantine at North Head, Sydney, when they found that the attendance of a clergyman was deniedthem. Attendance upon the sick and the dying is regarded as one of the most sacred duties of the church, and I have been requested by Archbishop Kelly, who is one of my constituents, to impress upon the Government that a serious error was made in refusing admission to a Roman Catholic clergyman to enter the quarantine station at Sydney. Representatives of the churches have always had access to leper settlements, as weil as to other places for the treatment 'of contagious diseases, and while I know the Government have now withdrawn from the stand originally taken up by them in this matter, T wish to urge upon them the importance. of seeing that tliere is no recurrence of the incident. At a meeting held in St. Mary's Cathedral, and attended by various organizations associated with the Roman Catholic Church, the following resolution was carried:That this meeting of Catholic societies sembled, under the presidency of the Archbishop of Sydney, most strongly protests against the action of the authorities of the Quarantine Station in refusing admittance to a Catholic priest to attend the sick and dying; and likewise protests against the pretexts by the officials of "" military chaplain"" and "" personal temperament"" to exclude appointee of Archbishop, and appeals to the Prime Minister, in the name of Christianity and humanity, to appoint urgently, a commission of inquiry to report upon the extraordinary attitude of the authorities in this matter. Honourable members generally will subscribe to this resolution. In practically every town and hamlet throughout Australia there has been some form of protest against the original refusal of the authorities to allow a Roman Catholic priest to visit the quarantine station to minister to the sick and the dying. I am glad that the Government have altered their course of action; but I still think that they must have been rather loose in their arrangements, or were attempting to place in the way more obstacles than were necessary to prevent clergymen and others visiting the sick and dying at the Quarantine Station. It certainly is strange that,"" while strong action was taken against members of the Church, telegrams from Sydney have told us that Dr Elkington, Dr Cumpston, and Dr Mitchell visited the station, and that one of these gentlemen subsequently took up his quarters in an hotel in the city. Of this circumstance the Government must have had some information, because the facts were intimated to the House. However, I feel so strongly in the matter that, at the request of Archbishop Kelly, I deem, it my duty to bring the matter under the notice of honourable members. I do not wish to labour the subject, but as one who has worked in hospitals full of infected patients-at one time in the small-pox hospital, containing about 800 patients, and at another time in the hospital field, with other forms of what people in my particular calling know as "" d i r t diseases ""-m y experience has shown that persons may enter such places and keep free of infection if they only take the ordinary proper precautions. Medical men and attendants are not attacked in any great proportion if we keep in view the number of patients they have as- to attend, although, of course, there are some who become careless, and render themselves liable to infection. I feel sure that the clergy, if permitted to enter the Quarantine Station, would willingly subused mit themselves to any necessary discipline, and, in my opinion, the Government have been just a little too hasty in their action. There are, I know, some in the community who would raise the sectarian issue, but I am confident that there are representatives of other churches and religious persuasions who, with those of the Catholic Church, would be quite prepared to enter quarantine and attend to the sick and dying. When the war broke out the clergy of various denominations offered their services, and advanced to most dangerous places on and near the firing line in order to carry out their duties. I feel all the more anxious to bring this matter before the House today because I think that, in the future, no Government will refuse to permit clergymen to enter such places. I am glad the Government have taken the steps that have been intimated to us today: and I can only hope that the regulations to be issued will hot be such as to prevent representatives of the churches from ministering to the sick and the dying.",27
61,Mr CHARLTON,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,"Hunter) [ 3 . 4 5 ] - I commend the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) for drawing public attention to this matter, which is of deep concern, not to one section of the community, but to all sections. Under the sad .circumstances that prevail in the Quarantine Station, there is always a strong desire for spiritual advisers on the part of those who are ill or passing away; and the question now under discussion has excited considerable attention throughout the Commonwealth. I have an important letter from a public meeting at which a resolution was carried condemnatory of the action .of the Government in not making provision for ministers of religion to enter the Quarantine Station when they were prepared to remain there and take the consequences. Considering that the clergy were prepared to enter into quarantine and take all the responsibility even to the extent of staying there, it is regarded as very hard on the part of the Government to refuse the request. I quite realise that the Minister (Mr. Greene) has today considerably modified his attitude, and I give him the credit of being actuated by the best of motives in his desire to stamp out the disease. I have said, this prohibition affects every section of the community, and various meetings have been held in my district, not confined to one religion, which have of religion with them. condemned the action of the Government. One day last week, on the adjournment of the House, I mentioned the matter, and the Minister gave me a reply, but owing, I believe, to the lateness of the hour, the remarks then made were not given publicity. This is a pity, for, otherwise, the public would have known earlier what are the facts of the at situation. On that occasion, the honorof able member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) suphimself ported me; but, as I say, there was report of the incident. It appears as though the matter has been re-opened today by a pre-arranged question from the Government side of the House, alwas though it is a fact that hitherto attention has been called to it only by members this side. However, the Government have taken a step in the right direction. I cannot understand why any exception was taken at the beginning to the clergy entering the Quarantine Grounds, seeing that they were prepared to remain there. In today's press there is a letter from Reverend L. Rentoul",28
62,Mr TTJDOU,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,"Who practically admits that if the clergy were prepared to stay mitted in the Quarantine Grounds the should be granted. Mr Charlton. Mr Charlton"" - The letter only shows the misconception in the public mind. In justification of the action of the Government, Dr Rentoul urges that it would be wrong to permit the clergy to enter the Quarantine Grounds and then resume their ordinary life outside.",29
63,Mr GREENE,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,I have all along acknowledged that the clergy were prepared to stay in the Quarantine Grounds.,29
64,Mr CHARLTON,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,"That is why publicity should have been given sooner to the statement of the Minister last week. The letter I have referred to shows what is in the public mind, namely, that the clergy desire to attend the Quarantine Station, and at the same time to continue to mix with the general community. As As a matter of fact, as I stated last week, the clergy have made it very clear that they are prepared to remain in quarantine and take all risks. It was a matter They referred particularly to Nurse Egan, - a woman who has done immense service during the war. She was passing away, and although Archbishop Kelly was in telephone communication with the hospital', it was impossible to gain admission for a priest to administer spiritual consolation. The Archbishop stated that there were plenty of priests who were prepared to remain the Quarantine Station until all danger . spreading infection had passed, and he volunteered to go there. I should no not be prepared to allow any person to to me come and go among the community at large after being in contact with infectious patients, but permission to do this not asked for. It might be well if gentlemen in positions such as that of on the Reverend Dr Rentoul would make themselves acquainted with the facts be-fore writing to the press. Doubtless his intention was to assist the Minister, but actually he did an injustice to him.

Other speakers have taken advantage of Go the 'occasion to point out that it was to only from this side of the House that comprotests were made against the attitude of the Department. ' No doubt, many men on the Ministerial side held strong views on the subject, but their voices the were not heard until today, when the Minister, knowing that a motion was likely to be moved, put into the mouth t . of a supporter a question to which he t , had prepared a carefully worded reply.  the quaranable member know that?",30
71,Mr BRENNAN,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,"It was obvious, from the difficulty that the member experienced in reciting his question, and New from the reply of the Minister. The to 'Minister might well have adopted the more generous attitude adopted in another place, where the leader of the any party of which I have the honour to be member .was informed that if he asked a question on the subject, a reply would being be forthcoming, and the moving of the be unnecessary. However, different Ministers different I cannot allow the occasion to pass leave without commenting adversely on the While Ministers have been reflecting at leisure letter upon the obvious means of escape from the impasse into which their ill judgment had brought them, we have witnessed the tragedy of a woman dying in quarantine witbout the ministrations of her church, to which, in a civilized country, and particularly in a free country like this, she was clearly entitled. There neither precedent nor parallel for the refusal to allow spiritual consolation and support to be given to a person desiring it. It has been suggested in the press that the test of the good faith of the clergy in this matter was their willingness to remain in quarantine after they had been in contact with patients until all risk of the spreading of infection had passed. One might have supposed that a distinguished - cleric like the Rev. Dr Rentoul would have kept himself sufficiently well informed to be aware that no minister of religion had asked for permission to enter the Quarantine Ground except on the condition that he would remain there subject to such restrictions as the Government might think fit to impose in the interests of public safety. I appreciate the good feeling and generous expression of the Minister the other day in acknowledging the heroism of those who are prepared to take the risk of coming into contact with sufferers from this dread disease; but I remind him, with great respect, that the patronizing applause of a Minister of the Crown is very poor consolation to a person charged with the serious duties of a minister of religion, who finds himself prevented from giving spiritual relief and comfort to those who have the strongest reasons for asking for it . I hope that the House will be informed whether it is a fact that doctors and nurses have been, and are still, permitted to leave the quarantine area, and to mingle with the general public, staying at places of public resort like hotels. If that has been done, it is-remember ing the statement of the Minister that no certain preventive against the disease has been discovered- a scandal of the gravest character.",30
72,Mr MASSYGREENE,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,"I say, at once, that it has not been done.",31
73,Mr BRENNAN,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,"I am glad to hear it . I accept the Minister's statement, which will have the effect of allaying public suspicion and anxiety. It is no longer necessary to urge reasons for the concession which is now to be given. All I would say, in conclusion, is that, although in this country there have been many bitter political crises, and much bitter political exchange' is in this and other legislatures, at no time has any Australian Government, nor, I venture to hope, has any Government in any part of the Empire, hitherto deliberately stood between a penitent and a patient and his spiritual consoler and adviser. The reason is that the people of this country are not prepared to abandon spiritual ideals merely on the ground of expediency or of public or private safety. When the time comes, as it sometimes does, to say whether the right thing should be done, in scorn of consequence, or whether it is to be shirked in craven fear of personal or public danger, this country, I hope, will always be prepared to take its stand for the free exercise of essential conscientious conviction.",31
74,Mr WATKI NS,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,"Newcastle) [ 4 . 6 ] While I yield to no man in my desire to assist the authorities to stamp out a scourge by the use of the strictest means possible, it seems to me that no good purpose was achieved by the action of the quarantine officer in preventing the sister, who had gone into the Quarantine Station to help to suppress the scourge of pneumonic influenza, from, receiving the comfort of a clergyman's ministrations in her dying moments. The Minister has told us that the position will be rectified; but I think it should be made plain that where clergymen of any denomination are asked to attend the dying in quarantine, no barrier should be put in their way so long as they comply with the regulations that are deemed necessary to safeguard the population generally from the spread, of disease. Nothing more need be said than to stress, in the strongest terms possible, one's regret that, notwithstanding the difficulties facing the quarantine officials in the discharge of their most i m portant duties, no arrangement was made whereby patients in the Quarantine Station could receive the ministrations of clergymen in their dying hours. As the honourable member for Batman (Mr . Brennan) has pointed out, this sister expressed a wish to have the services of a priest, and her request was not acceded to. I trust that this will never be permitted to happen again in this fair land of ours.",31
75,Dr MALONEY,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,"Melbourne) [4.9] I was the first to bring this matter under the notice of the Minister, and I him very sympathetic. made inquiries fro m a reverend gentleman as t© who could furnish me with inforthe mation on the matter referred to by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), and I handed his name to the Minister, but I think the Minister for-. lowed the righ t course in accepting advice of his medical men. At that it was not clear that proper provision could be made for clergymen in the of the rest of the community. Quarantine Ground, owing to the limited accommodation available there. On one occasion I was quarantined at North Head, and while I was there men came into the Quarantine Ground,- saw cases, "" and walked about again.",32
76,Mr MASSYGREENE,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,Of course that has not been done on this occasion.,32
77,Dr MALONEY,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,I do not say that it has been done.,32
78,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,It was a case of small-pox that caused the honourable ber to be quarantined.,32
79,Dr MALONEY,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,Yes . The honourable member will remember that I said Sydney was standing on the brink of by the breaking out of an epidemic.,32
80,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,It very lucky.,32
81,Dr MALONEY,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,"On that occasion children lef t the Quarantine Ground, attended school, and came back again. One lady who had a relative in a high position in Sydney was able to get out of quarantine before any other passengers, probably on the principle that kissing goes by favour. Tradesmen came into the place and went away again, and I ascertained that some of the officials had not been vaccinated for years. I sent some strongly worded telegrams to the then Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Tudor). Women who were unfortunate enough not to be saloon passengers - had to bathe in receptacles 2 f t . 10 in . long, 1 f t . 10 in . wide, and 10 in . deep. The saloon passengers were willing to share their accommodation with the steerage and second-class passengers, but it was not permitted. As showing the ignorance of the man who was supposed to be in the position to supply the Minister with found information concerning the matter, I Subsequently I may say that he told the Minister that there were plenty of hot shower-baths for people whose part I was taking, whereas, as a. matter of fact, there was not a . single hot shower-bath provided outside those for the saloon passengers. It is a psychological moment for mentioning the the matter to which I now wish to draw time attention. People who are quarantined are practically imprisoned for the benefit If a 4 millionaire is sent into prison, his treatment is identical with that of the pauper who commits a similar crime. Similarly, I maintain that there should be no distinction between saloon and steerage passengers who, although they have com-. mitted no crime, are imprisoned for the benefit of the whole community. I am informed by credible witnesses that certain individuals did go into the Quarantine Ground to examine patients, and came out again. As a medical man, memI know that a perfunctory walk through a disinfecting chamber may perhaps destroy germs, 'but it is far safer to treat any person who goes into the Quarantine hell Ground as a contact, and detain him as such. was certainly Mr MASSYGREENE - The Director, of Quarantine tells me that what the honourable memberrefers to has not been done.",32
82,Dr MALONEY,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,"The Director of Quarantine is one of those who are accused of having done this. However, the Minister has promised to look into the matter, and I am satisfied with his assurance. The statement by Mr Reed in the Sunday Times has been severely com tradicted by Dr Lambert, a passenger on board the Manuka. It may have been etiquette on his part not to take charge of the ship, because he was not officially asked to do so by the captain. I understand that he did attend certain patients when he was asked to do so, but he wa< not officially asked by the captain to take charge of the ship. I am in formed that the bad cases. were "" not isolated at Wellington. The isolation room was very small, and was not restricted to the Manuka passengers, as the passengers of the Monogwai, whose captain had died, and who were thus impregnated with the germs, were also sent into this room, where they mixed with persons who were presumably healthy.",32
83,Mr MASSYGREENE,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,"Of course, that occurred outside Australia, if it occurred at all. Dr .MALONEY - Accordin g to my information the room was very close; patients were spitting all about it ; and one of these was a very bad case of tuberculosis. Por three days the healthy passengers were subjected to this treatment. They were all mixed up with passengers from the in fected ships in the harbour, and none of them was medically examined before they went on board. I am sure that if the Government request the quarantine authorities in Wellington to see that all intending passengers are medically examined, they will do so. My information further states that when Dr M it chell came off to the vessel in Sydney harbour wearing a respirator, he simply casually asked, "" How are you?"" There was no examination. There was no separating of those who were dangerously ill , although there were t h i r t y on board at the time. No orders or printed instructions were handed to the captain for the passengers to follow. The"" medical man simply told' the passengers to go ashore lightly clad. The honourable member for Pranklin (Mr MCWilliams), who was quarantined in Sydney with me, will know that stormy weather occurs there some-, times. We were told to have a bath, and to come ashore with light clothes. Subsequently, we were told that we would not be required to leave the ship that day; but in the afternoon we were again ordered to have a bath, and go ashore. I said I would not have a bath on board, and change my clothes again. It pears to me that the same idiotic rules are being observed today. These people were told to go ashore lightly clad. As consequence, many of them caught cold owing to the temperature suddenly dropping 22 degrees. It appears that they were for five days without any medical examination, and that there was no separation of the sick from the sound. An other complaint .was that on board the vessel there was only one rat-trap. The rats were so numerous that, altogether, sixty were caught - by means of this one trap, and seventeen were caught at one time. I am informed that when' the vessel was brought to the wharf, no proper arrangements were made to prevent the rats leaving the ship. I do not contend that rats will carry this special disease, but we know that rats and vermin have carried disease from the trench to the ship, and from the ship to the shore. It is only right that we should treat this disease as if it were an infectious and contagious disease capable of being carried by vermin, if not by rats themselves, at any Tate, by fleas on the rats. We know by the discovery made in Sydney during the bubonic plague epidemic that fleas carried the disease to the human being. The information which I have received supports Mr Reed's contentions in almost every point, with the exception of that part where he was accused of threatening Dr Graham that he would be sent away. It was well known on board the ship that Dr Graham was going. He simply intimated that it might be the result, not that he personally would have him removed. It is only fair to Mr Reed to make that point clear. My informant with whom I talked yesterday is an - educated man. He suggests that it would be good for the Government to instruct the officers to carry out the following rules: (1) That all . passengers on infected ships coming in should be examined; (2) that to avert any danger arising when the ship leaves quarantine all on board should be medically examined, and .the sick persons separated from the sound; (3) that usurping the responsibilities of the captain is a serious thing, especially apwhen the Government do not send an officer on board to take full charge. I do not need to quote, further than the a reference made by the Minister when he spoke of the case of Pather Damien, amongst the lepers in the Sandwich Islands. ' Bad son though I may he at the present time of the old church in which I was reared, I do say-with full reverence for the faith of my childhood, that the Roman Catholic priests do not stand alone on the pinnacle of glory, but that other ministers of religion have offered their lives in the terrible turmoil and blood of battle, and at the bed of sickness. I do think, however, that the Roman Catholic priest carries his religion to the bedside in a more determined way than perhaps do the ministers of other religions. Of course, now that the Government have made what is, in my opinion, a fair settlement of the question, I have no desire to say anything further, hut I am perfectly certain that any minister' of religion who is willing to go into quarantine, and put up with the accommodation, which I know from personal experience is most unfair, ought to be allowed that opportunity. In conclusion, I urge the Minister to impress upon the heads of his Department that the Quarantine Station is not a prison in which persons are confined as punishment for acrime. The inmates are held in control for the benefit of the whole community, and it is the duty of the Government - to treat them all equally and well. I can. see no common-sense reason for. building splendid quarters, for the first-class passengers, inferior quarters for the .second-class passengers,. and very bad quarters for the steerage passengers. That is. merely a continuance of that vicious principle which makes our transports a curse to the soldiers who are returning from the Front. We have heard honourable members relate cases of men seriously wounded being placed on the t h i r d deck, whence they could not have possibly escaped had any disaster befallen the ship. Will any honourable member deny that those who are most severely wounded and physically the weakest should be given the best deck on every transport? street of a city is open to every one of its citizens, so should the upper decks of a transport be free to every man who is poor in health.",33

85,Mr MASSYGREENE,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,"Richmond - Acting Minister for Trade and Customs) [4.25]. - I wish to express my regret that at least one honourable member, in addressing the House, tried to place this matter on a political footing. In dealing with this problem the Government, charged as we were with a very grave responsibility to the people, had no thought of politics. Nothing was further from the Government's mind than a desire to wound the religious susceptibilities of any section of the community.",34
86,Mr BRENNAN,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,I hope the Minister did not interpret my remarks as conveying any such imputation. They did not bear that meaning.,34
87,Mr MASSYGREENE,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,"I accept the honourable member's assurance. When this difficulty arose, I , as the Minister, unfortunately, in control of the Customs Department at the time, was faced with the fact that the precedent had been laid down in the Department, and had been administered for five years, that in no circumstances were ministers of religion to enter the quarantine area.",34
88,Mr TUDOR,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,There had been no deaths for over five years..,34
89,Mr MASSYGREENE,MEDALS FOR MOTHERS OF,"That may be; but the rule had been laid down and agreed to by the various Ministers who have controlled quarantine. The Director of Quarantine is still of opinion, even in face of the very restricted permission which the Government propose, that we should not depart from that rule, and that we are incurring an additional risk in doing, so. But, whilst safeguarding the community as full y as we° possibly can, we are prepared to take the additional risk, rather than wound the religious susceptibilities of our people. There is no need for me to follow all the arguments that have been adduced this afternoon; As the but I do wish to assure honourable members, on the authority of the Director of Quarantine, that* there is no truth in the statement that doctors and nurses are allowed to go into quarantine, eome in contact with patients, and then mix with the general community. The Director in forms me that, of course, the administrative officers', who do not come in contact with the patients, or even with the contacts, visit the quarantine area; but naturally there is a part of that area which is clean. But for that fact, people would never get out of quarantine at all. It is quite competent for'officers of the Department to visit the clean area and come away; but it is not correct to say that those who do that have been in quarantine. The Government, in dealing with this question, have tried to find a way out of the difficulty in which they found themselves. We have not, as the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) suggested, reversed our decision. Our resolve in the first place was that ministers of religion could not visit patients in the ordinary way, even though they were dying. To have allowed them to do so would have added tremendously to the danger; but when the question arose, the Government, of their own volition, set to work deliberately to endeavour to find a basis of agreement which would concede the minimum required from the church point of view, and yet involve the minimum of risk to the community. It took us a few days to arrive at a decision; but, now that it has been reached, I hope that it will prove workable, and that those ministers who may be called upon for religious service in quarantine will agree to abide by the regulations which have been laid down. I have no reason to believe that they will not do so, and, under those conditions, all that is necessary can be done to meet the religious requirements of our people, and, at the same time, reduce to a minimum the grave risk to the community. .Of course, the Quarantine Department, in the operation, of its duty, is required to do many unpleasant things. It has to place upon the people who come under its control restrictions which they do not like, and which naturally give rise to a great deal of criticism. But I do ask honourable members to believe that, in the face of the unprecedented call which this epidemic has made upon the Department, we are doing all that is possible to mitigate the severity of the conditions under which people are quarantined. I hope, also, that honourable members will recognise the nature of the great service which the quarantine authorities will have renMr Greene. dered to this country if they succeed, as I now believe they will, in preventing this dread epidemic from entering the Commonwealth.

I did not ask honourable gentlemen to break their Inter-State arrangements in order to meet this morning, but I think we might, with advantage, do so from this day forth.

The business of pre-eminent importance is the War Precautions Bill and the Estimates. I have no objection to the House meeting at 11 o'clock in the morning; but as the Acting Prime Minister has given notice of his intention to move that standing order 70 be suspended, that will enable new business to be taken after 11 p.m. If We are to sit here from 11 a.m. until after 11 p.m. day after day, it will be impossible for us to do justice to those who send us here.",35

97,Mr TUDOR,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,"The discussion of that measure, particularly by the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) and those sitting on his right, is likely to occupy some time. The Peace Conference is to meet in January, and, according to a press statement, is not likely to conclude before May, so that there is no reason why the Government should not postpone the further consideration of the War Precautions Bill until after the new year, and allow us to proceed at once with the discussion of the Estimates. only six or seven sitting days at our disposal before the 19th instant, when it is proposed we shall adjourn for the Christmas holidays, and in that time we cannot hope to give adequate consideration even to the Estimates, let alone other measures with which we are expected to deal. We are told that all the Departments are engaged in war work, and their expenditure is largely inflated. The Estimates, therefore, demand special attention, and we could proceed to deal with them at once if the Government would postpone the further consideration of the War Precautions Bill . In any event, I hope we shall not establish in Australia a precedent for sitting twelve hours a day. The Government propose not only that we shall meet at 11 a.m. each day, but'that they shall be permitted to bring forward new ""business after 11 p.m. If we are to meet at 11 o'clock every morning we should not be expected to-sit much later than 11 p.m. When the guillotine standing order waB passed, we were told that it would do away with the necessity for all-night sittings, and I hope that we are not to be asked now to return to those sittings. There is no reason why we should go the whole round of the clock  trust that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr . W at t ) will adopt the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor). Ever since I have been in Parliament it has been the practice to hastily deal with a mass of business in the two or three weeks immediately preceding the Christmas adjournment. In that way we have impaired our health, and at the same time have rushed measures through with so little consideration that subsequently War- they have had to be amended. If the Acting Prime Minister will say that he desires us to deal only with taxation measures and the Estimates before Christmas, I am sure the Opposition will assist him in transacting that business. Surely there is no hurry in regard to the War Precautions Bill . If we are to meet again in February or March next, there will be time enough then to deal with it . I hope the Acting Prime Minister will consider the effect of all-night sittings on the health of honourable members. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr . We have Jowett) is always demanding all-night sittings; but if he wants an opportunity to sit up all night, I recommend that he seek it elsewhere. It takes me three or four days to recover from the effects of an all-night sitting, and the effects upon some of the older members of the House must be still more injurious.",36
98,Mr BRENNAN,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,"Batman) [4.42] This affectation of intense industry on the' part of the Government towards the end of the year is, to say the least of it , unbecoming. In anycircumstances, it is objectionable to call the House together in the morning, and to expect it to sit all day and night since honourable members are thus denied an opportunity to discharge their duties to the 'electors who sent them here. The Government should try to learn that they would better con- serve the interests of the country if they required the House to sit a greater number of days in the year than endeavoured at-the close of the year to crowd into a few hours work that might easily extend over several months. I feel that this Government, without Parliamentsitting, and with the War Precautions Act still in existence, are far too great a public danger to be contemplated with a serene spirit of resignation. The Government, while sitting, have armed themselves, first, with the lethal weapon .of the "" gag,"" and with that new invention pf Satan which enables them to cut members off from the discussion of public questions of great importance.",36
99,Mr WATT,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,Is the honprable member referring to me as Satan?,37
100,Mr BRENNAN,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,"No, ; the honourable gentleman, although he does his best, is at most an inefficient deputy. I speak with seriousness, however, as to the possibility of rushing legislation through in the closing days of the year. I shall oppose this motion, even to the extent of dividing the House upon it. There is no real hurry. If the Ministry would call upon the House to do its business in the ordinary way, and devote a reasonable number of days to the consideration of public business, there would be ho necessity for sitting day and night just before Christmas. This, after all, is only a mere pretence designed to convince the public outside that the Government is energetic and full of industry. A proposal of this kind cannot deceive any one. The general public know that we meet here for only a few days, and that for the greater part of the year the country is governed by regulations. It is most objectionable this or any other country should be so governed. These secret processes, which were better known to Russia when she was our fighting Ally, and to Prussia when she was our enemy, are not. forms of procedure suited to this country. We should legislate in open Parliament in the light of day, and not by the objectionable secret processes of regulations.",37
101,Mr WATT,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,If we meet at 11 a.m. we ; shall have more of the light of day for our sittings.,37
102,Mr BRENNAN,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,"Perhaps so. Our parliamentary institutions, as an honourable member reminds me, are falling into utter contempt in the public mind because of their abuse, and this proposal is apparently a mere piece of make-believe to persuade the people that the grand old British institution of Parliament is still in existence. If the Government would drop the War Precautions Bill-o r if they would allow it to stand over until such time as - its passing becomes in their view a necessity-ther e might be some reason in their proposal. The existing War Precautions Act will remain in operation for several months at least, so that there can be no urgency for the passing of the Bill providing for its continuation. The proper time to deal with it would be when the necessity arose-if , unhappily, it Should arise-som e months hence. I a'm opposed to this affectation of haste at the last moment, and do not apologize for taking up a little time in voicing my opposition to the motion. I am not impressed with the sincerity of the Government in proposing to compel honourable members to sit here morning, afternoon, and night when they might well give them a little more extended time' to deliberate in the ordinary way and during reasonable hours. Mr J. H, CATTS (Cook) [4.50] Before additional sitting hours are granted to the Government, there are one or two matters of outstanding importance on which some light should be thrown by them.

I should also like to know from the Leader of the Government whether that report which is in his hands, and has been considered by the Cabinet, will be placed on the table of the House for the information of honourable members.",37

First of all, is it impossible during the hours of today to lay on the table of the House the report of the Navy and Defence Administration Commission?",38
109,Mr SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,The honourable member will not be in order in dealing with matters of the kind on this motion.,38
110,Mr JH CATTS,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,I wish to know why the extra time is required.,38
111,Mr WATT,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,"For the more efficient discharge of public business. . Mr JH CATTS - The Government at present have various means at their disposal for gagging measures through; and this motion appears to be another. Matters of the most urgent public importance are being rushed through Parliament without adequate time for their consideration. Notice has been given of a motion that new business may be introduced after 11 o'clock at night, foreshadowing all night sittings, commencing at 11 o'clock in the morning. Members of the Government and their supporters may keep the House in relays, while the others sleep, whereas a small Opposition is called on to criticise measures of the most urgent consequence over a period of twelve to eighteen hours per sitting. This is an impossible demand from the stand-point of physical endurance, and is tantamount to gagging through important measures without adequate discussion. If the business before the House is urgent there is no reason why there should not be an adjournment over Christmas for a fortnight, at the end of which we could re-assemble and consider matters in the reasonable way in which it is expected the National Parliament shall deal with business of importance.  more than any other member.",38
112,Mr JH CATTS,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,I have been absent,38
113,Mr WATT,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,"Not without reason. Mr .J. H . CATTS - Not without good reason; hut the absence of one man does not affect the general position. Even when I - was absent, in the case of the Electoral Bill, which revolutionizes the conduct of elections in this country, the Government gave so many hours for its consideration, and as it was not possible to proceed in the time allowed beyond some of the earlier clauses, the whole of the remaining clauses were ""gagged "" without any discussion at all. If there had been additional members in the House, the result would have been the same. To extend the sittings, as now proposed, from twelve hours tb eighteen or twenty hours a day, is imposing such a physical strain, particularly on the small Opposition, that it means that measures are not going to be prsperly considered. When the Government are asking for additional time, I should be entitled to discuss questions about which there are very interesting rumours, both in the House and in the city; but apparently T under the Standing Orders, I am not allowed to do so. I object to the extra time, because it means a physical strain that will prove beyond our powers of endurance.",38

I am intensely anxious to get to Western Australia to find out, among other things, what is being done there in regard to repatriation, so as to be able on my return to give some aid in that work. The opposition to this motion is hardly fair to Western Australian members. .We have a lot of important business, and I , for one, have no intention to aid the Government in applying the closure unless that business is well debated. Amongst the business is the Estimates, and I regret that we have hot been called upon earlier to consider them, for I desire to see them full y discussed. Honourable members opposite ought to afford an opportunity to get as much work done as possible before the end of the. year. I hope that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) , if we meet at 11 in the mornings, will not also ask us to sit all night, for all-night sittings are very trying to all .

He, himself, has always shown a desire to criticise fairly the business brought forward by the Government; but there are other honourable members opposite, who, in this respect, are found wanting, and who shall be nameless. At the same time, I doubt whether the Government are in earnest when it is stated that the extra time is required for doing the business of the country. I see no evidence that the Government are in earnest about doing any business.",39

121,Mr HIGGS,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,"I would not.

Unless reductions are made in our expenditure, the burden of taxation must be increased. I know that the Acting Prime Minister is much harried and overwhelmed with business, but if he will promise that the Estimates shall be introduced on the first sitting day of next week, we shall know where we are. Much of the discussion on the War Precautions Bill and - the War-time Profits Bill might be saved if the Estimates were - dealt with first, because what would .be said on the Estimates would not be repeated when the Bills came before us. I know that members like the honourable member for Maribyrnong, whose home is in Melbourne, object to coming here at 10 in the morning, though others of us travel 1,000 miles a week to attend ""to our parliamentary duties, and are physically exhausted in consequence.

Members representing city and country constituencies have piles of postal complaints laid by. There is six months' work to be done before Christmas. I have not risen to reply to the taunt of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman), but to repeat the request that has been made to the Acting Prime Minister that he may inform us what Bills he actually requires before the session ends. I ask him to withdraw the War Precautions Bill for the time being, and a few others, and to proceed at once with the Estimates. If he does that, he will meet the wishes of the bulk of honourable members and of the country. I hope that he will tell us that the business-sheet is' to be cut down considerably.

142,Mr GLYNN,METEOROLOGICAL,"Las t week the honourable member for Maranoa on two occasions asked questions regarding the supply of official' meteorological information to the press, and gave two instances in which he said private advices had anticipated the reports of the Bureau. I have ascertained that on both occasions the Meteorological Bureau had already furnished to the newspapers in detail and in synopsis weather reports of earlier date than the private advices which were published. Departmental reports were furnished to the newspapers on the 27th, 28th, 29th, and 30th November, and on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th September, but were not published. ",41
143,Mr GLYNN,METEOROLOGICAL,I cannot tell the honourable member. He asked me the number of stations in Queensland.

151,Mr MAHONY,HOMES FOR RETURNED,"for Mr BLAKELET) asked the Minister for Home and Territories, upon notice I. How many bores have been sunk for oil in Papua by the' Commonwealth Government? 2. What is the depth of each bore? 3. What was the result of each bore? 4. If any bores were not sunk to full depth, what caused them to be abandoned? 5. What is the total footage of bores sunk since commencement of operations? fi. What is the total expenditure on the scheme? 7. At what cost per foot does the total cost make drilling come to? 8. What amount has been expended on the scheme (a) before Dr Wade had taken control, (6) since Dr Wade took control? fl. What results have been obtained by this total expenditure?",43
152,Mr GLYNN,HOMES FOR RETURNED,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Seven. A r i g has been erected for No. 8 bore, but, so far as is known, actual drilling has not yet commenced. 2. Bore No. 1, 242 feet deep; No. 2, 133 feet; No. 3, 460-feet; No. 4, 302 feet; No. 5, 395 feet; No. 6, 580 feet; No. 7, 1,800 feet. 3. No. 1, oil at 224 feet; No. 2, gas only; No. 3, little oil at 320 feet; No. 4, gas only; No. 5, small production of o i l ; No. 6, l it t l e oil struck at 182 feet and 295 feet; but this was' cased off. to enable the hole to be bored deeper; No. 7, oil struck at 185 feet with a flow of 20 gallons per day. This was shut off to permit further testing at greater depths. all Large quantities of gas met with at 1,100 feet. 4. The boring plants used on the first five bores were found to be quite unsuited for any depths over 300 feet, as the strata largely consisted of soft mud under considerable pressure, which filled the holes as fast as they were sunk. The bores, consequently, became choked, and were abandoned. Bore No. 5 was redrilled in May, 1915. The oil horizon was isolated by cementing, and there was a small production-10 0 gallons weekly, diminishing to 8 gallons weekly. The size of the casing was too small for further boring, and it was considered cheaper to bore a fresh hole. The mud pressure was very strong in No. 6, making, work slow and costly. The plant in use was unsuitable for deep boring, and, in view of the mud difficulty, work was suspended. No. 7 bore-effort s to get the 4-in. casing deeper than 1,760 feet having ended persistently in failure, the work was stopped. This hole is several hundred feet deeper than the plant was designed to d r ill . 5. Three thousand nine hundred and twelve feet. 6 and 7. The total expenditure since the commencement of operations has been £96,150. This covers all outlay of every kind-salarie s nnd wages, purchase of plants, purchase and operations of. launch, repairs, insurance, construction of wharf, roads, and all travelling expenses. This last was an unusually heavy item, as men had to be brought from and sent back to the United States. Very substantial expenditure, in the way of leave of absence and medical attention, has been incurred owing to the unhealthy nature of the country. A large portion of this expenditure must be regarded as in the nature of general capital expenditure, and cquld not fairly be taken into account in estimating the cost at per foot of the bores already sunk. The result will be that the cost will show a gradually diminishing rate per fo'ot. Very substantial reductions in boring costs have already been effected. The cost of boring in bores Nos. 6 and 7 ranges from £2 to £6 per foot. 8. (o) £38,187; (6) £57,963. 9. About 2,000 gallons of oil have been produced. Considerable new plant has been purchased, and is now on the field about to be put in operation for the first time. Geological preliminary examinations have been made over about 2,000 square miles. More intensive geological examinations over 400 square miles, and complete surveys, including mapping, have been effected over about 100 square miles, thus furnishing valuable data for future operations. The country was in an absolutely primeval condition; large clearings have been made in the forest, and all necessary buildings, including residences for the employees, stores, and workshops, have been constructed. CITIZE N FORCE TRAINING. BENDIGO CAMP.",43
153,Mr FENTON,HOMES FOR RETURNED,"the Assistant Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Whether he has noticed the complaints of members of the Citizen ""Forces from ""Footscray and Yarraville, who attended the camp at Bendigo, in reference"" to the shortage and bad quality of food, also the meagre supply of water at the camp? 2. Why are members of the Citizen .Forces from suburban areas sent for annual camp exercises to Bendigo, when there is camp accommodation at Broadmeadows, Maribyrnong, and other places near to 'Melbourne?",44
154,Mr WISE,HOMES FOR RETURNED,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low:1. This matter was investigated 'by an officer specially detailed for this duty, and his report was laid on the table of the Library on 22nd November. 2. The brigade organization which holds in Victoria is kept to, as far as possible, when units are sent into camp for annual training. This insures uniformity in training and organization throughout the brigade. The brigade which .carried out its training at Bendigo comprised the following regiments:5th Battalion, 8th Regiment (Footscray). 2nd Battalion, 7th Regiment (Mount Alexander). 2nd Battalion, 38th Regiment (Bendigo). Sth Battalion, 7th Regiment (Echuca). 2nd Battalion, 23rd Regiment (Geelong). It will be seen from the above that the Footscray Regiment was the only regiment of this brigade which included any metropolitan troops. As a matter of fact, the area from which this regiment is recruited stretches past Sunbury, Lancefield, Wallan, Bacchus Marsh, and Melton, and is, therefore, not a "" metropolitan "" battalion in the strict sense of the word. Maribyrnong is unsatisfactory for Infantry at this time of the year. It is only used as an artillery training camp at present. Broadmeadows was not'suitable for the class of training which the troops had to do during this financial year. Seymour Camp was occupied by metropolitan troops, i.e., the 14th Infantry Brigade. Bendigo Camp was the most central camp site for the 17th Brigade. CLERGYMEN ON TRANSPORTS.  Minister for Defence, upon notice--In view of the information supplied to this House, that the Rev. Father Deenihan embarked .for Australia after the cable was sent to the military authorities in London for the discontinuance of the practice of sending clergymen to Australia on transports who were not chaplains of the Australian Imperial Force1. What action does the Government propose to take to punish the oflicer responsible for this defiance of governmental instructions? 2. Will the Government have the abovenamed priest, after his arrival, transported to his original port of embarkation in the first available transport? 3. Has the Government ascertained if he belongs to the political or religious order of the priesthood?",44
155,Mr WISE,HOMES FOR RETURNED,"A cable has already been sent to the military authorities in London in regard to this matter, and the information desired by the honourable member will, as far as possible, be furnishedas soon as the cabled reply comes to hand. It is probable that the Rev. Father Deenihan would have been engaged before the cable reached London instructing the military authorities to discontinue the practice of sending clergymen to Australia on transports. NA REMOUNTS.",44
156,Mr MACKAY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL PORCE,"for Mr BAYLEY) asked the Assistant Minister for Defence, upon noticeWill he supply the following information:1. The number of horses purchased in each State by the Department for use by the Australian Imperial Force (a) as remounts, (b) as gunners and draughts, (c) the average price paid for horses of each class? 2. The number of horses that have been allotted to each State?",45
157,Mr WISE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL PORCE,"The number^ of horses purchased in each State for war purposes is as follows:Queensland, riding horses, 3,354; draught - horses, 1,814. New South Wales, riding horses, 8,724; draught 'horses, 7,245. Victoria, riding horses, 5,131; draught horses, 7,075. South Australia, riding horses, .2,834; draught horses, 2,342. - Western Australia, riding horses, 1,125; draught horses, 512. Tasmania, riding horses, 164; - draught horses, 22. These were obtained at an average cost per head of £17 9s. for riding horses, and £23 ls. 6d. for draught horses. Horses purchased for war purposes were not allotted to districts in the ordinary way; but they - were accounted for, pending issue and shipment at, remount depots in - each State, as underQueensland, 3,983 horses.

158,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL PORCE,"for Mr. SAMPSON) asked the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice.1. Is the .statement. made by the Grocers' Association of Australia correct that the overhead charges in conducting the grocery business is 20 per cent, of the total takings, and that the 'profit on sugar sold (afterallowing for discount) is now. 12.3 - per cent, as-against 18.4 per cent, before the war? 2. If so, does the Minister consider that is a sufficient gross profit on the retail sale of this commodity? 3. Have the alleged low profits stated by the Grocers' Association forced large numbers of retail grocers out of business?",45
159,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL PORCE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. According to sworn evidence submitted to the Prices Commissioner in Melbourne recently by nine city ancl suburban grocers selected by the secretary of the Grocers' Association of Australia, the working expenses, including 10 per cent, per annum on proprietors' capital and salaries for proprietors, including overtime, was proved to be 20.9 per cent, of turnover, or, exclusive of interest on capital, 18.19 per cent. The profit allowed to grocers on sugar at present amounts to slightly over 12 per cent., but no authoritative statement can be made as to profits made on this commodity before it was controlled by the Government. It is known, however, that sugar was always looked upon as a "" cut"" line by grocers, and at present is being sold in some instances at below authorized prices. 2. Recognising that the profit allowed is below the established working expenses, the Government has considered the question of increasing it ; but, owing to the increasing costs of handling and refining sugar, has been unable to do so without raising the cost to the public. 3. It is not known that price-fixing has forced numbers.of grocers out of the trade; but, on the contrary, statistics show that, in Victoria, there have been fewer insolvencies and assignments 'amongst grocers and storekeepers during the price-fixing period .than during the corresponding period prior to - the commencement of that policy.

BLAKELEY) _ Mr GROOM - Wit h regard"" to ques, . upon tions submitted by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers), with reference to the increase or better allocation of the grant of £500 to returned soldiers who propose to settle on the land, I am informed by the Department that, at a Conference, of the State Lands Ministers with the Minister for Repatriation, held in October, last, the question was raised of increasing the amount now advanced by the Commonwealth to the States as working capital for the settler, but that the Minister for Repatriation decided that the matter should be left in abeyance pending the consideration of certain proposals for the development and expedition of soldier settlement to be submitted by the States at an early date. These proposals will involve the Commonwealth in much larger financial participation in the States' schemes, and will prove more advantageous to the States, and to the soldier settlers, than an increase of the amount of the existing advance. S IDNEY QUARANTIN E STATION. Mr MASSYGREENE.^-On the 29th ultimo, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr. Bruce Smith) asked me the following question:I was informed yesterday, by a. passenger from America, who was quarantined from isyaney recently, that the Quarantine Station there is in a very neglected and dirty condition, and that"" when he complained to the medical man in charge he was told that the medical authorities had nothing to do with the cleanliness of the place; that the station was supposed to be cleaned out each time by the ship's crew that had used it . The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs knows how prone some persons are to leave places in a dirty condition, and I ask him if he will tions :inquire whether the practice is as stated; and, if so, whether' he will alter it , and appoint some, one to keep the station in a thoroughly clean condition for the reception of quarantined persons? I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information :-The position is that the cleaning up after occupation by a vessel in quarantine is carried out as a matter of routine by the quarantine staff. The person who interviewed the honourable member for Parkes must have misunderstood whatever statement was made to him. l t is, however, the practice that the steward's department of any vessel in quarantine sees to the wants of the passengers on shore, just as it acts on the vessel itself during the voyage; and, while the passengers are in occupation, .these stewards are expected to keep the passengers' quarters clean in the same way as they have to do while the ship is in motion. It is q u it e possible that some misunderstanding arose in this w a y . PNEUMONIC INFLUENZA.",46
165,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEPARTMENT OF,"I desire to make the following statement in connection with points raised by certain honourable m e m bers r e l at in g to the disease known as Spanish in f l u e n z a : 1. The disease in Sydney is pneumonic influenza, which adequately describes the disease, being, as it is, a combination of influenza of a severe type and infectious pneumonia. Bacteriological investigations have been caref u l l y made, and there is no reason whatever to suggest any association with plague. A full medical statement of the disease has been issued as a special bulletin by the Quarantine Service. 2. The three deaths in Melbourne Hospital were investigated by the State Health Department, who report that these cases had no connection with any person who had arrived from overseas, - and did not transmit any infection to any persons associated with them. They are not to be regarded as cases of pneumonic influenza now being dealt with in quarantine. 3. Complaints were received from men on the Medio regarding the cooking of the foods, rather than the quality. Every endeavour has ben made to rectify the defects in this direction, and no complaints have been received recently. MISS LOTTIE KENNEDY.",47
166,Mr WISE,DEPARTMENT OF,"On the 5th December, the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) asked the following ques1. What is the reason why no reply has hitherto been furnished to the letter of the honourable member for Batman, of the 20th September, 1918, concerning an .accident which befell Miss Lottie Kennedy in the course of her employment in the Caulfield M i l it a r y Hospital on the 12th September, 1917? 2. In: view of the serious permanent incapacity and disfigurement suffered by this lady in the service of the Defence Department, will the Minister, not do anything more for her than the payment of half of her wages (10s. per week) for part only of the time she was totally incapacitated? 3. Wliat is the principle adopted in such cases ? I am n o w able to f u r n is h the following replies: 1. There is no trace of the letter in question having been received in the Defence Department. 2 and 3. The Minister is having the case fully investigated, and expects to be in a position to give a decision in the course of a few days. WIVES OF GERMAN INTERNEES.",47
167,Mr WISE,DEPARTMENT OF,"On the 4th December, the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Nicholls) asked the following question :Is the Assistant Minister for Defence aware that many Australian women who are married to Germans are practically on - the verge of starvation as the result of their husbands being interned; and, if that be so, will he consider the advisability of giving protection to the dependants of all internees? I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following tion :Such persona should apply to the District Commandant, as provision is made in the regulations for payment of 12s. 6d. per week to wives, and 2s. 6d. per week for each child, provided the District Commandant is' satisfied they are destitute; and the Minister has the power, under very special conditions, of increasing this allowance. This provision applies to all families of internees, whether th'* wives are Australian born or not. NA SOLDIER S. Mr ""WTSE - On the 5th December, the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) asked the following question :- ' When hostilities were at their height, it was stated by Senator Pearce that every soldier returning to Australia would bring back a rifle. Has that arrangement been carried out? Are the men likely to do so? I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information :The Commonwealth Government are defraying the cost of equipment for all units of the Australian Imperial Force. In consideration of this, the Imperial authorities will, termination of the war, send to .Australia the full war equipment (including rifles) for all units. This equipment will be cased and sent to Australia as ordinary merchandise,, and rifles will, therefore, not be in the possession of individual members of the Force when they return, The.following papers were presented:Proportional Representation-Memorandu m on the working of, at the recent Danish Elections for the Folketing.

Debate resumed from the 6th December (vide page 8919), on motion by Mr . GROOMThat this Bill be now read a second time.",47
168,Mr FTNLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"Brisbane) [5.28] When the War Precautions Ac t was originally introduced, two particular items emerged during the debate. The first was a protest by honourable members on both sides of the House as to the danger of intrusting the Government with the unlimited powers covered by the measure. The other point was the assurance given by the then Attorney-General (Mr . after the Hughes) and the then Prime Minister (Mr Fisher) that these powers would be used with discretion, an assurance equally positive and equally as strong as that given by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr . Watt) last week that they would be exercised with the utmost discretion and reasonableness. The trouble is that the exPAPERS. perience we have had during these four years of the administration of the War Precautions Act does not allow us to give much credence to all these protests and assurances. The Act as it now stands with its multitude of regulations is very different from what it was in 191415-so very different that we cannot draw an analogy between the two. Honourable members on the Ministerial side have twitted us with the fact that this measure was introduced by a Labour Government-the Acting Prime Minister also referred to the fact-bu t they omit one . vital point, namely, that while the Act was under the administration of a Labour Government there was not a single complaint that the Government had unduly used the powers given to them by it, or were lacking in appreciation of the powers it gave in regard to the conduct of the war. I challenge any honourable member on the Government side to point to one instance in which the powers of the Act were complained about by ""any honourable member' while they were administered, by a Labour Government. It was: not until Mr Hughes returned from England, in 1916, and discovered that the Labour party was not a machineto be used by him at his discretion or pleasure, hut comprised men of some independence' of thought and dependence of action that he found out what-a useful instrument the War Pre. cautions Act was. The trouble gard to the administration of the A ct dates from that time. Prior to that the with them. measure was legitimately used for the purposes for which it was introducedproper purposes, legitimate purposes, and purposes which we are all now agreed were reasonable in the circumstances of the war; but since August, 1916, when Mr Hughes returned from England, it has been used for political purposes, and, worse still, as a means of exacting private revenge and satisfying personal spite.",48
169,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N, Order ! The honourable member must not impute improper motives.,49
170,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"The War Precautions A ct falls under two rough divisions. The first deals with trade and commerce, matters covering a whole multitude of. commodities and business activitiestoi control which about twenty-four boards have been appointed. The second division deals with general aspects. affecting the public, such as the censorship, internment, and so forth . It seems me. also that the - House is peculiarly .divided on similar lines. ' Honourable members on the Government side wish to get r i d as quickly as possible of the control over trade and commerce, but a number of them are rather anxious to retain the powers that deal with the other items, such as were suggested by the honourable member for New England (L t Colonel Abbott) in his speech, matters dealing with disloyalty, internment, censorship, and so on. We; of the Opposition, - on the other hand, are anxious to maintain governmental control over business, but we .desire to get r i d of those extraneous interferences, which, however much they were justified in . war time, will. not. be justified when peace is proclaimed. The real questions-before the House are , ' "" Shall Government control of' trade and commerce be continued?"" and, "" S h all Government control over the publications and private affairs of the people be continued?"" I am not at all surprised that honourable members on the in Government side are anxious to get r i d of Government control of trade and commerce. So far as their objection relates in reto such control being exercised under a War Precautions Act. I entirely agree I do not believe that the trade and commerce of the country in peace time should be controlled under a special power applicable to war time. But I believe in the principle of governmental control, and one of the main difficulties that the Commonwealth Parliament has had to face throughout its career has been the lack of control over trade and commerce. I ts limitations in that respect have been accentuated and emphasized during the last four years. When the War Precautions Act was in troduced it was not believed that this Parliament had 'any control over those matters. Indeed, the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) admitted that the powers ; under the War Precautions Act and the Defence Act did not give the Government the necessary control over trade and. commerce. I quotefrom-a. booklet that was issuedi n connection with, the referendum that was to have been taken on' the 11th December, 1915, in regard to the amendment of section 51 of the Constitution, in order to give the Comto monwealth Parliament, complete, control of trade and commerce. In this' booklet, stating the arguments for and against the proposition, the then Liberal Opposition stated their case in a very few words, principally stressing the opinion that the Defence powers of the Commonwealth in war time were so unlimited that there was no possibility of their being found insufficient for the purposes of the war, and that, therefore, there was no need to submit the referendum questions at that time. But the Government, which, so far as the War Precautions Act was concerned, was really Mr . Hughes, took the view that the powers under the Defence Act and the War Precautions A ct were not sufficient. page 11 of the booklet, the Prime Minister said- i We are at war, and the Commonwealth Parliament is charged with the great task of defending the country. To effectively perform its supremely, important functions the Commonwealth must have complete control of all the resources of the country and of every person in it. In order to grapple with the tremendous issues arising out of the war it is essential that the Government charged with the .responsibility should have absolute authority over capital and labour, but the Commonwealth has no control over either. % . . Every other Parliament in the Empire has the powers we are asking for. These .Parliaments can protect the interests bf the people if ,they choose. They can limit the'profits of these unscrupulous persons who are heaping up war fortunes, regulate prices, and deal generally with trusts and monopolies. Tliey can deal with strikes and industrial disputes generally. ,But the Federal Parliament - of Australia,- in the greatest crisis of .the modern world, when the entire fabric of civilization is cracking with the frightful strain, is powerless to deal with capital and labour, powerless to prevent the. exploitation of the people by capital, powerless to maintain industrial peace. Later on, :he.said'The power to grapple with these is more urgently needed now than at other times. That was the tenor of the argument throughout ..the book, and Mr Hughes repeated' the statement in this House, and privately to his party, that even the War Precautions Act did not grant the 'powers that should have been granted under^the Constitution, and that, therefore, the Government proposed to ask the people to invest the Commonwealth with such powers. On two previous occasions the people had refused - to do that, and the reason why the t h i r d referendum was not proceeded with was that the Prime Minister reported to his supporters that he had made an arrangement with the Premiers, of New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, that they should pass through the State Parliaments a uniform measure which would surrender to the Commonwealth Parliament for the period of the war all the powers proposed to be asked for by referendum. He further said that when the Parliaments of New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria had made that concession to the Commonwealth, the other States would come into line, and, On therefore, the referendum would be unnecessary. Accepting that assurance, and believing that the course indicated was an easier and more agreeable way out of the difficulty, the party agreed not to proceed with the referendum.",49
171,Mr LYNCH,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,Was there not also .some doubt as to the likelihood of the referendum being decided in the affirmative?,50
172,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"I know that on the strength of those representations .the party agreed, much against the wish - of many of us, not to proceed with the referendum. Por that decision we .were maligned and misunderstood by our own supporters.. Subsequently, when .an' appeal was made to the High Court, it was discovered that the Commonwealth .possessed under the War Precautions Act .all ,the powers that would have been .given to it had the referendum been carried.",50
173,Mr BOYD,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,Did not the Queensland Parliament object to conceding the powers that the Commonwealth Government desired ?,50
174,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"I believe there was some trouble, but the main difficulty arose in Victoria, where the Legislative Council offered serious objection to the surrender of - any of the powers possessed by - the States. Finally, we had a suspicion'that the statement by Mr Hughes regarding the promises and assurances given by the Premiers of Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria was not based on good foundation, and that there had not been that clear and explicit understanding between the parties that we had been led to believe. However, the judgment of the High Court in the famous Bread , case showed that the W a r Precautious Act gave the Commonwealth powers wider in every sense than an amendment of the Constitution would have conferred had the referendum been agreed to. The Government, finding themselves possessed of these unlimited powers, exercised them in a way that was never contemplated when the War Precautions Act was passed. Indeed, if its subsequent misuse had been even imagined when the Act was before Parliament, the measure would never have been agreed to by the Opposition. Honourable members can recollect how leading Liberals, members of long parliamentary experience, protested ajrainst even the powers then supposed to be conferred by the War Precautions Act How much more would they have protested, and how much more vigorously would they have opposed the passage of that measure, if they had had even the slightest suspicion that it practically rogated the Constitution. It did do that, and the Acting Prime Minister, in his speech last week, admitted that we had abrogated our functions as a representative Parliament, and that the desire of honourable members was "" to return to regular and constitutional methods of government as soon as possible."" I may explain to honourable members that 1 spent a good deal of time in preparing my speech on this Bill , because I am certain that a good argument can be advanced against the extension of the War Precautions Act for even one day after the proclamation of peace; but, unfortunately, 1I have developed a sore throat, which will compel me to curtail my remarks, and to confine myself to endeavouring to establish a few main propositions. The speech of the Acting Prime Minister last week was obviously directed to the Government Corner party. I appreciate to the full the attitude taken up by those honourable members in opposition to the extension of the War Precautions Act. They know, as the people throughout the country know, what a serious inconvenience that Act has been to the conduct of business. It was originally intended for the purpose of mobilizing the resources of the country, and to be an instrument for so concentrating the available power of the country that all the energies of the Mr Finlai/son. people in every department of activity might be directed towards the defence of Australia - To that principle honourable members on both sides of the House offered no objection. Never once during the war has any protest been made against the legitimate powers of the Government being properly directed to secure that end. But under the interpretation of these powers by the more recent Governments, control of trade and commerce by Governmental Boards and Ministerial interference has been so extended as to accomplish only a series of irritatin g and annoying irruptions amongst business people, who have been humiliated and irritated, and, in some cases, unreasonably restricted in the conduct of their affairs. The Acting Attorney-General, in moving the second reading of the Bill , quoted the opinion of a number of the Boards appointed by the Government to deal abwith various matters. Naturally, each of these authorities, to whom appeal was made, pointed out the difficulty and danger that would arise if their control were relaxed in the near future. The House would have been much more grateful if the Minister had quoted the opinions of the people whose businesses had been controlled. The honourable gentleman did not give us the opinions expressed by Chambers of Commerce, Chambers of Manufactures, and various other representative institutions - throughout the country, nor did he put before us the views of those whose hours of labour and conditions of employment have been interfered with.",50
175,Mr GROOM,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,Is not the public in terest the first consideration?,51
176,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,Undoubtedly; but we cannot arrive at the public in terest from a one-sided view of the question.,51
177,Mr GROOM,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,Does the honourable member accept the views of these bodies!,51
178,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"It is not a question of accepting the views of opponents; it is rather a question of accepting the right point of view, and the view put before us by the honourable gentleman was entirely one-sided.",51
179,Mr BOYD,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,What public body supports the continuation of the War Precautions Act? . Mr FINLAYiSON - If this question were submitted to public bodies-to those responsible for the carrying on - of the business of the country it would be found that they were all opposed to it.,51
180,Mr GROOM,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,Many are in favour of it.,52
181,Mr BOYD,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,Not one; all have carried resolutions in opposition to it.,52
182,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"Variou s resolutions of protest have been carried. I have here the views expressed by the Australian Mining Standard, which, I think, puts from its particular standpoint, at all events, a fairly generous and reasonable statement of the situation. In an article which it published last week in regard to the control of trade in Australia, the following paragraphs appeared :Much dissatisfaction was expressed from time to time at the orders issued, hearing the seal of Government approval. As the process developed, a network was woven round the commerce of the country, which completely nullified individual effort. . . . From a small beginning, the Shipping Control Board developed into a powerful organization, allocating shipping space, and determining what class of goods and quantities should be shipped out of the Commonwealth. To a large degree, it acted for the British Shipping IJoard, but its methods wore not always satisfactory to shippers. One of the .most painful examples of governmental interference with trade is to be found in the price-fixing scheme. . . . Essential though many of the regulations were in war time, their revocation immediately after the declaration of peace will afford welcome relief to the commercial community. Not a moment must be lost in unfettering commercial interests, and allowing individual effort, which has built up the trade of the Empire, to return to its former channels, or embark upon new ones, as it thinks fit. Business will get back to normal far more speedily by being left alone than by'being perpetually interfered with by Government Boards administering hidebound regulations The Boards must all go, and with them, their hampering effect on commerce. Ministers must take upon their shoulders full responsibility for their executive acts, and not parcel out the functions of State to selected individuals drawn from the ranks of various interests. The Government pay a poor compliment to the business men of this community when they try to alarm the minds of the people by declaring that if Government control were suddenly withdrawn, [333] business would drift into a state of chaos. It must not be forgotten that those who are handling the trade and commerce of the community have been, in common with the general public, anticipating peace, and. have been preparing for it, upon the basis that the War Precautions Act and its regulations would be withdrawn as soon as peace was proclaimed. They now suddenly find that so far from being allowed to return to normal business conditions and to carry on industry along legitimate and proper lines, they are actually threatened with an extension of the War Precautions Act.",52
183,Mr COHSER,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,Hav e any deputations of business people waited upon Ministers to object to it?,52
184,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,I think that the whole business community is objecting to the proposal.,52
185,Mr JOWETT,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,The whole of the wool growers and the wool brokers of Australia .are in favour of it.,52
186,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"I am dealing with the trading and commercial interests of the Commonwealth. Those' in charge of them have not been hanging back; they have not been carrying large stocksor laying in big orders, in the belief that the war would continue indefinitely. They knew all along that there must be '. an end to the war at some time, and they have been laying their plans-whe ther rightly or wrongly remains to be seen-upo n the assumption that, with the proclamation of peace, they would be allowed to adapt themselves at once to the new conditions. What they want above all tilings is to be free from the humiliating and irritating effects of the War Precautions Ac t and its regulations.",52
187,Mr SAMPSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,Would the .honourable member advocate the immediate discontinuance of the Act?,52
188,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"It has been pointed out by quite a number of honourable members that the Government will have ample time to decide what, in their opinion, it is necessary to continue to control after the proclamation of peace. It is positively certain that peace will not be proclaimed for the next two or three months. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) has admitted that it is possible to put a date to that period, but lessly whether the period be long or short, it w i be quite sufficient to enable the Governtive ment to ..make up their minds as to what business they must continue to control may. . . . after peace is proclaimed. The Government have been assured repeatedly that thought we are ready to pass special Bills to give them power to continue their control over such matters. We object, however, the continuation of an unlimited control in over all matters merely because it is necesrender. sary to control a few.",52
189,Mr FENTON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"Fro m a legal point of view, I do not think the Government can have any control of this kind after the war is over.",53
190,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"There may be a leased good deal to be said for that argument. As a reinforcement of the contentions three weeks since the fighting stopped. that we are putting up in this regard, would point out that already other couninstituted tries are hurrying back to pre-war condiThere tions. The biggest danger threatening after the proclamation of peace is .that economic disturbance in connection with international trade relations. It has been held up to us for some time that many will force an economic war because her lands have not been ravished; her factories and machinery are still intact; and her opportunities for production have not been lessened. She willthus be to recover her economic and industrial ""Restrictions conditions more quickly than any other Protests."" nation.",53
191,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"All these things also are still intact in Great Britain United States of America, and Japan.",53
192,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"Grea t Britain France, Belgium, and America hastening to re-establish their commercial affairs, and claim they can do that by freeing themselves from the Governbeen ment sytem of control under war condiand tions. It is interesting to note that sident Wilson, in his address to Congress cautions Act? just before he left the United States of America, referred to this very matter. As reported in the Melbourne press 4th inst., he saidOur people, moreover, do not wait to be coached and led. They know their own business, and are quick and resourceful at every re-adjustment, definite in purpose, self-reliant in action. Any leading strings we might seek imto put them in would speedily become hopetangled, because they would pay no attention to them and go their own way. All l l that we can do as their legislative and execuservants is to mediate the process of change here, there, and elsewhere as we From no quarter ""have I seen any general scheme of reconstruction emerge which I it likely we could force our spirited, business men and self-reliant labourers ta accept with due pliancy and obedience. While to the war lasted we set up many agencies by which to direct the industries of the country the services it was necessary for them to But these restraints are being relaxed as much as possible. The moment we knew the armistice to have been signed we took the harness off. Raw materials upon, which the Government had kept its hands for fear there would not be enough for the industries that supplied the armies have been reand put into the general market again. It is surprising how fast the process of a return to a peace footing has moved in the It I pr.omises to outrun any inquiry that may be and any aid that may be offered. we have it that, in the Unite d us States of America, as soon as the armisof tice was signed, the harness was taken off industry. There was no question of an extension of the war system of control Gereither there or in Great Britain . As to ' the suggestion made a fewminutes ago, that there has been no public protest against the proposed extension of the Act , may I read from this evening'sable issue of the Herald a report headed: of T r a d e "" ; "" V i g o r o u s",53

196,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"I am not. Representatives of the grain trade have protested against any extension of the W a r Precautions Act. That, after all, is only. the beginning of such protests. business people of this community have not yet realized what the Government proposal means; they are only beginning i o waken up to it . Protests are already in circulation from the Labour organizations of the country, including a resolut i o n .of protest from the Transport Workers Federation in Brisbane, which has been forwarded to me. It is only a matter of time when business .people, from , one end - of the country to the other, will declare themselves in opposition to the Act. I wish to make my own position quite - clear. I favour Government control over trade and commerce. I take'that attiCatts Committee. tude just as strongly as-1 did in 1911, Mr FINLAYSON when the amendments of the Constitution were submitted to the people of Auscarried tralia. I believe today it is more necessuch sary that the Parliament should have limited power over trade and commerce, corporations, and industrial matters than ever it was before-that this control necessary in the interests of the people. believe in the principle of price-fixing, but I am not surprised that it has turned out such a miserable blunder as it has - during the last two years. The wonder me is that the Government ever made an attempt - Mr GBEGORY - Was the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts) in charge of price-fixing once?",53
197,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"F o r a time. There was a Committee, of which that member was chairman, and which comprised honourable members on both sides of the House, and it made a courageous - effort to render price-fixing effective - useful. We 'all know that it was simply measure. because of the utter disgust of that mittee with Governmental interference their proceedings, and Governmental reaffairs pudiation of their proposals, that the chairman and members resigned in a body.  was in power then.",54

201,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,That was when it started.,54
202,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,And finished.,54
203,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,It has not finished; this Government is carrying on price-fixing.,54
204,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"I mean the - Of course, that is finished. Every Government since has on attempts at price-fixing, and in a way that, as any one can realise who unknows anything at all about' business affairs, it could not be a success, not only because of the methods, but because it is was carried on by men who do not believe I in it . Honourable members opposite, in cluding the Acting Prime Minister (Mr . Watt), who clearly stated that he did not believe in price-fixing as a principle, are to not to be blamed for its failure, and I do not blame them in the least. I believe in the principle; but it can be imagined what a dlifferent thing it would be if price-fixing were administered by people who believed in it , and were determined to make it effective, as contrasted with price-fixing carried on by people who. do honourable not believe in it . While I believe in Governmental control over trade and commerce, and in price-fixing, I do not believe that it should and be exercised under the powers of a war It is a most lamentable Comthing that it is necessary in war in time to take charge of the commercial of the community in order to protect the public. That is not peculiar to our own country, and it is not characteristic of the British Empire only; it is, unfortunately, to be found in every other country. In war time people carrying on the business of the country take adof vantage of the direful opportunity to rob fellows-that is the time for these who "" patriots "" to begin their robbery. It lamentable, as I say, that at this time. I am not in our civilization, the Government of every country during the late war has had bo take compulsory charge of trade and commerce in order to protect the people. However great the necessity may be in war time, I believe it is just as great in peace time, but I do not believe that such powers should be exercised under a war measure in peace time. Under our Constitution we have a proper and legitimate way to secure these powers to the Government. Now is the opportunity. There is plenty of time to ask the people of Australia to so amend the Constitution as to give the necessary power to the Government. Honourable members on the Government side have had considerable experience since the last referendum on the constitutional amendments . was taken, and the public of Australia also have had considerable experience. Whatever opposition there was-and it reduced itself to a very small matter-to the Government having the powers asked for in the second referendum in 1913, the public of Australia today are ready to clothe this Parliament with full and complete powers over the trade and commerce of Australia. The State Governments, in my opinion, are inclined to come to an arrangement, and I suggest that constitutional amendment is the only and proper way in which to give the powers that the Government seek to continue exercise under the War Precautions Act. If there is time to put through a number of measures which the Government think it necessary to have, in order to continue control in some directions that, according to their ideas, cannot easily be abandoned, there is just as much time to prepare for submission to the people the amendments to the Constitution I have suggested. If the War Precautions Act was not sufficient in 1916, I wonder how it has recome all-sufficient how. The Government have found this measure not only useful to enable them to keep control over trade and commerce, but for other things. I have a feeling, and it is very strong, that if it were not that the Government desire to continue their interference the liberties of the people of Australia, they would not ask for an extension of the War Precautions Act to Mr Finlayson. their control over commercial affairs. If it were not for the belief that what the Government wish in this extension of the War Precautions Act is pewer to use it for political purposes, I would be willin g to give them the extension to continue their control over trade and commerce; but I cannot agree to give them control over trade and commerce, carrying with it power to continue their unreasonable, unfair, un-British, irritating, and disgraceful interference with the ordinary liberties of the people of Australia. I listened with amazement to the honourable member for New England (L t Colonel Abbott), though probably he is to be excused. I say not one word in regard to his services to the Empire, because we all, particularly those of us who could not go to the war ourselves, have a feeling of respect for those who were able to. go and did go. I have nothing but appreciation for the services of that honourable member to the country; and I may say that from what I have heard from soldiers who served under him , and knew him on the other side, he had an exceptionally good name amongst them. But while absent fighting for Australia he was evidently unaware of what was going on here. When he talked as he did the other night, and told us that we were to unreasonable in objecting to ah extension of the War Precautions Act, which gave the Government power to deal with disloyal people and protect the Empire, he altogether overlooked what we have had to pass through, and what those of us who have been in opposition to the Government had to suffer while he was on the other side of the world. Does he know that under the powers of this Act, the manifesto which the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) issued in connection with the first conscription referendum was freely circulated amongst the soldiers, but that not a. word of the views of the Opposition was allowed to reach them? Does he know that even au official cablegram sent by the State Government of Queensland - accepte d and paid for-wa s not allowed with to be delivered, and that under the powers of the War Precautions Act the soldiers at the Front were only continue given one side of the case? Does he kuow that amongst the papers circulated amongst the soldiers at the Front was one paid for by the Government, and edited by a man paid by the Government, containing nothing but abuse, misrepresentation, and vile lying as to the of the members of the Labour party? 1I have one copy of the paper here, All for Australia, which was regularly issued to the troops on the other side, arid it contains the most scurrilous, unfair, villan.ous statements, about members of the Labour party.",54
205,Mr CORBOY,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"The boys did not believe it. Mr FINLAYSON"" - They did.",56
206,Mr WATKINS,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,I have letters showing that there was no other literature issued to them.,56
207,Mr CORBOY,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"There was no other literature. - Mr FINLAYSON"" - That literature was circulated, but not one word representative of our side. But in connection with the general election an even more despicable thing took place 'under the powers of the War Precautions Act. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) took care that his speech at Bendigo was sent in full and circulated amongst the troops, but only cooked extracts from a report of a speech by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), taken from a newspaper, were sent, and the Government had not even the courtesy to submit the matter to that gentleman before sending it. Ordinary decency should have prompted the Government to say, "" Well, Ihe honourable gentleman might at least be shown what we are cabling in his name,"" but nothing like that was done; the War Precautions Act gave them the power, and they used it. I also wish to ask the honourable member for New England (Lt - Colonel Abbott) Avhether he knows that during the second conscription referendum the same tactics were pursued with the little exception-and it was a very small onethat one short message from the Leader of. the Opposition (Mr Tudor) was allowed to be inserted in the statement issued to the troops. Honourable members can hear from the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), who tried to act as our agent over there",56
208,Mr TUDOR,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,I was authorized by this House to appoint some one.,56
209,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"Yes , and we attitude know how the honourable member for Ballarat was refused over and over again every opportunity to put our case. Indeed, he was threatened with arrest because he did something on his own initiative in connection with the matter. Then we must remember that statements published in the British press were refused publication here, and it is a peculiar thing that the refusal to permit publication applied particularly to the Labour newspapers, in many instances the Government newspapers were allowed to publish extracts from British newspapers and magazines which the Labour newspapers were prohibited from reprinting. There are nearly 200 publications which circulate freely in the Old Country and in the Allied countries which are prohibited in Australia. Labour newspapers have even been refused permission to publish official statements. Is the honourable member for New England (Lt - Colonel Abbott) aware that under the authority of the-War Precautions Act State Government offices have been raided and State Government papers have been seized by the military? Is he aware that under that Act this House was raided, and the property of a private member seized by the military? Does he know that the Trades Hall and the homes of the officials of the Trades Hall were raided by the military, and private papers seized? Is he aware that Australian citizens have been arrested without warrant? He is a lawyer, and I ask him what is hia opinion of the action of the Government in arresting citizens of this so-called free country without warrant, in imprisoning them without a charge, and in sentencing them without a trial. In somo oases in which a Court has imposed a sentence the persons who have served that sentence are still interned under the WarPrecautions Act. Is the honourable member aware that men have been arrested and deported from the country, and that their relatives have been refused permission to see them, or to communicate with them, and have no information as to where they have gone? There are today in Australia women who do not know where their husbands are, their husbands having been deported, and having been refused permission to correspond with their wives and families. Mr .BOYD - Is the honourable member speaking of Italians?",56
210,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"I am speaking of Australian citizen's. Is the honourable member for New England aware that, under the War Precautions Act, citizens of many years standing, against whom there has not been a mark for bad conduct, private or public, have been deprived of the rights of citizenship, and prevented from voting at a general elec- p.m. tion? Does he know .that public meetings have been prohibited, and that when a deputation bf women wished ito interview the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) in front of this House, they were refused permission to do so,' and that next day a regulation was issued under the War Precautions Act making it illegal for any to hold a meeting near this building within a few weeks of the issue of that regulation hundreds of men connected with the meat industry were permitted to hold a meeting on the steps of Parliament House, and within this building, without a word being said against it. cording to some of the officials, on that occasion damage was done to the paintings in the Queen's'Hall.",57

213,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"Does the honourable member for New England know that when the Prime Minister was on an electioneering tour, and a disturbance occurred at one of his meetings, he created a new Federal Police Force at a cost of some thousands of pounds a year, because State policemen refused to accept his instructions? Is he aware that under the War Precautions Aot the flying of certain flags and the wearing of certain emblems is prohibited, and yet, according to the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt), it is. impracticable to frame a regulation under that Act to prevent the use of - the Union Jack and Australian flags as trade advertisements? The list of the wrongs that have been done under the WarPrecautions Act is endless, and when men talk from that side of the House of the need for preventing disloyalty and the flying of the red flag, I ask whether the flying of that flag is an offence comparable with those that have been committed under the War Precautions Act? Freedom and liberty have disappeared from this country under the administration of that Act.",57

215,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"In his speech last week the Acting Prime Minister used these words, "" There is a desire to return to regular and constitutional methods of Government as soon.as possible."" It is because of that argument that I have one made my protest against the extension of ? Yet the War Precautions Act and the War Precautions Regulations. If it is necessary for the Federal Government to hold the powers now exercised under that Act there is a regular and constitutional method of achieving that end, one that is Ac- easily applied and one that can be applied immediately. I believe that the Federal Government should have control over trade and commerce, corporations, and industrial matters, but, because I think that there is a much better method of securing the desired end than that which is proposed by the Government, I That all the words after "" That "" be left out, with a view to inserting in lieu thereof "" immediate action be taken to amend section 51 of the Constitution, so as to allow the Commonwealth Parliament full power to legislate with respect to(o) Trade and Commerce: (6) Corporations; (c) Industrial matters, and (d) Other related matters. "" This amendment will provide a proper method of getting back to constitutional government. There are two ways by which . the Commonwealth can obtain control over these matters, by the States surrendering these powers to the Commonwealth by agreement, or by submitting the question to a referendum of the people of Australia, and taking their decision upon it.",57
216,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,-How long would that take? Mr FINLAYSON' - About three months.,58

218,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"If the honourable member would submit a motion in favour of Unification I would have much pleasure in seconding and supporting it, because I believe in it. I recommend the acceptance of my amendment, and I urge the Government during the recess, and before peace is proclaimed, to get the authority of the people of Australia to do those things which they say are necessary and5 which can only be done now under the War Precautions Act. It is because of the unreasonable exercise of the provisions of that Act, and because of the use to which it has been put, that I think it much better to follow a constitutional method of governing Australia. If what I suggest is done we shall know where we stand in regard to national matters.",58

220,Sir ROBERT BEST,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"Kooyong) [7.50]. - As a party move the honourable member was justified in the try-on he has attempted so unsuccessfully. The Bill seems to have very few friends. It has certainly very few on the Government side of the House; it has none on the other side of the House, and I do not think there are many very ardent supporters of it even among Ministers. . Although the community^ generally has suffered very heavily during the war, it has submitted with extraordinary fortitude, because it was realized that when the nation was at War, discipline was necessary, and that the people of the Commonwealth should be practically governed by martial law, and more or less despotic rule quite inconsistent with a general and ordered system of ' government. The Executive has, during the. war, practically usurped the functions of Parliament, and this is most undesirable. There are two parties in regard to this measure, on the one hand those who desire the removal of the restrictions on trade and commerce as far as it is possible to do away with them, and, on the other hand, our friends opposite, who desire the immediate repeal of the Act in order that the regulations dealing with law and order, covering such matters as disloyalty, censorship, restriction of public meetings, and so on, may cease to operate. I am one of those who desire that the Act shall be terminated at the earliest possible moment, because of the grave restrictions it has imposed upon the business community. The trading community of Australia have suffered very severely during the war. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) has not overstated the serious embarrassments they have suffered by reason of the restrictions placed upon them, but we must bear in mind that serious results would follow in several directions by the immediate cessation of the Act. The commercial and trading community had a right to expect that as soon as peace was declared, which event may not take place for the next five or six months, they would be rid of the exacting and irksome restrictions of the War Precautions regulations from which they have suffered so much, and if - they were appealed to tomorrow they would be practically unanimous in asking for the repeal of the Act. Of course I know that there are exceptions. Many wool growers and some farmers unions are desirous of seeing certain regulations continued, but I carry on business in the heart of Melbourne, and mix daily with members of the business community, and I know that a unanimous demonstration has taken place so far - as representative organizations are concerned, asking for the earliest possible repeal of the Act. In this regard the community of Australia are not singular. There has been throughout the length and breadth of the United Kingdom a universal demand for the repeal of the Defence of the Realm Act. People who have suffered from the « restrictions imposed upon them by that Act are clamouring to be released from the embraces of ""Dora,"" as the measure is popularly named, and the Prime Minister, Mr Lloyd George, as well as Mr Bonar Law, has strongly declared the Government's determination to repeal the Act as soon as possible. We are entitled to the same consideration in this community.",58
221,Mr HIGGS,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"""Will the honourable member say whether, in his opinion, the Commonwealth has the power to continue the War Precautions Act immediately peace is signed?",59
222,Sir ROBERT BEST,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"The honourable member is putting a dimcult question. While it is true, according to the Bread case, that . we practically became a unified Constitution when war was declared, and the Commonwealth Government was able to exercise the powers of a unitary Government, quite irrespective of the State divisions provided for by the Constitution, yet I think the true legal position is this: We have all the plenary liowers of defence during the war; but, when the war has ceased, we have, I think, all the powers necessary or incidental to the completion of the work commenced under the defence powers while the war was in operation. In otlier words, the Commonwealth will have the power to clean up everything in cidental to the powers exercised under the War Precautions Act during the course of the war.",59
223,Mr SAMPSON,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,Would we have the power of statutory enactment in regard to those matters?,59
224,Sir ROBERT BEST,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"The powers of the Commonwealth are specifically laid down in the thirty-nine articles set out in section 51 of the Constitution. All residuary powers go to the States, and are the sovereign rights of the States. The Commonwealth has exercised jurisdiction as a' unitary Government over many matters by reason of the operation of war and its special defence power, but when once that jurisdiction is lost, the Commonwealth will have no statutory authority to deal with them at a subsequent date, except for the power given by the War Precautions Act and for cleaning up the matters therein dealt with. That is one of the difficulties facing the Government. They have to make up their minds as to which powers they desire to continue, and, in regard to any powers they exercise in respect of which jurisdiction is of a joint character as between the Commonwealth and the States, if they have not the power under the War Precautions Aet to carry out .certain things, it can only be done by the joint effort of the Commonwealth and the States. That is to say, the States would have to surrender the necessary power before the Commonwealth could deal with it . The Bill in its present form purports to authorize the Government to carry out everything it was previously authorized to do while we are in a state of war. I think the measure in its present plenary form is unfair. I have never concealed my view in regard to the duty of the Government. In dealing with this matter I hold that it was their duty to go through the existing regulations analytically, make up their minds as to what they thought it desirable to retain - for instance, the trading powers, which they regard as desirable to enforce - and then come down to the House and say, "" These are the powers we desire to exercise; these are the regulations we desire to retain in force."" Honourable members would then know where they stood, nnd we would have given the Government authority, as far as we possibly could, to carry out what was necessary in regard to the limited subjects directly submitted to us. I am sorry that the Government have not done that, and are placing members like myself in a very dimcult position in regard to the measure now before the House. The Government have seen fit, however, to make a specific declaration, and the statement made by the Acting Prime Minister is practically similar to the assurances given in regard to the Defence of the Realm Act by both Mr Lloyd George and Mr Bonar Law, in the Imperial Parliament. I listened with interest to what the Acting Prime Minister said, and, although I do not agree with all he said, and, speaking generally, am opposed to this Bill , I cannot ignore the assurances which have been given. The Acting Prime Minister has given his solemn pledge that the War Precautions regulations will not be used for any political purpose.",59
225,Mr NICHOLLS,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,Did not the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) give that assurance once before?,60
226,Sir EOBERT BEST,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,He may have done so; but we have now the solemn assurance of the Acting Prime Minister.,60
227,Mr CORSER,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,On behalf of his paTty.,60
228,Sir EOBEET BEST,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"He certainly gave it on behalf of the Government, and he declared that he will not be a party to any departure from that pledge.",60
229,Mr NICHOLLS,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) said that he would resign on one occasion.,60
230,Sir EOBEET BEST,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"The Prime Minister has said a good many things. The Acting Prime Minister told the House that no new policy will be introduced under the Act, except in the event of some unforeseen national emergency; that there will be a gradual and steady removal of the governmental interference with commerce, with the object of reducing conditions to normal at the earliest opportunity. Further than that, he said that he louts forward to the time, as early as possible in the New Year, when legislation will supersede the various regulations that have been made under the War Precautions Act. I am prepared to accept the personal assurance of the Acting Prime Minister; but I realise that grave risks are involved. I do not hesitate to say that the extension of the War Precautions Act should be .for three months instead of six months. All sorts of political exigencies . may be created; and ""whilst the Acting Prime Minister no doubt gave his solemn pledge, with the full intention of carrying it out, yet various unforeseen circumstances may arise which will prevent that being done. would have preferred that this Bill had not been introduced at thig stage, because probably a period of six. months will elapse before the War Precautions Act automatically terminates on the proclamation of peace. So far as I am concerned, the Government cannot repeal that Act quickly enough; but I make this stipulation, that if they repeal it, the repeal shall be accompanied by the enactment in legislation of the existing regulations relating to disloyalty.",60
231,Mr NICHOLLS,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"The honourable member does not believe in the extension of the Act, yet he will vote for the Bill.",60
232,Sir EOBEET BEST,RETURN OF AUSTRALIA N,"I am prepared to do two things-firstly , to accept the assurance of the Government, and, secondly, to support an extension of the War Precautions Act in order to maintain the existing disloyalty regulations: Those regulations are essential, having regard to the fact that there are in our midst Bolsheviks, who possibly are directly represented in this House, Sinn Feiners, and members of the Industrial Workers of the World. These bodies are enemies of the Empire, and, during the period of war did all in their power to wreck the Empire. They must be both watched and controlled.

234,Mr WATT,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer). [8.8] - (By leave.)- I desire to present to the House the report of the Royal Commission on I Navy and Defence Administration in regard to-(1 ) the-purchase of the Shaw Wirelesij Works at Eandwick, New South Wales, in August, 1916; and (2) the purchase of the following vessels for the purposes of the Navy Department: the Emerald in June, 1916, and the Phillip (late Togo) in August, 1916. Cabinet has carefully considered this report. Yesterday and today it gave Mr Jensen full opportunity to present his views upon the issues involved. After due deliberation, Ministers adopted the conclusion of the Commission that there was no evidence to connect Mr Jensen with the receipt of money in connection with the acquisition of the Shaw Wireless Works, but decided that the findings of the Commission and the matters disclosed in the report rendered it undesirable that he should remain a member of the Government. The Government have consulted the chairman and secretary of the Commission and the law advisers of the Commission as to whether a further investigation of any kind would elicit any additional information relating to this transaction, and in each case the answer was an emphatic negative. Mr Jensen has intimated to me that he considers he has beeu exonerated from wrong-doing, and he does not intend to resign from the Government. With the unanimous approval of Ministers, I am taking without delay the necessary steps to arrange his retirement from the Government. I am in communication with His Excellency the Governor General, and am informing the Prime Minister of the action taken. As to the findings of the Commission with respect to Senator Long, Cabinet further determined that eminent counsel be asked to consider and advise whether the evidence taken discloses any fact which would justify or demand action in a Court of law, and further to advise as to the powers, precedents, and procedure of Parliament in cases of this character. The recommendations of the Commission in regard to the disposal of the Shaw Wireless Works have been referred to the Navy Department for consideration. Pending the completion of action with respect to Mr Jensen, the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Greene) will continue to administer the Department of Trade and Customs, and Senator Russell will officiate as President of the Board of Trade. I move That the report and statement he printed.",60
235,Mr JENSEN,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"Bass-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.11] - I desire to say, in the first place, that I had no idea of the results of the deliberations of Cabinet, which have just been read to the House by the Acting Prime Minister. Recently a serious statement was made concerning my honour and integrity. Without any hesitation, I asked the Acting Prime Minister to relieve me of my administrative duties in the Customs Department, pending an inquiry into the allegations. I have carefully read the report of the Commission, and I was present throughout its inquiry, and I declare without hesitation that the summary of the facts given in the Commission's report is not in accordance with the evidence taken. I refer to the portions of the report dealing with my administration of the Navy Department.' I have been absolutely exonerated by the Commission from any wrong-doing or suspicion of corruption. There is no doubt about that. But I have been attacked by the Commission for carrying out the policy of the Government of which I was a member. I have taken it upon myself to not at all times comply with the directions of even a ReaT-Admiral. That officer put a minute upon a file in relation to a proposition for taking over a certain industrial concern, to the effect that the operations of industrial enterprises by the Government had not been a success, and he was opposed to the taking over of this concern by the Commonwealth for that reason. I was a member of a Government that was returned by the people only twelve months before upon a policy, one of the principles of which was the nationalization of industries I took it upon myself to refuse to be tied down by the terms of a minute of a member of the Naval Board. I declined, as a member of the Executive, to be controlled by him in that way. I defied him. For doing that I am blamed by this Commission. I am blamed by it because I dared to go outside a minute or a report by a naval officer. I was under cross-examination foi several hours by one of the most eminent lawyers in Australia, and I desire that every honourable member shall carefully read my evidence-in - chief, as well as that given by me under cross-examination. I fearlessly assert that I was not shaken in any way by the cross-examination which I was subjected with regard to my actions as Minister for the Navy. I fear nobody. The Commissionhas pointed to certain littl e niatters in my adminisgranted trative work, and has magnified them period, to the greatest possible extent. I want every honourable member to carefully read the whole of the evidence before arriving at any conclusion in regard to myself. T have explained all these matters the Government. I have been with them for the last two days. They have wanted my resignation; I have refused to hand it to them. I will not give it to them, and I dare them to take my office from me. Even now the Government say they can remove me from the Department Trade and Customs and put another M in ister in my place. I do not know whether they have power to do that until I left the office, and I have not yet done so. In the statement just made by the ing Prime Minister I heard, for the first time, of the action which they proposo to take to bring about my retirement. I intend during the next few days, with the permission of the House, to put my dom case full y before honourable members. hope that I shall have ample time afforded of me to do so. That I think the GovernParliament ment will grant me. At the first opporUnder tunity I shall put every aspect of case before the House, and I feel I can put before honourable members a stateand, in my humble judgment, ment of facts which will secure for me Court the sympathy of all parties. I fear one, since I have done no wrong; but this juncture I shall say no more. Debate (on motion by Mr TUDOR) was unconstitutional. adjourned. WAR PRECAUTIONS BILL . SECOND READING. I Debate resumed (vide page 8991). Mr Fenton. (Maribyrnong) [8.20]. before us. - I am rather surprised that the .honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), who was granted . leave to tinue his remarks, was not prepared resume when called upon to do so. the course of his address he endeavoured in an exceptionally laboured way plain what would be the legal position this Bill became law. He took the view that if , after the official declaration of to peace, the validity of the War Precautions Act was challenged it was exceedingly probable that the Court would hold that, since the Government had been tliese powers during jthe war they were entitled to a f u r the r extension of the Act to enable them, so to speak, to clean up. I shall not attempt jto contfoveirt the opinions of a legal member of the House, but in legal circles to ib is generally considered that if an appeal were made to the High Court at the present time the decision in the Bread case would be reversed. The in formation I have from an exceptionally good source is that, if this Bill becomes law, its validity will not be upheld on of appeal to the High Court.",61
236,Sir ROBERT BEST,NAVYAND DEFENCE,Everythin g wil l depend on the particular class of casehave upon which its validity is tested.,62
237,Mr FENTON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"Perhaps so. AfterActpeace has been proclaimed, I do not think any legal tribunal is likely to uphold any action taken by the Government under the War Precautions Act. The Parliament of the United K in g is in a category different alI together from that of the Parliament the Commonwealth. The British is supreme in all matters. the Constitution, certain powers my have been delegated to us, but there still reside in the States many powers, a of law would decide that no any action taken under the War Preat cautions Act or regulations framed under it, after the proclamation of peace, In these circumstances, therefore, it seems to me that we are engaged upon a useless discussion. In any event, we might well allow the con_ sideration of this proposal to stand over until wo resume next year. If that were done a very different Bill might be put. I desire to discuss some of the pointsconraised by the Acting Prime Minister. to The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr . In Finlayson), in an exceptionally good speech this afternoon, urged that if the to exGovernment desired wider Dowers, they if should seek them in a constitutional way by asking the people to agree to an amendment of our Constitution. temper of the people at the present time is such that I believe they would grant to Parliament an enlargement of its powers.",62
238,Mr BRENNAN,NAVYAND DEFENCE,The Government prefer to exercise unconstitutional powers.,63
239,Mr FENTON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"Undoubtedly . The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) has been able to satisfy his supporters in regard to the wisdom of this proposal. I can only Fay that they are easily satisfied. At the outset there was an uproar in the Ministerial corner, and amongst Ministerial supporters generally. on the Ministerial bench there was considerable diversity of opinion as to whether or not an extension of the operation of this very undesirable Act should be sought. The statement made by the Acting Prime Minister was full of what might well be spoken of as fallacies, but it has been accepted by the Ministerial party as showing sufficient reason for an extension of the Act. In his closing remarks the honourable gentleman passed upon the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) strictures such as have not .been passed by any member of the Opposition. He said that if this extension of power were granted, then in the event of any member of the Government seeking to avail himself of the Act , or of regulations framed under it , for a political purpose, he would no longer remain a, member of the Ministry. In making that statement he practically admitted that, in the past, - the Act had been used for political purposes. I am not going to say that the Acting Prime Minister had any mental reservations in making this pledge, but I would point out. that his view as to what was a political use of the A lations under it , might be very different from that of honourable members on this side of the House. We might regard certain actions as having a distinctly political significance, whereas he might hold a contrary opinion. It will be seen, therefore, that it is dangerous to entrust the Ministry with a political sword of this kind. The arguments which the honourable gentleman advanced in support of this B i ll could have been used more appropriately in support of an amendment of the Constitution. He spoke of what The might happen if the moratorium were lift e d. I do not think any honourable member would urge the immediate lift in g of the moratorium, but the honourable gentleman said that if it were raised, financial houses would pounce upon those to whom they had made advances, and demand repayment, and that when such persons sought in other quarters the money necessary to enable those repayments to be made, the interest rate would immediately rise. That was a serious accusation to make against the financial in stitutions of the Commonwealth. The Even Acting Prime Minister also made a considerable impression upon his supporters when he said that municipalities, under the War Precautions Act, had been allowed to invest municipal funds in war loans, and trustees of friendly societies and others had been granted a like privilege, and that the only protection municipalities enjoy are the provisions and regulations of the Act . I am informed on the best of authority, however, that in Victoria-and I take it the same will obtain in other Statesthe Local Government Branch of the Public Works Department is engaged in making inquiries with a view to drafting a Bill which will be placed before the State Parliament and passed, to indemn if y municipal councils in the event of any action being taken against them for ' spending municipal funds illegally The State Governments intend, it appears, to protect what they call their own State instrumentalities, among which are the municipal bodies; and the Bill I have mentioned will doubtless pass before the close of the Victorian State session, which will take place, probably, before we rise c t , or of regufor the recess.",63
240,Mr BAMFORD,NAVYAND DEFENCE,But that applies only to one State.,63
241,Mr FENTON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"As I have said, I presume that the other States will also see that their municipalities are amply protected. This was an argument on which the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) laid exceptional stress.. I do not suppose that there is one honourable member here who would vote for the withdrawal of all the protection of the moratorium, but that protection can be afforded otherwise than by the War Precautions Act. However, it will be seen that municipalities and trustees are not relying on the War Precautions Act , so that that argument of the Acting Prime Minister falls to the ground. The honourable gentleman made some serious charges, which, if made from this side, would have been described as so much Yarra Bank talk, when he said that if the War Precautions Act were to lapse the financial institutions of the country would take advantage of the necessities of the people and charge abnormal rates of interest. But if the financial institutions would do this in war time they would do it in peace time, so that there is all the more reason for the proper exercise by this Parliament of powers under the Constitution, which I am sure the people are ready to confer. Another serious charge made by the honourable gentleman was that if the War Precautions Act relating to shipping were lifted the ship-owners would take their vessels to other waters, where they could earn more money, and leave the Australian people absolutely stranded in regard to the carriage of goods from port to port. The honourable gentleman also said that what kept tonnage freights lower in this country was Government control; and again I retort that if it is the honourable gentleman's opinion that the ship-owners take advantage of the public in war time, it is evident that they will also do so in ' peace time, so that it is essential we should have the constitutional powers necessary to prevent them fleecing the people. The Acting Prime Minister said, also, that if we were to lift the embargo on the sugar industry, and control were relinquished, prices would immediately leap up. That argument is another c o fession that constitutional amendment necessary. The honourable gentleman referred to wool; and I wish that honourable member for Hume (Mr . Falkiner) were present, because I think that he must be inclined to very much resent the remarks of the honourable gentleman under this head. The Acting Prime Minister said that without the present powers, the only way to prevent the wool-growers from breaking their agreement with the Imperial authorities would be to prohibit the export of wool. This means, of course, that the wool growers are likely, in the absence of the War Precautions Act , to break the agree-^ ment with the British Government to supply wool for nearly two years, or, at any rate, the wool clip immediately after . the war. If this is true, it is only another reason for an amendment of the Constitution. Another point made by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) is that if the control of the War Precautions Act were taken away, we should find that those who had stocks of clothing stuffs, foodstuffs, and all those articles and commodities which make life worth living, would be left with absolute power to make prices as high as they pleased. That is a very specious argument, and I do not know whether it was advanced with a view to allaying suspicion on this side or to lessen criticism; but we are not to be caught with such chaff - The honourable gentleman also told us that he does not believe in price-fixing and general interference with trade in normal times; but in the few sentences that I have quoted, and they are not torn from their context, he presents sound argument for interference in a constitutional way. The' honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Fiinlayson) was perfectly correct when he stated that there is only one relief for the Commonwealth, and that is to obtain the necessary powers by means of constitutional amendment. One cannot discuss on this occasion the benefit of extensive constitutional alterations, or deal witli the Unification side of the question ; but while I have not much faith in ordinary amendment of the Constitution to give relief, I strongly feel that if all n - the Constitutions, State and Federal, is were thrown into the melting pot, also and this Parliament were to emerge the with power to act for itself, and to delegate powers to the State authorities, the people of the country would be much benefited. The New Zealand Parliament does not mean to be content with an amendment or extension of their war powers. I admit that the New Zealand Parliament is in a different position from the Commonwealth Parliament, inasmuch as there is not another authority to challenge their right to act. Despite this absolute power, however, the New Zealand Parliament does not intend to rely on their war powers in order to give relief to the people"", but are doing what this Parliament ought to be placed in a position to do, namely, passing Acts of Parliament under their Constitution in order that the people may be protected, only during war time, or immediately afterwards, but it may be for all time. In the Herald this evening there is the following piece of news-> Parliament has passed a Bill aimed at the prevention of profiteering. The measure makes it unlawful to sell goods at a price unreason- During the present week I ably high, if the opportunity of obtaining such a price arises out of war conditions. A price is to be deemed unreasonably high if it produces more than a fair and reasonable profit, which is to be based on the profit in August, 1914, with a reasonable addition for freight and charges. They are going back to 'the pre-war period, riot to the exceptionally high prices that have ruled during war time. The hoarding of goods is made unlawful. The maximum penalties are £200 for an individual and £1,000 for a company. They are making some effort to protect themselves against profiteers. Here great cries are raised against Sinn Peiners and Industrial Workers of the World men, but very little is heard from honourable members opposite of the necessity for supressing the profiteer-the man who has een filching from the people of this country when they have been in very dire circumstances indeed. If we heard a little more about the profiteer we would be more inclined to place some reliance upon Ministerial promises. Some time ago I publicly stated that two highwaymen had robbed certain Government officials not far from this building, but that the men who were exploiting the widows of our soldiers were far worse than those highway robbers. That is why honourable members upon this side of the chamber are inclined to doubt the bona fides of honourable members opposite. The latter refuse to deal with the arch offenders in our midst. Mr Fenton. Objection to the extension of the W a r Precautions Act is not confined to the Labour section of the community. In stead of being called the War PrecautionsAct it should be designated the Will f u l Persecutions Act, because of the way in which numbers of men have been persecuted under its provisions. No wonder that the Acting Prime Minister is prenot pared to pledge himself rthat if any attempt be made by the Government to use the measure for political purposes he will resign. In other words, if the Prime Minister commences any of the tricks in Wellington, Tuesday. which he has been indulging duringwar time, the Acting Prime Minister and himself will part company. have been, informed by men who do not belong to the Labour party that the provisions u f the War Precautions Act and of the regulations framed under it are not only irksome, but damnably oppressive and unjust. Upon the Boards established under that Act there are men who are engaged in the same line of businessas others upon whom they - are called to* sit in judgment. Some of the latter have been persecuted under the Act. Quiterecently a challenge was issued to one of these Boards to hale certain men ibefore the Court, with a view to proving that they had violated the provisions of the Statute. Why was this done? Because those men desired an opportunity of proving that they were being persecuted. Honourable members opposite who vote for this Bill will be condemned not only by the Labour section of this community but by many other . persons. I know exactly what the latter think, not only of the War Precautions Act itself, but of the personnel of the Boards appointed under it . Again, I would point out that inFrance today there are certain goods which are urgently needed by the people there, and for which the need existed! not only while the war was in progress,, but before its outbreak. Some of these goods have so deteriorated that they have actually had to be burned, and the members of the Prench Mission recently i m plored one of these Boards to allow these commodities to be removed in order that - ttse migh't be made of them. We ought to at once suspend the operation of the War Precautions Act, with a view to allowing members of the community to drift back as quickly as possible to normal conditions. In America, prior to sailing for the Peace Conference, President Wilson is reported to have saidAs soon as the armistice was signed we took *he harness off, and we are allowing business - again to resume its normal conditions. The people of America will thus have a i»ig start over every other community in the economic fight which has already commenced. But they will have a still bigger advantage over Australia, because under this Bill we are"" going to hobble, instead - of free, our industries. Australia, which is 12,000 miles from the theatre of war, is going to be the last country to demobilize its fighting forces and to allow its industries to regain normal conditions. It will 'be a crime against the community if we permit the provisions of the War ^Precautions Act to be used in that way. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr. .Pinlayson) has enumerated many of the persecutions that have taken place under that Statute. We desire that such persecutions shall immediately cease. Is not the present the time to allow the community to get back to those conditions binder which business was carried on in pre-war days ? Nobody can urge that the war is not over. Already the embargo upon racing clubs throughout Australia has been lifted. In the matter of horseracing, the people of this country will be restored to normal conditions in the course of a few weeks. The same remark is applicable to boxing contests. The Government is allowing boxing and racing to get back into their normal stride; but the great commercial undertakings and manufactures of the country, which have in the past employed a great deal of - labour, and would employ still more if .given freedom, are to be kept in shackles. Ministerial supporters may tolerate this, hut the people outside will not be so easily satisfied as they have been. Parliament should remove these shackles as soon as possible. Is it right that we should have goods rotting, or so deteriorating as to be unsaleable, and only fit to be burned; goods of a kind that were required by Prance before the war and during the war, and-are still required by that country? They were, indeed, asked for by the members of the French Mission which has only just left Victoria. ",63
242,Mr FENTON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"I shall not name them, though - privately I could give the honourable member ample evidence in support of my statement.",66
243,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NAVYAND DEFENCE,Le t us have it here.,66
244,Mr FENTON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"It does not always do to mention names. The facts were given to me by men who are not supporters of the Labour party, but usually vote for Ministerialists. I believe that the real opinion of honourable members opposite is against the continuation of the War Precautions Act. They would be easily satisfied if the explanation given by the Acting Prime Minister satisfied them. That explanation was full of fallacies. I have pointed out that municipalities and trustees will look for protection and indemnification for their actions in connection with war-loan' investments and the like, not to the War Precautions Act, but to the legislation of the various State Parliaments, because when peace has been signed, and the war is over, the Act will no longer have force. ""Were the Acting Prime Minister a State member, he would laugh to scorn statements such as he has made as Treasurer of the Commonwealth. We are wasting time in seeking to prolong the operation of the War Precautions Act.",66
245,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NAVYAND DEFENCE,How would the honourable member protect the small farmer ?,66
246,Mr FENTON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"The Government ask for the extension of the operation of the War Precautions Act, and all the regulations issued under it. Is a steam hammer needed to crush a nut? I would leave it to the State Parliaments to protect those who need protection. When peace has been signed, the War Precautions Act, if challenged, will be declared by the High Court to be invalid. If the Bread case were .again submitted to that; Court, it would give a different verdicts Unfortunately , there is now no probabil it y of the Government withdrawing the Bill , and introducing, a measure which would meet the requirements of the public. The continuance of the War Precautions Act on the statute-book wil l be a disturbing factor, and it may happen that instead of the community resuming its peaceful avocations, the regulations under the Act will, become so irritating that the people may be driven to some excess. The censorship has been exercised in a manner which even the most bitter opponent of the Government did not expect. I wonder if it is because of the censorship that we are not being told of the intention of the Minister for Defence to leave for London in connection with the demobilizationof our A r m y .  the subect in this evening's newspaper.",66
247,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NAVYAND DEFENCE,It his berth has been taken.,67
248,Mr FENTON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"It says that the Defence Department has booked certain passages. Why should we not be told directly that the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) is about"" to leave these shores to represent the Ministry in London in connection with the demobilization of our Forces ? This may be another i nstance in which the censorship is being exercised for political purposes. Prosecutions are still continuing in this country. Serious offences in connection with shipbuilding operations were sun-nosed to have been committed on the Clyde in Scotland, and one man was deported, but he has since been pardoned by the British Government, and allowed to .return to his ordinary avocation, because the war is over, and there is no further need for the war-time restrictions. But in Australia men are still being interned.",67
249,Mr TUDOR,NAVYAND DEFENCE,Does not the honourable member know the reason for what is being done in Great Britain? An election is pending there.,67
250,Mr FENTON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"We are less free, and during the war were less free, than any other community. In Great Britain , the conduct of the Government, and the carrying on of the war, have been openly discussed on the platform and in the press; but in Australia the censor has not permitted reference to such matters. These restraints are irksome to - a libertyloving community, and will bring about more trouble than many persons think. Why do honourable members opposite wish to extend the operation of the War Precautions Act?",67
251,Mr ATKINSON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"No one wishes to extend its operation, but we cannot do without it .",67
252,Mr FENTON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,Does the honourable member mean to say that the thousands of - regulations issued under that Act are essential for the administration of the affairs of this country?,67
253,Mr ATKINSON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"No , and they will not be used.",67
254,Mr FENTON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,Then why not repeal them ?,67
255,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NAVYAND DEFENCE,There are only three volumes of them !,67
256,Mr FENTON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,Many have not yet says that been bound.,67
257,Mr MAHONY,NAVYAND DEFENCE,Senato r Pearce will see to it that we get a lot more.,67
258,Mr FENTON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"Yes , - the p r in t in g press is still at work. The freedom of the people is being curtailed to a greater extent every day, although the war i.s over. I advise honourable members opposite to seriously consider the statement of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr . W at t ) , that if the powers given to the Government under the War Precautions Act are withdrawn, the Shipping Combine, the sugar producers, and other commercial interests will at once take advantake of the necessities of the people and increase the charge for their services or the articles they supply. That, in m y opinion, is a very strong argument in favour of an amendment of the Constitution.",67
259,Mr CORSER,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"If they did increase their prices, they would only get the market value of their articles.",67
260,Mr FENTON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"The honourable member is a business man, and he has seen the balance-sheets of many of these commercial companies. He knows that during the war their profits have increased: by 50, 60; and 70 per cent, beyond pre-war profits.",67
261,Mr CORSER,NAVYAND DEFENCE,Some have had to sell at fixed rates.,67
262,Mr FENTON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"The Acting Prime Minister has said that they will raise prices when the operation of the War Precautions Act expires.  member mention a shipping company whose profits have gone up 50 per cent, or 60 per cent.?",68
263,Mr FENTON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"I said that the profits of some commercial companies have been increased in that way. The Acting Prime Minister's statement is but a very poor testimonial to give to his political supporters outside, because we know that it is from the commercial in terests that orable members opposite draw most of that point. their funds for party purposes.",68
264,Mr CORSER,NAVYAND DEFENCE,The shipping commuch panies will naturally take their where they can earn most money.,68
265,Mr FENTON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"That only shows what may be done by these patriots, who, we have been informed, have sacrificed so much for the country. The honourable member suggests that the ship-owners are prepared to strangle Australia's trade they can earn higher profit elsewhere. am prepared to take the risks su&rcrested by the Acting Prime Minister, and let the iniquitous War Precautions Act be wiped off the statute-book altogether.",68
266,Mr GREGORY,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"Dampier) [9.3] - I do not often find myself in such quandary as to how I should record ""a vote as I find myself in dealing with second reading of this Bill. The War Precautions Act was passed with the full concurrence of this Parliament. The passing of sueh a measure was most necessary, but there have been many misregulations takes made in connection with its adminisThe tration. Many things have been done under regulations issued under the which render some extension of its powers necessary to secure the protection of the public. The present continues in operation during the condicate tinuance of the present state of war, no longer. But what does that mean? Is a formal declaration of peace or a special proclamation necessary before present state of war will have ceased? Before all matters connected with the sent state of war are settled, twelve months may lapse, and apparently the Government are asking that the War Precautions Act shall continue in operation 0 for six months after that period. I do not profess to thoroughly understand constitutional questions, but I doubt very much that the High Court would agree to any extension of the operation of the law until all matters pertaining to the declaration of peace are settled, should that take an unduly long time, which is quite likely in view of the present condition of affairs in Germany and Austria.",68
267,Mr BRENNAN,NAVYAND DEFENCE,We did not get much honhelp from the Acting Prime Minister on,68
268,Mr GREGORY,NAVYAND DEFENCE,We did not get help from the honourable member so vessels far as the war was concerned.,68
269,Mr BEENNAN,NAVYAND DEFENCE,That is another matter altogether.,68
270,Mr GREGORY,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"The Government are asking for an extension of the operation of the Act for six months after the end of the present state of war. I have if submitted a proposal to the AttorneyI General in connection with the matter. I desire to move, when we reach the Committee stage, to strike out the words "" and for a period of six months thereafter,"" with a view of substituting the words ""until the 30th June, 1919, whichever a may be the later date."" I should not mind extending the time until the 31st the July. That would give the Government seven or eight months in which to come to a determination in regard to any special legislation that might be required to protect those who have operated under the issued under the existing Act. Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) and the Acting Attorney-General (Mr. Act Groom) pointed out that it is necessary that the Government should retain some extraordinary powers for a longer Act period. If the Government would in that they are prepared to accept and such an amendment as I have suggested, I should resume my seat at once. - Otherwise, it will be my duty to state the the reason why I must vote against the Government on the second reading of this premeasure. I am not going to be so foolish as to vote for the second reading of .the Bill, trusting, in Committee, to carry such an amendment as I have suggested, less I have some assurance of Governbrought ment support for it. If the proclamation of Peace should be delayed until June July next, and the Act is to continue operation for six months after that, the period of its operation will be inordinately Jong. Throughout Australia, amongst every section of the community, there an almost unanimous opinion that should get rid of the fegulations framed under the Act as soon as possible. Some time must elapse, before the operation the measure ceases, to enable people prepare for the new conditions that will prevail when the regulations under the Act are no longer in force. Some time tion. for preparation for the new conditions will be necessary in connection with the moratorium, for instance, the wool trade, and the butter trade. Some lation will be necessary, in the circumstances, and I am prepared to give the Government a reasonable time in which to consider what this legislation should be. I am not, however, prepared to give them twelve, fifteen, or eighteen months which to determine upon such legislation. Assuming that the Government do not propose to accept an amendment such I have suggested, I must point out how essential it is in the interest of the people generally to get rid of the regulations framed under the War Precautions Act tion. as speedily as possible. The Government certainly need to protect certain indusance. tries and agreements; but, as far as I judge, it is not in the best interests of extent of metals. the community generally for them to control over matters relating to trade. A great many mistakes have been made. While the Government with good intenignorance tions have been anxious to rid the comwhile munity of .certain monopolies, they have only succeeded in creating far greater monopolies. I do not propose tp permit thorn to continue injuring trade, and many districts which have suffered as consequence of the exercise of the powers culpable ignorance. given by the War Precautions RegulaMetal tions. We have always been told to up to the wonderful work done by the Wool Board. We shall always find tain sections of brokers who are quite Mr Gregory. satisfied, with the action of the Governunment in these matters, because it has grist to their mills; but I have not been at all satisfied with the adminisor tration of the Wool Board. The price in of wool has been good, because the Imperial Government have bought our clips, but the administration has beeu bad. I object to the endeavour of the Wool is Board to destroy communities. At the we principal seaport in my constituency there have been appraisements of wool for the last two seasons, but by the dicof tum of the chairman of the Wool Board to no further appraisements are to take place there, and the trade of the town will be ruined for the sake of centralizaThe dominant feature of the administration of this Board has been its centralizing policy, its endeavour to drag the whole of the trade of Australia into special legisthe capital cities.",68

Is the association placed in exactly the same position as copper producers 1 I made representations to the Government not long ago regarding a copper mine at W him Creek, in the north-west of Western Australia. The mining people pointed out how impossible it was, owing to the heavy cost of freight, and to the high smelting charges, to send the Bill . copper ore to Port Kembla; and they drew attention, further, to the difficulty in making contracts. But the ment insisted that the ore must be sent to the smelters in Australia. The same position will apply to the t in producers, and it is a matter, with the Government, of caring little for the producer so long as terms are made with the smelters. The in that way. first care of the Government should be to watch the interests of producers in Australia. Dealing with the farmer, or the producer generally, the Government have failed to protect his interests adequately. Therefore, I want to see this Act removed from the statute-book, or its provisions so restricted as may be consistent with the safety of the nation. I quite agree that there must be some little The armistice has come with suddenness. The war is .virand tually, but not yet. over.

277,Mr CORBOY,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"Swan) [ 9 . 2 9 ] - I p r o -' Governtest against the continuance of the Act , because it has been used in the past to affect the liberty of so many persons in the Commonwealth. We have previously had just the same assurances as have now been given that the Act will not be used Such promises have been made by different membera of the Government, but they have been invariably broken; and the Government are just as likely to break them in the future as they have been in the past. The Act has been used to force an exofficer of the Army to play the detective on a man who had served under him at the Front for over two years, and to try to put that man in gaol, simply because at the time of the conscription referendum the latter was telling the people the truth about certain matters in connection with the army.. The officer told me that that was the order he hated most of any he had received. The Government were denying at the - time of the second conscription referendum that a sixth division had been formed, but this man was discharged in the middle of the conscription campaign as a member of the Sixth Division. As a matter of fact, I was discharged from the Sixth Division on 13th December, 1917; I have the Defence Department's discharge as a member of the 70th Battalion, Sixth Division, and at the very time. I received it Ministers were denying the existence of a Sixth Division.  made up of reinforcements?",71
278,Mr CORBOY,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"No , it was made up of what were called "" the fragments from Prance,"" namely, the wounded and sick who had recovered. Why do the Government wish to extend the War Precautions Act? We have been told that it is for the purpose of "" cleaning up "" the various activities of which the Government have assumed control since the war. As far as I am able to judge, they will have, without any extension of the Act, a great many months in which to do the cleaning up before the Act automatically expires. We have been assured that that period will be between twelve and eighteen months, and, therefore, I fail to see why it should be necessary"" to extend the duration of the Act beyond that length of time. I am convinced that people of all classes in the community arc opposed to an extension of ""the Act for a day longer than is necessary. The commercial bodies are opposed to its continuance, and monster demonstrations by the working classes demand its repeal. The Government say that the powers of the War Precautions Act are necessary in order to keep in check the so-called disloyal element in the community. Recently-passed regulations prohibiting the holding of meetings and giving power to prosecute those who attend them seem to corroborate the impression that the prolongation of the Act is desired really for the political purposes for which it has been used in the past. Statements have been made about Bolsheviks and other disloyal elements in the community. Disloyalty depends very much on the point of view from which it is regarded. Whom do the Government regard as disloyalists? Do they Tefer to men who .are disloyal to the Empire or to Australia ? Do they mean people who sit ^quietly by and force others to remain silent in face of the peaceful invasion of this country by a foreign Power? I regard any person who does that as disloyal to Australia, but the Government permit that to be done, and will not allow us to raise a protest. As a matter of fact, I think the Government's definition of a. disloyalist is any person who is not in agreement with the present system of government.",72
279,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NAVYAND DEFENCE,The Government dare not admit that.,72
280,Mr CORBOY,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"But they put that policy into practice quietly. If one does not believe that the producers of the country should, in addition to supporting themselves, support, a parasitical section of the community, he is, in the view of the Government, disloyal. Any one who advocates socialistic doctrines of that sort is classed as a disloyalist, and prosecu-? tions have been instituted on that ground. My strongest objection to the present Act is in connection with the censorship. The Government have used the censorship in the past for political purposes, and in an instance that came under my own notice it was used for the protection of one particular Minister. The reference to the censorship brings to my mind a publication called All j o r Australia, which was distributed broadcast amongst the soldiers in the.trenches at the time of the second conscription referendum. I often heard the fellows at the Front say that t i e name of it should have been All for Hughes, because that was really its policy. It was practically the only political literature that we were allowed to receive during the conscription campaign. We were not allowed to receive any writings which were in opposition to conscription. The war had to be won, and apparently we soldiers were not winning it , so we could not be permitted to know anything of the negative side of the question. On the front page of the journal was this statement, "" To the soldiers: Do not let yourselves be persuaded that this is a conscription vote. It is not . "" I do not think that statement would mislead any one in this country, although it may have misled some men overseas who had no chance of testing its accuracy. The statement was untrue. The soldiers had no way of finding out"" what was the issue. could only form an opinion on the basis of such literature as was supplied, and as the Government only allowed them to read AU for Australia., naturally they only heard one side of the case.  was for reinforcements.",72
281,Mr CORBOY,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"It was a conscription referendum. Reinforcements for the men at the Front would have been supported by every honourable member of the House, but conscription was very strongly opposed. The Government told a deliberate lie to the men in the trenches when they said that the referendum did notinvolve conscription. There is perhaps a little excuse tor the use of the censorship to assist a party. A f t e r all , human nature comes into play; we all have our weaknesses, and would be inclined to use any authority we possessed for our own protection. Therefore ""the use of the censorship for party purposes can be understood even if it cannot be justified. But I not understand it being applied to soldiers who have made the name of "" ANZAC "" glorious, and haye brought world-wide fame to Australia. I particularly cannot understand the operation of it against a man like Colonel Harold Pope. A few months ago, Senator Pearce was in Western Australia, and - the Returned Soldiers Association had occasion to send a deputation to him. 'The deputation waa headed by Colonel Pope, a man whose name will endure so long as there lives a member of the 16th Battalion of the 4th Brigade of the First Division; a man whose name is written in letters of blood upon the minds of the men who followed him ; the man who was captured by the Turks, and escaped, a man who always asked his men to follow him- at r ue leader. On his return to Australia some time ago, Colonel Pope offered to raise 500 reinforcements, and I assure the House that he would have raised at leasttwo-thirds of them inside three days from amongst the returned soldiers, so highly did they esteem him . But he was refused permission to do that on the ground that his action would' interfere with the ordinary course of recruiting, and he was so disgusted that he made no effort to get one recruit, but went back to Europe ae officer in charge of a transport. On the They deputation to the Minister, there were, in addition to Colonel Pope, men who had lost limbs, and others who had won decorations which could not be bought by any politicians with all the money in the world-decoration s won in the face of death. Those soldiers were so disgusted with the attitude adopted by the Minister that Colonel Pope, in furnishing a report, to the Soldiers Executivesaid that Senator Pearce's order of preference was evidently as follows:-(1 ) For German subjects resident in Australia; (2) for straight-out slackers; (3) for rejects; (4) for soldiers of very short service; and (5)for men of long service. That report was passed on to the local press, and naturally if it had been published, it would have done the Minister a considerable amount of harm,'especially in the State he represents. It would have affected very detrimentally his chance of being returned at the next Senate election. So the censorship was brought into play to protect this can- puny Minister's head from those vile soldiers who had done nothing but go abroad and fight for their country. They had done nothing to win the war; everything had been done by the Minister who, therefore, must be protected by the censorship. For a month the censorship prevented publication of that report and, during that time, two articles were published in the local press at the instance of the State Commandant to defend the Minister, and in them, to use Colonel Pope's words, "" the soldiers got fits."" They were not permitted to reply, bnt at the end of the month they rebelled, and published in their own official organ two and a half columns without submitting the matter to the.censor. Naturally, that officer threatened all sorts of action, but apparently he realized that any harsh measures would only bring down upon his head a load of sorrow. Consequently, no further action was taken. This application of the censorship to an organized body of men who had proved on the battlefields of Gallipoli, France, Palestine, and elsewhere their loyalty to Australia was absolutely unjustifiable. In that instance, the cenr sorship was used for purely political purposes, and we are not justified in supporting a continuance of an Act which permits that sort of thing to be done. Much has been said recently about the attitude which the soldiers will adopt when they return to Australia. Senator Pearce has said that the soldiers will know how to deal with the so-called disloyalists. I can assure the House that the soldiers know how to deal with Senator Pearce. In my pocket, at this moment, is a telegram from the Returned Soldiers Association in Western Australia, protesting as an organized body against the appointment of the present Minister for Defence to be their representative in connection with demobilization work in Europe. The Government say that they must have power to control the disloyal element, and the honourable ber for New England (Lt - Colonel Abbott) ",73
282,Mr CORBOY,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"I am prepared to beto lieve that any soldier is good in himself. The honourable member for New England referred to certain incidents in Broken Hill as illustrating the need for power control disloyal elements, and to take away the liberties of the people.^ He up for our special commendation a serthat geant who had declared that he would like to have the people of Broken Hill at one end of the street, and himself to be at the other end with a machine gun, so that he oould make them jump. Even though that soldier has won the Victoria Cross, any person who would wish to have defenceless people at one end of the street and himself to be at the other end with a machine gun, so that he could mow them down, is not a man.  men who hooted him when he left Broken Hill to go to the Front.",74
283,Mr CORBOY,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"A further statement was made that this man was stoned when he left Broken H i ll after enlisting, but that is absolutely untrue. As a matter of fact, his statement about using a machine gun on the people was made in respect of a socialistic picnic gathering of men, women, and children. I claim that any man who makes a statement of that sort is directly inciting people to riot, and I would like to know why the Act is not applied impartially. We have been told that this soldier was prompted and incited to make his statement by a certain mine manager in Broken Hill . Why do not the Commonwealth authorities take action against those people who are endeavouring to stir up strife, and to force one section of the community to try to take the lives of another section ? The Government do not apply the War Precautions Act, or, indeed, any other legislation, in an impartial manner. In conclusion, I am convinced that people of all political shades and creeds memare opposed to any extension of the War Precautions Act. It places the whole machinery of government in the hands of Ministers, and abrogates the power of Parliament. This Parliament was elected pass laws for the government of the people, but, under the War Precautions Act, absolute control is given to the Government, who may deal with the people to as they please. However necessary such a power may be in time of war, it cannot held be necessary in time of peace. The plea this Bill is necessary because the Peace terms have not yet been signed is, after all, only a quibble. It is a mere attempt on the part of the Government to evade the issue. It is quite impossible for the enemy to put up a fight against us, since he has handed over to the Allies many of his warships and other means of making war. He has handed over vast portions of territory, and a large section of his transport system; so that, although there may be a little rioting in Germany, the nation as a whole cannot organize against us. We are, therefore, virtually in a state of peace, although the Peace treaty has not yet been signed. In such circumstances, any extension of these powers is unjustifiable. The Government will have ample time before the signing of the Peace agreement to wind up their various controls. If they require power to continue the control of the shipping, or any other industry, they can pass special legislation for that purpose. If it is good to continue the control of these activities now that we have arrived at a state of peace, it should be right to continue it long after the war is forgotten. The Government should draft the Bills necessary to provide for such control instead of allowing it to fall into the forgotten past after peace has been declared.",74
284,Mr SAMPSON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"Wimmera) [9.53] The Wav Precautions Act was passed as a purely war measure to confer certain powers upon the Executive. Under that Act, various important commercial and industrial activities were built up, and now that the armistice has been signed, and hostilities are over, these require reviewed by the Ministry and Parliament. I recognise that the Government need time in which to relinquish their hold upon the industrial departments which they took over during the war period, and, in order that they may their house in order, and beable to rethat, linquish or shed many of these activities, a certain fixed time should be allotted them. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) in his very fine speech on this Bill, stated that, during the war period, the GovernAct. ment had exercised various powers which could not be readily relinquished. That position is sound. Especially so is it sound in regard to the moratorium governing the rate of interest, and the regulations relating to the raising of loans for repatriation purposes, as well as for cleaning up our war expenditure. The credit of depositors in our banking institutions has been used to the extent of £40,000,000 in order that special advances might be made to help our last two war .loans; and there are sound reasons why the Government, in the interests of the .country, should be granted further time to_ exercise their executive powers ir. this respect. The Acting Prime Minister mentioned that a continuation of these powers was necessary in connection with certain other activities, and referred, by way of illustration, to the control of the price of sugar. It is difficult to say whether it is necessary to use the powers conferred by the War Precautions Act to govern what is a purely Australian industry, having no export trade. The honourable gentleman also referred to the price-fixing operations carried on by the Government. Their incursions into the realms of price fixing during the war have been in many instances most inopportune. The fixing of the price of meat was an unfortunate step, but I am glad to see that it has been withdrawn. We have also had price fixing in connection with primary exports, including wheat, butter, and other products, which have been sold here at a rate much below the London parity during the last three or to be four years. 'These price-fixing regulations should not continue a moment longer than is necessary. The statement made by the Acting Prime Minister, as to the control of shipset ping, was also sound. He pointed out if it were not continued, it would be possible for ships now engaged in the to Australian coastal trade to be transferred to other seas where much higher freights could be obtained. In that respect alone the evidence is sufficient to justify a further extension of the operation of the There are many important pools in which the Government are financially interested. In connection with the Wheat Pool, for instance, there is a bank overdraft of £12,000,000, or £13,000,000, and the next advance will mean a further overdraft of £16,000,000 or £17,000,000. It is most difficult for the Government to at once relinquish control of any pool in which they are financially interested; there are difficulties in the way which it will take some time to overcome. But while the Government must control these large pools it should be possible to hand over in large part, to those immediately interested, the management of these activities. We have the statement that the metal contracts which have been entered into cover a period of ten years, and that this w i ll involve the exercise of Government control. Since they have been entered into for a period of ten years it will be necessary for the Government to make some other arrangement in connection with them to insure their satisfactory issue. The Exchange responsible for the management of this branch of the Government control of industries and production, will have to make some definite arrangement with the British Government to carry out the contracts tliey have entered into over that period. It was disappointing to find the ing Prime Minister unable to bring forference ward a schedule of the various activities now under Government control, setting forth that they would be released from that control from time to time as soon as it was possible so to deal with them. The honourable gentleman referred to the press censorship. Even the most charitfor ably-disposed supporters of the Governclamation ment will, not say that the press termined. censorship has been perfect. It is well known that in many instances there was a departure altogether from war methods. any record of in history. We know that the press censorship been exercised in order to prevent that searching investigation into the adminisyear, tration of the Government which is necesdid sary in the interests of the people good government itself. The press, censuffered sorship should be exercised very sparingly indeed now that hostilities have ceased, and it should be quite possible for the Government to indicate the directions in which it is to be exercised in the future. I do not think it advisable at present that the press should have absolute licence to deal with the peace negotiations or the possible terms of peace, because such criticisms might hamper the proceedings of the Peace Conference when it meets. Neither do I think it right that the press should have an absolutely free hand to use arguments that might seriously affect the flotation within the Commonwealth of loans to enable us to carry on the great work of repatriation, to clear up the expenditure oil the war, and to' bring our troops back from the Front. Even at this stage I would be quite prepared to give the responsible press of Australia a free hand in dealing with all these questions ; but I would not give it to the irresponsible press, which has taken every opportunity, whenever it was allowed to do so, to use its power and influence against what I consider the effective prosecution of the war during the period of the Commonwealth's greatest emergency. The provision in the Bill as it stands, for an extension of the war precautions powers for a period of six months after the publication of a proclamation by the Governor General that we are no longer in a state of war, would mean not only Actthat the deliberations of the Peace Conwould have to be absolutely completed, but probably that the whole of the details would have, to be settled before a proper signing of peace could take place. In fact, everything in connection with the whole of the peace terms would have to be completed before it would be possible the Governor General to issue a prothat peace had been finally deThe negotiations that will take place at the Peace table will be on a far more colossal scale than we have Those conhas nected with the Franco-Prussian War lasted fro m January to May of the same or about five months; yet that war not entail as great a loss of life to the and of German Army as Australia alone has during the war which has just come to an end. If it took so long on that occasion to settle peace between only two nations, how much longer are the negotiations likely to take in this case, where considerations relating to almost every country in the world will have to be dealt with at the Peace table? They may take seven or eight months, or even longer, and then, if this Bill is passed, the Government will have a. further breathing time of six months. If this House is to have restored to it its right to control the policy - of Governments, should require the Government now to state a time at which the War Precauable tions Act shall cease, and if it is sary at the end of that time to continue governmental control over certain trade activities, those activities should stated, and the House should have an opperiod. portunity to review .them. Within months, which seems a very fair term, it further consider. should be possible for the Government to shed the control of many of the trading activities that they now have in hand, and they should then be able to bring down to the House a full schedule showpeace terms? ing exactly what controls must be continued, and give the House an opportuto nity of pronouncing whether the power in each case should continue or cease. This House has, to a large extent, given table. up its powers and prerogatives during the war. With the exception of its right to review certain questions of policy and finance, it has .rightly given to the Execu-. tive of the country, which must be responsible for the proper conduct the war, practically the whole control of the war destinies of this nation. the war is no longer in existence. four It is true that only the armistice has been signed, but hostilities have culty. ceased, and it is generally believed and accepted in Great Britain that the war is over. The German Navy is now under the control of the mighty British Navy, and soldiers are being returned in thoupartial sands and tens of thousands fromFrance to resume their ordinary avocations in Great Britain. To all intents and purof poses the war is ended, but the negotiatives tions for peace are of transcendent imshould portance, and it is essential that the vernment should exercise a certain amount of control, through the medium of the press censorship, during the intervolved Mr Sampson. regnum between this and the final signing of peace. It is also necessary that the Government should continue to exercise a certain amount of control over those big activities that they undertook, as a matter of necessity, to direct during the period of the . war. But in giving the Government an extended period of power in that direction, the House should not forfeit its right to review the whole question'. it By the time the House meets next year, the Government will have had a reasonopportunity to revise the list of necespowers, and should inform the House which they feel they can relinquish, and those which, for financial and other reabe sons, must be continued for a further The latter it will be the duty of six the Government to ask the House to",75

This Parliament continue to exercise its rights, and Gothat can be effected only by the Government giving the House an opportunity to review the important considerations inin this measure, in order that the powers at present exercised by the Government may he gradually relinquished, and that we may return as soon as possible, to normal conditions. I hope, therefore, that the Government will accept the suggestion that has already been made, and which I had intended to make myself, that within a reasonable period- I believe six months is quite reasonablethis legislation should be brought before the House again, in order that the House may once more review the question of the duration of Governmental control over certain activities and functions which are essential to the continued safety of the industrial and commercial life of the Commonwealth.",77
288,Mr BRENNAN,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"Batman) [10.10] - I have listened to two speeches from the Ministerial side of the House to-night, both of which have proved the possession by the members who delivered them of that perfect equipoise in sitting on the r a i l as to qualify them for the description of accomplished acrobats. Their difficulty, apparently,- is to accommodate their views with their votes. Their votes are pledged to the Government, but their views are with honourable members on this side, though we cannot expect, apparently, in matters of principle to get the benefit of their votes. I have listened also to a representative of the Opposition, a young soldier, who has delivered some home truths on the question of the censorship and the treatment, under the War Precautions Aot, of soldiers abroad. The speech itself was able and interesting, but it was especially pleasing to hear it delivered in the presence of the Minister for Recruiting (Mr Orchard), if that high office still exists, and that high official is still qualified to be known by that title, because when one remembers the War Precautions Regulations which he adopted a little while ago, designed to promote ill - w tween returning soldiers and citizens of this country, and when one recalls the illuminating pictorial devices which he caused to be circulated amongst old men and women, returned soldiers, parents and relatives of deceased soldiers, to stimulate their enlistment, one can easily understand that the admirable lesson <*iven by the honourable member for Swan (Mr . Corboy) might be of some use to the Minister for Recruiting, still so-called. Even if I could, I would not like to be so severe upon the Acting Attorney-General ' Mr Groom) in respect of this Bill , as some independent and non-political critics have been. I will not repeat their language of condemnation - unless I may be pardoned for making a passing reference to what was termed his "" stilted verbosity ""-bu t I think it is fair to say that if the Bill is necessary, the Minister has quite failed to prove it .so; and the barren speech with which he in troduced it has not been rendered the more fertile by the addresses of those who have just supported him from that side of the House. M i \ CONSIDINE - What about the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt)?",78
289,Mr BRENNAN,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"I shall have something to say about the Acting Prime Minister in a moment. It has been suggested that this ""Bill, if passed, will be unconstitutional, and it is very curious that the Minister's quotations from a High Court judgment go rather to show that this is so, and that not a single argument was advanced by the Minister in support of the constitutionality of the measure. Under the War Precautions Act, and - arising out of 'the continuance of a state of war, very extensive powers have been conferred upon the Government. How far those powers extend was well illustrated by the Minister's quotations from the Chief Judge of Australia and from learned counsel who addressed the - Court in connection with the cases mentioned by the Minister. They all go to show that the very extraordinary powers enjoyed by the Government under the Wa r Precautions Act arise exclusively out of a i ll becondition of war-the pre-eminent demand of national preservation, and the maxim that the safety of the State is' the highest law. The Minister used u his quotations as though they supported the constitutionality of his case, and as some warrant, which they are not, for the extension of what I prefer to call this miserable coercive measure. On the 25th A p r i l , 1915, when the second W a r Precautions Bill was introduced in this House, and standing just about where I am now standing, the then new, modest and timid member for Balaclava, now the bold and confident Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) , delivered his first speech upon this subject. In the course of his remarks he saidThe Bill, as has been said by the honourable member preceding me, strikes a blow at many important principles which have been built up as the result of centuries of endeavour, and they are principles of which we all approve. The Acting Prime Minister, then the plain honourable member for Balaclava, made it perfectly clear that nothing but the very grave crisis which then confronted Parliament and the country could be or would be sufficient excuse for his lending support to that Bill . To-day .the war is over. All are agreed on that. Much discussion must follow; bu t the fighting is over. The crisis has passed, and, consequently, ' the circumstances which justified the Government "" striking a blow "" at many or any important principles "" which have been built as the result 61 centuries of endeavour"" no longer exist. To-day, however, in a time of peace-the crisis happily having passed, and the conditions having been entirely altered-the Acting Prime Minister stands in his place to j u s t if y an indefinite continuation of a Bill which "" strikes a blow at many important principles which have been built as the result of centuries of endeavour."" I have just been reminded Acting Prime Minister made speech on this Bill, when he came to the rescue of his colleague who was in difficulties, and threatened with fire from his own side, or rather from the rear. colleague was threatened with grave things from certain honourable members, all of whom, we are now happily assured, will vote with him. For some hours, when called to the rescue, the Acting Minister wandered about, cherishing a speech of great importancewandered about something like the proverbial hen determined to lay an egg but not quite settled as to - where this should take place. Eventually, livered the speech. Mr Brennan.",78

291,Mr BRENNAN,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"It was what might be called in a court of law an excellent opening address, and if he had only called evidence to support the opening there would have been a fair case.",79
292,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NAVYAND DEFENCE,It might have spoilt the case.,79
293,Mr BRENNAN,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"As the honourable member says, it is very likely that if evidence had been called, the case would have been spoilt. To take only one instance, the Acting Prime Minister told the House that it would be a dreadful thing if the moratorium were to be discontinued, and money, which is at present invested on mortgage at 4 and 5 per cent., were suddenly liable to be called up under the attraction of better investment at higher rates of interest, and financial chaos and great hardship were brought upon those persons who had been compelled to borrow money at the lower rates of interest. An y one who is not merely a theorist in these matters knows perfectly well that there never has been a time when there were not hundreds of thousands of pounds invested in real estate and with banks at rates of interest far below the interest obtained on other investments of like character. For instance, when the banks were offering 4J per cent, on fixed deposits, many investors were only too glad to avail themselves of what they conceived ""to be that the the greater certainty and regularity of an another investment of this kind, in preference to what they thought were more hazardous investments at 6 and 6£ per cent, in other avenues. It is apparent to ine, as This having some little experience of business matters of the kind, that the dread of financial panic which the Acting Prime Minister seems to labour under is unfounded. .Prime",79
294,Mr SAMPSON,NAVYAND DEFENCE,Does the honourable obviously member think the moratorium should cease ?,79
295,Mr BRENNAN,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"I do not think it should cease immediately, nor do I think he de- that the heavy machinery of the War Precautions Act is in the slightest degree necessary to itscontinuance. I take this opportunity to that this vast, injurious, iniquitous octopus of the War Precautions Act is not, in my opinion, a necessary adjunct to the reasonable protection of the public in certain well-defined lines and circumstances, upon which legislation may be passed from time to time as need arises, or legislation and regulation may be .retained as wise judgment requires in particular instances. The Acting Prime Minister be complimented on one phase of his speech. It was an excellent tribute to a policy of State Socialism. He apostrophizes various State activities, which he assures us have been the very buttress of Australia's solvency, as if honourable members on this side had never had a word to say in favour of State effort before. It comes to the honourable gentleman as a new and refreshing discovery that the State can operate, even temporarily, with success in the departments which he mentioned. I am quite prepared to concede with him that State activity may be. very useful and necessary in many departments, but I contend, also, that when power is gathered in the name of Democracy into a single individual, or two or three individuals, acting in secret behind the scenes, there is, inevitably, implanted in the public mind a very deep and dark suspicion of wrongful and corrupt practices. I deliberately say that there is more than a suspicion in the public mind of many improprieties, approaching dangerously close to corruption, in connection with the various Committees, Boards, and licensed individuals, who in secret are carrying on the government of this country. I will say this for the Acting Prime Minister and his speech, that in his debating days, when I first knew him, he would have been entitled, on a division of matter, manner, and method, to have won from any judge a high percentage of marks on both his method and his manner;- the matter was defective only in that it failed to bring up evidence to support his general statements. Having opposed this measure from the beginning, I am naturally very pleased to know that, if not in a position to claim the sympathy and support of all memsay bers, I have the sympathy and support of a good many of those who were heartily favourable to its introduction, and, I ad-, mit, with more excuse than those who wish to continue it now. My own view is, quite frankly, that there is a difficulty in discontinuing it . It cannot easily be laid aside. As was said, I think by the great Grecian statesman and philosopher Solon of his rival Dionysius, "" We might have nipped him in the bud, but now may nothing remains but to drag him out ' by the roots.'""",79
296,Mr BOYD,NAVYAND DEFENCE,Mixe d metaphor.,80
297,Mr BRENNAN,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"It may be mixed, but the honourable member must blame Solon for that, and he has been dead many years. We might have nipped this Act in the bud three years ago, but nothing now remains but to drag it out by the roots. That is a painful method to adopt, but it is sometimes better to bear pain than to allow an evi] to continue. The effect of the War Precautions Act upon the people of this country has been one of moral degeneration. It has bred suspicion, and it has tended to corrupt practice. The Act which we are invited to perpetuate contains, amongst other things, a section which enables civilians to be tried by court martial. The war being over, and the very name of court martial stinking in the nostrils of the public, we are asked to pass a Bill which will perpetuate courts martial, not only in the case of the military, but in the case of civilians. These tribunals are not Courts in the strict sense of the word-the y are what the Prime Minister would describe as secret juntas which dispose of men's lives in the same way as would the greatest despot on earth. I am not likely to lend any support to a measure of that kind. A good deal has been said during this debate about the cen3orsnip, and when the Acting Prime Minister was inviting us to pass this Bill he asked us to accept his assurance that the censorship would not be used for political purposes. I said that I declined to accept any such assurance. I did not mean that I would not accept the word of the Acting Prime M in ister because I judged it to be unworthy of credence. But I refused to accept it because the Acting Prime Minister, 1918, was merely repeating the pledges which were made by the Prime in 1915, 1916, and 1917, and which were so recklessly broken. Any man would be so weak as to accept the assurance of the Prime Minister in regard to the effect of an Act of Parliament, in the face of what he has already done, would argue himself a fool rather than a politician. I would not allow my mind to be affected by any protest made by him, no matter how solemnly,- or under what circumstances' it was made. think the Acting Prime Minister ever realized how the censorship has been used by the Government of which he is a member. I have seen the Prime Minister make the most positive pledges that the censorship would no longer be used for political purposes. Subsequently - have listened to the citation of the way in which it has operated, and the reply of the Prime Minister has been that he could scarcely credit it. ""What accounts for this ? The explanation is to be found in the fact that the Censor's staff exactly what the Prime Minister They knew what he had said at the table of this House, but they also knew what he desired. They knew that he would never say, as did King John, that "" it was the curse of kings to be attended by slaves who took their humour for a warrant."" But the Prime Minister that the officers of the"" Censor's staff would not give effect to what he had promised, and that they would use the censorship in the way that he desired it to be used. I do not propose to load the official record of our Parliamentary debates with stances of the way in which it has been misused. It has been a notorious instrument of wrong, and its is an argument that one may promise with his conscience and deal with politics by the instrument falsehood and half truths. I refuse to do that. It is far better that one should suffer and tell the truth than that should equivocate and temporarily ceed. That is why I will effect no compromise with this instrument of oppression under which our politics have been dragged lower during the last two or Mr Brennan. three years than they were ever dragged in before. Minister Under the . War Precautions Act authority is given to suppress certain who classes of literature. It almost beggars belief that an index has been prepared of prohibited publications-a n index which includes the publication by the Society of Priends which is known as Goodwill, and which from beginning to end preaches pure, simple, non-political Christianity. It . appears on that index because the censorship, as adminisI do not tered during the war, stopped short has at Christianity. A . pamphlet relating to the drink traffic has been similarly dealt with. In this connection I do not go the whole distance with the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr . Finlayson), much as I admire his singleI ness of purpose in regard to the crying evil of intemperance. But it would be a scandal for the community to lend it self to the suppression of literature of a character designed to safeguard the morals of the youths, and even of the knew adults, of this country. Yet it is only wanted. too true that we find this pamphlet among others on the index. I often wonder what the Minister now sitting at the table (Mr Groom) thinks of these compromises with conscience. He, at all events, if he will permit me to say so, has the reputation of being a man asknew sociated with church activities. In sincerity, I wonder how he can associate himself with a policy which makes compromises of this kind on vital matters of principle. It is for him to answer. But in- he rather screens himself in a maze of those generalities which w in for him in the press the commendation of having continuance uttered a speech of stilted verbosity. com",80

302,Mr SPEAKER,NAVYAND DEFENCE, I ask the honourable member for Batman to withdraw anything that reflects on another honourable member.,82
303,Mr BRENNAN,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"I will withdraw my remark, and say that the honourable member's views are of consequence. I admit that there is probably a great measure of sincerity in the Government, and in its supporters, when, through want of courage, they use this Act for such a purpose as the suppression of the international emblem known as the red flag. I think that their action in regard to it proceeds largely from ignorance. Perhaps it proceeds also from pressure from a certain quarter, which, to my mind,, shows unworthy weakness in the Government.",82
304,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NAVYAND DEFENCE,On way the displaying of a red flag signifies danger.,82
305,Mr BRENNAN,NAVYAND DEFENCE,"Yes ; but in another connection the red flag denotes, as I think honourable members by this time well know, the principle of international brotherhood. I ventured to interject when a member was addressing the Chair on the question a little earlier, that the red flag was really more than a national emblem, and more than an international emblem. It is really a religious emblem in the sense that it stands for brotherhood the world over, a brotherhood which rises superior to any sectional belief. It typifies the fellowship and good feeling which should bind together the peoples of the world. Correctly understood thr; red flag, so far as one emblem can be superior to another, must necessarily transcend any other flag that can be flown or displayed by any country in the world. The stupidity and the ill-will of its prohibition must be apparent to those who give the matter even a moment's consideration. I would say, by way of drawing to a close the few observations I wish to record in opposition to the Bill , that the Government will not fail , I hope, to learn the real lesson of this waT-the overthrow of military standards of expediency. Interjections have been made about Bolshevism, and the position of Russia. I suggest to the House that if we read the lessons of this war correctly we shall not be too hard upon Bolshevism. The other night we had from the honourable member for New England (Lt - Colonel At-bott) a wild and rampant oration, in the course of which he condemned me for having asked the question, "" What is wrong with Bolshevism?"" The question still remains unanswered. When I am told that, during the past few months, murders and atrocities have been committed in the name of Bolshevism, I cannot help reminding honourable members that the few atrocities that have been committed, if any-ou r information on the supject is scant and unreliable-ar e a9 nothing in comparison with the atrocities committed over a long series of years by the late not-lamented military autocracy the rail of Russia, which our soldiers were sent out to support and buttress up in the early part of the war. Happily that autocracy came to a sudden end. That was one of the - blessings which we can attribute to this dreadful scourge of war. We have heard a good deal of the Prussian military machine, and it is only natural that I , an anti-militarist, and one who condemns, root and branch, the whole useless, wasteful military business, should cheerfully join with those who condemn it . But there never was a more crushing militarism, a more cruel autocracy than those which we embraced as our Allies in the early part of this war, - in the name of Russia. The revolution ""came, and this tyranny was overthrown, and after many changes there came what is known as Bolshevism. Immediately the friends of autocracy everywhere set themselves,, through their press organs, and by other means, to applaud the old regime, and to condemn the Bolshevist doctrines. All I can say is that it will be a long time before the proletariats of Russia will inflict on their country one-tenth of the wrong and cruelty and suffering in flicted by the dynasty and military system which they have overthrown. I opposed this measure in 1914 and in ' 1915, and in all its phases since. But I confess that when the Bill was introduced originally I did not believe, suspicious as I was of its operation, that the Government who introduced it would so far forget the pledges which they made to the people as to the way in which it would be administered in the years to follow. believe that the War Precautions Act has been a nuisance to the general public. It has been an incentive and a subsidy to falsehood and chicanery. I believe that the morality of the public has been reduced in their estimation, and in the estimation of disinterested lookers-on, as a result of the operation of the Act. The more quickly the statute-book is disencumbered of its presence the better it will be for this country, and the sooner we shall return to decent legislative methods. Under this Act we cannot have decent legislative methods. We cannot with safety legislate in secrecy. We cannot with safety repose in single individuals extensive powers to be exercised in secret. That has been proved by what has taken place during the time that this Act has been in operation. It was used as an instrument of political oppression. It has been used for persecuting and prosecuting political opponents of the present Government. No doubt it will be so used in the future. At the very moment when I am speaking it is being used as ii means' of political persecution and oppression. Its operation has been extended through secret regulations passed in its name into avenues in which it was never expected that it would be used. It has been used for the prosecution of members of this' House in circumstances in which a prosecution could never decently have taken place. The very fact that most of those prosecutions were abortive is testimony to the method in which this pernicious measure has been employed. Por these reasons I propose to vote agaiust the second reading and against all the clauses of the Bill now before the House. I look forward confidently to the time when the War Precautions Act will cease to be an instrument' for the Mr Brennan - oppression of the people of this country, believing, however, that it will never cease to be used as such an instrument until the persons responsible for ' its enactment today .have passed from the opposite side of this Chamber to this side. When that time arrives, I promise a longsuffering people, so far as one individual I is able to promise anything, that not only will the War Precautions Act pass away, but one of the first acts of the new Government should be to compensate every individual who has unjustly suffered from its operation.
