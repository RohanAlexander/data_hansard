7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member would not be in order in doing that. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - The substance of the statement on which I base question is that in Mexico recently an uirship, hanging over a warship, was able almost to smash her decks, and drove her out to sea. In view of the fact that this warship had to put to sea to save herself from the attacks of a hawk-of a little bit of an airship- I ask the Prime Minister will he see that no more money is spent vessels of war, or other craft, or engines of destruction, or economic waste; in until a Royal Commission has gone into whole expenditure of the Defence Department?",11

12,Mr KELLY,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The r e is no justification for the assumption that the agreement provides for anything in the nature of preference to unionists. It is ment with a certain union that its members will work at certain rates of pay as far as Tarcoola, but its scope is limited to the members of the union ; it cannot bind any other persons who are not parties to it . The statement that the agreement provides for preference, or anything in the nature of preference, to unionists is without foundation.",12

Mr W . H . IRVINE - I have no knowledge of the intentions of the company; and, therefore, cannot answer the first question. The matter is entirely in the hands of the Minister of External Affairs. The second question I have already answered, it having been put to me by another honourable member.",12
16,Mr FENTON,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Will the Minister of External Affairs state whether the newspapers are correct in reporting that the Marconi Company intends to proceed with its litigation with the Commonwealth Government?,12
17,Mr GLYNN,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Crown Solicitor has not, I think, received any letter from the solicitors of the company, but, so far as I can ascertain, the action is to be proceeded with, and we are, of course, making necessary provision for an adequate defence in the event of the action being fought out. As a matter of fact, I had an interview this morning with the Crown Solicitor and counsel, and, so far as I know at present, the action will be proceeded with. BEEF TRUST.",12

20,Mr KELLY,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"On the 7th May the honourable member for Maribyrnong asked me to make inquiries into the complaint that at some of our military horse depots men are called upon to work unnecessarily long hours on' Sunday, because, seemingly, some superior officer wishes to bring along a friend in the afternoon to inspect the horses. The honourable member asked that this excessive Sunday work should be stopped. I have been in formed by the Minister of Defence that the District Commandant reports that, as a result of inquiries, it has beeu ascertained that there is not the slightest justification for such a complaint. The members of the Remount Section, the Commandant states, are paid as other soldiers, that is, for seven days in week, and are detailed in turn for day duty as required, the hours being from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., as on ordinary days. NA INSPECTION.",12
21,Mr SHARPE,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"I ask the Minister External Affairs if it is true, as reported, that he proposes to appoint two inspecnot tors of land for service in the Northern Territory, to fill the position lately cupied by Mr Ryland?",13
22,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"No ; I have not thought of appointing two inspectors to fill Ryland's position. The office that held was thought to be unnecessary, its duties have been taken over by others in the Service. There has been a genemy ral re-organization of the work of oflicials of the Northern Territory. appointment was made about four months ago, of a gentleman named Williams, who had been to South America in connection with inquiries as Orders are silent. to the possibilities of Welsh Patagonian immigration. For reasons principally connected with immigration, when that gentleman returned his services were retained, and he was given the title of arisen. inspector, but no addition has been made to the staff in consequence of Mr. land's retirement.

24,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"Kennedy) [2.45]. that was done- I rise on a question of privilege and I and in writingshall conclude my remarks with a motion. that was doneI trust that honourable members will give me attention for the few minutes I shall be speaking. I shall not detain the House for many moments, but the matter I wish to bring forward is one of vital importance in connection with the conduct our proceedings, not merely at the pre/ cussed? the sent moment, but also in the future, Sunbecause what we may do at the present time may affect other Parliaments, and other members, .after we have gone. In those circumstances, I think it is only fair that this matter should be dealt with, apart from any party feeling. What I refer to is the taking away of of the right of honourable members to discuss the rulings of Mr Speaker. It is my intention to traverse those rulings, or to say whether they are good ocor bad. It has been stated that motions disagreeing to Mr Speaker's ruling have been placed in-such a position on the busiMr ness-paper that the House will have no he opportunity of ever discussing them. On and this point our own Standing Orders are most specific, and for that reason it is not intention to indulge in long extracts the from May's Parliamentary Practice. Our An first standing order says that we shall have recourse to the House of Commons practice only when our own Standing",13
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"I rise to order. I submit this is not a question of privilege,, such as is meant by our Standing Orders. It is not a matter that has suddenly It affects no privilege of the House except such as can be dealt with Ryeither by notice, or by the ordinary ma. chinery of the House. Therefore^ I submit that there is nothing in this question which warrants interference with the ordinary practice of the House. This is not of a matter of privilege suddenly arising, such as is necessary to be dealt with precedent to the transaction of other business.",13
26,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"In regard to that point of order. I would point out to the Prime Minister that we have departed from our own standing order which says that a motion to disagree to Mr Speaker'sruling must be discussed on the next day. Standing order 287 says- Q If any objection is taken to the ruling or decision of the Speaker, such objection must, be taken at once; and motion made, which, if seconded, shall beproposed to the House, and debate thereonforthwith adjourned to the next sitting day.",13
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,What then?,13
28,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,What do those words of mean but that the motion must be dis,13
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,You know better (than that.,14
30,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"I will admit candidly that I do not know better than that. W it h very rare exceptions, no precedent can be found for a motion to disagree to the r u l ing of the Speaker not being discussed next day. Indeed, that is the practice of this House. I do not know whether any such case arose during Mr Carty Salmon's Speakership, but that practice was always followed when Sir Frederick Holder was Speaker, and when I was in the Chair - such a motion was brought forward by the honourable member for Capricornia, and it was immediately placed at the head of the notice-paper for the next day. I would urge the Prime Minister not to take objection to m y motion at the present moment. So far as I am personally concerned, the discussion of the motion to dissent from your ruling , Mr Speaker, would not - occupy a quarter of an hour. I - wish to make is that you, and you alone, have the right to fix the business of the House.",14
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,Does able member find authority for that statement in the Standing Orders?,14
32,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,It is the common practice. The House is above the Government; it can displace a Government.,14
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND, above Mr Speaker.,14
34,Mr MCDONAL D,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"Quite so. any of its privileges are attacked the House has the right to decide what shall be done, and is, therefore, above the Government in these matters. As soon as Mr Speaker has read the prayers, does he not ask whether any honourable member, has a petition to present, and is it not a fact that the Government of the day cannot prevent the presentation of a petition if it is in order? again, is it not a fact that Mr Speaker next calls for notices of motions and questions, and that notices of motions may then be given? the business-paper which covers a page, and the reading of which must have occupied full y five minutes. so, the question of the length of a notice of motion is not material to the issue. Honourable members may ask what questions they think proper when you, Mr . Speaker, call on notices of motions and questions.",14
35,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"I do not think the honourable member will find that questions, without notice, are called for ; the call is for notices of motions.",14
36,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"Notice s of motions, and, I think, questions are called.",14
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,Is this discussion taking place on the point of order?,14
38,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,Yes .,14
39,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,The honourable member raised the point of order.,14
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"Then permit me in the circumstances to withdraw the point of order, because the discussion of it is going to take longer, apparently, than would the discussion of the question of privilege.",14
41,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,The Prime Minister The point is righ t in withdrawing his point of order. I shall not take long in discussing the question of privilege.,14
42,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"I shall have to in the honor- tervene, irrespective of the action taken by the Prime Minister, since the motion is' not one affecting privilege, but relates really to our own Standing Orders and practice, and does not come within the definition of what constitutes privilege as I have already pointed out, I think, on two recent occasions. The question of And it is also petitions and notices of motion being called on is specifically provided for in the Standing Orders. That is why they When are called on first. W it h reference to this question, I can only repeat what I said when the matter was raised before. Personally, I should much prefer that motions relating to my rulings were disposed of at once. No standing order, however, exists giving any precedence to motions to dissent, and the House has directed that Government business shall take precedence at every sitting. The noticeThen, paper is strictly in order according to the resolutions of the House. Whatever my personal wishes, I have no power to alter it . There is one on",14
43,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,Do I understand,14
44,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"I wish to intimate, That being at the outset, that I do not propose to allow my decisons to be made the subject of a debate immediately after they are given. In order that there might be no misunderstanding as to what my ruling was, I read it to the House, so that it might be perfectly clear.",14
45,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"I have no desire to traverse your ruling, Mr Speaker, but I wish to know whether the Government, in the event of my moving that your ruling be disagreed with, will allow the niotion to be discussed tomorrow ? - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Will the honourable member allow me to intervene with an explanation ?",15
46,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,Yes .,15
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,I desire to say generally that this departure from the ordinary practice of the House has been rendered necessary by the circumstances in which we find ourselves.,15
48,Mr J,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,H. CATTS - The Prime Minister admits that it is a departure from the practice.,15
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"A departure I from the practice, but not from the Standing Orders.",15
50,Mr MAHON,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,A very serious departure.,15
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"I admit that it is, and the circumstances are serious. I take this course for the reason that it is perfectly obvious to any watching our proceedings that the whole of the time of the House would be taken up in discussing motions to dissent from Mr Speaker's ruling if it could under the Standing Orders.",15
52,Mr BRENNAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,That is a reflection the House.,15
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,It is a fact.,15
54,Mr JH CATTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"I submit, Mr . Speaker, that the Prime Minister is not in order in casting a reflection upon honourable members who give notice .of motion to dissent from your ruling, and I ask that .he be called on to withdraw the mark just made by him.",15
55,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,The Prime Minister has not so far transgressed any standing order. The honourable gentleman was that pointing out what might happen if unwith limited licence were given to set back vernment business in order to discuss points of order that might possibly be raised for other than legitimate purposes. He is perfectly in order in putting a case.,15
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,Ordinaril y I should be the very last to interpose to prevent a motion of dissent from Mr . Speaker's ruling being disposed of at theearliest possible moment; but I venture to say that since this House met a notice todissent from Mr Speaker's ruling has been given on the average once everyday.,15
57,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,No ; there are only three on the notice-paper.,15
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"But how manynotices of motion have been given and; nothing has come of them? There was, for instance, the notice of motion given the other day by the honourable member for Illawarra, which he could not read, and which therefore went by the boardi..",15
59,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,Order .,15
60,Mr BURNS,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,That is not true.,15
61,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"I ask the honourable"" member for Illawarra to withdraw that statement.",15
62,Mr BURNS,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"In deference to you, sir,. withdraw it , but say that the statement that I could not read my notice of motion* is incorrect.",15
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,Then I shall conclude the whole business by saying that the Government cannot afford the time for likewise these incessant motions.,15
64,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"I wish to make a one personal explanation, and shall not occupy more than a minute or two in doing so-.. The Prime Ministersaid that the reason* why he would not allow your rulings to be done be discussed, Mr Speaker, was",15
65,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"The honourable memon ber will not be in order, under cover of making a personal explanation, in traversing what the Prime Minister has said except in regard to something which affected him personally, and in respect of which he has been misrepresented.",15
66,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"I desire not to make a personal explanation, but to make rea statement just as the Prime Ministerdid. Leave granted.",15
67,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY LAND,"We have been told it is because of the necessity of dealing urgent business that certain noticesGoof motion to dissent from your rulings, Mr Speaker, are not tp be discussed. It is entirely for the Government to say what method shall be employed to prosuch ceed with business, and there are two methods distinctly laid down in the Standing Orders. Under the circumstances, if the Government fail to proceed with the business. their proper course is to resign. SURVEY CONTRACT: LAWRENCE AND CHALMERS.",15

Is this a right procedure for the Deputy Postmaster-General to deal with an oflicer without giving him an opportunity to explain ? 3. If not, will the Postmaster-General diately issue instructions that such practice must be instantly discontinued? 4. As clerical division officers commencing duty at 9 a.m. are allowed fifteen minutes' grace (vide Regulations 7 and !) under the Public Service Act) should not the same more especially apply to letter-carriers who have to commence duty at 5.30 a.m.?",17
84,Mr AGAR WYNNE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Deputy Postmaster-General, Melbourne, has furnished the following information in reply to the honourable member's questions:1. An overseer of letter-carriers visits suburban post-offices at 5.30 a.m. to check the attendance of letter-carriers. In cases where late attendance is infrequent, and only of a few minutes' duration, the letter-carrier concerned is merely warned by the overseer. It is essential that letter-carriers be punctual in attendance, in order to obviate complaints from the public of late delivery of correspondence. Letter-carriers claim overtime when their deliveries occupy more than the regulation 'period, and it is, therefore, necessary, so as to minimize such claims as far as possible, to have a careful check kept upon their attendance. 2. It is the usual practice to obtain explanations from the oflicers concerned. 3. Instructions have already been issued as to the procedure to be followed. 4. Explanations are obtained from officers of the Clerical Division who are more than five minutes late in attendance, as Public Service Regulations 7 and 0 provide that fifteen minutes must only be considered as a concession to meet emergent cases. If an officer of the Clerical Division is frequently late in attendance, he is dealt with in precisely the sam.o manner as the officers of the General Division. CLASSIFICATION OE PATENTS.",17
85,Mr JENSEN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"the Attorney General, upon notice I. Whether the Patents Oflice classification of patents differs from the existing system of established patents offices, or is it merely a copy of some well-known classification? 2. How long would it take a teacher of chemistry, an inventor, or a mechanic, to master the key and subdivisions of such classification ? 3. Is the Attorney-General aware that the Commonwealth Patents Office has no systematized alphabetical subject-matter index, such as is connected with the classification systems of the Patents Offices of Great Britain and United States of America? 4. Will the Attorney-General take immediate steps to remedy this alleged defect in the Commonwealth Patents Office?",17
86,Mr WH IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The answers .to the honourable member's questions are1. The classification is based on well-known principles, but is not a copy of any other classification. 2. It depends altogether upon the capacity immeof the individual. 3. An alphabetical word-index or key to classes is published, which, in connection with the classification, fulfils the purpose of as alphabetical subject-matter index. 4. The defect is not admitted. CAMP: BUNDOORA PARK.",17
87,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the defence authorities propose to impose a small impost on cadets who attended the recent Easter encampment at Bundoora Park? 2. If so, why; and for what?",17
88,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Commandant, 3rd Military District, to whom the matter was referred, has replied as follows:1.

NORTHERN TERRITORY. MEAT WOBKS-ADMINISTRATION .",17

91,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"the Minister of External Affairs, upon notice Whether he will give any reply to the statement made, on the motion for the adjournment of the House on the 14th inst., in reference to the administration of the Nortliern Territory?",18
92,Mr GLYNN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"T be answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l lows :Regarding the Maranboy field, I am aware of the necessity for expedition in regard to the erection of the battery. Some time necessarily elapsed before the plans could be prepared, as it was essential to have surveys and a complete examination made to select the best site, and also some assurances from responsible geological authorities that the field was likely to be a permanent one. When those assurances were received, and surveys, &c, made, I gave instructions for the work to be pressed on with all expedition, and am now in a position to state that a large part of the plant is already under way for the Territory., and the balance will be delivered in Darwin beforo the SOth June. A manager has been appointed, who will supervise the erection of the plant. He is now also en route to Darwin. His instructions are to proceed with the construction as early as possible. The matter of the improvement of the is important, and has already received the IBVINE Administrator's attention. I believe that work is now proceeding. Tho honourable member's useful suggestion as to employing available miners for the purpose has been brought the Administrator's notice. The gold-fields named were retained as gold-fields for two years; but when that expired in April and June, 1911, and May, 1913, they became, by operation of law, to all classes of miners. It was intended continue these fields as new gold-fields longer term, but the proclamations not having been issued t i ll the original period expired, they wore, I am advised, of no effect. I quite agree with the honourable' member to the importance of development of the ing industry, and hope that the very large expenditure now being incurred in that tion will have substantial results in improving the condition of affairs and increasing the popuService. lation in the Territory. URGENT TELEGRAMS.  General, upon notice I. To what extent aro urgent overtaking ordinary telegrams, comparing last two 2. Must an ordinary telegram be detained the sending office t ill all urgent telegrams despatched, and at the receiving end t i l urgent telegrams are delivered? 3. Inasmuch as all telegrams are important, does not the initiation of the urgent-telegram system mean a doubling of charge? 4. Has it been made sufficiently clear to the public that, if their business is important, they must pay double rates for transmission in reasonable time?",18
93,Mr AGAR WYNNE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The answers are1. Taking the Commonwealth as a whole, the percentage of telegraph traffic transmitted as ""urgent"" during the March quarter, 1913, was 7.30, and for the corresponding quarter of the current year, 8.39. 2. Urgent telegrams are given preference over ordinary telegrams, both as regards transmission and delivery. As will be seen by the answer to No. 1, the number of urgent telegrams is comparatively small. 3. Double rates are charged for urgent telegrams; the object being to enable telegrams of relatively greater, importance than others to secure precedence. 4. The treatment accorded urgent telegrams, and the rates payable on same, are clearly set out iii the Commonwealth Postal Guide, page 161. Ordinary telegrams are normally transmitted within a reasonable time; but, as already stated in answer to No. 3, the object of the "" urgent"" system is to enable telegrams of relatively greater importance than others to secure precedence. NA PROHIBITION BILL . Debate resumed from 15th May (vide roads page 1077), on motion by Mr W . H . That this Bill be now read a second time.",18
94,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Wimmera) [3.10] to - In continuing my remarks from Friday last, I should like to deal with two addinew tional phases of non-preference to unionists time in the Government service. On Friday, the open Leader of the Opposition affirmed the to principle that the granting of preference for the to unionists in the Government service did not conflict with the Public Service Act; and when this question was debated as during the last Parliament a great deal minof stress was laid on the fact that all things must be equal before preference to direcunionists was to be given in the Public A merely cursory glance into the history of the introduction of preference to unionists in the Public Service shows clearly that preference to unionists does conflict seriously with the provisions of the Public Service Act, and that if absolute preference to unionists is enyears? forced in regard to the employment of at casual labour in the Government service, arc the principle of "" all tilings being equal "" l all .must necessarily be of no effect. During last Parliament, consequent on the order issued by the Minister of Home Affairs directing that preference to unionists should be given in the Public Service, a niotion of want of confidence in the Fisher Government was tabled. It was shown then that, on the strength of that Ministerial order, the head of the Department of Home Affairs had issued a memorandum stating that preference to unionists must be enforced in regard to casual employment in the Service, and directing that a list of all non-unionists must be furnished to him. I have always claimed that that interpretation of the Minister's order by the permanent head of the Department was the only consistent interpretation it could have. When the no-confidence motion was under discussion in the House, the Prime Minister of the Government attacked declared that 1 1 being equal "" was a necessary condition in the granting of preference, and with that assurance, and with the failure of the Opposition to put the Government out, - the matter rested for the moment; but in September of the same year it was discovered that a minute attached to one of the contracts in the Home Affairs Department declared that absolute preference to unionists must be given to all employed in the carrying out of that contract. It is unnecessary to quote the whole of the minutes and directions, as they are already in Hansard, and must be admitted by honourable members, but the Minister of Home Affairs at the time was, and has been, thoroughly consistent in regard to the matter. He has never tried to whittle down the force of the ukase he issued. He has always declared, as he declared in the House when the second debate took place during last Parliament upon the minute attached to specifications, that absolute preference to unionists was to be given in the employment of labour in connection with the carrying out of these Government contracts. Even after the Prime Minister interjected that "" all things being equal "" was a condition, the Minister of Home Affairs declared that that could not be so, and that when he issued the order that "" all things being equal preference to unionists was to be given,"" he found that his instructions had not been carried out, and that ib was necessary to alter his order by stating that absolute preference to unionists must be carried out, as it was the only possible means of enforcing his policy in the Department. - Mr W. H. IBVINE - And his was never repudiated. Mr Sampson.",18
95,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Minister for Home Affairs declared also that he was master of the Department of Home Affairs, which suggests a very interesting situation. Was the direction given to the Minister by Caucus; was Caucus responsible for the order being given? As a matter of fact, we know that the pressure came from the outside unions, but not from every union ; because, as stated by the Attorney-General on Friday last, not every union is prepared to take up the position taken up by the Parliamentary party. Only quite recently the Premier of Western Australia, Mr . Scaddan, repudiated the claim put forward that there should be absolute preall things ference to unionists in employment in the Public Service.",19
96,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Leader of the party at the time made the statement that "" other things being equal"" was to be a condition.",19
97,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"D u r in g the debate in Parliament, the ex-Prime Minister interjected that "" all things being equal "" was a condition of employment, but that statement was immediately repudiated by the Minister of Home Affairs, who declared that his first order had been ignored, that he had meant absolute preference by it , that he took his instructions from no one, that if he was not to be the boss of the Home Affairs Department he would be like the fifth wheel of the coach, and that he ran his own circus. I think those were his words. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Hear , hear! I was the boss in the Department. Mr W. H. IBVINE - And his colleagues never repudiated his action.",19
98,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I was just about to say so. F r o m the time the last word was said by the Minister, absolute preference to unionists must have been the policy of the Department of Home Affairs u n t i l the Labour Government went out of office.",19
99,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,You pick out statements to suit yourself.,19
100,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am giving a fair resume of the situation. Let me now deal with the assertion of the Leader of the Opposition that preference to unionists in the Government service cannot come into conflict with the provisions of the Public Service Act. Examinaaction tions determine the order in which our officers enter the Public Service, and subsequently the qualifications for promotion are the ability of the officer and the merit he displays in his Department. On the otlier hand, in regard to temporary employees, who ' should come under the Public Service Commissioner, ability, qualification, and order of registration are supposed to be the requirements for employment. Mr KINO O'MALLEY - Temporar y employees do not come under the Public Service Commissioner.",19
101,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"They must be registered, and that matter is in the hands of the Public Service Commissioner. Also the Public Service Commissioner prescribes the questions which applicants must answer when they are registered for temporary employment.",20
102,Mr BKENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Is there any mention of preference in the regulations? Mr SAMPSON"" - No . It is open for any one to make application for employment. The only requirements are that the applicant shall have priority of registration, and that he shall' be qualified to take up his duties. Therefore, preference to unionists must conflict seriously with the Public Service Act in every class of employment that comes directly under t.he Act. In those two points, preference to unionists, as denned by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs and his Leader on Friday last, is a serious contravention of the practice of the Departments, and the letter of the Public Service Act. Mr KINO O'MALLEY - Navvie s have nothing to do with the Public Service Commissioner.",20
103,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am not confining my remarks to the employment of navvies. The gravamen of the charge against the Labour party is that they would apply preference to unionists in the selection of men appointed to carry on the public works of the country. It is the whole body of taxpayers that contributes the £22,000,000 annually paid into the Treasury. This money is the property of the people, for whom the Government of the day is the trustee. Ordinary legislative measures do not receive the assent, of the Governor General until they have been discussed and agreed to by both Houses of the Parliament, and for their interpretation, and for the protection of the people's interests, we have established courts of law. But in the exercise of administrative authority in spending the public revenues, the case is diametrically different. So far as it is concerned the honest discharge of a public trusteeship in administration is the people's only protection. To devote any part of the public funds which have been contributed to the revenue by the whole people to political uses or in rewarding political partisans is a grave and shameless breach of faith on the part of any Government, and a flagrant violation of a sacred trusteeship. It is a misapplieation of the public funds for political purposes. It establishes within the Commonwealth the vicious principle of spoils to the victors. It constitutes a cruel wrong to every man in the community who is not a member of a political union, although equally with unionists a taxpayer. The recognition of the principle of preference to unionists brands the non-unionists as incapable, and debars free citizens from the opportunity to obtain employment in the Public Service of the country, paid for out of revenue to which they have contributed. It stands as a degradation of the administrative authority and of the political life of the Commonwealth. I regret exceedingly that a unanimous Parliament has not risen in defence .of the purity of our administration, and to preserve unsullied that high and lofty ethical standard of which we are proud, and to which we have attained in the administration of the public affairs of Australia.",20
104,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"West Sydney) [3.24], - When the Bill was last before us I said that I considered it the shadow of a sham, and recent events have strengthened that opinion. If any lingering doubts remained the speech delivered by the Attorney-General last Friday amply justifies my opinion. In the course of his remarks the honourable and learned gentleman left the Bill almost severely alone. He said many surprising and irrelevant things, but his offer to withdraw the Bill if. the Labour party would pledge itself not to give preference to unionists in Government employment should a Labour Ministry again come into power, was supremely inane. Such a proposal destroys the only argument that could be used in support of the action which the Government is taking. Our criticism of that action has been that the Bill is unnecessary, that if passed it would accomplish nothing that what it purports to do has been already done. Regarding it as a legislative bantling, and not as an instrument for parading the patriotic anxiety of the Government to appeal to the people, the only reason for its introduction can be that if it passed it would prevent a Labour Government from granting preference to unionists until a repealing Bill had become law. But what of that ? A Labour Government in power would command a majority in this Chamber, and could, therefore, as easily get a repealing Bill passed as frame an Executive minute providing for preference to unionists. So much for that argument. The Attorney-General, though always a man of infinite resource, surpassed himself in his most recent speech-if ingenuity, and not logic and relevancy, is the supreme triumph in the discussion of political measures-by the cleverness with which he avoided reference to the Bill. He would not have even mentioned it but for his slavish reverence for the Standing Orders. He talked about everything under the sun, and even of things that are not under the sun, taking refuge at last in the revelation of St. John the Divine. Anything more hopelessly inappropriate than such a quotation from such a quarter could not be imagined. The Bill purports to do something already done. It has been introduced really to serve as a vehicle for an early appeal to the country. But the Attorney-General knows that if Parliament goes to the country, and after the elections there is a joint sitting of the two Houses, there will not be one chance in 25,000 of a majority in the joint sitting approving it. But if we assume, for"" the purposes of the argument, that something may happen, which is really as improbable as anything humanly can be, I ask, What would be gained if at the joint sitting there were a majority for the Bill? Things would be still exactly as they are. Nothing would be changed. No persons' rights would be alfected in any way. Yet the measure forms the pretext with which Ministers are endeavouring to persuade a reasonable man that section 57 of the Constitution ought to apply, and that a double dissolution ought to be granted. The Attorney-General has stated that it is wrong and unprofessional to introduce the name of the Governor General into this discussion, and I agree with him; I Mr Hughes. think it is the first time that I have done so. In doing so now I have but followed his example. He was the first to do so. But I shall not permit him to mislead the citizens in regard to a matter so important as this. On Priday, when he suggested that the Opposition is endeavouring, by every ingenious device possible under the Standing Orders, to delay a general appeal to the country, he was asked by the honourable member for Hunter, and by myself, what would happen if the Government did not get a double dissolution? Would it take a single dissolution, which was all that would be left to it? His reply was, ""Wait and see."" When brought to the brink and asked, ""Will you jump ?""- he replied, in effect, "" No, I will not."" He has treated this House to a cinematographic display of horrors, and has told the country that, like Mettius Curtius, the Government are prepared to leap into the gulf that has opened before them. He knows, however, that the gulf which he speaks of is only a painted picture. When we take him to the real thing, the single dissolution which lies yawning before us, and ask him if he will jump, he says, "" Wait and see."" If the Government cannot get a double dissolution, Ministers must accept a single dissolution. There is no other alternative. Yet they shiver at the very mention of it, for, unlike their threats in regard to a double dissolution, it has reality behind ib. The Attorney-General told us that the object of the Bill was to crush, at its very inception, the introduction of the spoils system into the clean political life of Australia. In effect,'he invited the electors to contrast Labour politics, Tammany, and corruption with the clean political methods of the present Administration. He suggested that the late Government resorted to practices which had sullied the legislative escutcheon of the Common- wealth. I ask the electors to look at the matter fairly, and let the searchlight of truth shine on the facts. The Attorney General suggests that the last Labour Adminstration introduced the spoils system. As a matter of fact, we put an end to it. We appointed Justices of the High Court, administrators of the Northern Territory, naval and military experts of the highest standing, the Governor of a bank, and other high officials, charged with the responsibilities of the most important and national duties, and in no one case did we appoint a member of our own party. We were the first political party in this Commonwealth that ever did that. Before our time, it was the practice to always appoint supporters to positions of influence and emolument.",20
105,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,There are not many bank managers in your party.,22
106,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable and learned Attorney-General speaks about spoils to the victors; but I say that such a taunt coming from such a man, standing as the spokesman of such a party, is to outdo Satan himself condemning sin. I point to the record of the Labour party, and I ask the honourable member to contrast it with his own. If the Labour party erred at all-and I say sometimes we did-it was because we followed too elosely along those lines of which m y honourable friend has kept clear all his political life. We did not appoint our friends to public positions. The party which calls itself the Liberal party never had a great office at its disposal that they did not fill it with a friend. I challenge the honourable member, or any honourable member on the Government side, to say that we appointed a friend to any one of the great offices filled by us. every case we appointed a political opponent.",22
107,Mr HANS IRVINE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"What "" brother "" Ryland?",22
108,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not call his office a great one; but, at any rate, the present Government "" sacked "" him. In face of these facts, and much more, honourable members opposite speak about "" spoils to the victors."" To give a poor devil of a navvy a job at 9s. per day, for which he has to work hard, is "" spoils to the v i c to r "" ; but to appoint a stout supporter to a f at sinecure or a position of influence, where he can subordinate the current of political l if e in this country to the interests of the Government and its wealthy supporters, is patriotism pure and undiluted. Even so far as the appointment of manual labourers was concerned, before the Labour Government came into office, it was the notorious practice of Ministers to stick their own friends into every billet, from that of 'a crossingsweeper upwards: and members supporting the Govermnent went cap in hand to Ministers, who in turn appointed friends, of those But, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, and of the State, too, we laid the axe at this tree of nepotism and persons were appointed for reasons of fitness, and fitness only. The honourable member asked, "" W as there ever any inquiry as to the fitness of persons appointed under the Labour Government?"" In every, case. There was never fi case where a man was engaged at 9s. per day, or appointed to any position greater than that, but that his fitness was regarded as the first essential; and all we asked was that where persons qualified for billets were unionists, they should get preference. And properly so. Why should they not get it? Here is a practice that was recognised throughout the Commonwealth by private employers even before the law compelled them to recognise it . Every private employer today can be compelled by the Courts of the country to grant preference to unionists. And yet the Government are not to do what the laws make the private employer d o ; and when the Government do it , the Attorney-General raises this stupid cry of "" spoils to the victors."" The Attorney-General said that we In gave preference to unionists because the unions supplied us with funds. I do not know, whether he makes that charge about on any grounds otlier than those he disclosed to the House; all I know is that there is no truth in the statement. Some unions do subscribe to the political movement; most do not. I stand here as a man who has been in political l if e for the last twenty years, during all of which time. I have taken a prominent part in in dustrial organization; and I can state that I have never received one penny piece from any industrial organization for political purposes, nor has any union with which I am officially connected ever contributed a penny for that purpose. That can be said 'by many members on this side. Some unions are affiliated with the political movement, and others are not. Others are opposed to it , as, indeed, are some of the organizations I am connected with ; and to say that we granted preference to unionists because the unions gave us funds with which to contest elections is absurd. The honourable member went on to say that we compelled men to join a union or to starve. I shall have a l it t l e members. to say in regard to that phase of the matter later on. I desire to ask the honourable member one simple question: In giving preference to unionists, what wrong'is done to the community? If the unionists are in sumcient numbers to do all the Government work, why should they not get the work as well as non-unionists ? Because, if by sacking a non-unionist to put on a unionist you condemn the non-unionist to starve, the reverse of that must be equally true, that by sacking a unionist in order to put on a non-unionist you condemn the unionist to starve! But if, on the other hand, there are not enough unionists to do the work pf the Government, non-unionists will tike their place alongside the unionists, and no one will starve. I do not kuow whether the honourable member, who speaks so glibly of unionism, has the faintest conception of what unionism is or does; but I may tell him that in some of the most militant industrial organizations it is the daily practice of unionists and non-unionists to work together when there is an insufficient supply of. union labour to do the work. In the latest award given by Mr Justice Higgins, the only one in which preference was granted to a union that was a de facto union, preference .was given upon those very terms, and all the preference granted by the Courts throughout Australia is given upon the distinct understanding that the unions shall supply a sufficient quantity of competent labour. The labour must be competent and in sufficient quantities. But these conditions being fulfilled, the unionist gets preference; and why not? What.claim has the non-unionist on society more than has the unionist? If one or other has to starve, why should not' the non-unionist starve as readily as the unionist ? But all this talk about starvation of unionists or non-unionists is so much bunkum and rubbish. In this country, where unionism has great power, no working man or working woman need starve, or, at any rate, only very rarely; but in countries where the unionists are powerless, or fighting for a bare existence, great numbers of people do starve and die. This country, where unionism has the greatest power, is the country where prosperity is most general, and starvation is least known. How does this fustian and hysterical rubbish which the honourable member has treated us to about compelling non-unionists to starve compare with the facts? The Labour Governmept Mr Hughes. were in power in this Commonwealth for three years, it provided for preference to unionists in its own employment, and let the honourable member bring forward the record of cases of starvation of non-unionists or anybody else during that period. Aud now to another inatter. Por some reason even more obscure than that which moved him in other respects, the Attorney-General introduced the subject of compulsory unionism. That is a sort of political "" Mrs Harris "" ; there is no such person. I have been many years in the political movement, and I have never heard of it. It is not a plank of the Labour platform; I am not in favour of it ; I do not think the honourable gentleman is in favour of it. But he says that the Labour party are not in favour of it because it would mean the appointment of a public trustee and the auditing of the accounts of unions. The innuendo covered by this statement is, I venture to say, a very shameful and cowardly one-is absolutely unprovoked by the circumstances. The facts do not warrant it . The honourable and learned gentleman is a lawyer and an able man, and he ought to know that the law, as it stands today, provides for the auditing of the accounts of every union. Under the law in this State no union can be registered unless it provides, in its rules for the auditing of its accounts, for the production of a balance-sheet, and for the expenditure of its money for such purposes, and such purposes only, as the Act itself approves. Further, it provides that the balance sheet is to be available to the Registrar. I quote from the Victorian Statutes of 1890, from the Trades Union Act of that State. The Commonwealth Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-11, section 60, provides that where the rules of an organization do not provide ' for the audit of accounts, or do not disclose the true financial position of the organization, or do not provide reasonable facilities for the admission of new members, or impose unreasonable conditions upon the continuance of any person's membership, or are in any way tyrannical or oppressive, such an organization' cannot be registered. The honourable and learned gentleman cannot but have been aware of those facts when he made that charge. If those remarks had been made by a stupid or ignorant man they could have been excused, but when made by an able and learned man he cannot seek shelter under the cloak - of stupidity, or even of ignorance j he stands convicted of other motives. The honourable member makes this charge presumably. to convey the impression to the public that the funds of the trade unions of this country are used in ways - of which the unions and we should. be - ashamed, and that for this reason, therefore, we are opposed to the appointment - of a public trustee and to an audit. There is not one tittle of evidence to justify thab statement; on the other hand, the facts are conclusive against the honourable gentleman. But I will tell the honourable member this: What is wanted in this country, and wanted badly, is the appointment of a public 'trustee and auditor to safeguard the in terests of both the public and the. shareholders of private companies, to prevent - the issue of misleading balance-sheets, - and to prevent trusts and combines - cloaking up their Machiavellian ways, to compel private concerns of the kind to - answer legitimate questions, properly put, in the interests of the public, and to prohibit them flouting Commissions of In q u i ry appointed to get at the truth. All these things are wanted, and wanted badly. Let the Attorney-General, before making these charges against the trade union officials of this country, first set his - own house in order, and let him set in - order the houses of those who retain him, and we shall then give greater consideration to his charges against industrial unionism. Before I pass from the question of preference in Government employment, let me place on record the principles that governed the granting of preference under the Pisher Government. As reported in Hansard, volume LX . , page 634, Mr . Deakin, in this House, on the 20th September, 1911, asked the present Leader of the Opposition whether1. He will define the classes of Government employees within which members of unions will henceforward be given priority of appointment over all who are not unionists? The - right honourable member for Wide Bay replied1. Other qualifications being equal, preference will be given in all cases. Mr Deakin also asked whether2. Qualifications such as ability, experience, or. physique, will be considered; and, if so, to what extent in the appointments made? In-reply, he was referred to the answer to the first question. He asked further whetherThe Ministry proposes to distinguish between unions when making appointments? To this the reply of the present Leader of the Opposition wasNo Commonwealth law now provides a means of determining this question. The next question put was whetherMinisters intend to impose any new conditions upon the choice of permanentemployes under the Publio Service Acts? The answer to that question was "" No . "" The fifth of the series of questions put by Mr Deakin wasIf preference is to be granted to unionists, other' things being equal between the applicants, who is to determine, and on what evi-' deuce, their comparative qualifications? The answer wasThe officer charged with the duty of selecting. Mr Deakin also inquired Avhether the determination mentioned would be final or subject to appeal, and was informed, in answer to that question, as well as to the further question whetherNon-unionists appointed on the ground of greater personal qualifications or' capacity will be liable to be subsequently displaced in favour of unionists applying for appointment, thatNo alteration in the present method will' be made in these respects. This position was again laid down in the course of the no-confidence motion on the 26th September, 1911. We have here, then, principles laid down by the late Government, and those principles, I venture to say, must commend themselves to the common sense of the public. They are obviously a recognition of a principle generally accepted in Australia, in its application to Government as well as to private employment. The At torney-General quoted from a circular sent out by my colleague the ex-Minister of External Affairs in regard to employment in the Northern Territory. As my honourable friend intends to deal with the matter in detail, I shall say no more than that the circular applied to special circumstances, and that it in no way affected the selection of the fittest men to do the work. The principle acted upon by the Fisher Government in every case was that the fittest should be selected. Untrammelled power was given to the person selecting to choose the fittest to do the work required. Those circumstances exist even at the present time. I come now to the question of preference to unionists in general. The Attorney-General, at various times, has said a great deal about preference to unionists, and it is rather dimcult to disentangle and to reconcile his somewhat conflicting utterances. At Camperdown, on 7th August last, as reported in the Argus, he said thatThe voluntary co-operation of workers who were engaged in the same class of work for the furtherance of their particular interests in connection with that work was not only necessary, but inevitable. This sounds rather well. But , speaking at Korumburra before the last election, he saidBy no law, or by no agency of the law, should any man be deprived of the means of earning his bread. . . . Unionism or cooperation scould not exist under coercion. The first main principle attached to it was that it must be free from coercion, whether legal or otherwise. I wish to impress that statement the House and the country, in order that - it may be clearly understood to what the Attorney-General takes exception. words are free from ambiguity: they cover the whole field of action in which unionism operates. The Attorney-General not use them without careful He is not a man to be carried off his feet by his own words. a hard-headed-I shall not say hard hearted-and logically-minded one who listened to his half-hysterical outburst in this House on Friday and saw him beat the air, as he spoke about liberty and the tyranny of unionism, must have come to the conclusion that there was something more in it than met the eye. Such heat in another man would pass unnoticed, but when my honourable and learned friend displays heat, it must be either that he simulates it, or is torn by a very volcano of emotion. clined to tliink that he felt nothing; that he realized thoroughly the advantage of displaying the righteous anger of a man appalled at such wickedness, tyranny, such cruel and relentless oppression as was sanctioned and applauded by the men who met his eye when he looked over to this side of the House. honourable friend, no doubt, realizes that such an exhibition without its use on the political But I am going to deal with the matter on its merits, asking honourable Mr Hughes. merely to remember the Attorney-General's' statement thatBy no law, or by no agency of the law, should any man be deprived of the means of earning his bread. Because, later, I projjose to contrast it with his daily practice. Let mesay, first of all, in regard to .preference to unionists, that this is admittedly an age of combination-of combination amongst workmen and combination amongst capitalists. It is only the economic troglodyte who would deny that. If the right of combination be admitted, then clearly, since we have to consider the reasons for combination-w e must a l low that men combine to benefit themselves, and to promote their own interests-combination s of workmen may do what the law allows to further those in terests. For what reason do workmen combine ? T t is in order that they may raise the price of their labour. And it is for that reason precisely that combinations of capital are to take place. Capitalists upon combine together to raise the price of commodities, and combine in order that they may corner the markets. His It is perfectly obvious that the great obstacle with which the workman has to deal is the unattached worker-the did man who, prating about liberty, sells thought. himself to the capitalist, in his hour of need, at a lower price than his organized He is brethren demand for their labour. man. Any The non-unionist is a menace, not merely to unionism, but to society. He is a menace last, infinitely greater tlian is any contagious disease, because the non-unionist spells low wages and bad conditions to the people at large, and all the wretchedness and misery that dog the heels of poverty. If in Australia today men are working under reasonable conditions, they owe it entirely to organized labour. The irony of the position is that I am in- the non-unionist reaps where he has not but sown; he gets that for which the unionist has worked aud paid, and he then betrays him. He is at best a selfish foolish person; such at worse, he is a traitor, who, prating about his liberty and his rights, has no liberty or rights but those which have been given him by organized labour. It is My difficult to deal with this question of prefully ference to unionists as if it were an is not isolated phenomenon. It is not. It is a platform. recognised principle throughout every human association. It is as rational, members as proper, and as moral as is the principle of "" Australia for the Australians,"" or the Monroe doctrine, or patriotism itself. It is the principle that runs through every organized living beingthe corollary of combination for the protection of those who are threatened with danger. The non-unionist is a person who refuses to go into the fold and to protect himself and his kind. Naturally, those who see the light, and who realise the danger, regard him sometimes with aversion; always with contempt. Honourable members opposite take up in regard to preference to unionists an attitude that it is a little difficult to understand. There is, for instance, the attitude of the Prime Minister, who says that he believes in preference to unionists as much as ever. He does not believe in political unionism, he tells us, but he does believe in unionism and preference to unionists enforced in the good old way. Then we have the Attorney-General, who does not believe in that kind of preference, or any other. As for the supporters of the Government, we are unable to separate them into two camps in this matter. But, at any rate, they do not believe in preference to unionists. If they do they manage to conceal their belief very well. Preference to unionists is, and has been, the law of this country for the last ten years. It is, and has been, recognised for many years as a settled principle. It is today accepted by eight out of every ten employers in the country. For all practical purposes preference to unionists runs throughout every industry. Every well organized industry today enjoys it. Even where an industry does not get it under the sanction of the law, it nevertheless enjoys preference. To denounce a principle universally adopted in this country, to say that it is vicious, malignant, is a foe to liberty, demns men to starvation, is to indulge in mere fustian rhetoric. Unionism never had so much power as during the last few years, and this country was never so prosperous. This is the best possible answer to the foolish and utterly misleading statements made by honourable members opposite. Preference, as is well known, is practised by employers in every dealing of their daily lives. Trusts and combines are based on it , and could not live a day without it . The Attorney General knows this, for he has told this House and the country so many times. Yet he has nothing but the mildest and most academic censure for preference exercised in such a fashion by such men. The preference by which a poor man manages to get a fair and reasonable wage to enable him to maintain his wife and family, he lashes with whips and scorpions. And this brings me to a point of absorbing interest, for it shows the gulf between the Attorney-General's words and actions. Something was said the other day about the Attorney-General himself belonging to a union, but the honourable gentleman repudiated that idea with scorn and emphasis, and declared that the men who made such a statement did not understand what they are talking about. I have no wish to dwell on the matter more than is necessary, but it is only fair, when we have a man like the Attorney-General saying that "" By no law or by no agency of the law should any man be deprived, of the means of earning his bread ""-that unionism condemns men to starve, and that we on this side are supporters of a system which is bowelless and tyrannical - it is only fair that he should come into court with clean hands. The honourable gentleman says, and I have no doubt he believes, that between his organization and the organization, say, of sewer miners or waterside workers, there is a gulf so wide and deep that even the imagination cannot bridge it. But I shall plainly show to the House and the country. that everything that a trade union is created to do, and everything that it does doevery weapon that it can use, and does use-ma y be paralleled, and is paralleled, by the organization to which the honourable gentleman belongs. Further, whereas the workers' organization or unioncall it what you will-struggle s on in the conshadow, without the aid of the law, getting all it can inch by inch against the determined opposition of all the forces whose representatives sit in high placesthe feet of the honourable gentleman and his associates have been guided by the light, the grade has been easy, and everything has been pleasant, and remains so. First of all, the honourable gentleman belongs to a profession which is under the sanction of the law; no person can practise law unless he has been admitted as a barrister or solicitor; and a high ring fence is drawn between those admitted and mere outsiders. This, however, the General says is entirely different unionism; and, of course, it is. would be very much better for the unions if they could have the same The Attorney-General, the other asked, by way of interjection, we would call a cab-driver a unionist because he had a licence to drive a cab? I should prefer to put it this way: If those who grant the cab-driver his licence are also cabmen, he is in a pretty place. We know that the Attorney-General belongs to a profession that under the licence of the law, and that those who grant the licence are lawyers, himself. Show me another organization where that is so. It cannot be'shown in the ranks of the workers. But the Attorney General is not satisfied with the ample protection afforded his profession by the law. He belongs to another tion, a sort of holy of holies. the honourable and learned gentleman is not ashamed or afraid to defy the law, although he is an advocate of , and gets his living by, pleading causes under the law. The Attorney-General is a member of the Bar Association of the State' of Victoria, or I assume that he is. This is an organization which has for its object the sweeping aside of the law of this State, which provides that persons admitted to practise law may, practise either as a solicitor or as a barrister. It has been formed so that, in spite of the law, only those persons shall practise as barristers who do not practise as solicitors. not know what the rules of theassociation now are; it may be that tliey have advanced, as Rockefeller and those otlier artists in the business have advanced, to the stage when there are no rules at all, but only an ""honourable understanding."" However, I wish to show the House, and the country what the rules were when this organization was first established. deliberately that, in the rules of the Bar Association of Victoria, there are to be found provisions which are not to be found in the rules of any trade organization in the country-rules that not be allowed by the law of the land in any trade organization, because they are tyrannical and unfair in the extreme, in that they provide for the boycott, and the black list, and the condemnation of men without trial or even notification of Mr Hughes. their offence. These rules were drafted Attorney- immediately after the State Act was from passed to provide that any man who was It admitted might practise as either barrister or solicitor; and I should like to quote the protection. followingday, 10. Any member of the legal profession in whether Victoria desirous of becoming a member of the association shall, until 18th December, 1891, sign and deliver or send to A. J. Agg, Esq., and thereafter to the secretary of the association, a declaration in the form set forth in Schedule 1 to these rules. ""soft"" I shall, in a moment, show what schepractises dule 1 is12. Notwithstanding Rule 11, no person who like shall, or whose partner or partners, employer or employers, employee or employees, shall act or practise, or hold himself or themselves out as practising in a double capacity, that is to say, as barristers and also as solicitors, have usually acted or practised previously to 1st December, 1891, shall be entitled to admission to the association except at the discretion of organiza- the committee. Further, This is an open defiance of the law. I direct special attention to rules 15, 16, and 18, as follows: 15. No member of the association shall accept any brief or appear in any cause or matter or upon any trial, rule, motion, or petition, or give any opinion or advice, or draw any pleadings, or act in any matter professionally jointly with any person not as a member of the association. 16. No member of this association shall accept any retainer or brief from or act in any manner professionally for or upon the instructions directly or indirectly of any person who shall or whose partner or partners, employer or employers, employee or employees, shall act or practise or hold himself or themI do selves out as acting or practising otherwise than as solicitors have usually acted and practised previously to 1st December, 1891. IS. That no member of this association shall enter into partnership directly or indirectly, or share or divide incoine with any other member of the legal profession of Victoria. The rules I have read provide that no man shall brief or take a brief from , or act with, or do anything at all profesI say sionally in association with any practitioner otherthan as provided in the rules. If a person does so, under the rules he may be expelled and treated exactly as if he were not a member. That is to would say, such a man is to be denied the opportunity to ' e a r n his bread. That is, to use the Attorney-General's own words, he may be houndedout and condemned to starvation. These rules, not satisfied with providing for and compelling resort, to the - boycott-which , by the way, the Attorney-General so glibly denounced-' resort also to a black list, and a secret black list at that. Rule 20 saysIt shall be the duty of the committee from time to time to prepare a list of persons and firms, members of the legal profession (other than members of this association) who in the opinion of such committee do or whose partner or partners do, practise or hold himself or themselves out as acting or practising otherwise than as solicitors have usually acted or practised previously to 1st December, 1891, and a copy of such lists shall from time to time, at the discretion of the committee, be forwarded to members of the associationThis list is not sent to the persons named; they are condemned unheard as utterly as men were when the Council of Venice cast its votes into the fatal urnand the persons and firms specified in such lists shall be deemed, for thu purposes of Rule 16, to be persons and firms who actually do or whose partner or partners do act or practise or hold himself or themselves out as acting or practising otherwise as solicitors have usually acted or practised previously to the Baid date. The mere fact that their names are on the list condemns them. They have no opportunity to defend themselves. Such were the rules of an organization of which the Attorney-General was a member. It may be that these are no longer the rules; but I say deliberately that they represent the principles on which the Association acts. And I say to the learned member for Indi that I will give £500 to a hospital if the honourable member will act with the Attorney-General, or if the Attorney-General will act with him, or go into Court and plead alongside him. But the honourable member for Indi knows very well that the Attorney-General would say, "" I would not act with the honourable gentleman in such circumstances."" The fact is that the honourable member for Indi is a pariah to the members of this Bar Association of Victoria. They will not eat with him ; they will not drink with him ; they will not allow him to' work with them. Rule 25 providesIf the Committee, on investigation, decides that a case of wilful breach or any of these rules by a member of this Association has been shown to it, it shall, at its discretion, either caution such member against persisting in or repeating such breach, or by a resolution, of not less than five members of the Committee, cause a special meeting of the Association to be convened for the purpose of considering such alleged breach; and if such meeting, by a majority of two-thirds of the members present, determine that such member has been guilty of such wilful breach, then the said member shall, at the discretion of the Com[44] mittee, either be reprimanded or have his name removed from the list of members of this Association, and in sueh latter case shall thereupon cease to be a member of this Association. Then comes the crowning humiliation: Every member of this Association, of which this great protagonist of liberty, the Attorney-General, is one, must sign the following declarationI, , of , being a duly admitted member of the legal profession in Victoria, do hereby request that I may be admitted a member of the Bar Association of Victoria. I do hereby solemnly declare that it is my intention to, and that so long as I continue to be a member of the said Association I will, act and practise only as barristers have usually acted and practised in Victoria previously to 1st December, 1891. I do further promise that I will not wittingly depart from the principles and rules of this Association, and agree that my membership thereof is con>ditional upon my adherence to such principles and rules. In other words, "" Each swears that he will practise the boycott, will refuse to his fellow-man the right the law has given him, will resort to the black-list; in short, will hound him out of professional life if he happens to violate one of the rules of this book."" Whether these rules are in force now as rules, matters not; it is notorious that the principles and practices acted upon by the members of this Association are those set for th in these rules. And my honourable and learned friend the Attorney-General was a member of that Association. The honourable gentleman talks about freedom and condemning men to starve. When I was Attorney-General, I was not free to employ any but members of the Victorian Bar. If I had dared to do otherwise, no reputable solicitor would have briefed a man, no other barrister would have acted with the man I employed, and that man Would have stood alone. Yet these gentlemen speak of the "" boycott "" and of the "" tyranny of trade unionism,"" and say that a man "" should not be hounded off the face of the earth."" In the whole gamut of associations, industrial and political, can any one parallel for me rules such as these I have read to honourable members? Can any one-show me anything to beat them 1 I put down for comparison the rules of the Waterside Workers Union. Honourable members can look through them, and send them out broadcast, but they will find that the union is compelled to admit every sober and. competent man who applies to be admitted. In fourteen years, though 15,000 men have applied to be admitted to the Waterside Workers Union, only two have jected; and in the whole of the organization of waterside workers, according to the evidence given the other day before the Arbitration Court, only six men have been rejected in the whole of Australia during the same period. The rules of the Victorian Bar Association serve to show to what length men will go, and how the system of preference to unionists runs like a steel rod through every section of society. These gentlemen of the Bar Association push the principle of preference to unionists to an extreme which I do not pretend to justify. Let the people judge between the preference of the labour organizations and this Bar Association. As to the Bill before us, it is a sham; . and honourable members on this side would not waste a moment in discussing it but that the measure is a vehicle for an attack, cowardly, unprovoked, and a declaration of the pretended desire of Ministers to get to the country. get to the country!"" Yes, when they have taken every precaution in order to prevent their going to the country. They talk about a double dissolution. not care whether it is a double or single dissolution; but, wrangle as they may, Ministers will in the end be like little children crying "" Bogy man, bogy man"" confronted suddenly with the horrid apparition, materialized, of a single dissolution, which will take them by the throat and hurl them into the political limbo.",22
109,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Robertson) [4.27] The statement of the honourable member for West Sydney, that only two men had been refused admission to the Sydney Waterside Workers Union in the last fourteen years is worthy of being met by the question-How many men wished to be proposed as members of that union, and could not be ? It is all very well to say by a juggling of words that these men were the only ones refused admission. Others were 'never given the opportunity of being proposed, and they were not refused admission for the simple reason that no one would give them a chance by proposing them. two or three matters in connection with the Bill with which I propose to deal. The honourable member for West Sydney talked of unions as though they would "" roar me as gently as any sucking dove,"" and he endeavoured to persuade us that unionists would not interfere with nonbeen ; reunionists ; while the other day the Leader of the Opposition said that wiping out preference to unionists meant preference to non-unionists, and one would think, after hearing arguments advanced from honourable members on the Opposition side, that the unionists gave non-unionists a free hand to do as they pleased. I shall deal with that phase of the question before I sit down, but I shall approach it in my own way. The Bill is a measure, not only to abolish preference to unionists in Government employ, but also to abolish political patronage, which is the main thing at the back of it . It is not a Bill to reduce parliamentary political privilege, which is necessary to uphold the liberties of the people; but the administrative act the Bill proposes to wipe out was an insidious way of interfering with the political privileges of all sections. We have heard a great deal about the supposed analogy between the "" To Lawyers Union, as honourable members are pleased to call it , and industrial unions. The honourable member for West Sydney said that he was going to parallel the I do two unions. The honourable member, who is a barrister, knows that two parallel lines cannot meet, and that the two unions can no more approximate than can two parallel lines. The honourable member might just as well say that because the wheels of a cart go round the wings of a carrier pigeon should do the same.",29
110,Mr SHARPE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,They are two unions.,29
111,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"They are two unions of quite a different character. There is no comparison between them. While the Lawyers Union may exist for its own protection, industrial unions are created solely for the protection of their members. The Lawyers Union, so called, - is created to maintain a high standard"" of work. Honourable members know that in this regard we have one of the great complaints against industrial unions of today. The officials of these unions go round teaching the baneful idea that the reduction of output means increase of work for those in the unions, whereas every honourable There are member and these officials themselves must know that work is like credit, that properly handled it increases. Therefore, the sooner this wrong idea that the reduction of output is going to improve the position of the unionists is abolished the better it will be for the unions. But that is nob the principal point that I set out to make. My point is that these unions, as fa r as they can, debar men from earning an honest living. According to the honourable member for West Sydney they do nothing of the kind, but there are innumerable examples within our own time in Australia, and I shall give one or two, since honourable members, by their interjections, ask for them.1",29
112,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Before you get to that point, is not the Barristers Association recruited from members of the Political Labour party, as well as from members on this side of the House? Does it not include the honourable member for Bendigo as well as the Attorney-General ?",30
113,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It includes prominent members on both sides. In no way does it attempt to dominate their political opinions. Members of the Association have a free hand to do entirely as they please, and it is just as much a union of the Labour party as it is a union of the Liberal party. But my point is that lawyers and barristers are free, if they please, to improve their own industrial positions, provided they do not interfere with outsiders, or infringe on the liberties of the people. Mr J. H. CATTS - I think we should have a quorum, to hear this extraordinary statement. [Quorum formed.]",30
114,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If honourable members opposite wish to bring their industrial unions on to the same lines as those of the Lawyers Union, they would need to provide that each applicant, to prove his fitness to enter a Wharf Labourers Union, must first carry 4 cwt. for 40 yards half-adozen times a day, or that every applicant for the position of fencer must sink eighty post holes a day in fair sinking ground before being permitted to take on a job as fencer, or that every shearer must be able to shear 150 sheep satisfactorily before being able to obtain a stand in a shed. Then there would be some grounds for comparing unions with the Lawyers Union, as honourable members call it . Until they do so there can be absolutely no comparison. Honourable members might just as well compare a tip-cart with a carrier pigeon. There is no ground for comparison u n t il men are brought up to a certain stan[44]- 3 dard. I said just before the bells were rung for a quorum that the unions were not by any means as mild-mannered as the honourable member for West Sydney would have us believe, and we do not need to go far from Melbourne to prove this. A little while ago, at Geelong, a man brought in some chaff to be shipped to Sydney, but it was found that this man had been working with non-unionists, and the whole of the unionists in Geelong black-marked that chaff, and would not allow it to be shipped. But that occurrence was a mild one compared with the recent Sydney meat strike, when for a time that city was almost completely deprived of meat. That trouble arose because the butchers at Glebe Island discovered that there was a man working with them, who, although a unionist, had four years earlier worked with non-unionists. Immediately they stopped work, and practically put an end to the meat supply of the city. There was never a more vindictive strike. Yet honourable members opposite say that it is necessary to give unionists preference. A f t e r taking a man's money for four years, and levying on him in various ways, the Sydney butchers threw the meat trade of the city into disorder to take vengeance on him . The officials of the union endeavoured to stop the strike, but the men would not obey them. Honourable members opposite are like small boys on the top of a moun- & tain, who start rolling down rocks; they do not know where the rocks will stop. Honourable members opposite do not know what damage may be done before the rocks that they have started in connection with unionism come to a standstill. There is not a man on this side who does not recognise that unionism has done much for the good of the workers, but because standing - timber protects the stock in our paddocks from the rigours of inclement weather, we do not let vegetation spread until the whole ground is overgrown with scrub, and unfit to support anything but vermin. We, on this side, believe in unionism when properly controlled, but we say that everything can be overdone, and that unionism is now in a fair way to be overdone. In New Zealand during the recent big strike a union secretary said that 10,000 or 15,000 armed men could be provided to "" down "" the people. Again, in Sydney, when the meat strike had arisen in the way which I have described, the men, after bringing upon the community discomfort and almost starvation, to wreak their vengeance on one of their number, came forward with their usual hypocrisy, and said, "" We will arm 5,000 men to compel the owners to slaughter their stock.""  a Labour Government!",30
115,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes . The unionists are not nearly so mild in manner as the members of the Labour party would have us believe. I daresay many honourable members opposite realise that the unions are getting beyond the control of their leaders. When the New Zealand strike occurred, the union secretary sent a message to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, asking him to prevent the handling of cargo from New Zealand which had been loaded there by non-unionists, and threatening this country with penalties if it did not obey the decisions of the union leaders of the Dominion. Still more recently the miners of Western Australia, taking up the cause of the miners of South A f r i c a , tried to threaten the Prime Minister into sending to the Old Country a statement to the effect that he did not agree with the action of the South A f r i c a n Govern- power."" ment in deporting the men. It is clear that the union leaders are tryin g to dominate the people, and it is time that we warned the people of the danger that is threatening them. It does not matter where privilege comes from , or who benefits by it , the liberties of the people always suffer when it is permitted. Whether the privileged person is an aristocrat or a sundowner, the giving of political privilege to any one, or any section of the community, will begin to wreck the Empire of which we have all good reason to be proud. The honourable member for Darling told us the other day that we ought not to be proud of Great Brit ain or of our connection with that country, because at one time little children were treated cruelly there. No man on this side, I make bold to say, even as much as men on the other side, desires to see little children ill-treated, but the fact that there was ill-treatment of children 100 years ago is not relevant to our present discussion. It need only be said that 100 years ago Great Britain was ahead, as she is today, of all the other nations of the world in the humanity of her laws. The liberty enjoyed by the people of Australia is the widest in the world, but it is our duty to show the people that that liberty is being endangered. The history of every country furnishes undeniable proof that privileges given to any section of the community in opposition to the general welfare are a source of the greatest national danger. The train which.carries a great part of the people of this country is running on the wrong set of rails, and this Bill is the danger signal, warning it to stop. We hold out the Bill , not so much for what it may achieve in itself, but to warn the community of a danger that threatens them. The Bill is to do away with political patronage introduced into this country by a Yankee, whose methods, without saying anything detrimental to him, are naturally those of the politics of America, which we all wish to eschew. His colleagues were not prepared at the time to stand up boldly behind him and say, "" We believe in what is being done."" The honourable member for Darwin had the courage of his convictions, as I think he always has, and was clever enough to see, and to take, his opportunity. He said, "" I am in favour of preference to unionists, and I am going to give effect to it absolutely, so far as I have the The leader of his party hesitated, being afraid to go forward, and that is the position of the party today. Its members do not know whether to advance or retreat. We, on this side, however, know exactly what our course is to be. The honourable member for Wide Bay, in speaking to the Bill the other day, was as unhappy as he was unconvincing. It is evident to any one possessing any political insight that the members of the Labour party are not solid on this question, and it was hard luck for the leader of the militant section of the party that he happened to be absent when the crisis came. I have no doubt he will suffer for that. What occurred emphasized, if that were necessary, the division in the ranks of the party opposite. The Liberal party, however, is absolutely solid on this question. We believe that a great and vital principle is at stake. The Bill may, or may not, be what it has been called by honourable members opposite, the shadow of a sham, but it is a matter of more interest to them than many of them would like to admit. The real matter for concern is not what is going to happen to us, but what is going to happen to the people. We on this side have declared that we are ready to go before our masters-the electors-at any moment, to tell them that a great and grave danger is threatening their liberties, and to ask them to give us power to protect them.",31
116,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Barrier) [4.45] - I understand that the Bill has been introduced with a two-fold object; that it serves a double purpose: it is to prevent preference being given to unionists in Government employment, and to bring about, if possible, a difference between this House and the Senate which shall result in a double dissolution. Possibly' the second object is, in the minds of M i nisters and of their supporters, the paramount one. I do not hesitate to declare that, in my opinion, so far as both objects are concerned, the Bill is a sham, a fraud, and a delusion.",32
117,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member is not in order in saying that.,32
118,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"If you consider, sir, that I should not use those words, I withdraw them. I do not think that the Bil l will accomplish either of the two purposes for which it has been introduced. If it is passed by this House and by the Senate, it will not, of course, bring about a double dissolution, but how will it then affect any individual in the Commonwealth? So far as this Government is concerned, there is no need for it , because Ministers can, by an executive act, do what it says should be done. If the present Ministers were succeeded by others with the same political views, the Bill would be unnecessary.  Government came into office ?",32
119,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then the measure would not prevent any Minister from doing all that was done before.  ber believe in Ministers breaking the laws of the country?,32
120,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Does any one suppose that if the Bill became law, and the At torney-General had to appoint a barrister, he would engage what is called an amalgam, or a scab lawyer? He would engage only a full-blown barrister, and the measure would not prevent him from doing anything else, because he could say that, in his opinion, the man appointed was the man best fitted for the position. There are barristers and barristers. Both the Attorney-General and the Minister of External Affairs are barristers, and the former told us the other day that he had appeared in cases with his colleague. I ask whether he has ever appeared, or would appear, with the Minister of External Affairs, except in constitutional cases, before the H i gh Court? I believe that there is an agreement that they shall work side by side with scab lawyers in that Court; but, except in that Court, the Attorney-General is not prepared to work with even his colleague, Mr Glynn. A barrister in the position of the Minister of External Affairs has, towards a barrister in the position of the Attorney-General, just the same relationship as a member of Packer's union has towards a member of the Australian Workers Union. We have heard a good deal from the Attorney General and other members about the iniquity of unionism, and, as has been pointed out, in Victoria, before a person can become a member of the Lawyers Union, he has not only to pass a very stiff examination, which I think is very good, and to which I have no objection, but, in addition, he has to pay £40 before he can appear as a barrister. Some time ago I made reference to this fact, and the honourable member for Flinders, who was then sitting in Opposition, said that the £40 was to go towards keeping up a library. I would like to ask the honourable member what is the difference between a barrister having to pay £40 towards the maintenance of a legal library before he can appear in a case, and a man having to pay something to a union to meet the expenses of the executive and the salary of the secretary? I remember that when the unionists at Broken Hill were most powerful, and unionism was compulsory, no one being allowed to work unless he was a unionist, the rules of the association allowed a non-unionist to go underground and work u n t i l he received his first pay, in order that he might pay his entrance fee into the organization.  the worse kind?",32
121,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Where is the difference between that rule and a man having to pay £40 to the Barristers Union before he can appear in a single case? There might be a man as brilliant as even the honourable member for Wannon, one able to make two blades of grass grow where one grew before; he has won scholarships, has passed all his examinations, and is called to the Bar, but he must plank down that £40 before he can appear in Court.",32
122,Mr RODGEKS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Suppos e you prove up to the h i l t what you wish to prove ahout the Lawyers Union, are you not indicting certain members of your own party?",33
123,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am dealing with the honourable member who introduced the Bill. I have no more objection to a union of lawyers than I have to a union of shearers or miners, but the Attorney General is a member of the Lawyers Union. I am not allowed by Mr Speaker to call the Bill a sham and a fraud, but, even allowing that it is all that is claimed for it by the Attorney-General, I venture to say that it ought not to pass this House, because trade unionism in itself 13 a good thing, and, in order that trade unionism may have full and proper effect, preference should be given to unionists. I am here to plead on behalf of the unions, and I know of no more-powerful reasons in support of unionism and preference to unionists than those which have been given by the Prime Minister. I will deal with those reasons in detail. First of all, the Prime Minister said that the unionist refused to work beside the non-unionist because he objected to another mau reaping where he had not sown. The fact cannot be controverted that unionism has bettered the conditions of the people, and brought about an in crease in wages, and, consequently, it is unfair that those who have brought about those better conditions and higher wages should be called upon to work side by side with those who reap the full benefit of the bettered conditions without having done anything towards bringing about that betterment. No one can question that in England wages are much better in districts where unionism is strong than in districts where it is weak. ",33
124,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Are there no unions in Canada?  are here.,33
125,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Some of us know something about England; some of us, indeed, were born there. I came from Cornwall, where a great deal of is done, and I believe the Cornish miner is as good as any other, but his were the lowest of any miner in land, because there were no organizations in Cornwall. In England the labourer is paid a lower wage than practically any other worker. Why is he the lowest-paid man ? It is not simply because of the price of commodities. There have been some very interesting articles written lately by a great political economist in England, a gentleman who does not belong to the Labour party.  rural conditions.",33
126,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Of course, Mr L . Chiozza Money does not know as much as the honourable member for Hume. He has not the honourable member's brain and knowledge.  experience.",33
127,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Practica l experience is not required for the tabulation of figures. That gentleman points out that the agricultural labourer in Oxfordshire gets 16s. per week, and in Durham 22s. per week. The farmer in Oxfordshire is paid for his wheat, beef, poultry, eggs, and otlier produce exactly the same as the farmer in Durham. Yet the farmer in Durham is paying the agricultural labourer 6s. per week more than the man in Oxfordshire. Mr L . Chiozza Money attributes that to the fact that the Durham farmers are nearer the coalfields, and the miners are well organized, and unless a farmer is prepared to pay his employees a certain wage, they will leave the farm and go to the coalfields to work. Consequently, though the price of commodities has to be taken into consideration when dealing with wages, that factor is not everything. This is a case where the prices of commodities are the same, and yet the wages paid for the same class of labour under the same conditions are considerably higher in one county than in another.",33
128,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,All good arguments for unionism.,33
129,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am glad to hear the honourable member say that those facts are in favour of unionism, but how are we to have unionism without preference? The same writer goes on to sayOnr inquiries in connection with sweated trades have shown that similar extraordinary variations obtain in other industries which are mining as unorganized as agriculture. So that the wages which the worker gets wages depend a great deal on whether he is Engconnected with an organization or not. The Times is a very prominent paper in farm England, and I suppose some of the people who write for that journal know something about the rural conditions in the Old Country. Possibly they do not know as much as the honourable member for Hume, but it is likely that sometimes they know something about the matter they are writing on.  practical experience. Mr .THOMAS - It is generally understood that a man must have some amount of ability and knowledge before he is granted space in that great paper. An article appeared in the Times, in which complaint was made about the wages paid to the agricultural labourer, and the writer went on to say that the farmers stated that they were paying as high a wage as the farm labourer was worth. The reply to that contention was that as long as the farmers continued to pay that wage, so long would they continue to have that type of man, and only when they were prepared to pay a higher wage would they get a higher type of mau. I tliink that argument is quite correct. If that be so, then unionism does good not only for the worker, but also for the farmer and for the employer, because if it brings about better wages and working conditions, those improved conditions attract a better type of man, out of whom the employer gets more value. The honourable member for Wannon has been good enough to say that these facts are an argument in favour of unionism, but not in favour of preference to unionists. I will quote another reason in favour of preference to unionists, again a reason given by the Prime Minister, namely, that unionists are victimized. The Prime Minister instanced a very good case in Lithgow, his constituency at that time, of men having been dismissed from their employment because they had been trying to improve the conditions of the men who were working in the mines. A recent ca.se at Ballarat was reported in the press where an employer was summoned before the Court for dismissing men, and the evidence proved that those men had been dismissed because they were members of a union.",33
130,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,There were three convictions in the Carlton Court the other day. and tliere was not a word in the papers about them.,34
131,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There was the case of two men who had come from England and obtained employment in this State. The employer was so satisfied with their work that he increased their wages. When the organizer of the union came along, they offered to join the union, and they asked the squatter to give to the organizing secretary in their behalf the necessary money. The result was that those men were dismissed from their employment for having joined the union. That instance tends to prove that there is such a thing as victimization. Those men were clearly victimized because they were unionists. Their salaries had been increased, and the squatter was well satisfied with them until he found that they had dared to join a union, and then they were dismissed.",34
132,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,A very rare case.,34
133,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,We have heard the honourable member for Eobertson speak of the iniquity of some trade unionists. Here Ave are able to point to a case where men have been deliberately victimized. The squatter AVUS fined-probably £2 or £3-bu t Avhat difference did that make to him?,34
134,Mr EODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,He Avas fined £5.,34
135,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"But he was not compelled to employ the man. When reading Trevelyan's Life of John Bright, which Avas published quite recently, I came across a statement which occasioned me some little surprise and a good deal of pleasure. I suppose that even the Attorney-General will admit that John Bright was one of the great figures in English politics. He was a great Liberal,, and one of the founders, if not the actual founder, of the Manchester School, which stood out for individualism and absolute freedom. Yet John Bright, according to the writer I have named, Avas an advocate of State interference for the agricultural labourers and others engaged in trades that were not organized. The pay of these people was so small that even John Bright Avas prepared to advocate State interference on their behalf. It seems to me that Ave must have either State interference or unionism. The extreme wing of the Socialist party might say that they preferred State interference rather than unionism, but we must undoubtedly have either the one or the other. An other reason in support of preference to trade unionists is that union officials, as the honourable member for Robertson admitted, help very much to bring about the peaceful settlement of industrial troubles. It often happens that they are out-voted,. or that the majorit y of the members of a union are opposed to the advice tendered by their officials, and in such circumstances, as loyal officers, they must carry out the wishes of their organization. But the fact cannot be gainsaid that union officials help to remove many grievances, assist in the settlement of many difficulties, and have been of great assistance to the body politic generally.",34
136,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Generally speaking, their efforts are all the time for peace.",35
137,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Quite so. realise the responsibilities of their position. I must confess to a certain amount of astonishment, if not bewilderment, at the failur e of the Prime Minister to take charge of this Bill . We all know that it is competent for the Leader of a Government to hand over a Bill to any of his colleagues. It is customary, for instance, for a Bill bristling with legal technicalities to be placed under the control, of the Attorney-General, especially when the Prime Minister is not a member of the legal profession. But we have before us now a Bill that presents no legal technicalities. It is so simple that a layman could pilot it through the House as weD as could any lawyer. therefore, why the Prime Minister is not in charge of it ; more especially as he is Minister of Home Affairs. If the Bill becomes law, and does what we are told it will do, it will affect the Department of Home Affairs more closely than any other Department of the Public Service. will not affect the Attorney-General's Department. There are not many casuals employed there. I suppose that an occasional typist and those who are called in to sweep out the offices represent the whole of the casual labour employed in the Attorney-General's Department. That being so, it is strange that the Attorney-General should be in charge of this Bill . One reason why the Prime Minister himself should take charge of it is that there is no one on the Government side of the House more competent than he is to deal with the question of unionists and non-unionists. any honourable member on this side has had a wider and fuller experience of unionism and non-unionism has the honourable gentleman. in itself, is a good he should be in charge of the Bill . There is still another reason. The Bill is introduced, apparently, not only to prohibit preference to unionists in Government employment, but to engineer a difficulty between the two Houses. It raises a big constitutional question, and is, therefore, of more importance than an ordinary measure. When the British House of Commons entered into its great conflict with the House of Lords, the Prime Minister, notwithstanding the tremendous responsibilities attaching to his office, took charge of the Parliament Bill , which dealt with the matter. He They did not hand over the Bill to his Attorney-General, although he was one of the most brilliant occupants of the office that the House of Commons had ever known. Honourable members-, whether they believe in, or are opposed to, Home Rule-whe ther they believe Ulster is right or Ulster is wrong-mus t admire the splendid stand taken up by the Prime Minister of Great Britain, when, at a time of crisis, he took upon his own shoulders the duties of Minister of War. We can well believe that, as he left the House after announcing that he had taken over the portfolio of Minister of War, which meant that he would have to seek re-election, he received an ovation One wonders, the like of which had never fallen to the lot of a Prime Minister in the House of Commons. In connection with this Bill , we are face to face with a great constitutional question, and may find ourselves tomorrow in the midst of a constitutional crisis. Who, then, is better enIt titled to take charge of the Bill than is the Prime Minister himself ? Instead of doing so, however, he gets behind the At torney-General, and shelters himself, I suppose, behind the skirts of the women of the National League. It seems to me that, out of very shamefacedness, the Prime Minister was not prepared to in troduce this Bill ; and that, for the same reason, he has not been prepared to make a second-reading speech upon it . He has not yet spoken in favour of it . I believe that I am right in saying that, even last session, the Prime Minister did not speak in favour of it . There must be a reason for this; and the reason is, I Scarcely think, that he has a past, and a very interesting one. I am referring, of course, to the honourable gentleman's political than career. However much we may differ, I That, think that his private career is beyond rereason why proach; but, as a Minister, he has no character. He was at one time a union secretary, and very shamefacedness, it appears to me, prevents his taking charge of this Bill. One cannot help feeling that, deep down in his heart, he is opposed to it. If it is not so, why have we not heard him speak in favour of it? I think that the Prime Minister is opposed to the Bill, that he is not a free man, that he is but the hireling of the party with which he is associated, and is not its real leader. In the career of the Prime Minister we find an example of patience and unscrupulousness obtaining its reward. The reactionary forces of Australia have hired the honourable gentleman, and are paying him his price. The trading trimmer has succeeded in becoming recognised, for the time being, as a Conservative, and will be recognised as such just as long as it suits him. There is still another reason why the Prime Minister is not prepared to pilot this Bill through the House. Despised by the party he has loft, he is, apparently, distrusted by the party with which he is now associated, as he is despised and distrusted by the body politic. Will this Bill do what it purports to do, seeing that, if work taken by a contractor, there is nothing in it to prevent him giving preference to unionists? The Attorney-General has, in this connection, accused the Labour party of "" Tammany-Hall tactics,"" which I understand to mean that money is paid to people for votes in municipal or legislative affairs, or for services rendered and likely to be rendered in the future. Is the Attorney-General the man in this House who should accuse anybody of "" Tammany-Hall tactics "" ? We have all read of William Pitt-the great son of a great statesman-wh o was notoriously an honest man in a venial age. At a time when he was in financial difficulties, the merchants of London twice offered him £100,000 with which to pay his debts; but he refused on both occasions, saying, "" I am in politics, and intend to remain in politics; in yeaTs to come I may be asked by the merchants of London to do, on their behalf, something that is not for the welfare of the country, and if I accepted this gift, the fact of my acceptance might hamper me in my duty."" But we have an ex-Prime Minister of Victoria taking £2,000 from the employers of Australia.",35
138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I cannot connect that with the question before the Chair'.,36
139,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Attorney-General has accused the Labour party of "" Tammany-Hall tactics.""",36
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I understood the honourable member for Barrier to be making a reference to some member of the Victorian Parliament, and I do not think that that can be identified with, the motion.",36
141,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I have no desire to> go against your ruling, but I submit that we have a right to reply to the base, dirty, mean insinuation of the Attorney-Gene",36
142,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member is in order in replying to the Attorney-General, when he does so in accordance with the Standing Orders.",36
143,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Then I say that a Minister of the Crown-to be on safe ground, I - shall not refer to any particular person-wh o does something for which he accepts £2,000 or any sum, and yet remains in public life, should be the last in this House to refer to "" TammanyHall ta cries"" on the part of the Labour is underparty or any other party.",36
144,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does the honourable member infer that the Attorney-General received this money for services rendered or likely to be rendered?,36
145,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member may take it as he pleases-h e may regard it as paid on philanthropic grounds. However, what I was asking was whether this Bill, even if it be passed by both Houses, will do what it purports to do? To-day I came across an extract from Macaulay's essay on parliamentary reform, in which he mentions a Bill that was passed by the House of Commons in 1819, to prevent seditious and blasphemous publications. Macaulay asks, in the course of the essay, how often that law was put into force, and the reply is that it was not put into force once. I may here say that, unlike the Bill before us, the Act passed by the House of Commons contained a penalty clause, and a person, on a second conviction, could be banished, and, in case of his returning, transported. Macaulay points out that under that Act there was not a single prosecution) although in 1820 there were more seditious and blasphemous articles written than in any previous twelve months. The further question is discussed in the essay, why Ministers did not put their new law into force, and the reason given is that the Govermnent durst not, and could not, put it into forcethat they obtained, the Bill with ease, for they had to deal with a subservient Parliament, but that in executing it they would have to deal with a refractory people. Therefore, I ask whether, even if the Bill before us he passed, the Government will be able to put it into force? Are the Government now carrying out the principle of no-preference? They have issued an executive minute that there shall be no preference, and only merit and ability considered; but I ask, how many non-unionists are employed on the transcontinental railway? Is it because unionists are always the best men that only unionists are employed on that work? If so, it seems to me a very strong argument in favour of trade unionism. If one of Packer's union were sent on to the transcontinental line, how long would the Government be able to get along with the work? Packer's union, above all, is that which the Liberal party delight to honour; so much so that the Prime Minister announced the policy of Australia before its members: and yet, apparently, there is not a member of that union fit to work on our great railway. I should now like toread some remarks that were made in this House by the present Prime Minister at the time of the great railway strike in Victoria, when the present Attorney-General was Premier of the State, and, according to all accounts, settled that dispute. The Prime Minister on that occasion saidA dispute has recently been settled in Victoria, and a great triumph has been achieved, but the results of the trouble remain. The dispute has not been settled in the true sense of the term, and we may be sure that the men who have been compelled to submit to the impositions of the Victorian Government will seek the earliest opportunity to secure a redress of their grievances. I speak not as one taking sides in that dispute. I am simply relating a fact which has had abundant confirmation. Wherever a strike has been resorted to, and peace has been secured by methods such as were recently adopted in Victoria, it has led only to the breaking out of the trouble .again as soon as one side or the other has been in a position to seek a remedy for its grievances. I do not think, however, that the Attorney-General need worry very much because of these sentiments, seeing that in the Prime Minister he has a most complacent colleague, who can adjust his Sir. Thomas. convictions to suit his ambitions. The Prime Minister, who has been the leader of the Labour party, as well as the leader of the Conservative forces in Australia, must possess, not only a great deal of ability, but also a great deal of adaptability. The Labour party has been accused of jobbery in connection with the Northern T e r r it o r y; and the Attorney General quoted some letter which I issued, as Minister of External Affairs, to the effect that a man had to be a unionist before he could get a position. I say here now that, under the same conditions, and, if I were in the same position tomorrow, I should do exactly the same thing ; and I shall tell honourable members why? We called for some eight or ten men for the Northern Territory, and there were 400 applications. I brought Mr Francis from the Northern Territory, where he was in charge of the railways, and left him an absolutely free hand in selecting the men. He selected eight, and I in dorsed his recommendation; but it was discovered, when they arrived in Darwin , that not one was a member of a trade union. There was trouble at once. The other persons who were working in the Northern Territory refused to work with the non-unionists. However, .the men sent up joined the union. It seems rather strange that out of 400 applications not one of those chosen happened to be a unionist; but we will let that matter pass. Later on, when we required eight men for a survey camp, we called for applications, and the Chief Surveyor having come down from the Territory, I allowed him an absolutely free hand to pick the men, though I did ask him specially to make inquiries about two of the applicants whom I knew. They were the only men I knew, but he felt justified in turning them down, and I never questioned his action.",36
146,Mr FINLAYSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Were they unionists?,37
147,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes , but I do not say they were turned down on that account. There were plenty of other unionists turned down. The Chief Surveyor afterwards came to me and told me that he had gone through the list, and that, in his opinion, certain men were the best. Then he said, "" I suppose you would likeme to see whether they are unionists or not,"" and I said, "" Yes."" What was the good of sending men to the NorthernTerritory in order to have difficulty immediately they arrived? This gentleman,. who was in charge of the survey camp, knew very well that if the men appointed were nob unionists there would be trouble immediately they arrived. I told him that if the men were unionists he could appoint them, and, so far as I know, they all happened to be unionists, and were appointed. I would do exactly the same today under the same circumstances, and I would like to ask whether any Minister of External Affairs would act differently if he wished to do anything in the Territory. Of course, if the policy of the present Government in regard to the Northern Territory is to do nothing, it matters not whether they send unionists or non-unionists there; but if they wish to pursue a vigorous policy of development, they will require the assistance of the workers of Australia, and they can only get that full and complete assistance from the unionists. If the Minister of External Affairs wished to send a nurse to the hospital at Darwin, would he send other than a member of the Nurses Union ? The honourable member for Robertson spoke about what the shearers have done. What did the doctors of Adelaide do ? Because a nurse had been appointed over a nurse who they thought should get the position, they walked out of the Adelaide Hospital on strike, and the patients in that institution might have died so far as they were concerned. Nurses are absolutely justified in belonging to a union. Their union has done a great deal for them, and if a nurse has spent years and years in hospitals in order to gain her diplomas, she should get a living wage for the work she does and the trouble she has taken. I know that the Minister of External Affairs would not send a nurse to the Darwin Hospital unless she were a member of the Nurses Union. I have pointed out some reasons for saying that it will be utterly f u t i l e for the Government to do anything under this measure, even if the Bill be carried; but there is another reason for the introduction of the Bill . The measure is intended to engineer a difficulty between the two Houses, and, if possible, bring about a double - dissolution. Some two or three weeks ago, when dealing with this particular matter, I said that we must take the - Constitution as it stands, and not necessarily the interpretation we place upon it , and that we must not read into it the ideas in the minds of those who framed it . The Attorney-General agreed with ime. He was good enough to say that this was very often overlooked. Though so great a jurist as Judge Isaacs takes a different view, and says that that which the Constitution was. obviously intended to do must be read into it , I am prepared to take it literally. I agree with the Attorney-General that we cannot read into the Constitution anything more than is in it in black and white. That being the case, the Governor General can read into the Constitution only what is there, and not something enveloping it that the Government bring under his particular notice. It is said that if this Bill is lost in the Senate a double dissolution is to be asked for, not so much upon this Bill as upon something which the Government have up their sleeve; but if the Government ask for a double dissolution on those lines, then, to use the words of the honourable member for Bendigo, Ministers will be attempting a fraud on the Constitution. They will be attempting to prostitute for political and party purposes the highest position in the land. I do not know that this would bother the Prime Minister very much. No doubt he would be prepared to say, "" Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."" I understand that he is quite prepared with equal readiness to advocate a republic or an empire, as the occasion requires. Whether this Bill is lost or passed makes very little difference to me. If it becomes law it will not interfere with my rest, for under it nothing can be done. If it is thrown out by the Senate it will not disturb ""the even tenor of my life, for I feel quite assured that the Government, in forging this Bill , in order to bring about a double dissolution, are minting coins that can have no currency.  take exception to certain remarks of the honourable member for Barrier concerning the Prime Minister, not very complimentary to him, in his absence from the chamber. The honourable member said that it was the place of the Prime Minister to take charge of this Bill , and in attempting to draw a parallel, he took us to England and other parts, and spoke of the action of the present Prime Minister of Great B r it a in in regard to the Home Rule Bill and other extraneous matters, u n t i l in the end honourable members could not realise what his argument was. In 1910, the Conciliation and A r b i tration Bill was brought down to this House, not by the then Prime Minister, but by the then Attorney-General, the honourable member for West Sydney.",37
148,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I said that a Bill containing a lot of legal technicalities should be introduced by the Attorney-General.  right for the Attorney-General of the honourable member's Ministry to introduce the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, surely it is quite proper for our Bill to be introduced by the Attorney-General of the present Ministry. The honourable member for Barrier said that it was quite impossible for the Government to carry on the transcontinental railway construction without preference to unionists, that all the men employed on the work were unionists, and that they received preference; also that in order to carry on this great national work the Commonwealth was dependent on the efforts of unionists. The honourable member could not have cited a stronger case for the Bill. We have four or five hundred men, who could work for 12s. 6d. a day, under the very best conditions that Australia can offer to men doing this work, and yet they are on strike. It is really time that unionists were taught their business; time that there was an open door to competitors from outside unions, and time that giving preference to unionists was knocked on the head. These 400 or 500 men are demanding 13s. 6d. a day. I defy any honourable member to point to unskilled labour on' railway construction that is receiving better pay than that which the Government offer at Kalgoorlie. When travelling in New South Wales the other day, I was in a carriage with a number of fettlers and railway men, and they formed me that they were receiving only 8s. a day. In Western Australia, in a similar climate, men employed on the same class of work get 10s. a day, yet, though the men on the construction work of 'the transcontinental railway are offered 12s. 6d. a day, and have every facility for having their wives and families where they are working, and an unlimited supply of water, and their rations taken to them, and every possible privilege, yet they are on strike. They were receiving the biggest wage men in that class of work could receive. If the honourable member for Barrier has given us one reason why we should do away with preference to unionistSj it is that. When men belonging to unions refuse to work, it is time to open the doors to those who are not in unions. The honourable member compared the condition of the farm labourers here with those of the farm labourers in the Old Country, and said how much better off the former are. But the members of his party are continually arguing that the conditions of the Australian farm labourers are anything but right; and they contend that the rural workers ought to be able to bring disputes into the Arbitration Court. Let me make a comparison between the conditions of workers in Australia and those of workers in Canada. In every case the advantage is with the latter. In Canada bricklayers receive 110s. a week, and in Sydney 78s.; masons, 110s., as against 66s.; plasterers, 9.1s. 8d., as against 66s.; painters, 75s., as against 64s.; plumbers, 75s., as against 72s.; and carpenters, 82s., as against 72s. In Canada there is no Labour party, no Wages Boards, no Arbitration Court, and a Conservative Government is in power.",39
149,Mr LAIKD SMITH,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I have here a full account of the Canadian Arbitration Court.,39
150,Mr ABCHIBALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Is there no winter in Canada?  year there. My point is that, under a Conservative Government in Canada, labour is better off than it is under a Labour Administration in Australia, notwithstanding all our arbitration laws, in - which did not prevent 250 strikes from occurring during the three years that the Pisher Administration was in power. In August last the honourable member for Grey gave us some account of his early experiences in South Australia and elsewhere, stating that he had undertaken shearing for 10s. a 100 sheep and his food, and had worked as a farm labourer for 10s. a week and his food. The account that I refer to is to be found in the Hansard record of our debates of 20th August last. To-day shearers receive 24s. per 100 without their food; but years ago the quality of the sheep waa poor, the fleeces averaging only 4 lb. or 5 lb., men could then easily shear 10O 1 sheep a day, and now, with fleeces averaging 8 lb. or 9 lb., they do not shear more than 80 sheep a day. Thus a said:shearer today gets in wages 19s., from which must be deducted 3s. for the cost of living, making his net wages 16s. a DEAR SIR, day, or 6s. a day more than shearers used proval to receive years ago, an increase of about 60 per cent. Honourable members oppoin site, no doubt, claim that this increase is rate due to the splendid organization of the Australian Workers Union.",39
151,Mr ARCHIBALD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There is no doubt about it.  at one time were paid 10s. a week with their food now get 30s. a week with their food, and in many cases are paid more, so that their wages have increased 300 to vote Liberal? per cent.  worked for Chirnside, I got 6s. a day for working for fanners in the Colac trict.  honourable member would get those wages. Although our friends opposite say that the rural workers should be under the Arbitration Court, the fact mains that, whereas the shearers, whose organization is the biggest in Australia, have increased their wages by only someinto thing like 60 per cent., the farm labourers, without organization, have secured an crease of 300 per cent. The honourable member for Barrier, repeating what was said by the honourable member for West Sydney, spoke of the Bill as the shadow of a sham, because he said the Liberals would everywhere enter into contracts for vote labour. the carrying out of public works, and thus there would be no Government employees postal vote. on those works. We hope, of course, that the Labour party will not again, hold the reins of office, but, in the ordinary course of affairs, they may be expected some future date to do so. Will not they at once re-affirm the principle of preference to unionists, and revert to the dayLiberalism labour system, providing Government employment for some 12,000 men ? In maknothing ing appointments is preference to be shown to unionists in every case? The honourable member for Barrier finds fault with the Attorney-General for speaking of the Tammany methods of the Labour party, but I think that the following ter supports what the Attorney-General * Department of External Affairs, 2nd April, 1913. I have the honour to inform you that aphas been given for your appointment as field hand in connection with survey work the Northern Territory, with wages at the of ls. 5d. per hour of forty-eight hours per week. This approval has been given on the understanding that you are a member of a recognised union. If you are not, it will ba necessary for you to take steps to join at once, otherwise the agreement lapses. Yours faithfully, ATLEE HUNT, Secretary.",40
152,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I do not know who that. man was. He might have been a Liberal. ,40
153,Mr THOMAS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,In the Northern Terri,40
154,Mr BUENS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I think that we should dishave a quorum. [Quorum formed.]  tralia I came across a concrete instance of the way in which unionists are compelled to vote Labour. On polling day a labour union secretary compelled all the remembers of his union who were present to file into his office. The first man to receive a ballot paper put a tally-paper the ballot-box instead, and brought back the ballot paper to the secretary, inwho gave it to the next trade unionist, and this man, in his turn, brought back another ballot paper, a mark being put against each man's name on the roll. In this way every person who happened to belong to that union was compelled to . Mr YATES - You are talking about the  tale, but I am stating facts. The honourable member knows that that system has at been adopted throughout Australia.",40
155,Mr WEST,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I say that is not correct.  do not allow us to defend such tactics. ""Liberalism,"" says Broadhurst, "" does not seek to make all men equalcan do that. But its objecb is to remove all obstacles erected by men which prevent all having equal opportunities."" We do not for a moment profess to make all men equal, but we shall, as long aB we exist as a party, endeavour to remove letobstacles which prevent all men having equal opportunities. That is what we stand for. As the Prime Minister said in his opening address, we all belong to a union of States, and as every individual in the State belongs to t h at union, we should have equal rights. Every citizen in the Commonwealth contributes to the revenue, and as revenue contributors we should certainly have a say as to how that revenue should be distributed. citizen who has attained the age of twenty-one has a vote, and our friends on the Opposition side are continually preaching the principle of one man one vote. That carries with it the principle of one man one value, instead of which honourable members opposite would give the union man a value additional upon t h at of men outside the union. I ask the Leader of the Opposition, whether, in giving preference to unionists, he would go further, and l i m it the franchise to unionists? If he is not prepared to do that, why should he give preference to them in Government employment ?",40
156,Mr GREGORY,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Do you say that no man outside a union should be allowed to vote?  principle of preference to unionists holds good in one case, it holds good in the other. The right honourable member for Wide Bay, when he was in power, defined the unionists as persons belonging to unions affiliated with the Trades and Labour Council. The object of every member of a union is to improve his position on the labour market, but Mr . Fisher's definition of a unionist is limited to membership of a union affiliated with the Trades and Labour Council. I take it that if a body of free labourers band themselves together for the purpose of i m -. proving their position in the labour market, although possibly they do not belong to a union affiliated with the Trades and Labour Council, they should have exactly the same rights as members of other unions; but if the definition given by the right honourable member for Wide Bay be adopted, those men will be denied the privileges and rights which members of other unions have got. I listened with great interest to the speeches delivered by the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for West Sydney, and both those gentlemen declared that all the best men are in the unions.",41

Opposition and the honourable member for West Sydney did make that statement, and the honourable member may find it on page 3109 of the Hansard reports for 1913..

162,Mr YATES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Undoubtedly .  the vilest man in this country may become a good man by paying his entrancefee into a union. I would like to follow that argument up with one or two illustrations. I do not profess to be a cricketer, but suppose I wanted to become an accomplished batsman, a veritable Trumper, all I would require to do would be to go to Sydney, pay two guineas for membership of the Association, walk through the turnstile, go on to the cricket pitch, and hi t the ball all round the wicket.",41
163,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"As soon as you cease to be a pagan and become a Christian you are a better man. Is that not the doctrine of that religion?  ists today are more political than indust r i a l, and, that being the case, they should be treated as other political associations, are treated. As long as they keep the industrial aspect of their aims to the fore, let us give them every opporUtility they have a right to, but when they become political organizations they should be treated the same as the Farmers and Settlers Association and the Liberals are treated.",41
164,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,T would like to make you provethat.  bers tolerate a proposal by the Government to bring in a Bill to give preference to Liberals?,42
165,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"You do it without a Bill .  Labour party want to keep all the plums for themselves. If they were to broaden their vision, and allow that charitable in stinct of which they boast to extend to others, the country would be better, and they themselves certainly would be better. I recollect listening some time ago to an address delivered by a gentleman in New South Wales, and he said that the Labour party reminded him very much of the man who prayed every night"" Oh Lord, bless me and my wife, my son John, and his wife, we four, no more, for evermore. Amen. "" I think that is the Labour party's prayer.",42
166,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That joke is only five hundred years old.  well in this particular instance. to apply to this argument a few figures which will carry weight. According to the latest figures given by Knibbs, the population of the Commonwealth is 4,568,000, of .which the unionists number 443,000, equal to one unionist in every ten and a half persons. revenue of the Commonwealth £21,000,000, equal to £ 4 12s. I d . per head of population. Each unionist contributes to the Consolidated Revenue £ 4 12s. I d . , aud nine and a half non-unionists contribute £ 4 3 14s. 9£d. In other words, a total of £2,000,000 is contributed by the unionists and £19,000,000 is contributed by people outside the unions. I ask why the man who contributes £ 4 12s. l d . to the Consolidated Revenue should have an equal voice with the nine and a half other persons who contribute £ 4 3 14s. 9£d. ? Next, I come to the question of preference to unionists, "" all things being 'equal."" What is the meaning of the phrase "" all things being equal "" ? Who is tb decide the equality? On the 20th September, 1911, Mr Deakin put this question to the then Prime M in ister, the honourable member for Wide BayI f preference is to be granted to unionists, other things being equal between the applicants, who is to determine, and on what evidence, their comparative qualifications? The present Leader of the Opposition, who was then Prime Minister, repliedThe officer charged with the duty of selecting. Instead of allowing the question of preference to be determined by a Judge, the Labour Government picked out certain oflicers by whom this preference should be given.",42
167,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,They did not; they were the ordinary oflicers of the Department.  would be scattered all over the country?,42
168,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes , wherever they might be working.  of whom the honourable member speaks, would be foremen, sub-foremen, and gangers. Most of them, probably, would be union men, and very much prejudiced.",42
169,Mr FENTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"A foreman cannot be a anion man.  Labour party recognised their position. If purely industrial unions were concerned in this matter, we should be very I desire pleased to help them; but we feel that we ought not to agree to preference being given to the political unions of the Labour party, as against the Liberal Leagues, or the Farmers and Settlers' Association. We think that all should be treated alike. I have gone very carefully into The the balance-sheet of the Australian is Workers Union as presented recently to the House by the honourable member for Darling. This balance-sheet covers a period of twenty-five years, and it shows that during that time the total amount collected was £438,358 . Of that amount, a sum of £54,523 was disbursed by way of "" strike expenditure,"" whilst £34,961 is set down in respect of "" Donations to other unions, hospitals, & c . "" "" R e f u n d s of forfeited wages, tas.,"" amounted to £6,412 . making a total of £95,896. Thus 22 per cent, of the money collected during this term was devoted to legitimate union purposes; the rest was devoted to organization and politics. Mr J. H. CATTS - What about the expenditure of the Farmers and Settlers' Association %  We say that, as members of the Farmers and Settlers' Association, we are fighting for our political rights. Honourable members opposite profess that the funds of their unions are devoted to helping the poverty-stricken, the sick and"" the distressed ; yet, according to this balance sheet, the Australian Workers Union, over a period of twenty-five years, devoted only £34,961 to donations to ""other unions, hospitals, & c . "" W hy do they not tell us exactly how much they gave to the hospitals, instead of including hospital contributions with ' ' donations to other unions, Ate."" ? I live in a rural district, and do not know of one donation to our hospitals by the Australian Workers Union. There is a branch of that union at Orange, the chief town of my electorate; but I have never heard of it subscribing a guinea to the local hospitals.",42
170,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"What does the Employers Federation give to hospitals ?  the Employers Federation, but with the balance-sheet of the Australian Workers Union. I think, however, that the members of the Federation subscribe liberally to the funds of the hospitals.",43
171,Mr CHARLTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does the honourable member say that members of the Australian Workers Union do not subscribe individually to hospital funds? ,43
172,Mr CHARLTON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Then why make this allegation?  ing from the balance-sheet of the Australian Workers Union as put forwar d by the honourable member for Darling.,43
173,Mr BURNS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Does not the honourable member know that the members of the union take up a collection at every shed ?  lections do not come from the funds of the Australian Workers Union. people also take up collections for the same purpose. Out of the total of £438,358 raised by the Australian Workers Union' during the period covered by this balance-sheet, £34,961 was devoted to "" other unions, hospitals, &c."" Even if we assumed that the whole of that amount was given to hospitals, it would represent only 8.3 per cent, of the total moneys collected by the union. I desire to compare this balance-sheet and the conditions prevailing here with those of the various unions in existence in the United Kingdom. Taking a ten years' average, we find that 100 of the principal unions provide for disputes benefits; seventy-nine of them provide unemployed benefits; seventy-nine provide for a sick or accident f u n d ; thirty-seven for a superannuation f u n d ; eighty-seven for a funeral f u n d ; and thirty-three for all fou r benefits. The expenditure of these unions is distributed as follows:-Dispute s benefits, 13.4 per cent.; unemployed, 22.1 per cent.; sick or accident funds, 19.1 per cent.; superannuation, 12.4 per cent.; and funeral fund, 11 per cent.; or a total of 78 per cent., leaving 22 per cent, for management expenses. In other words, 78 per cent, of their funds is devoted to charities and to funds for the alleviation of sickness and poverty.",43
174,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Superannuatio n and the funeral funds are not charities  the honourable member I will say that 78 per cent, of the expenditure of these unions in the Old Country is devoted to humanitarian objects. In that respect, they set, a splendid example to the unions with which honourable members opposite are associated. The Australian Workers Union devotes 78 per cent, to management expenses, and at the most gives only 8 per cent, as donations to other unions, hospitals, &c.",43
175,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It does not give anything to hospitals.,43
176,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Fro m what has the honourable member been quoting in regard to the funds of unions in the Old Country ?  peedia Britqnnica.,43
177,Mr JH CATTS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"That information is half a century old.  Other honourable friends opposite would do well to read it , and to adopt here the practices followed in this respect by the trade unions in the Old Country. The principle of preference to unionists which the Labour Government applied to public servants cuts against the grain of B r i tish fair play. If there is one thing more than - another of which we are proud it is Magna Charta-.",43
178,Unknown,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 7.45 p.m.  dinner I was endeavouring to show that this Bill, deals with an evil which strikes at the root of all true British freedom, and at those liberties for which our fathers have fought-liberties , the foundations of which can be traced to the Magna Charta which K in g John signed at Runnymede. ' Chapter No. 40 of that Charter readsTo no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay right or justice. If we allow preference to unionists, either in or outside the Public Service, we are refusing that right to which every section of the community is entitled. If honourable members opposite are in favour of preference to unionists, are they also in favour of preference to employers' unions 1 If the latter, how is it that we find trade unionists working for various employers who do not belong to employers' unions, and thus branding themselves "" scabs "" ?",43
179,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Act does give preference to employers' unions or organizations.  honourable members opposite are very in consistent, or they would not accept employment from employers who are outside the unions. Only a short time ago, during the butchers' strike in Sydney, two of the master butchers withdrew from the union of the employers on the question of employing union labour, and, as a matter of fact, there was a regular rush of unionists for employment with those men. This appears to me to be supporting a principle which unionists describe as hateful; and I think they ought to be more consistent. Before I sit down I should like to show that a very high compliment has been paid to our worthy Prime Minister by a leading member of a trade union, and it is well that the country should know the facts. The compliment is contained in the following newspaper extract:CANBERRA DISPUTE . PRAISE FOR MR . COOK. The treasurer of the Railway Workers and General Labourers' Association, a large organization, spoke yesterday in favour of the Liberal Government of the Commonwealth. "" Last February,"" said Mr Rosser, "" we had n strikp at the Federal Capital area, and the Prime Minister made n special visit to inquire into the men's grievances. We put forward a list of claims for his consideration, and I must say that the result has been most satisfactory. We could get no satisfaction under the Labour regime, nor could we under the Liberal Government until the men downed tools; but the arrangements that have now been come to are calculated to ensure lasting peace. The schedule of rates is most comprehensive, but the quotation of a few instances will serve to indicate that Mr Cook and the Department of Home Affairs realized that the men had just cause of complaint. For instance, hammer and drill spawler and jumper men were paid ls. 3d., now they will get ls. 4£d - the highest rate paid in New South Wales. Several men, pickmen, and tipmen, now paid 9s. and 9s. 6d. under New South Wales control, are to receive 10s. per day. The pay for horse, dray, and driver, which is 13s. 6d. on New South Wales railway works, will be 14s. 4d. under this Commonwealth schedule."" According to this gentleman the workers of Australia are absolutely safe in accepting employment under the Government when there is a man like Joseph Cook at the head of affairs. as Mr YATES (Adelaide) [7.52] - The honourable member for Robertson has asked if we are prepared to grant preference to employers, and I ask him in return whether, in the event of our being so prepared, he will guarantee that the employers shall meet the demands of combined labour. If so, there will be no need for preference either way; and I should say the employers will have a very happy time, inasmuch as they need not fear industrial disputes. In the course of the debate we have repeated references to ' ' British liberty ' ' ; but so far as I can see it is only just recently that the great masses of the people at Home are becoming enlightened as to what true liberty means-, and unless a little British fair trade play is extended to them. I am inclined to think that the turmoil and unrest will become much greater. What "" British liberty,"" so far as we know it , is there in regard to the higher professions and employments at Home? It is said that the upper classes put their sons into the army, the church, or the legal profession; even in the church the livings are in a great many instances reserved to representatives of the higher classes. I doubt very much whether a manual worker could obtain one of those rosy positions in the church; and the legal profession is hedged round in such a manner that it is well-nigh impossible for any one of the mass of the people, except a genius, to find his way to the front . Not long ago there was so much "" l i be r t y "" at Home that if a man was not prepared to take the "" King's shilling "" he was compelled to serve, but all that' was required from a man who desired to be an officer on horseback was to buy a commission. Can we see no preference all these illustrations ""liberty"" and ""fair play""? elderly man from Great Britain, has been through the life, will tell you that there is not much liberty for the proletariat-those teeming millions, many of whom, according to Campbell-Bannerman, verge of starvation. Let honourable members read Jack London's book, The People of the Abyss-that abyss into which it is most easy to slip and most difficult to get oub of. The "" liberty,"" however, which so many honourable members is a different thing altogether. unionism is now a sort of religion, which has lifted the industrial world to the place it occupies today. We now ask for a requital, and the sneaks of society should not be allowed to benefit from our efforts. We on this side offer no apology for the attitude we are taking on this Some honourable members seem to have the idea that preference to unionists not be given in the Public We should remember, however, that Australia is not going to follow in the rut of other nations, but is going to branch out for herself, and as her industrial development is unlimited, the time may come wheu the Government greatest employer in the country, men of many trades, now embraced by trade unionism, in their pay. not seeking too much in trying tc place the Government employment on the same line as any other employment. ally, I am prepared to go to the country tomorrow and advocate preference unionists, as a guarantee of efficiency in our workmen and of benefit to the Commonwealth. The honourable, member for Robertson used a very humorous ment in regard to the legal He was referring to some remarks made earlier in the day by the honourable member for West Sydney, but that honourable member is a legal man himself, and knows too much to be taught anything by the honourable member for Robertson. latter emphasized the point that a lawyer has to undergo a certaiu course of training before entering the profession, and he seemed to suggest that a working man should, before being given Mr Yates. carry'a hod of bricks, or wheel a barrow, a certain distance. The honourable member forgets that if a navvy cannot break enough ground, or shift enough of that under stuff for which 4s. 6d. a yard is paidof British but which may be worth only 2s. if the Any work is by contract-h e is a losing prowho position to his employer, and is dismissed. turmoil of The same principle holds good throughout all the trades, and a unionist, if he proves to be incompetent, is sent about his business, especially if his employer happens are on the to be a shrewd commercial man. If I go to a legal man to seek advice as to my chances in a court of law, I find, nine times out of ten, that, if he thinks I have any money, I get an about opinion that my case is good enough. talk, On his recommendation, I take the case Trade into court. I put my hand to the plough by engaging that legal luminary, and I cannot stop until he stops, and whatever the bil l may be, I must pay it . That is the difference between the two men, the lawyer and the trade unionist. I am not a legal luminary, and, therefore, cannot criticise the business of lawyers, or say question. whether lawyers are efficient or inefficient; but the tale goes the rounds that one should lawyer may write a sentence and submit Service. it to four other lawyers, and that they will all differ as to its meaning. So, how much do lawyers know? Every member of an industrial union knows his business. If a tradesman starts out to make a chair, he does not make a table; no other man will be the can say that it is not a chair, and that with it is a dressing-table, or a side-board. The man makes what he set out to make, We are and proves his knowledge of the business. On the other hand, I cannot say how many cases are lost in the Courts by in Person- dividuals who have gone to law on the recommendation of lawyers. But the to lawyer has the best end of the stick every time, so that the simile between lawyers and trade unionists is lost. The honourable member for Calare said that if he argu- paid £ 2 a week to become a cricketer, he profession. must necessarily, when he has finished, be the best cricketer. The honourable member said that it was claimed that all unionists were the best men. We have not argued that the best tradesmen are in trade unions. We have argued that The the majority of the best tradesmen are in trade unions, but we have not said that every man outside of trade unions is not a good man.  employment, is reported in Hansard.",44
180,Mr YATES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Our leaders may have made some remarks upon which the honourable member has put lus own construction. I am satisfied that our leaders recognise that there are good men outside trade unions. There are plenty of good workmen outside trade unions. often it is the skilful man who will stand on his own ability, and will not join a trade union; he thinks that he can get a job anywhere when he wishes to leave one place-h e is conservative because he is highly skilled; but he will not say, "" Before trade unionists raised the price of my labour, it was worth so much, and I cannot accept any increase""; or, "" I worked ten and twelve hours a day, a-nd, though now the hours of labour are eight, I wish to go on for ten hours "" ; or, "" Seeing that we worked at the same rate of wages after doing ten hours' work, I can not accept time ancl a-half for overtime now."" Any one who looks at the matter from a fair point of view must come to the same conclusion as ourselves, that trade unionists having brought about all the benefits that now obtain in Australian industries, no tradesman should remain outside a union. The man who remains outside a union is always a menace to it . The unionists never know what the non-unionists will do. If the unionists find a certain set of conditions irksome, or if they think it wise that there should be some advance made in the rate of wages, they have to go to the non-unionists and ask them if they are prepared to advocate whatever may be advocated by the unions; and they may say, "" No . "" they do, the boss, as a rule, when approached, says, "" So-and-so is satisfied."" The non-unionists may be considerably in the minority, yet the unionists, unless they have the full strength of their organization, have to conform to the dictates of the two or three outside the organization. If they fight the battle and lose, they are on the same plane as the non-unionists; but if they win in their endeavour to alter the conditions, the benefits they gain are not confined to them-the non-unionists advance also. This condition of affairs is most irksome, and the trade unionists, therefore, have nothing for which to apologize in their demand for preference to unionists. The existence of non-unionists is obnoxious to them. Seeing that the Arbitration Court deals only with bodies of men instead of with individuals,' we ask that it should recognise the efforts of trade unions, and give preference to unionists in the Government service as well as outside. Some say that trade unions are not, absolutely industrial. If they are not absolutely industrial, whose Very fault is it? There was a day when there were uo Labour men in Houses of Parliament, and the day that heralded the beginning of the Labour movement politically was brought about at the instance of the employers. We had a big strike, well within the memory of residents for any length of time - I refer to the great maritime strike of 1890-and word went round from the employers in South Australia to this effect: "" We shall get these chaps to drop this method of driving us to give them what they ask."" They adjured us that the strike weapon was barbarous; that it brought trouble and tribulation into homes; that the wives nnd children suffered through strikes; that strikes caused dislocation to trade and chaos to every one; that to strike was to hark back to the days of barbarism. They said if we were not satisfied with the position as we then found it , the law of the land was responsible, and we should get into the Houses of Legislature and alter the law. Did these employers say - that to individuals? Did they say it to non-unionists? No. They said it to the Seamen's Union, and to the Wharf Labourers Union, and to every other union who stood back to back with those unions in the great fight which was put up If in 1890; but little did the employers dream that the trade unions would accept their advice and act on it . They did act on it , and today we find that trade unions have gone in for politics. In South Australia particularly they have made rapid strides, and if it were not for that old, worn-out system of British liberty and fair play, and for following the precedent of the Old Country-if it were not for the existence of what we call the House of Fossils in South Australia, things in that State would be infinitely better than they are now. There are many who would, if they could, bite out the tongues that gave the unions that advice. They shudder at it . It hurts them so deeply. Nearly every honourable member opposite claims that our funds are used for political purposes, but, having advised us tb take political action, can honourable members say how industrial and political objects can be dissociated? If all the unions were disbanded, and a dispute such as that of 1S90 arose, and the President of the tration Court was asked to bring about a settlement, seeing that it would extend yond one State, the Judge would immediately ask whom he should cite to the Court. He could not send for individuals, otherwise he would have all the unionists in a line, from Spring-street to Spencer-street, marching to the Court as respondents to the plaint that would be filed. As a matter of fact, we know that the Arbitration Act is only possible because of the existence of organized bodies who can be dealt with. In the circumstances, how can we dissociate political action from industrial action? Can trade unions be other than industrial politically? In no sense can they be. I have been connected with trade unions, and with the political side of the movement, as secretary, and I know what funds are paid into the Political Labour party's account in South Australia. Some of our opponents are carried away by the amount that they imagine comes in from trade unions. We win our elections, not by the money that - comes in from the trade unions, but by the loyalty of trade unions and their members to their cause, and by the propaganda work we have carried out. We do not get the thousands such as were poured into the campaign funds of our opponents by the vested interests to defeat the referenda in South Australia. We were successful in securing one of our opponents' subscription lists, and on that list appeared the South Australian Land Company, which, owing to British liberty and fair play was allowed to exploit Australia for so long. There was also the name of Harris, Scarfe, and Company for £100. I think the name of the South Australian Gas Company appeared on the list. Then there was A. Simpson and Son Limited for £100. Do not I wish that I had somebody to wheel in £100 to me as secretary. Instead of carrying the referenda in the numbers we did in South Australia, we would have doubled our majority. Our efforts were puny, having regard to the issues at stake. In regard to an interjection by the honourable member for Wannon, may I say that I am the auditor of the Australian Workers Union books in Adelaide? I know that remark hurts the honourable Mr Yates. member for Calare. His statements' in. that regard were erroneous. He took collective figures, and tried to found an Arbi- argument on them. As I was saying, I would have been the proudest man in be- South Australia at the last elections if I had had a few of those hundreds to play with. Our contributions came from our propaganda centres. One centre collected at Sunday afternoon meetings and other meetings the sum of £200, all voluntary contributions from our supporters.",46
181,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What about the levies you took from the shearers?,47
182,Mr YATES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does the honourable member know how much we got from them?,47
183,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I do.,47
184,Mr YATES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The honourable member does not know what the Australian Workers Union paid into the funds of the Labour party in South Australia. The honourable member would be astonished if I told him, but I shall not satisfy his curiosity.",47
185,Mr FLEMING,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,There is no necessity. I have often paid in the contributions of my own shearers.,47
186,Mr YATES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am positive .the honourable member does not know how much was paid, but I am not going to tell him. Honourable members have no idea of the amount of money paid to the Political Labour League of South Australia by the unions in that State. Seeing that we appealed to our supporters everywhere and anywhere to establish a fighting fund, can we prevent a union from saying, "" We shall give you £10 out of our general fund"" ? It is a contribution from them for their political, as well as for their industrial, salvation. I ask the other side if the two can be dissociated. The members of the industrial world must see that the political side of their lives is looked to. What would be their position if they could not get members of Parliament to try to bring about the results at which they aim? Honourable members opposite have spoken of the strikes that have occurred under Labour administration, and the honourable member for Calare has quoted remarks of a union secretary concerning the Prime Minister. I am pleased that the Prime Minister has not forgotten all that was best in him when a trade unionist, and has shown a little of his real self, which is so different from the fictitious seif which he generally shows at the present time. The honourable member for Calare referred to the manner in which the Cook Government have granted requests made by the workers. The Verran Government in South Australia, a Labour Administration, was asked on several occasions for higher wages. It granted a shilling a day on one occasion, and when a subsequent request for an increase was made, it granted another shilling a day; but, as the result, some one was facetious enough to dub it the "" Bob-a-day "" Government, and what the honourable member for Calare regards as good in the attitude of the Cook Government was ridiculed when done by the Verran Government, which, like the old man with the donkey, could not please any one, though it tried all it could to meet the desires of the workers. I belong to a union whose members require more assistance than any other. We approached the Government for free tents, free tools, and free working time. The word "" free "" astonishes honourable members opposite; but they do not know what hard work means. Some of them may occasionally do a little digging in the garden, and think that they could turn over a mile of earth without getting tired; but they could not work as those whom 1 speak of have to work. We asked for time in which to put on sea boots, as the men were working up to their knees in water. Any one who has any concern for his brother man must feel the injustice of demanding that ten minutes should be taken out of his luncheon hour to enable him to put on sea boots in which to work. Again, as a railway track is pushed forward, the men engaged in making the line have to walk further and further. Sometimes a man must walk a mile to get to work, and it has to be done in his own time. When the men get back from their work, they have to turn to and cook their meals. They have not comfortable homes with wives getting their tea, so that on returning from work they have only to take off their boots, put on their slippers, and sit before the fire. I should like honourable gentlemen opposite to try what their work is like-not - for one day, but year in and year out. When rain falls, work is stopped, and sometimes when a man is drawing money to send home to his wife and kiddies, he finds that three or four days' pay has been deducted from the weekly wage. These men, be it remembered, love their homes as others do. We are fighting strenuously for preference to unionists, because where an extra shilling a day has been granted, where walking time has been granted, or where conditions have in any way been improved and brought more into conformity with Christian teaching, it is the unionists who have agitated, borne the expense, and suffered the victimization that has been necessary. We hear about "" all things being equal "" ; but when a lot of navvies present . themselves for employment on railway work, what test of equality is to be applied? Is each man to be asked to ring a pick to see whether there is steel in the point, or to show how far he can throw a shovelful of mullock? A ganger might pick out those whose physique was the best; but physique does not mean equality. Those who are on the lowest rung of the social ladder are treated now as if they were lower as men than are their fellows; but the social system should be built up on the feeling that each man is worthy in accordance with what he does for the community. The man whose work results in the construction of a raihvay is of more value to the community than many who are engaged in other occupations than navvying. We have a right to say that when a lot of navvies apply for work, the places shall be given to unionists. I shall have no fear in going to the country in support of the principle of preference to unionists. I would fight for the principle, not only in the Adelaide division-becaus e that is a seat which can easily be held for Labourbut in any other constituency in South Australia. I have no wish to make a narrow appeal. Men must be recognised for their value. A few business men-the members of the Employers Eederation, for instance-ma y not recognise that principle. The so-called kings of industry may be against it, and may try to break it down, but they will not succeed. The Bill is an attempt to break down unionism. But, although it can have no effect, we are bound, as a matter of principle, to prevent it from passing, and I shall take every opportunity to oppose it . If I did not, I should not be doing my duty to my constituents. Some speakers have told us that, as all the taxpayers contribute to the revenue, all should have the same opportunity to get Government employment. To that we do not object. There is nothing to prevent all those engaged in an industry, if competent, joining the unions. There are men who stand outside unions, but who, nevertheless, vote Labour. It has been said that we are trying to force men into unions to make them support the Labour but the non-unionists, the sneaks of society, vote Labour now, because know that they gain advantages by having Labour in power. They will not join unions, because they do not wish to bear the burden of unionism, and are afraid of victimization. They are the toadies of the industrial field. I may be asked to prove that there is victimization-which is, of course, very difficult, and, in many cases, impossible. But when an employer thinks that he is being forced by the combination of his employees to increase wages, he often tries to get rid of troublesome workers who have taken an active part in the matter. The member for Boothby said the day, that one empolyer when a ganger sees a man reading a newspaper, he gets rid of him, knowing that such a man is likely troublesome. The employers would like to see the working classes as ignorant as they were when women worked in the coal mines. The workers are equal to any other section of the community, the employers would like to see them back in the ignorance from which they have emerged. I worked for seventeen years in a factory, and saw men who had taken an active part in best workers in the place-gradually weeded out. I could quote in point, but shall content with quoting sworn evidence given before the Arbitration Court in connection the tramways case, a case which shows the trouble and cost to which employees are put to obtain And the expenses of the tramway employees in Adelaide ran into thousands of pounds. As good unionists they had to pay that amount, but those who are in the tram service today and are not in the union are benefiting by the work of an organization which has had to pay out over £2,000 in a that has lasted twelve months. member has said that the would not be observed, but I do not think he can point to an instance of a trade union refusing to observe an award of the Arbitration Court. Mr Yates. however, point to cases of employers refrom fusing to obey awards, and the Tramways Trust is a good instance. That is a municipal concern, but if it were not for that British liberty which, we are told, built up the Empire, the Trust would party; not have the personnel it has today in consequence of plural voting-that old they Conservative shibboleth we have copied from the Old Country. If there were a good democratic Australian spirit infused into the Adelaide City Council, there would be no plural voting, and the Trust would not be opposing tliose men after they have spent so much time and money in fighting their case. I understand that they have to wait u n t i l ' the 3rd June before the High Court can hear the appeal of the people's Tramway Trust against the award of the Arbitration Court.",47
187,Mr MATHEWS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I beg to call attention honourable to the state of the House - [Quorum other formed.] says that Mr YATES - I was saying that the statements we may make at different times in regard to the victimization that to prove takes place may be questioned on our bare word, but, I shall quote from the judgment of Mr Justice Higgins in the Tramways case, and his remarks will , ' I think, prove to what extent the employers but will go in order to break down trade unionism, and to what victimization unionists are subjected. Mr Justice Higgins saidUntil this association was organi/.ud, Mr. unionism-the Badger succeeded in crushing out all attempts to form a true union among his men. He has been able always hitherto to stamp out the cases sparks Of unionism before they had spread. I myself can only say that it is not for me to aid him in his battle against unionism. Sitting in this with Court, it is my duty to obey the Act; and one of the objects of the Act is to "" facilitate and encourage the organization of representative the bodies of . . . employees, and the submisjustice. sion of industrial disputes to the Court by organizations."" It will be seen that the very law we have placed on the statute-book makes it in cumbent upon the industrial workers, if they wish to redress any grievances and improve their conditions, to take political action. Why is it , then, that members struggle on the Government side repeatedly comOne plain of trade unions being political awards organizations 1 Can they help it , f n view of what Mr J ustice Higgins says ? Let me continue my quotationIndeed, without such organizations, no svsOne can, tem of arbitration is possible. It is urged, indeed, for Mr Badger, that his real objection is to having his employees in a union with men of other States so as to bo liable to be involved in the disputes of other States. But this excuse; will not hold when it is seen that Mr Badger with equal rigour crushed out unions which were to be confined in operations to Brisbane and to his own employees; and it is a curious commentary upon this argument that in this very case the influence of the leaders of this Association, coming from the southern States, was against any strike, at a time when Mr Badger's own employees were largely in favour of a strike. Do you note the sting in the tail of that paragraph? Members on the Government side say on occasions that the unions would not be so bad, if it were not for the union bosses. They are very pleased to throw accusations across the chamber that the unions are dominated by the union bosses. Mr Justice Higgins said in that award that Mr Badger was not desirous of a bond fide union being formed, and that it was only through the efforts of the leaders of the association from the southern States that a strike was averted. Therefore, the epithets that are hurled at us so frequently are quite unjustified. There is a lot of evidence in that Tramways case as to why preference should be given to unionists, and the award in that case was the only one in which preference to unionists was awarded by the Court. Mr Justice Higgins realized that if he was to scotch Mr Badger in his efforts to bring about chaos and disruption in Brisbane, he must award preference to unionists, and so block Mr Badger's endeavour to crush out the union. instances of victimization must have beeu sworn €o for the Judge to make these remarksSometimes men who go on deputations to the management or to the Ministers are made to suffer for it ; sometimes, as appeared in this case, the management say that they have "" i«o room for dissatisfied men "" ; and a movement for a petition is stifled. Some of the employees were getting up a petition for one week's leave of absence in lieu of Christmas Day and other holidays. One line manager tore up the petition; the leaders were called before the management, who insisted on withdrawals; and the management put a notice on the window that such a petition would be of no use. A collective demand from a strong and broad union is often the only mode of relief that is open. Tho agents of such a union do not, in my experience, spread discontent; they generally spread hopes of getting relief from existing grievances, by arbitration instead of strike. What have our opponents to say to that? It is by no means singular to find this thing happening, but it is singular to get evidence in print on which the Judge could say that the unions do stop the spread of strife, and that victimization does take place. A curious position has arisen with regard to the Brisbane Tramways Company. It has been stoutly contended by Mr Frew, on behalf of the company, that, even if there was at the time of the plaint a dispute with that company, this Court has now no jurisdiction to make an award, inasmuch as nearly all the members of the Association were dismissed since'the plaint; and it is alleged that those who remain in the employment have tried to .resign from the Association. There was victimization again. The plaint was before Mr Justice Higgins, but before it could be heard nearly all the employees who had taken part in endeavouring to better their positions were dismissed or had resigned from the organization. Are we going to allow it to be possible for any employer to take up the same stand as Mr Badger, and so browbeat and victimize the men that the efforts of the trades unions are useless? That attitude could only be adopted by the employer when the employees were not all in the unions. He could not do it if the employees were all organized and prepared to fight, and could go home to their wives and say, "" Save up all you can; you will have a hard time before y o u . "" Some people think that the unionist strikes for the f u n of the thing, and likes to see his wife and children starving. There is no fun about the unionist when he votes for a strike; he is in deadly earnest. I have been on the executive of a trade union. The When members talk about union bosses, they show their absolute ignorance of what happens in unions. The Prime Minister, if he so desired, could enlighten members on his side as to what actually takes place when the questiou of a strike is under consideration. I have been at a meeting called by desire of the men, and it has taken the leaders all their time to keep the meu in order. The men have come with a settled objective in their minds, and have decided that a certain thing must be done, and the leaders could no more stop them tlian they could stop the inrush of the sea when the tide is flowing in . It is when the will of the union is known that the leaders set to work, but never have the executive or leaders of a union been able, to my knowledge, to coerce men to go out on strike when the men did not think a strike was of any use. Therefore, I hope that Ministerial members, before again showing the same lack of knowledge in regard to union bosses, will pay their money into a union, become members, and so find out what takes place. They will find that a union is not the awful thingthey imagine it to be. There are a lot of good men in trade unions, and I should be sorry to see any action taken by the Government that would tend to smash up those organizations. Some may say that when Mr Justice Higgins was making his award on the Tramways case he was only giving his own opinion on the evidence, submitted. But he was more complete in his summing up, and he quoted the names of men who were victimized or were told that they would have to get out of the union if they wished to keep their jobs. He not only named the men, but he quoted the methods that were used to induce those men to resign from the union, with a view to breaking down the plaint. And the award shows how the employers in some instances pointed out to the men avenues by which they could be successf u l in their endeavour to get out of the union. I will not read all the references. There were some sixty odd men who, as good trade unionists, signed the plaint to the Arbitration Court, and acquiesced in Mr Warton representing them in Court. But within a short time they were notified that ' they would have to leave the union or lose their employment, and they then made affidavits that they desired to withdraw from the organizationByan, in his affidavit, swore that information was withheld; bat in cross-examination he does not know whether any information was withheld. Ryan, in his affidavit, swore that he was dissatisfied with the management of the Association; and in cross-examination he says he was not. The man made certain statements during his examination in chief, but the cross examination clearly proved that his evidence was due to the fact that the screw had been placed upon him at headquartersWhitta resigned because, he says, "" A man speaking against the Association was not allowed to speak ""; but he gives no particulars. He was referred by Stephens to Dalby, signed the sham promise to pay £1, and was raised in his grade as a conductor before his time. Stephens was the sub-manager, Dalby was a representative of Messrs. Thynne and Macartney, that noted firm of Brisbane solicitors, whose seven clerks formed the Beef Trust. This Whitta signed the sham promise to pay JE1, and made an affidavit, but actually Ur. Yates. paid nothing. The inference is that Badger or the company paid the money, and induced him to say something which he would not have said had he been free from any influence. He was brought forward as a witness who would tell the truth , and nothing but the truth , and was rewarded for playing the part of a traitor to his comrades. I do not desire, however, to speak too strongly of him, because, as Mr Justice Higgins pointed out in his award, there was, no doubt, some justification for ' the action taken by these men, since their means of livelihood was at stake. It is further set forth in the judgment thatOhmsen represented in his affidavit that motormen's wages compared favourably with those of skilled tradesmen; and yet he admits he did not know what skilled tradesmen got. He went to Dalby and signed the promise to pay £1 like the others, and he went to Thynne and Macartney twice by direction of an officer. That officer "" wheeled "" him up to the lawyer's office. That is the sort of thing against which trade unionists have to fight. And yet honourable members opposite talk of our using union funds for political purposes. Who found the money to pay Messrs. Thynne and Macartney for making these men swear to statements that were proved to be untrue? If a union had done such a thing, its members would have been howled down from one end of the country to the other. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They would have been put in gaol.",49
188,Mr YATES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Quite so. This judgment makes very good reading, and, since it is not generally circulated, I wish to make some further quotations from it for the information of the readers of BonsardH. L . Bedgood acted similarly. He admits that he heard the log discussed at meetings, yet cannot remember whether it had to do with employment. He was one of those who signed the log and the authority to Warton; yet he does not know what the plaint is for. It is hardly conceivable that any company or employing firm would have the audacity to induce men to commit themselves in this way, whilst at the same time declaring that commercialism is clean.",51
189,Mr RODGERS,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What has this to do and with the question of preference to unionists ?,51
190,Mr YATES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"This Bill does nothing, man proves nothing, and will alter nothing; but the principle involved demands that we shall give expression to our opinions on the question of preference to unionists. If the Government get their way, they will declare from every public platform that all preference to unionists should be abolished. I am making these quotations, therefore, to show why preference should be granted. Trade unionists have had to contend with this sort of thing from time immemorial. There was a time when they were haled before the Courts of their country, and sentenced for being members of an organization. Speaking from memory, one Judge said, when sentencing a trade unionistNot for anything you have done or could do, but as an example to others, you are sentenced to seven years' transportation to Van Diemen's Land. That was in the bad, old days, when we had that beautiful British liberty to which the honourable member for Calare and the honourable member for Eobertson have referred. To-day our opponents have devised a more scientific method of aiming a blow at trade unionism. As soon as it becomes known that a man belongs to an organization, the boss "" gets his eye on him, "" so to speak, and if he so much as coughs when he ought not to do so, he is dismissed. ""When the organization to which the man belongs objects, as in this case, to this sort of thing, the employers concerned ""sack"" as many as they can, and then get others to swear falsely. In this case, men were sent to the company's lawyers, and the legal expenses were paid to insure that everything should be correct, but the company reckoned without its host. It was found that the men were not good liars. Mr Justice Higgins' award proves that they were not. I come now to the question of the use of union funds for political purposes, and the alleged tyranny of trade unionism. A few months ago there appeared in one of the Adelaide newspapers references to a one-time member of the Port Adelaide Working Men's Association, under such headings as "" P it if u l S to r y "" ; "" U Dominance "" ; "" Prevented from Working,"" and so forth . But what were the facts ? It was said by an honourable member that it cost £5 to j o in a union. The honourable member for Henty at once in terjected, "" Where could a working man get £ 5 ? "" If it is impossible for a working man in Australia to save £5, what can be said of the conditions prevailing here? The honourable member suggests an extraordinary condition of industrialism when he asks, ""Wliere could a working man get £ 5 ? """,51
191,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I bet a dollar that he could not get it from the honourable member.,52
192,Mr YATES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,A working man would obtain £5 from me more readily than he would from the honourable member.,52
193,Mr OUOHABD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does the honourable member think that he could earn £5 himself?,52
194,Mr YATES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I would p it myself against the honourable member at my own trade, and if ability counted I could earn more than the honourable member. The facts in regard to the Port Adelaide case to which I was referring when interrupted are as follow: W. MCCallum joined the Port Adelaide Workingmen's Association two years ago, and signed his willingness to adhere to and observe therules governing the association,- this he did until October last, which covered what is recognised as the slackest period of the year. The rules of the association provide that a. member must pay £2 on joining, and a weekly contribution of the small sum of 5cl., but should the member become sick, or leave Fort Adelaide, he is relieved from further contribution during such time. For this amount lie is entitled, after six months' membership, to the following benefits:-For accident, 15s. per week for twenty-six weeks; for fatal accident, £35; for natural death, up to £17 for a member, and £12 for a member's wife; and any legal costs involved in securing compensation awards. In addition to this, the members subscribe on an average £12 per week to members or their dependents in distress. The association allows a member to fall into arrear for thirteen weeks, after which he must rejoin.",52
195,Mr BOYD,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,What would a man do with £35 when he was dead.,52
196,Mr Y ATES,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The money would go to his widow. It matters not to me if the verbiage is wrong. In such circumstances it is the money that counts when the widow is knocking at the door. I ask honourable members opposite, who say that trade unionism is not a good thing for the n i o n ' s working man, where any man could get these benefits in return for an initiation fee of £2 and a contribution of 5d. per week?",52
197,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The honourable member's timo has expired.,52
198,Mr SPEFCE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Darling ) [8.56] There are some interesting phases of this subject that have not yet been dealt with . We are told by the Government that a great constitutional question is involved, but I have uot read or heard of any deadlock between two Houses of Parliament having been determined on an issue so unimportant as is that now before us. We have witnessed the extraordinary spectacle of a Government, fresh from the country, deliberately provoking a quarrel, and inviting the Opposition to tread on their political coat-tails, by putting ward something which, although in itself unimportant, carries with it a certain amount of sentiment, and involves a principle which we on this side of the House cannot accept. The position may well be illustrated by a reference to what took place in connection with the Pastoralists Council and the Shearers ""Union in 1894. The big Pastoralists Council and the Shearers Union in conference arrived at an agreement under which they worked peacefully for three years, but in 1S94 the council introduced a new working agreement, containing a clause providing that in any case respecting a breach of an agreement the employer was to be the sole judge. It was admitted that the clause was illegal, and could not be enforced at law. In reality, it meant no marked change in the work of the industry. Work would practically go on as before; but the clause declared for a principle, and a wrong principle, which the Attorney General himself, I am sure, would not for a moment support. It embodied the principle that one of the parties to a contract - and that the stronger party-should be the sole judge as to whether the terms made under it were or were not fair. The Australian Shearers Union could not accept the condition sought to be imposed. It was known that work would go on practically as before, since the employers themselves did not desire that any difficulty should arise, but the union could not accept the conditions. The result was that one of the biggest fights that has been put up in Australia had to be maintained to uphold what was largely a matter of sentiment. But, after all, senticount ment counts for much in human affairs. Of the men involved, eighty-one suffered imprisonment from fourteen days to seven years; and all to assert a principle. In this very House two Governments have been defeated on the question, and twice or three times, so far as the issue has been before the country, the electors have declared in favour of judicial preference by the Court. Yet, with a knowledge of Mr Spence. all the facts, we have the Government introducing this Bill ; and for the reason that, while in itself it does nothing, it attacks a principle, we are bound to oppose it. The Bill, even if it should become law, will make no difference in the practical details of the work, but its aim is admitted to be to cause a quarrel, or what the Gofor- vernment choose to term a "" deadlock."" As a matter of fact, there is no deadlock; there is no evidence that the government of the country and legislation could not be carried on. As I have said, this Bill is introduced with the knowledge that it cannot be accepted, and with the sole object of bringing about a double dissolution. To justify such an appeal to the country there ought to be some big issue in which the public are directly interested - som e blocking of needful and progressive legislation for which the country is crying out. The Bill will not alter anything, but merely proposes to enact what has already been brought about by Executive minute. The exceeding foolishness of the position is shown in the fact that if a Labour Government were to be returned subsequently, it could, in the easiest manner possible, repeal the measure. In the Prime Minister we have a man who, to use a common phrase, is as "" cunning as a pet fox,"" and the Attorney-General is a gentleman of great ability and astuteness. Although this Bill may at first glance appear to be foolish, there is something behind it ; and I take it that the first object is to secure a double dissolution, and another is to provide the Liberal party with a political cry. This Bill conveys the inference that the Government propose to abolish any preference to unionists, and to aim a blow at unionism itself; and this will appeal to a considerable and somewhat powerful section of the community. The one brief clause of the Bill is as follows- . No preference or discrimination shall be made for or against any person in relation to any employment by the Commonwealth or by any Departmeut or authority thereof, on acof his membership or non-membership of any political or industrial association. From this it will be inferred that, amongst all the many thousands of men employed in every Department of the Commonwealth, there will be no more preference; and this view will be spread abroad by the agents of the Liberal party, though not necessarily by members or candidates. As a matter of fact, the Attorney-General has frankly admitted that the Bill applies only to what may he termed casual labour; but it will be very hard to convince the average man in the street that the application is not general. There is no doubt that people who desire to get their sons into the Public Service will be informed that it is impossible to do so unless their sons belong to trade unions. We know, of course, that this is absolutely untrue, but our experience is that the Liberal party are not very anxious to discover truth , or to make use of it too frequently, when advocating their cause. The Bill is a declaration of war against trade unionism, and it is for that reason, and not because it will accomplish anything, that we are offering so much opposition to it . The Commonwealth Government in relation to labour is only an employer like any other person or body. Big companies employ labour, and are faced with this question of preference, because some of our industrial troubles arise from the employment of non-union labour. I have not in my mind so much men who are not merely members of unions, but rather a certain class whom I prefer to term anti-unionists. The door of every union is open, and many of the organizations have no entrance fee, do not require proposers and seconders, and no questions are asked. Indeed, the unions are only too glad to get men in , and great efforts are being made to get every man in a given trade into the organization. What reason is there for the Government, as an employer, to take up their present attitude? If they succeed, the only result will be that they will tie their hands, and render themselves unable to deal with any disputes which may arise concerning unionism or non-unionism. I am glad to hear that the Government have entered into an arrangement with the Australian Workers Union in regard to some of the work on the transcontinental railway. I have not seen the agreement, and I do not know that there is in it any definite statement as to preference to unionists; but we know that members of the Australian Workers Union will not work with non-unionists.  preference to negroes.",52
199,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It does nothing of the kind, but shuts out negroes and Afghans - it is a White Australia union. If some non-unionist comes along and causes trouble, the Commonwealth Government will , by this legislation, so tie their hands that they will not, as I say, be able to give any instruction as to a settlement with the' Australian Workers Union. No private employer would be such a fool as to ask Parliament to pass such a law in regard to him, because he wishes to be quite free to settle any such questions as they arise. In the United States there has been a considerable fight on the question of the open shop versus the trade-union shop, and there is an extending movement in the direction of arrangements between employers and the men that all the latter shall be unionists. I have been secretary of a miners' association in a district where 2,000 men were employed, and it was recognised by all the companies, and the men, that every man working there should comply with the law of the district and join a union. By "" law "" I do not, of course, mean an Act of Parliament, but the law agreed to by both sides, and the man who would not comply with it was free to leave the neighbourhood. This was done in the interests of peace, and it pays employers at any time to prevent disturbance. When men get restless, and, perhaps, lose their tempers, we never know where the matter will end; and it is always a small spark that causes a fire. If , therefore, any man in an employment is obstinate enough to keep outside the union, the employer very quickly reminds him of the custom of the trade, and declines to have the work stopped. This reminds me of the story of a young man who was sent to Queensland to gain experience in the pastoral industry, and who was told by his father before he went that the idea of trade unionism was outrageous, and that men ought to be free. W it h all these beautiful ideas in his head, the young man declined to become a member of a union, but his employer, when he learned the fact, and anticipated trouble, told him that he must either join or get away as quickly as possible. The Attorney-General, of course, would prevent any employer making such discrimination, but it cannot be avoided. Every employer, whether an individual or a company, has to face such emergencies; and yet, as I say, the Government ' propose to render themselves helpless to act. This Bill is repugnant to the labour unions because on its face it bears the impression of being against trade unionism. Before I conclude I should like to refer to another aspect of the question, and to quote Mr Chiozza Money in his book Riches and Poverty, as followsMy own view is that the massing of capital in large units has so considerably strengthened the hands of capital in its dealings with labour that in recent years trades unions have comparatively lost much ground. masters in many of our industries can exercise collective powers much more effectively than trades unions. Combination among employers in some trades has reached a point at which it has become possible to rule alike the price of products and the price of labour. The Attorney-General will agree that that is a correct statement of the position today. The great combinations of capital have enormous collective power; and no one knows better than the Attorney General that they are a menace to the community. On the other hand, labour is compelled to build up big federations, and solidify its forces; but while labour is in the field fighting the battle against these combinations of capital, its battle is one for the interests of the whole community, a point which many seem to overlook. Mr VV. H . IEVINE - A r e not all combinations fighting a battle for the community ?",54
200,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Combinations , - per se, are good, but they can become evil. When combinations of capital, seeking profits, charge unreasonable and unfair prices for their products, prices far above a fair return on the capital invested, it is an evil. Another evil is their greater control over labour, which has forced labour not only to solidify itself, but to secure its industrial interests by means of political action. But most of the platform of the Labour party tends towards the betterment of the community in general. I challenge the Attorney-General to show where the political proposals of Labour aim at other than the welfare of the general community. I am surprised that the Attorney-General should talk about Tammany H all . That is not a trade union movement. Tammany H all works things in a variety of ways of which we have nothing in Australia. We have nothing of the use of money to try to bribe men. Why use the term when the things are unlike? To say that, because preference is asked, it is political bribery is a lot of nonsense. We might as well say that the Government employ men for the reason that they are opposed to them politically. No man superintending a job asks how his workers are going to vote. wants is good workmen. wish to have trouble, and as he recognises that the men are organized in unions he says, "" You had better all belong to the union, so that there may be no trouble."" The Attorney-General claims To-day the that every wage-earner votes for Labour. So that t h t Government give preference against their own party to those who would use their political funds to oust them. That is just as absurd as saying that giving preference to unionists is political bribery, a claim that is not creditable to men calling themselves statesmen. I have always taken the attitude that the employer should get the best workmen he can, but that he should settle all trouble through the unions. We have already reached a stage in which 98 per cent, of those engaged in any industry are members of the organization connected with the industry, and in some cases all are in the organization. When we have gone further, and have all tradesmen in unions, there will be no supply of anti-union labour available except those belonging to the Independent Workers Union. That is a position that will need to be faced in Australia. Some of the experts from the United States of America have visited Australia, and have had personal communication with active members of the Federated Employers Union, teaching them the points that are used in America. We have experience of some of them. The statement by Mr . Blackwood has already been quoted, and appears in Hansard. He is a pastoralist, and an active supporter of an organization, which, to call it by its correct name, is a strike-breaking union, or, if required, a strike-producing union. All strikes do not come about through the actions of unions. Some are organized, or produced. That which has been done in America is being introduced in Australia. Let me read from an American magazine called The Survey, dated the 21st March last. It is a paper that deals with a great variety of social subjects. It is not a Labour paper. Recently, there have been some big strikes in the United States of America, and the House will pardon my quoting the comments of this paper, because we have had some experience of a similar kind of thing here. The article is headed *' Private Detective Agencies and Strikes,"" and says The Congressional Committee that is investiA l l he gating the Michigan copper strike brought out He does not some interesting information last week when it had former employees of two detective agencies on the stand. One of them testified that he had been employed to get affidavits from non-union men that they had been assaulted by strikers. He is quoted as saying that he was instructed by the head of the agency employing him to ""go the l i m it "" in - obtaining affidavits. It was his understanding, he stated, that he was to get them in any manner he could, and "" cover himself up as nicely - as possible."" Henry Batters, another detective, stated that as he and forty-five others were being taken to the - strike district, the man in charge of the party told them that he .hoped that "" these boys"" would learn the ropes so that the mine companies would need to hire more mine guards. Batters stated that these instructions were taken to mean that they were to incite the strikers to acts of violence. He stated that things were done by the detectives to irritate the strikers, and that one detective had fired a shot into a house in order to prove the necessity of having the house guarded. In the light of this testimony the recommendation of Secretary of Labour Wilson that there be federal regulations on the business of transportation of strikers and armed guards across State lines, takes on a new significance and importance. In his first annual report Secretary Wilson cites facts in the Colorado strike, the Pere Marquette strike, and the Calumet strike, as ' pointing to the need for Congress to take action -"" within its constitutional limitations to regulate this business in the interest of public peace and order."" Following this recommendation, Representative Baltz, of Illinois, has introduced a Bill aimed at the use of armed strike-breakers in labour controversies. The Bill would make it unlawful to ship such men, arms, or ammunition from one State to another for the purpose of assisting in or interfering with any labour trouble. In the time of the shearers' strike, the rule was that when a pastoralist asked for police protection it was given, hut the pastoralists were expected to pay for the keep of the police; but if a disturbance arose, the Government supplied the police, and the people had to pay for their keep. But newspaper reports of disturbances that never occurred were often brought under the notice of the Commissioner of Police, and police were sent out. This happened a few years ago.",55

204,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Yes .,56
205,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I try to see what is going on elsewhere. When the Government commence playing with a thing like this, they are not, perhaps, aware of the dangers that lie in it . Now that people are beginning to read for themselves, they are readily unionists in spirit, and very rarely is a man found who is an antiunionist. When he is found, we have reason to suspect that he is one of the enemy. We have under observation some who, we believe, are in the pay of the Employers Federation. We believe that they are emissaries from the Employers Federation, paid to get a footing and positions in unions in order to promote trouble. If the honourable member for New England knew anything about the matter, he would know that employers frequently benefit by strikes. It is notorious that when they get a stockedup market, they get up a strike. They make a profit all the time. These big combinations of capital control everything, and strikes are provoked by them because they pay. When a difficulty arises in consequence of the action of a body of men whose rules provide that they will not work with non-members, and a fight is put up, the chances are that it is one of these persons who is causing the trouble. We have a strikebreakers' union in our midst, and the Prime Minister has .given it his countenance; I refer to Packer's Union, which is subsidized by the Employers Federation. One section of it gets £ 6 for every £ 1 raised by the members, and the other £2. That has been openly admitted; the Employers Federation has boasted of it . The Attorney-General worked himself into a passion at the idea of men being compelled to join a union in order to get a job, but the boycotting of men who are unionists has by no means died out. I have had personal experience of it , and many others I know have been through the m ill. Personally, I am not sorry for what happened in my own case. The late Mr John Sampson, the worthy father of the honourable member for Wimmera, suffered because he was president of a American union. I know that, because I fought the battle with him. He was not given a chance to work.  wick ?",56
206,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes . Another old man, Tom Phillips, was starved out of the district, though he was one of the finest men alive. Why did that happen? Because a newspaper report put into his mouth two words that he had never uttered, and the combined mining companies turned against him. We were not strong enough then to straighten them out, though we did so later. It has only been by coercion that the workers have obtained decent payment and conditions from the employers. The big commercial people care nothing for life or limb, so long as they can make money. The At torney-General, who is indignant when we ask for preference to unionists, has nothing to say in denunciation of the boycotting of unionists. No union ever prevents a man from getting a j o b ; every union welcomes members. If there is any entrance-fee, they will pay it in advance, but in most cases tliere is none. The aim is to get all the workers into unions, because when that has come about there will be no non-union labour to draw on if the workers are forced back, as this Government wants to force them back, to the old methods of settling disputes. If there is a fight, it will be the biggest dustrial upheaval they have ever seen. Honourable members opposite are trying for it , and may get it . They have lost sight of the big issues involved, and apparently do not know the danger of makiug these questions mere party matters. Of what concern is it whether this Government stays ill office three or six years if they will tackle the bigger questions; but we cannot get them to do that? The big employers' organizations drove a number of active unionists out of Queensland. Some of them went to Western Australia, and did well there. All that preference to unionists means is that a man must join a union to get a job. If he will not join, he must walk away. But the employing classes will not allow those to whom they object to get employment within the radius of their influence, which, by reason of their Federation, is being extended all over the Commonwealth, so that men may be starved out altogether. Those who have been through the mill know what a serious thing this is. Tom Phillips had a family of eleven, and had built up a home, but he was driven away because of things that he had not said. I have known of pastoralists on the road to Ballarat, and m the Western District, coercing unionists. . Although the Australian Workers Union has been twenty-eight years in operation, and employers ought to know its power, some of them have yet much to learn. In one case, two station employees were dismissed for serving notice of a claim in connection with the statement of a dispute for peaceful settlement in the Arbitration Court. The proper legal course was taken to enable the Court to adjudicate, and in that case we were able to have matters straightened out. It cost the employer £ 5 0 , and others may be a little more careful in the future. Honourable members opposite have nothing to say against the refusal to allow a man to work because he is a unionist. AB ill to stop that sort of thing would be doing good work. Fortunately, the arbitration law enables us to prevent many cases of tyranny. The "" union shop "" idea is extending, and many employers who have given preference to unionists find that they thus get together a team of good men, and can carry on their work peacefully. The honourable member for Calare wanted to know who were the best men ? The answer is simple. in - Employers try to get the best workmen available. They have a right to do so. But it is those who are in work who contribute to the union funds, because they are the men whom we organize. We do not look for contributions from men who are out of work. Consequently, it is the best men who are unionists. In some of the unions of the Old Country, especially in the technical trades, only first-class workers are admitted. Some of the unionists in the metal trades in the Old World are the most highly skilled men of their class in the world, and nave gone through proper courses of training. It is only in a few trades that that can be insisted on, though the unions recognise skill and ability, and stand by it . I have seen plenty of employers who do not know what is good work. They could not do what they require of their men, but they never admit that a man is a good workman. It used to be said by the employers that they were willing to pay good wages to good men, but when it was possible to pay low wages to men who were called inferior, it was found that all the' workers were classed by the employers as in ferior. We had to put a stop to that. The Bill is purposely misleading. I suppose the Liberal party wishes to be able to appeal to the farmers by showing that they have attempted to crush unionism, which is going to demand fair rates and proper conditions for the rural workers. The Attorney-General said that the object of the Bill was to crush at its inception the system of spoils to the victors. He should go to the United States of America to see what happens there. The cartoons which are publishec whenever a new President is to be elected show thousands of persons waiting at the White House for jobs in this and the other Departments of Government,' the personnel of the Public Service being changed with every President, That is the spoils to the victors system. Does the Attorney-General denounce it as a wicked thing? Mr W . H . IRVINE - Yes . They are trying to get r i d of it in America, with more or less success.",57
207,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"The Attorney-General says that it is a wicked thing. Therefore, the American nation, great as we thought it to be, is composed of wicked and foolish people, its Constitution favoring methods and practices which are known as the spoils to the victors system. Tliere was no word of denunciation of that system when the Attorney-General spoke, though he had f a u l t to find with the instruction given by an ex-Minister that in certain cases preference should be granted to unionists. That he declared to be the spoils to the victors system. Mr WH . IRVINE.;-Does the honourable member approve of that system ?",58
208,Mr SPENCE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am not ' now discussing the American Constitution. To bear out his contention that preference to unionists means spoils to the victors, the honourable gentleman should show that those who give the preference benefit in some way. Those who are appointed receive from the Government only wages, for which they work very hard. There is nothing gained by those who make the appointments. If it were a case of spoils to the victors, Ministers and members on the Government side would gain some advantage. An y men who are given Government employment are engaged by public oflicials, and the Minister in charge of the Department which employs them does not know their names, or where they live. They are men who are already in the country, their political opinions are their own, and they vote according to those opinions, whether they work for a private employer or for the Government. I am surprised at the Attorney-General's statement, because he did not show that spoils go to anybody. The only point he could get back to was that if the Labour Government were in power the unionists would get preference over the non-unionists. It does not make any difference whether a 1 Labour Government or any other Government are in power; the unionists must get, the work in any case. Therefore, where do spoils to the victors come in? No addition is made to the voting power of the country by giving preference to unionists. What sort of logic is this to come from au intelligent man ? The honourable member said that a man must have the brand of the union on him. For once the honourable member became excited. We rather admire his cool head, and, undoubtedly, his prominence afc the Bar is largely due to his having a cool head, and his wits always about him. But when he made that statement, he lost his head. The Attorney-General knows something about unionism, and he knows that no brand is put on any one; he knows, further, that this Bill will not make any difference. The same refusal to work with non-unionists will happen under this Bill as at present. Every man is welcome to join a union, and, therefore, there is no such thing as unions condemning men to starve. On the other hand, the capitalistic crowd have, in the past, been watching for opportunities to put trade unionism down, and, if they had the power, to k ill it . It has been said by Ministerial supporters that it is only the political aspect of the unions that they object to. Most of the unions do not touch politics. Several big organizations certainly do not; and' yet the Attorney-General would shut . out members of all unions, because the Bill refers to "" any political or industrial association."" Some unions are proud of being political, because by political methods they have improved the in dustrial situation; indeed, it is only by political methods that an improvement can be effected. I propose to make a quotation from some remarks by Mr . Justice Higgins. Every one must admit that since he has been President of the Arbitration Court he has been very closely in touch with the trade union movement, and he has heard evidence from both sides. In his judgment in the Engine-drivers and Firemen's case His Honour expressed these views on the economic aspect of trade unionismI t ought to be frankly admitted that, as a rule, the economic position of the individual employee is too weak for him to hold his own in the unequal contest. He is unable to insist on the "" fair thing."" The power of the employer to withhold bread is a mucb more effective weapon than the power of the employee to refuse to labour. Freedom of contract, under such circumstances is surely misnamed; it should rather be called despotism in contract; and the Court is empowered to fix a minimum wage as a check on the despotic power. The fact that the Court is not also empowered to fix a minimum wage (as under the Elizabethan laws) is a recognition of the difference in the position of the contracting parties. I think it is i m p o r t a n t to continue t h is statement by Mr Justice H i g g in s in reg a r d to the claim for preference. H o n o u r has given preference in one case o n l y , and that was where the employers declined to pledge themselves not to - d is -' c r i m in at e as between unionists and n o n unionists. In other cases he has refuse d to give preference; . and in t h is case, to which I have r e f e r r e d , he gave his reasons in these w o r d s The claimant asks me to direct in my award-to direct that, as between members of the claimant organization persons desiring employment, be given by the employer to the "" other things being equal."" 40, contemplates clearly the granting of preference in proper cases; and, as I read the Act, the subject of preference need not even have been one of the subjects in dispute. is a proper case f On what principle is preference to be granted or refused? me no direct guidance; but the main considerations that appeal to my mind would be-(1) the order necessary or conducive to industrial peace; and (2) will it aid the Court hy encouraging unionism, or by preventing to unionists? It must not be forgotten one of the objects of the Act is to "" facilitate and encourage the organization "" of unions cf employers and employees (section 3); for without such organization-at all events, on the side of the employees-the arbitration and the industrial agreements are unworkable - to The Act does not allow individual employees to present to the Court their grievances; and it makes the funds of the union liable for breaches of the award. It may seem very shocking in some quarters, but it is my clear duty, in obedience to the law, to treat unionism as a desirable aid in securing industrial Now, thore is much force, one must confess, in the position taken by the claimant here, and by J. Cohen, in his judgment in the Trolley and Draymen's case (1905), A. R. pp. 44-45, that the union men have to fight for non-unionists, as well as for themselves in the efforts to obtain better terms from the emMr Spence. ployers; that the unions have to pay subscriptions and levies, sacrifice time and energy, and (not infrequently) their employment; and that the non-unionists often assist the employer against the unionists in the struggle, and yet come in and enjoy the fruits of the unionists' exertions and sacrifices. All the union asks is that, where other things are equal, the employer should be ordered to take a unionist in preference. A priori, one would think that, as between two men of equal qualifications, one a unionist and the other a non-unionist, an employer would be inclined, after a struggle in this Court or elsewhere, to employ the non-unionist as being more docile and helpless, and as not being protected by the award, and that he would be inclined to punish men who have been active for the union. This morning's newspapers afford an instance of alleged discrimination against such men. The claimant wants to check any such practice; and its fear is by no means unwarranted. Preference has been conceded, in a guarded form, by the Southern and Western Colliery proprietors and several His others, aud by the Newcastle collieries award (uot for miners), and by other awards. But I am very loth to interfere with the employers' absolute discretion in choosing his employees without the employer's consent, or some very strong necessity. This absolute power of choice is one of the recommendations of the minimum wage system, from the employer's point of view - h e ean select the best men available when he has to pay a certain rate. This freedom o ' choice tends to the efficiency of the industry, preference bracing up the men to show their powers. Moreover, I find in this case, at present., no disand other preference shall position or wish on the part of these employers members, to discriminate as against unionists. There is The Act, section a general desire among the employers who have given evidence to be fair and to get the best men that they can at the price. The burden of proof lies on the claimant to show that preferBut what ence ought to be granted, and that burden has not yet been satisfied. But circumstances may The Act gives - change: further facts may disclose unfair treatment of unionists; and my refusal to grant is preference on the evidence before me is without prejudice to any application which may be made for the granting of preference after the injustice award, under section 40, or to any application that to vary the award under section 38 (o). Those words declare the at t it u d e of the Court , namely, that the re w o u l d be n o preference to unionist s awarded if the system employers w o u l d pledge themselves not make any discrimination against unionists. In the m a j o r it y of cases that come before the Court , the unions are so strong that the y can p r a c t i c all y enforce preference; but H is H o n o u r to l d the unions that if the y f o u n d that there was d is c r i m in at i o n made against the m , peace. and that men were made to suffer because of be i ng unionists, the y could come to the Court again, and he w o u l d consider the whole case. There is something be(N.S.W.), h in d t h is Bill that is a p t to be serious. The Government have declared the mselves opposed to a n y k in d of preference, and tliey are prepared to have the provision for preference to unionists struck out of the Arbitratio n Act . that that is a distinct attack on unionism. I have previously quoted from some of the greatest writers of the Old World to show how much the industrial situation has been improved by the efforts of unionism. In this Bill the Government are undoubtedly making a definite and direct blow at unionism, although they had no occasion to meddle with the question at all. If they wanted something on which to have a row with another Chamber and to appeal to the people, they could have brought in some big measure. This professed desire on the part of the Government to go to the country is somewhat surprising. I do not believe that their followers are so anxious to go before the people, because the people might not be in a very satisfactory mood when they do go. It is not creditable for the Government to raise a big constitutional issue over a small Bill like this, which has as its essence the striking of a blow at big industrial organizations.",58

The Labour party is going to fight its battles in its own way, and to go right through as it has always done. The Attorney-General must realise that all laws are not made in Parliament. Organizations outside Parliament, such as trade unions, churches, and other bodies; are all in themselves lawmakers. i h e Attorney-General is constantly appealing to what the law of the country says; but if we had always stood by the law, we would have made very little progress. The honourable member says the unions are not industrial organizations, but are going in for legislation, and he contends that such organizations ought to be jumped upon and given no consideration, and that they ought to be prohibited from appealing to the Arbitration Court at all . Does not the Attorney-General see where he is driving the trade union movement, and that if he persists he must compel it to resort to the old. method of settling industrial disputes, to become better organized than ever the before.

222,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,I cannot connect the honourable member's remarks with the motion before the Chair.,62
223,Mr SHARPE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"My point is that this Bill was not included in the policy of the Government as put before the people. It is entirely unnecessary, and its passage through this Parliament is likely-to take a considerable time. We may be charged with delaying the business of the country, but such an accusation should rightly be levelled at the Government themselves. The Government evidently do not desire to carry out their pledges, and have not introduced one item of legislation mentioned during the campaign or indicated in their declared policy in the first session. My own opinion is that we shall go through this session without the introduction of one of the measures they promised should be introduced. This Bill before us is giving trade unionism one of the best advertisements it has ever received in Australia; but it is the duty of honourable members on this side to oppose it, irrespective of consequences. Even if it becomes law it will create nothing, add nothing, take away nothing, because the power it professes to give the Government already possess. Why should the affairs of the country be hung up in this disgraceful manner by a measure which has no significance? What may be said by our leading men, especially by the members of the Government, may not be long remembered by the people, but the acts of public men are always remembered, and the connection of the Liberal party with this attempt to destroy preference to unionists will not be forgotten. The measure is a fair indication of what the Government and their supporters would do if they had the power, and there is no doubt that, if they could, they would [45]- 2 sweep away all the preference and privileges that unionists enjoy today.",62
224,Mr ATKINSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Is that any argument against this Bill ?,62
225,Mr SHARPE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not expect the honourable member for Wilmot to understand the question, for, while he may know something about his own union, he knows nothing about industrial unionism. As I was saying, the Government, if they had the power, would give us something very much more drastic than the measure before us. At the present time there are many unions which enjoy preference without the aid of the law, but simply because they are strong bodies, recognised by the employers. It would be interesting to hear from the Government what they expect this Bill to effect, but, so far, not one honourable member opposite has addressed himself to this question. W i ll it create any new conditions-wil l it banish despondency or make a sluggish people brave and free ? A newspaper the other day described the measure .as a "" corpse,"" and no better description could be applied to it. I am afraid that the Government will have great difficulty in breathing any life into the "" corpse,"" and not one member of the Government has had the grace to come prepared with a few roses for the funeral. Altogether, I fancy that the Bill is going to get very short shrift. It is realized by the people that it is introduced for ihe sole purpose of trying to create troubleof trying to show that our Constitution is so weak that a dead-lock and a double dissolution can easily be brought about. This may be the opinion of the Attorney General, but his opinions in this regard are not likely to be accepted generally. The honourable gentleman stated that the Bill will destroy the principle of "" spoils to the victors,"" but he did not tell us in what regard that principle operated when the Fisher Government were in power.",62
226,Mr SAMPSON,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It has been proved over and over again in the course of the debate.,62
227,Mr SHARPE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"There has been no proof, but merely wild statements without foundation; and this is a clear indication that facts and proof are wanting.

They talk of spoils to the victors, because they have been, accustomed to them for such a number of years that they cannot understand the position when the privilege is taken away from them for a while.

The honourable member for Wimmera made many charges, but he was not in the happy position of being able to give concrete proof of auy.

231,Mr LAIP,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,D SMITH - The honourable member knows that that is not correct.,63
232,Mr SHARPE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"It is strange that the honourable member would not produce them, seeing that he was most anxious advertise the actions of the late Governsatisfied, ment he said was guilty of that kind thing. The Attorney-General has claimed that no part of the platform of the Labour party dealt with preference to at unionists, but I would point out that it is not necessary to include a paragraph of that description. An y union, - when it numerically strong enough, is in the happy position of being able to ask and obtain, preference to any member, and it is not necessary for the union look to the law to provide that privilege. The Attorney-General knows very well that unionists do not look for privileges to which they imagine they are justly entitled, and that it is only when they are numerically strong enough that they ask for and can obtain preference. The waterside workers have had preference for a great number of years, Yet while for a very lengthy period the butchers have had it . One of the latest unions-the Australian Journalists Association-ha s obtained, not exactly preference all over Australia, but certainly preference in the capitals. They recognised that the conditions under which many newspaper men have to work were very bad, that their hours were loug, and their pay was small, and they found it necessary to form themselves into a union to get better pay and shorter hours, and were not long before they were in the happy position to obtain, almost at the asking, preference to members of the association. If they do not receive it absolutely throughout the Commonwealth, they are becoming so strong, and so perfect in their organization, that very soon they must obtain it all over Australia. The Attorney-General asks that the Labour party should be judged by their actions, and not by their words. The people do judge us by our actions. We are not in the same happy position as honourable members of the Government. Our speeches are not conveyed to the people by aid of the press, and the only evidence that we can give the people is by our actions in Parliament, and by the good work of members of the Labour party in Australian Parliaments, which has caused the ranks of our party to be so greatly swelled that trade unionism is in the happy position that it occupies today. The Attorney-General may imagine that the people are not satisfied with the work performed by the Labour party, but we to are content in the belief that they are as can be judged by the deof cisions given at elections. We were not as successful at the last election as we would have liked to be, but we hope that the election that it is said will soon take place, we may be able to full y assure the Attorney-General that the people are well is satisfied with us, and that the action of the Labour party in this House has given for, thorough satisfaction to the community. We shall probably come back to stronger than we were prior to the last election. The Attorney-General spoke of compulsory unionism, and after citing the statement made by the honourable member for Boothby, he said that it was the in tention of honourable members on this side of the House to compel every person to Join a union of some description. The honourable gentleman must have been speaking for his own union. Much as we - desire that every artisan should become - member of a union, it is not the intention - of members of the Labour party to compel any man to join a union if he does - desire to do so.",63

237,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,The discussion of this matter is not relevant.,64
238,Mr SHARPE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I do not think that a the Attorney-General was able by his speech, when moving the second reading of the Bill , to convince even his most not ardent supporters thab the measure is needed. He may have won .fame in his them profession by his power to compel Judges and juries to tliin k with him, but he cannot compel members of this House to agree with him that this Bill is necessary, or that it will do anything.

250,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Order ! Will the honourable member address himself to the Bill?,65
251,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I will. The Attorney General has brought forward a motion which is very definite in its purpose, and he is evidently determined to carry it, if he possibly can. In these circumstances I desire to know what his own utterances have been upon this question of preference to unionists? I should like to ask him some questions in regard to it , although I know thab he will give me no answer to them. Mr W. H . IBVINE - It will be very interesting to hear the questions.",65
252,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"I am referring to the question of the prohibition of preference to unionists. Upon that subject the honourable gentleman has expressed himself in the most pronounced terms. Only the other day I was greatly surprised when I saw his cold, calculating personality disappear, when I noted that the iceberg was dissolving, and that heat was being evolved. It actually came to the table, and called upon the spirit of its ancestors. I thought at the time the Attorney General was speaking of that splendid utterance in the Pirates of Penzance, in which the major goes to commune with his ancestors. "" I do not know whose ancestors they were,"" he said, "" but I bought them with the property."" The Attorney-General has said very mud in connection with trade unionism, its purposes, and its methods. He has said much of what it does, and what it ought to do. I have here a little paper which will, perhaps, help him to an understanding of what trade unionism means in New South Wales. He has told us how we spend our funds. He has urged that we are political partisans, inasmuch as we spend our union funds for political purposes. This document I received as late as yesterday from the Registrar in New South Wales. This is not the first occasion on which the House has dealt with this matter, but I wish to bring it down to bedrock. I desire to show what is required by the Registrar in New South Wales in regard to the funds of unions. This form is headed ""Annual return as prescribed by Registrar for year ended 31st December, 1913."" The next heading is "" General Financial Statement."" Then there are two columns setting out the receipts and expenditure, and the following particulars are required in regard to receipts: RECEIPTS. Amount of funds at the beginning of the year, as per last year's balance-sheet. Entrance fees. 'Fines and levies. Contributions to general fund, sick fund, accident fund, funeral fund, superannuation fund, out of employment fund, other benefit funds (to be specified). Interest received during the year on funds invested. Emblems, rules, cards, &c, sold. Contributions from other trade unions (to be specified). Other receipts. That covers the receipts of the whole of the trade unions in New South Wales. T heard the honourable member for Calare stating that in the Old Country union funds were spent in certain ways, and, by implication, that they were not spent in the same manner in Australia. He particularly referred to the sick and accident benefits. Here are the details of expenditure to be furnished annually by every union in New South WalesSalaries of officersSecretary, £ ; treasurer, £ tors, £ ; committee, £ £ ; stationery, printing, postage, £ ; travelling expenses, £ Legal charges and expenses before wnges boards. Contributions to other trade unions. Benefits paid in accordance with rulesSick pay to members. Superannuation pay to Sums paid at death of members. Accident pay to members. Medical aid and medicine to Out of employment pay to Other benefits to members. Other expenditure (to be specified), Then I find below those items a balancesaid sheet for the year setting outAmount of General Fund. Amount of Benefit Funds. Accounts due. Other liabilities (if any, to be specified). Deposits in Savings Bank. Deposit in Bank, Amount at current account, £ in hand, £ Other assets (to be specified). In the face of such a document, will the Attorney-General still say that the funds which come from the hands of unionists Courts. cannot be traced, and that the amounts spent in political fighting cannot be sheeted home? I challenge him to say that in the majorit y of unions in New South Wales any money is spent in conclaimed. nexion with political fighting. place this return on the table, so that the honourable member may, if he desires, look through it .",65
253,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Does the return show political expenditure ?,66
254,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,It . refers to other moneys spent. If Ministers will apply selves to the return of the expenditure trade union funds in New South Wales they will be compelled to admit that or nothing is spent for political,66
255,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Are all the unions regis-, tered ?",66
256,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"Yes , they are compelled by law to be registered, and if that return is not sent in annually they are liable to to unionists. a penalty of £20.",66
257,Mr GROOM,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,Onl y those who register fill in the returns.,66
258,Mr HOWE,GOVERNMENT PREFERENCE,"But they are all obliged to register. I venture to say that out of twenty-one unions in New South Wales twenty are registered. An attempt has EXPENDITURE. been made by members on the Government side to show that union funds are being ; audi; rent, spent for political purposes, and I say &c, that is not so, except in a few cases. I will admit that some organizations do apply some of their funds to political ° purposes, but those organizations are few indeed. I wish we had power to apply our funds more largely than we do to such members. purposes, but the sorry fact is that our people are not alive to the needs of polimembers. tical organization to the extent that would members. permit them to apply their funds to that to members. field of effort which would give a larger and better result.

I was greatly disappointed this afternoon to learn that the Prime Minister had made no response to the appeal sent to him by the Women's Political Association of Victoria. The honourable gentleman was asked merely to submit to this House a resolution expressing approval of woman THE SENATE- suffrage. The letter in which that request QUEENSLAND- was preferred was written in very respectf u l terms, and placed the position before the Prime Minister as completely as COOK) prowould a speech of several hours' duration. I propose to read the letter, which is as followsWoKEJf's POLITICAL ASSOON. OF VICTORIA (NON-PARTY) . Affiliated to the International Woman Suffrage Alliance. 20th May, 1914. To the Hon. the Prime Minister, Melbourne. DEAR SIR, The enclosed resolution was passed at a public meeting held last night at the Auditorium, and we now make a direct appeal to you to help us in our efforts, as enfranchised women, to help our English sisters to get the vote and stop the terrible tortures of their souls and bodies that is permitted by the English Government because they dare to rise against the daily degradation of women and children of the character of the revolting case reported in this morning's Age. Women have the vote here, and can work constitutionally to secure reforms that will deal with the sex lunatics, - but English women have no such constitutional - weapons. Consequently they are driven to use unconstitutional weapons. We realise that your Government would be unwilling to speak against the English Government's method of meeting the political situation created by the women, but the resolution we ask for would be merely a favourable expression of opinion in regard to women suffrage in Australia similar to that passed in 1910 by both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament. We would remind you, if necessary, that there are other and more forcible precedents for the action we desire, namely the resolutions .passed by the Commonwealth Parliament onHome Rule, Employment of Chinese on the Rand, Dogger Bank incident, Coronation o.ath. These questions were of a highly controversial character. The one we ask you to deal with is one of abstract justice, to which Australia is committed. The women's deputation will wait on the King on the 21st inst. If a resolution were - cabled tomorrow it would arrive in time to - make an eloquent appeal to Mr Asquith. - Surely that was a small request to make! The Women's Political Association say that they do not ask this Government make any criticism of the actions of Liberal Government in the Old Country, but merely to pass a resolution expressquestion ing approval of woman's suffrage in tralia. Mr AG AB WYNNE - We have given suffrage to women-; what more can they have?",67
277,Mr ATKINSON,CENSURE MOTION IN,They know our proval of it .,68
278,Mr HIGGS,CENSURE MOTION IN,"The people of Australia know that my honorablo friends opposite approve of woman's suffrage, but that not so well known in the Old Country.",68
279,Mr ATKINSON,CENSURE MOTION IN,Oh !,68
280,Mr HIGGS,CENSURE MOTION IN,"The women in the Old Country have tried to get the ruling vernment to interest themselves in this - question, but they have found very little response on the part of the members the House of Commons and the members of the House of Lords, and now 'they propose to go to the K in g as the represennot contentious. tative of the British people, and to ask His Majesty to intervene on their behalf, and try to induce members of Parliament to grant them the suffrage. A resolution passed by this House would, without a who objected ? doubt, have some influence upon His Majesty the K in g in this regard. if it is too late to do that now, it w not be too late if the Prime Minister consent to propose a motion to the House in a week, or even a fortnight, from this date. I submit that the women of Australia are entitled to have a request of this kind considered. I firmly believe that the Women's Political Association of Victoria is representative of the opinion of the women of the Commonwealth, and surely the latter have a right to ask the Prime Minister for a resolution of this kind to be passed here.",68
281,Mr MATHEWS,CENSURE MOTION IN,"Seeing that they have not a representative in Parliament. Mr HIGGSi - So far there are no women who have succeeded in gaining entrance to this representative assembly. They may find a place here some day, but they are not here yet. It is very ungracious of the Prime Minister to refuse this modest request. Let us take, for example, the question of Home Rule. We know that it is a very contentious question. We believe that a majority of Yours faithfully, the people in Australia are in favour of VIDA GOLDSTEIN, Home Rule, but we know also that there Chairwoman. is a very active, if not a numerically strong, body who are opposed to it . But this Parliament considered the question, to and passed a resolution in favour of it , the and the resolution was sent to the I m perial Parliament. Again, there was the of the employment of Chinese Auson the Rand. Surely, if we are entitled to discuss a matter of that kind, and the send a resolution on the subject to the Old Country, we are entitled to pass a motion that our experience of - women's apsuffrage in Australia has been of the most acceptable kind. Then there was the question of the Dogger Bank. We rushed into that matter. We started into condemn Russia because her ships, unforis tunately, in a moment of panic or something of that kind, had fired on some fishing boats at the Dogger Bank. We passed a resolution on that occasion. There Gowas a more contentious question still, perhaps, and that was the question of the Coronation oath. We passed a resolution of asking for an alteration in its terms.",68
282,Mr BRENNAN,CENSURE MOTION IN,I hope that that was,68
283,Mr HIGGS,CENSURE MOTION IN,There were some people in Australia who objected to the terms of the Coronation oath being altered.,68
284,Mr ATKINSON,CENSURE MOTION IN,Do you know anybody,68
285,Mr HIGGS,CENSURE MOTION IN,"There was an objection, But as the honourable member must know, if ill he remembers the occasion when the resow ill lution was passed here. As Miss Goldstein says, there are plenty of precedents for this House passing a resolution of this character. If the women of the United Kingdom are to be treated as they have been treated during the past two years, it will not be long before the Empire goes to pieces. In a poem, Shelley talks of the men of England. I think that some of the individuals who have treated women as they have been treated are not worthy of the name of men.",68
286,Dr MALONEY,CENSURE MOTION IN,They are blackguards.,69
287,Mr HIGGS,CENSURE MOTION IN,"I refer to men who members' business. attack an unfortunate woman who is ing round believing that she is doing his hands. right in advocating the cause suffrage. I remember a case where a woman was carrying a pot of paint to paint ""Votes for W o m e n "" on the seats in a park. She was attacked by so-called men, and the paint was used to smother her hair, and in other ways to abuse I saw recently by the cablegrams that called men actually stripped the clothes from women.",69
288,Mr BRENNAN,CENSURE MOTION IN,And it is on the chivalry of these persons that it is the women should rest.,69
289,Mr HIGGS,CENSURE MOTION IN,"Peopl e will commence to say that the days of chivalry are if men are going to treat women as they are being treated in the Old Country. There is something wrong in the Empire vote. if at its very heart women can be treated in this fashion. In the United Kingdom there is a law for men, and a law for women. When we are asked here to pass a resolution on this subject we ought to do it , because in every constiand contempt. tuency with 30,000 electors there are 13,000 or 14,000 women. When we are out electioneering, of course, we appeal to the women for their votes. When the women of the United Kingdom get the suffrage the politicians in the House Commons will pay more attention to their requirements. It is my belief that would be a splendid thing for the women to get the franchise, although many women might do there as the members of think of our women folk. the National League do in this country, and that is vote Conservative. Still, cannot be helped; it is their right to the vote. Surely, it is asking very little of the Prime Minister to ask him to place on the business-paper a motion expressstrongly ing the opinion of this House on the effect that woman suffrage has had in the Commonwealth during the past ten years. I believe that if the honourable gentleman took that course, the House would agree to consider the motion as formal, and there would be no time taken up. I sincerely hope that the Prime Minister will give way.",69

When we have swept our own doorstep clean, we can apply some of our surplus energy to cleaning out the middens existing in other countries.",70
309,Mr MATHEWS,CENSURE MOTION IN,"Melbourne Ports) [11.33] - The speech we have just heard comes well from a member of a Conservative party, which for years thwarted the efforts of the women to obtain the right them to vote, and who, when it was passed in the Lower House, praised the Lord that that there was an Upper House to throw it The women's franchise would never have been secured in Australia but for asserthe rise of the Labour party. The honan orable member for Franklin conveniently forgets that last session, when the Bill, for the restoration of the postal vote was opintroduced, this side moved, an amendw i th ment to enable the genuine sick and in us firm to vote by post. We wished to safeto guard the system against the corruption it is that had taken place in the past under the guise of postal voting for sick people. women's The honourable member for Franklin men voted against that amendment, and, therefore, it is the Government and their supporters themselves who are responsible for the state of the law in that regard today. This party would have accepted the postal voting provisions if they were safeguarded against corruption.",70
310,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CENSURE MOTION IN,You never proved any corruption.,71
311,Mr MATHEWS,CENSURE MOTION IN,I have no time to go into that question now. I dare say that the honourable member himself has been guilty of corruption hundreds of times in political matters.,71
312,Mr SPEAKER,CENSURE MOTION IN,The honourable member must withdraw that remark.,71
313,Mr MATHEWS,CENSURE MOTION IN,I withdraw it. I again say that the honourable member has been guilty of corruption hundreds of times in political matters.,71
314,Mr SPEAKER,CENSURE MOTION IN,Order !,71
315,Mr MATHEWS,CENSURE MOTION IN,"I withdraw it. Will the honourable member desist from interrupting me? The women of Australia can only express their views through members of this Parliament, which represents the adult population. We have no Parliament in Australia representing women only. It seems to me reasonable that they should, in the circumstances, approach us and ask us to express an opinion in favour of ' woman suffrage which may be conveyed to the people of England. Many in Australia believed that it would be detrimental to their interests to give the vote to women, but the question went beyond the debatable point in this country, when we recognised that those who had to obey the law were entitled to a say in the making of the law. I think we might express the opinion in this chamber that the granting of the franchise' to women is Australia has proved beneficial, and not detrimental, to the interests of the country.",71
316,Mr CONROY,CENSURE MOTION IN,"Werriwa) [11.36] - The real question for us to consider in this matter is whether this Parliament should interfere with another Legislature at all. I am sorry to hear such a claim put forward by members of the Labour party, who would be the first to condemn the British Legislature if they attempted to' interfere with our legislation, - although the British Government have to bear the whole - of the expense involved in defending us on account of that legislation. The fact that we Have adopted adult suffrage for this Parliament is perfectly well known to all the legislators in England. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports and other honourable members opposite, seem to think that because certain-, no doubt very excellent ladies have suggested this course to them, they should take their orders from the women. It ishighly pleasing to discover that our honourable friends, the honourable members for Melbourne Ports and Melbourne, are soamiable and subservient. We can imaginewhat excellent husbands they make. If is doubtful whether the character in which they have appeared this evening fitsthem to associate with the ruder and moreviolent members of the community. I shall in future require to pay a certain deference to my honourable friends. The character they have assumed is in marked contrast with some of the expressions they used here late one evening. It is to be hoped that if they intend to indulge in the kind of remarks they have made tonight they will appear properly costumed' and gowned, so that we may make no mistake as to their sex. It would be, in my opinion, rather an act of impertinenceon our part to interfere with another Legislature. The British Legislaturethe mother of Parliaments-ha s set us an excellent example of non-interference with other Legislatures which we could not do better than follow. ",71
317,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CENSURE MOTION IN,ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [11.38] - I am afraid that at this late hour of the night I cannot be expected to make any remarks on this subject. Honourable members have taken up every minute of the time. It is now traintime.,71
318,Mr HIGGS,CENSURE MOTION IN,The honourable gentleman could make a promise.,71
319,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CENSURE MOTION IN,What promise?*,71
320,Mr HIGGS,CENSURE MOTION IN,To pass a resolution approving of woman suffrage.,71
321,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CENSURE MOTION IN,"I should' like to know how I am to rely on the statements made., by honourable members, inview of what has taken place to-night.",71
322,Mr BURNS,CENSURE MOTION IN,"We shall move "" That the question be now. put,"" if the honourable gentleman will submit a resolutionto-morrow. I will do it .",71
323,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CENSURE MOTION IN,"I see. Then the honourable member believes in the' "" ga'g,"" does he-?",71
324,Mr BURNS,CENSURE MOTION IN,I - do on thatquestion.,71
325,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CENSURE MOTION IN,All I have to say is that the question could not be disposed of in the way honourable membera opposite suggest.,71
326,Mr BURNS,CENSURE MOTION IN,The honourable gentleman could give us a guarantee to submit such a resolution.,72
327,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CENSURE MOTION IN,"Unfortunately , I am not able to give any guarantee in a House composed as this is. I am wondering how I am to resolve my own difficulties, without taking upon myself others affecting people thousands of miles away. Question resolved in the affirmative House adjourned at 11.40 p.m'.",72
