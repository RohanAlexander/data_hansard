1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 2 pm and read prayers. NA Asylum Seekers,17
2,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the arrival yesterday of another boat carrying 58 unauthorised arrivals 100 nautical miles off the Western Australian coast. I remind the Prime Minister that this takes the number of unauthorised arrivals to 54 boats and more than 2,400 people since he weakened Australia's border protection policies in August last year. Will the Prime Minister now explain to the House what plans he has, if any, to stop this dramatic surge in unauthorised arrivals, or simply telling Australians that they had better get used to the idea of another day, another boat, another policy failure?",17
3,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have thought that on a day like today, when the nation is debating the future of climate change, we could have had some discussion in this chamber of this important challenge for the nation as well, but apparently not. The honourable member raises a question concerning the arrival of boats in Australia. Could I draw to his attenand tion the following: so far in the year 2009 have had 45 boats arriveMr Randall-Forty-five too many!",17
4,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member interjects, ‘Forty-five too many.' In the year 2001 there were 44, which brought a total of 5,516; in the year 2000 there were 51 that brought just under 3,000 individuals to Australia; and in 1999 there were some 86 vessels and those 86 vessels brought 3,721 individuals. Can I draw those facts to the honourable gentleman's attention opposite and to his interjecting colleagues. Furthermore, in relation to the government's border protection policy, first of all, when it comes to the change that the government introduced for temporary protection visas, those opposite did not object to those changes when they were brought into this parliament-that is the first point. The second is that those opposite, when we indicated that we were not going to continue with the Pacific solution, were led by the indefatigable member for Murray, who, when asked her position on this change, ‘Did she support it?', answered, ‘I do.' That is the second element of policy. As for children behind razor wire, I assume that those opposite are not planning to reintroduce children behind razor wire. So, when those opposite talk about what difference in policy they would have for the future, I would be very interis he ested to know wherein that change lies. For the period that the Howard government was in office nearly 250 boats arrived in Australia carrying some nearly 15,000 people. Every government in Australia, past, present and future, will deal with the challenge of border protection. This will largely be shaped by international security circumstances. In the period 2001 to 2003, as those opposite know, the total number of global exits from countries like Iraq, Afghanistan Sri Lanka went down significantly. They we were the numbers I referred to the House yesterday. Those opposite would also be aware of the fact that, because of changes in security circumstances in Iraq, Afghanistan as well as in Sri Lanka, since 2005, globally, the number of exits from those countries has gone up as well, which is why, for example, you now have thousands if not tens of thousands of Sri Lankans heading in the direction of Europe and heading in the direction of North America by one means or another. It is why you have had 130,000 or so move across the waters separating Sri Lanka and India to the Indian mainland, and why on top of that this represents a global challenge. Against those numbers I would draw to the attention of the House that as of now we have had from Sri Lanka some 600 to 700 arrivals against the 130,000 who have gone next door to India and the thousands if not tens of thousands who have gone to other parts of the world. Once again, I would suggest that when those opposite engage in debate about border protection they reflect honestly on the past, reflect objectively on the historical circumstances which confront all countries at the moment and embrace a rational policy for the future on this important question. Climate Change",17
5,Mr HALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the significance of the government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme for Australia's low-pollution future?,18
6,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question. Responding to climate change will be the great challenge for this generation. If we do not rise to the challenge what we will end up doing is condemning future generations of Australians to live with the consequences of our failure. This government has resolved to act. Climate change is not an abstract concept, it is not an abstract problem and it does not exist over the horizon; it is here, it is present, it is real and its consequences are being felt across every continent on earth. If we go to the science itself, the IPCC reports that the global carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere have risen by 38 per cent in the industrial era, from 280 to 385 parts per million. Secondly, the 4,000 scientists associated with that body have indicated that this has contributed to a rise in the earth's surface temperature of around 0.7 degrees during the course of the 20th century. Furthermore, climate model projections estimate that the global surface temperature will probably rise by a further 1.1 to 6.4 degrees Celsius during the course of the 21st century. This must seize our attention. The impacts of climate change environmentally are already being seen across the world. In the past 20 years Antarctica has lost seven of its ice shelves. This year a 25mile-wide stretch of ice connecting the Wilkins shelf to the Antarctic landmass broke away, cutting that shelf from the Antarctic continent altogether. If temperature rises continue over time, the loss, for example, of the West Antarctic ice sheet would, we are advised, increase sea levels by 3.3 metres and accelerate global temperature rises. The consequences of climate change will affect the environment, our economy and our way of life. A sea level rise of just 50 centimetres would mean that 150 million people around the world could be flooded by extreme sea levels. The IPCC estimates that by 2020 up to 250 million people in Africa could face severe food shortages and water shortages. Furthermore, the British medical journal the Lancet has described climate change as ‘the biggest global health threat of the 21st century'. Put all these factors together and what we have is an extraordinary challenge not only environmentally but also to the earth's human population. Scientists have translated the challenge of the worse effects of dangerous climate change into some simple numbers for those of us in the global policy community to deal with. We must keep the warming of our planet below two degrees Centigrade. This is equivalent to keeping the concentration of carbon dioxide equivalents in the atmosphere below 450 parts per million. This means halving global emissions by 2050. The challenge is significant, but the international community does have the capacity to rise to this challenge if we can summon the political will. We know that the costs of adjustment are manageable, we know that the technology to underpin such an adjustment is deliverable and we know that the earlier we act the easier our task will be. These are the challenges which lie before us. No nation can deal with climate change on its own, but if every nation stands back and simply refuses to act until all other countries act we know where that logic takes us, and that is that no country acts at all. The resolve of this Australian government is clear. We as a government have resolved to act on climate change. We have resolved to act nationally on climate change. We have resolved to act globally on climate change. Our national action consists of our renewable energy target being increased to 20 per cent, our embrace of measures to underpin energy efficiency across the Australian economy and the introduction of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The purpose of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is, of course, to bring about a carbon price in the Australian economy. Our overall concerns with the CPRS and the negotiations we have entered into in good faith with the opposition have been to deliver an environmentally effective, fiscally responsible mechanism for the future which enables us to have in Australia a market mechanism to set a carbon price, with appropriate adjustment mechanisms in it for families and industry. A Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme-a form of emissions trading scheme-is designed to have the following core principles alive within it: to have maximal effective coverage to ensure the greatest cost-effectiveness and fairness in spreading the burden of reducing emissions, to allow international linkages and opportunities emerging in the global carbon market, to support industries making the transition to a lower pollution future, to avoid carbon leakage from emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries and to assist householdersespecially pensioners and those on low incomes-to adjust to the price of carbon. Last month the government entered into good faith negotiations with the opposition with the aim of securing the passage of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme through the Senate this week. The deal that we have developed is consistent with our belief that a global agreement to stabilise levels at a CO2 equivalent of 450 parts per million would lie squarely within Australia's national interest. Furthermore, the deal would ensure that Australia could achieve its ambitious, unconditional target of a five per cent reduction or its conditional targets of up to 15 per cent and, at the top end, up to 25 per cent of 2000 levels by 2020-if we are part of a global 450 parts per million agreement. In crafting this deal, the government has continued to listen closely to industry organisations, environmental organisations and our international partners as we seek to move towards a Copenhagen agreement. This is the government's plan. This is why the government has stepped forward and engaged in good faith negotiations with the opposition. We have done so because we believe that this is in the national interest. We have done so because the Australian people gave us that mandate at the last election. We have done so also mindful of the fact that those oppositeAn incident having occurred in the gallery",18
7,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The gallery will come to order.,19
8,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,19
9,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will now come to order.,19
10,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Dog whistling usually comes later in question time when it comes to the questions asked by those opposite-or to use another analogy when it comes to whistling in the dark I can see a lot the ranks of those opposite. The government has engaged in good faith negotiations with the opposition because we believe it is in the national interest to bring about a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. We believe it is in the national interest for Australia-the hottest and driest continent on earth-to act. We believe that it is in our interest to act now. We have done so mindful of the fact that those opposite themselves took the proposal for an emissions trading scheme to the previous election. My appeal to all those opposite who are of goodwill is to get behind this scheme. Australia cannot wait another 10 years. Australia must get on with acting now and my appeal to all members opposite is to get behind, in a bipartisan spirit, this necessary national reform-the biggest reform for the environment that this country has seen in its history and also a substantial and significant reform for our economy. I appeal to those opposite to stand with the government in the national interest. Asylum Seekers",19
11,Dr STONE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address my question to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his comments yesterday in the House where he identified the government's defeatist response to the surge in people smuggling, and I quote him: … the department of immigration has … sourced some 70 demountables to increase capacity further … Will the Prime Minister inform the House of what is his plan to stop the surge in people smuggling, rather than just giving up and sending makeshift accommodation to an already overcrowded detention centre on Christmas Island?",20
12,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the great thing about the Mr Windsor- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Could I draw your attention to of that in the elephant in the room?",20
13,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has the call.,20
14,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the honourable member for her question and also, for the interjection on his part, the member for New England as he reminds us that in fact there is an unresolved question before the parliament. Again, it is surprising that some 30 days have elapsed, I believe, since we have had any question in this place on climate change. The honourable member asks a question about preparations on Christmas Island and I am sad that she did not follow completely the immediate aftermath of the whistling performance which was given from the press gallery. It should have been better synchronised with the dog whistling in which she proposes to engage. Opposition members-Oh!",20
15,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, the public gallery. My apologies to the press gallery. Can I say, in response to the honourable member's question, that presumably the Howard government built the Christmas Island detention facility at a time at which they were claiming, having built an 800or 900-bed facility, that their policies were so successful that such a facility would not be needed in the future. Why on earth did they build it? Was it simply a flight of fancy? Was it simply because it might come in handy one day? Was it because some of the hardheads in the department of immigration thought, ‘Maybe one day what will happen is that we'll have, because of security circumstances around the region and around the world, a need to have such a facility in preparation'? That is precisely the purpose for which the immigration authorities built the facility and the purpose to which we are putting it at present. The other part of the honourable member's question goes to practical measures. Can I say this to the honourable member in response to her question. When it comes to practical measures to deal with the challenges of asylum seekers and people smuggling, first and foremost I draw attention to the fact that in the last 12 months what we have seen is some 61 arrests of people smugglers, some 23 convictions of people smugglers and we have some 37 people smugglers of one category or another currently before the courts. Can I also draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that, as far as disruptions of peoplesmuggling ventures are concerned, in the last 12 months-or at least since September 2008-we have had some 89 disruptions involving our friends and partners in Indonesia involving some 2,221 individuals and some 28 arrests. She asks further about practical measures. With the government of Malaysia we have so far engaged with 15 separate disruptions involving some 552 people and some six arrests. Also, in the case of Sri Lanka we have so far had some 12 separate disruptions involving 110 people and 18 arrests. Those opposite ask: what practical measures are you taking to deal with the challenge of people smuggling? I would suggest to those opposite that these actually constitute practical measures, because they are working with our friends and partners in the region to disrupt a significant peoplesmuggling operation right across our wider region. That is one arm of cooperation. The other is, of course, dealing with the challenges in source countries themselves. When it comes to dealing with source countries, those opposite would be familiar with the particular challenges we face in Sri Lanka. That is why the foreign minister, again as a practical course of action, in partnership with the World Bank and other international institutions, is working with the Sri Lankan authorities to assist with the resettlement of those who have been internally displaced within Sri Lanka back to their original place of domicile. Some 260,000 people have been dislodged. The challenge, therefore, in providing accommodation for those who need to be relocated is huge. That is why we are working with the IOM and other international organisations, including the World Bank. Finally, I would say this to those opposite, and I go back to what I was saying before about the sheer numbers involved in this disturbance in Sri Lanka: 260,000 and 130,000 have gone across the water to India and you have some thousands and tens of thousands going to Europe, by one means or another, and into North America. The total number of arrivals in this country so far from Sri Lanka: some 600 to 700. Emissions Trading Scheme",20
16,Mr RIPOLL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House the reasons why passing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme this week is critical for the future of the Australian economy?,21
17,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Oxley for his question. Could I also congratulate him on the joint parliamentary committee report that came down last night, which really goes to the core of future economic reform particularly in financial services. The government will look at all of those recommendations and take them very seriously, because, as a government, we take long-term reform very seriously. Long-term reform is never easy. Opening up our financial system in the eighties was never easy. Introducing compulsory superannuation was never easy. Tearing down the tariff wall was never easy. But all of these long-term reforms that were put in place by far-sighted governments of the past are one of the reasons why we are such a prosperous nation today and among some of the reasons why we have done so well during this global recession, because far-sighted governments and political parties committed to long-term reform took the hard decisions at the right time. They did not delay. They did not take the easy course of action. Of course, nothing is harder-and this is the case-than introducing a carbon pollution reduction scheme, but it is an essential reform for our future prosperity and an essential reform if we want to leave a legacy of prosperity to our children not just in terms our economy but in terms of our environmental sustainability. This is a challenge we cannot afford to shirk as a nation, and the government has been working very hard in this area over a long period of time. We made a commitment to the people at the last election. We have brought down a green paper; we have brought down a white paper; we have brought down legislation. We are very serious about long-term reform because we are serious about what we hand to subsequent generations with regard to a prosperous economy and a sustainable environment. That is what is at stake in the debate about the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. In essence, it is about jobs and it is about protecting our economy from the consequences of dangerous climate change. The government has come to this after it has done an enormous amount of work. We have had an enormous amount of work done by the Treasury: comprehensive modelling that the world looks at as being one of the most important responses that has been put in place by any nation around the globe. What does it tell us, because this is what should inform us about how we act if we are going to act in the long-term national interest? This is what the modelling shows us. It shows we can have continued economic growth while we reduce carbon pollution. It is a path that livers continued increases in employment, with 1.7 million new jobs to 2020, while we reduce carbon pollution. It is a path that delivers continued increases in average income. Expect it to grow by $4,300 per person to 2020 while we reduce carbon pollution. But critically, and this goes very much to the here and now, what we must deliver is certainty to business so that it can invest in new green technologies and new industries. This is the way forward. This is the path to the future, which is why the government has come to the table with good faith and negotiof ated with some opposite to put in place a scheme which is sustainable, economically that responsible and environmentally credible. That is what we have done. The bottom line is that as an economy, let alone a society, we cannot continue to put this problem in the too-hard basket. It has been there for far too long. Too many people over a long period of time have taken the short-sighted approach. Perhaps it is the politically popular approach, but it is the short-sighted approach. Hard reform is never easy, and we have to take it on. If we have inaction for longer, it will get harder and harder. The longer we delay the more it costs the nation, the greater the burden we deliver to our children and our grandchildren, and the greater the cost to the economy. That is what all of the modelling shows. It is what common sense shows as well. It is what common sense tells you: the longer you delay taking action, a fundamental action, the greater the cost that comes to you and the community in which you live. So for that reason we have moved forward in a practical way. We know that the cost of not acting now is far higher in the long term. And if we do not act now, we are sentencing the Australian economy to a very sharp and dangerous shock at some stage in the future. That is the problem, and that is why we need de- to act. That is why we have spent two years working on a carbon pollution reduction scheme. It is about time this parliament acted. It about time everyone here put the national interest ahead of their self-interest. It is our turn to put the Australian economy on the right path by passing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Asylum Seekers",21
18,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to reports today of a special unit of Australian immigration officials being flown into Indonesia from around the region for the fast-track processing of the 78 Oceanic Viking asylum seekers. Prime Minister, how many other asylum seekers in the region have access to a special unit of immigration officials flown into process their claims under a special deal?",23
19,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Curtin for her question, and I go to the Ronaldson doctrine, which says, ‘Make sure you pursue stories which take into account special interest groups getting undeserved handouts.' The Ronaldson doctrine then says: You don't get news stories by trying to change perceptions, you get them by reinforcing stereothis types.  of order on relevance.

20,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat! On the question of relevance, the Prime Minister knows that he has to respond to the question. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.",23
21,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I am always taken by the sensitivity with which they respond to the Ronaldson doctrine when it is rendered here. I would have thought, when it was emailed out from the office of the Leader of the Opposition, and coming from is Senator Ronaldson's senior staffer, that they would all own it with pride. Mr Randall interjecting",23
22,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Canning is not assisting. The Prime Minister will direct his remarks to the question.,23
23,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question was asked about mobile team visits. I draw this to the member for Curtin's attention. Mobile team visits have been in operation since 2003. Furthermore, mobile team visits have so far been conducted in the following locations-a number of these were under the previous government-in Beirut, in Nairobi, in Pretoria, in Cairo, in Bangkok and in Jakarta. Furthermore, for the information of the honourable member, there were 14 MTVs, as they are called, conducted in 2005-06 in Beirut, Nairobi, Pretoria, Cairo and Bangkok; 12 in 2006-07; 11 in 2007-08; five in 2008-09; and six so far in the 2009-10 period. I thank the honourable member for her question. NA",23
24,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery afternoon the New Zealand Minister of Justice, the Hon. Simon Power. On behalf of the House I extend to him a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Emissions Trading Scheme",23
25,Ms REA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change. Will the minister outline how the government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is in the national interest?",23
26,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you to the member for Bonner for her question. Today the government is on the cusp of delivering one of the most significant economic and environmental reforms in this country's history because-if the deal that is presently before the opposition is agreed to-the CPRS will, for the first time in our economy, place a price on carbon pollution. This will enable Australia to start the very important work of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. It will also drive investment in abatement and low emissions technologies. To protect jobs and smooth the transition to a low carbon economy, the deal before the opposition enhances transitional assistance for industry and jobs. A key element of the deal is that, in relation to the coal industry, the inclusion coal mining in the scheme and it will contribute to the abatement effort overall in the economy. There is an enhanced $1.5 billion assistance package in the deal to protect jobs and assist the industry transition-$1.23 billion is in the form of free permits to the gaseous coal mines over the first five years of the scheme and there is also included a $270 million abatement fund to assist waste coalmine abatement. A further key element in relation to emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries is that there is enhanced assistance to emissions-intensive activities. These include permanently incorporating the global recession buffer, announced by the government on 4 May, into the assistance rates. Those rates will commence at 94½ per cent for the most emissions-intensive industries, and 66 per cent at the second tier. The proposed deal retains the annual 1.3 per cent carbon productivity contribution to ensure that emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries retain an incentive to reduce emissions. There is also assistance to be reviewed regarding any new global agreement and evidence of comparable efforts by trade competitors. Importantly, this deal also strengthens environmental outcomes, including through measures to further encourage and account for voluntary action and through a new energy efficiency mechanism to be developed next year, with input from a new prime ministerial task group on energy efficiency. The deal also creates a new green carbon fund to build resilience for natural ecosystems under threat from climate change and there is also a commitment that the IPCC advice on mitigation is taken into account when setting scheme caps and gateways. The deal also retains assistance to households for increases in costs of living associated with the introduction of the CPRS. If passed this legislation will, as the Prime of Minister said earlier, be a very significant milestone in our economic history and also a milestone in environmental reform. Since coming into power, the government has taken very strong action to meet the challenge of climate change. We have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, introduced the renewable energy target, committed to significant reduction targets and made the largest ever investment in energy efficiency, carbon capture and storage, and solar technologies. The CPRS is the key plank of our action against climate change. Labor is extremely committed to this important reform and to acting in the national interest. It is now up to the opposition to vote in the national interest, support the deal and support the passage of the CPRS legislation this week. Asylum Seekers",23
27,Ms LEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. What were the budgeted costs for the Christmas Island detention centre for this financial year and, given the ongoing surge in unauthorised arrivals and the need to increase accommodation and security at the facility, will the Prime Minister now require supplementary funding and, if so, how much?",24
28,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is good to see that Ronno's doctrine is still at work. You do not get news stories by trying to change perceptions, you get them by reinforcing stereotypes-and stereotype 101 has just been at the despatch box.",25

30,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well those opposite circulated the Ronaldson doctrine on stereotypes-we did not. It was prepared by a senior staffer in Ronaldson's office and circulated from the office to the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Randall- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I cannot see how sexist comments can be relevant.",25
31,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,25
32,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Perhaps after question time the member for Canning will have just a little reflection on his comments over the years. In response to the question, Christmas Island capacity is as I have described to the House before. Furthermore, can I say to the honourable member that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has made suitable statements on the requirement for additional capacity. Regarding any reserve capacity beyond that he has also commented that that will be in hand. It is practical and prudent to do this, in dealing with what has been a surge in activity, particularly coming out Sri Lanka because of civil disturbances in that country. Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme",25
33,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Do the government's proposed changes to the CPRS undermine efforts to return the budget to surplus?,25
34,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government does face a very substantial challenge to return the budget to surplus after the impact of the global financial crisis and global recession on the budget, particularly with a dramatic drop in projected taxation revenue. The recent Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook papers did modify the projections in a positive way with respect to future deficits and projected debt but, nonetheless, we are still facing the prospect of debt peaking at around 10 per cent of GDP and at around $150 billion or so in net terms, which is still extraordinarily low in global developed world terms but does require serious discipline on the part of the government in order to get the budget back to surplus-at least by 2015-16, as projected in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook papers. We have set in place a couple of disciplines to ensure that that will occur-in particular, offsetting all new spending with savings and also placing a cap of two per cent in real terms on increases in spending once ordinary trend levels of growth have resumed. Mr Speaker, like everybody in this House, you would be aware that we have received a great deal of advice and free character assessment from the opposition in recent times about the importance of getting the budget back into surplus and about the levels of debt and deficit. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition does not always follow his own advice on these matters. We have had a number of budget initiatives that have been of blocked in the Senate-budget initiatives involving billions of dollars worth of savings-such as the private health insurance rebate reforms, the reforms to the scheduled benefit for cataract surgery and also reforms to youth allowance. You can imagine, Mr Speaker, that, given my responsibility, I approached the prospect of negotiations with respect to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme with some degree of trepidation given some of the initial claims being put forward by the opposition. But I am very pleased to say that the proposals that have been negotiated between the government and the opposition have only a very, very modest impact on the budget over the forthcoming 10 years. In fact, the total impact in net terms is a deterioration of somewhere slightly higher than $750 million over 10 years. I think that augurs well that we may be seeing a slight change of heart on the part of the opposition on these matters, and I look forward to that being reflected in some other contributions that they make. I commend the opposition for their constructive approach in these negotiations. It is tainly very important that we maintain the integrity of the budget position in this regard and, given the position that the opposition have taken on those issues in recent months and given that they hold significant power over these matters in the Senate, it is certainly very important that they practise what they preach. I could say more, but I am conscious of the fact that some members are part way through a very important meeting and they have to get away from question time soon in order to resume. I do not wish to add anything further on that point, but I would urge the opposition to complete the process, join with the government in a bipartisan way to get through what is a very difficult and challenging issue and support the amended Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme proposal as negotiated between the government and the opposition. Budget",25
35,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his pre-election commitment to adopt the budget discipline of the Howard government. He said: I am an economic conservative, I'm proud of that fact … Prime Minister, in which year will you deliver your first budget surplus? Prime Minister, in which year will you pay off your $153 billion of debt? Isn't this just a case of another Labor broken promise?",26
36,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It has been, I think, more than 100 days since we have had a question on jobs. I notice that, even in this breaking of Joe's duck for the last several weeks, there is still no question on jobs. Can I say in response to the honourable member's question that what is appropriate and what is conservative in dealing with a global economic crisis is this: for the government to expand cer- its own role and the economy when the private sector is in retreat and for the government to withdraw its activity once the private sector recovers. That is why the honourable member will be familiar with the fact that the government's national stimulus strategy was purposely designed to peak when the economy was at its weakest and then tail off. In fact, I am advised that the government's stimulus strategy, and the payments associated with it, peaked in the second quarter of 2009. That is because we are through the initial set of payments to pensioners, carers and low-income families. Secondly, we are now in the process of the medium-term infrastructure build-Building the Education Revolution, the insulation package for people's houses as well as the public housing investment-before we move into stage 3, which is the longer term infrastructure build. That is how it is designed-to deal with weaknesses in the economy now and build the infrastructure we need for the long term.

37,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney interjects. If he looks at the data produced by the International Monetary Fund he will see that 2009 is the first time since 1951 that the world economy has contracted. Mr Hockey interjecting,26
38,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He says, ‘Oh, it's the Australian economy.' Is the shadow Treasurer suggesting that Australia is unaffected by movements in the global economy? Is the alternative Treasurer of Australia seriously suggesting that, given our exposure to (a) global financial markets and (b) global export markets, the level of growth in the global economy does not materially affect growth and jobs in this economy? This government is unapologetic about stepping up to the plate to defend Australian jobs. Had we taken the advice of those opposite, what would have happened? We would have hundreds of thousands more Australians out of work. The result of our action is this: we now have the second-lowest unemployment of the major advanced economies. As a result of our actions and the actions of the Australian business community, Australia is the only economy of the major advanced economies not to have gone into recession. It is the only economy of the 33 economies in the OECD to have grown positively in the 2009-10 financial year. On top of that, we have registered the lowest debt and the lowest deficit. I regard that as a reasonable record of achievement so far, with much more to be done. Mr Hockey- Mr SPEAKER ",27
39,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the Prime Minister concluded his answer?,27
40,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes.  der: yesterday when I asked you a question after question time about the habit of pausing and allowing a minister to finish their answer, you said I had to take that as a point of order at the time of the offence. I noticed that the Prime Minister, in his answer just now, was allowed to finish at least a couple of sentences while the shadow Treasurer stood to take the point of order. I ask you to address that issue in the future.",27
41,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will try to predict which standing order the Manager of Opposition Business was rising on. I suppose it was the belief that I am obliged to recognise people approaching the dispatch box for a point of order. The wording in the standing orders is ‘may'. As I tried to explain yesterday, when I believe there is a chance that the minister is concluding their answer, I allow that to happen. I just would like to make the comment-and some keen observers might like to think about this and not just shake their heads-that I have found that every time. I allow a point of order, as I said last week, for every action there appears to be a reaction and we spend a lot more time going through the motions again. I believe that it suits the convenience of the House to allow this, because I can only believe that the defence of these points of orders is because people are trying to make a point rather than a point of order.

It is true that standing order 86(a) says ‘A Member may raise a point of order', but standing order 86(b) says ‘A Member interrupted by a point of order must resume his or her seat.' So, when the member standing on this side of the House takes their point of order, it is the member who must resume their seat. That is the point. That is no reflection on you, Mr Speaker.",27
43,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,28
44,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Sturt will resume his seat. Those on my right, it is not an open invitation for you to make comments. The point of order requires me to give recognition to the person rising on the point of order and it is at that stage, when I give the call to the person, that the person on feet should resume their place. So all of these things, I agree, are deliberate decisions that have made to try to keep things going. Regarding the member for North Sydney, I do not believe that I can read his mind all the time, but he would have been approaching the Mr Melham interjecting",28
45,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Banks! The member for North Sydney would have been rising on a point of order that could only have been on relevance. The relevance was that the Prime Minister was concluding. Climate Change,28
46,Ms RISHWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. What action is the government taking to support Australia's near neighbours prepare for the impact of climate change on their marines resources?",28
47,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I know she has a strong interest in effective climate change action not only here in Australia but also in our neighbourhood. The fact is that our neighbours in South-East Asia and the Pacific are highly vulnerable to climate change, of course through sea level rise and having many people living in coastal communities, but there are also expected impacts of higher temperatures, ocean acidification, extreme weather, different ocean currents and the like. This is particularly important where many people rely on the ocean for their food security and their livelihood. I am asked what actions the government is taking to support Australia's near neighbours. We are taking a range of activities to help: a $20 million Pacific Climate Change Science Program, for example, helping Pacific island countries and East Timor better understand how climate change will their impact on them. We have also allocated $25 million to help implement adaptation proI grams in Pacific island countries, improving coastal zone management and disaster preparedness. As well as that, Australia is a development partner for the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security. I was pleased to attend the second ministerial meeting of the Coral Triangle Initiative in the Solomon Islands last week. The Coral Triangle, an area of global environmental significance bordering Timor Leste, the Philippines, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea, has the greatest marine biological diversity on the planet. It includes the Solomons as well. Some call it ‘the Amazon of the oceans'. The Coral Triangle meeting was looking at ways of building the resilience of marine environments so as to better withstand the impacts of climate change. Australia has been pleased to support the efforts of the Coral Triangle Initiative, particularly providing expertise for them to develop and deliver plans of action, especially in terms of coral reef management, which for Australia, given our experience on the Great Barrier Reef, is a great asset. I am pleased to say that last week again I saw the strong commitment from the six Coral Triangle Initiative nations. They know that the problems that they face are important and they do want to take pronounced action to deal with them. This follows the Coral Triangle declaration, which was signed in Manado in Indonesia in May this year. There we had the presidents of the six Coral Triangle Initiative countries-President Yudhoyono, President Arroyo, Prime Minister Sikua, President Ramos Horta, Prime Minister Somare and Prime Minister Razakstanding side-by-side and agreeing to work together in the interests of their region and in the interests of the planet. Today the government is delivering the most significant economic reform in a generation and the most significant environmental reform in our history to deal with the impacts of climate change. Like the leaders of the Coral Triangle Initiative, we are acting in the national interest to protect the future for our children. We have done this because we know, as do they, that a healthy and productive environment is absolutely fundamental to our social and economic future. Addressing the impacts of climate change is critical to the long-term sustainability of populations in our region, as it is to Australia's interests as well. As the leaders of the Coral Triangle Initiative show that leadership, so it is time for the opposition to recognise the national interest that is at stake. We now need to move comprehensively and decisively on dealing with climate change. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme that is in front of the parliament will assist this nation greatly in doing that and the time for leadership is now. Infrastructure",28
48,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his pre-election commitment: If you are serious about building the 21st century economy in Australia you have got to build the infrastructure for it. I also refer him to the October report of the Business Council of Australia which revealed that only 14 per cent of the government's $96 billion stimulus spend has been set aside for vital economic infrastructure. How does the Prime Minister justify this reckless and wasteful spending and does this low priority that he has given to infrastructure assets not represent just another broken election promise?,29
49,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Here we have the National Party campaigning against the rollout of infrastructure across the nation-the rolling out of roads across National Party electorates, the rolling out of rail infrastructure across the nation, the enhancement of ports across the nation, the building of schools in each and every National Party electorate contained within this parliament. I really wonder what planet the National Party sometimes lives on because it is completely detached from what their constituents are saying. Buried within that question from the Leader of the National Party is the following: that the expenditure currently going to the building of schools in each and every National Party electorate represented in this parliament is not wanted. Is that what the Leader of the National Party is saying? Is that what the member for Wide Bay is saying? He does not want any funding for any school in his electorate? He is hiding in his papers. Is that what he is saying? Is there anyone over there from the National Party interested in funding for their schools? I ask myself why is it that my good friend and colleague here, the Minister for Infrastructure-a term which was missing from the vocabulary of those opposite for their 12 years in office-constantly gets representations from National Party members about more to be done. I am looking at the Minister for Education-truckloads of correspondence; is there any from National Party members? Ms Gillard-Yes.",29
50,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There are truckloads. How can you just stand at the despatch box and say ‘It is a terrible waste to invest in this infrastructure' on the one hand and then on the other write to the ministers responsible and say ‘Give us more.'? I do not understand. How do you get away with this? How do you square up when you try to do this? The member for New England is appropriately gesticulating. There is a certain detachment from reality on the part of the National Party. Mr Bruce Scott interjecting,29
51,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, Bruce. All those members over there: Kay, Bruce, all the others; of that. You are not saying you do not want that money for your schools in Maranoa? Bruce, do you want money for your schools in Maranoa? Mr Bruce Scott-Are we getting any for Warrego?",30
52,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Do you want any money for schools in Maranoa. A government member-He wants more!,30
53,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He wants some more. Come on Kay, over there in the Riverina; do you want some money for your schools? Mrs Hull interjecting",30
54,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So we have got Kay, we have got Bruce Speaker: we have been through this before. Firstly, the Prime Minister is not referring to members by their proper titles and, secondly, it is a particularly cowardly act to ask us to respond to a question when he knows that we cannot answer.",30
55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt will resume his seat. The member for Sturt can thank those on my right-he got out of a warning because they carried on. The Prime Minister will refer to members by their names but I suggest to people who feel provoked into making interjections that that provocation does not justify them ignoring standing order 65(b). It would assist if they sat there in silence. The Prime Minister has the call.,30
56,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you Mr Speaker. Let us just leave schools for a moment and go on to roads for a bit, including a road very close to the electorate of the member for Wide Bay-the Cooroy to Kurra road, known very well to me, as I grew up in that part of the world, and to the Treasurer-the road which all the Leader of the Nationals himself has described in its current state of repair as ‘something like the worse road in Australia'. Mr Truss interjecting",30
57,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have not said that? I think he might have said that. Mr Truss- Mr SPEAKER ,30
58,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, no-the only approach that the Leader of the Nationals can make is if he is raising a point of order. I do not think that he is really going to do that. Mr Randall interjecting",30
59,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I just say to the House what I have said before. The problem here is that we have a tradition that answers are allowed to be debated and these sorts of rhetorical questions are by way of debate. I think that is the problem. I suggest to people that they might just-and this will get me into trouble with those on my right-ignore those type of questions. The Prime Minister has the call.,30
60,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I hear an interjection from one of our colleagues from Western Australia about infrastructure. Before I go back to the Cooroy to Kurra road, is it the WA Liberal government which is now partnering with us in an infrastructure development at Oakajee? Is it the WA Liberal government which is partnering with us in an expansion of the Ord? Is it the WA government which is partnering with the Australian government in the inner city rail bridge at Northbridge? I think in all three of those cases the answer is yes. And a WA member rises in sensitivity! Mr Randall-Again, Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance of fact. If the Prime Minister is going to question me as a Western Australian, representing",30
61,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Canning will resume his seat. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,31
62,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question asked by the Mr Forrest- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Somebody has got to do something about raising the standards in this place. The Prime Minister is ignoring the injunction you just gave him when you asked that the rhetorical questions not be asked, because he",31
63,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Mallee will resume his seat. The point that I was simply making was that, so far, the House has not wanted to address the rules of engagement for question time. I simply put it to you that, if the same rules applied to answers as apply to questions, that would even the playing field. It would mean that some of the allowances that are made for argument in questions would not be allowed as often. That is what I was suggesting.",31
64,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When it comes to the member for Mallee, should I mention the Horsham Town Hall? That is something which the member for Mallee has been keen to receive investment in, through the agency of the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, in order to assist with that project of, believe, some millions-a project whose opening, the launch of the project, I believe the honourable member was very happy to attend. The reason I raise this with the member for Mallee, other National Party members, the member for Canning, representing, as he does, the interests of the WA Liberals, and others who are here is to point to one central point on infrastructure investment. It is called hypocrisy. They are in here saying, ‘Isn't this a terrible thing for the Australian government to be investing in the infrastructure needs of the nation and the regions and localities?' on the one hand, and in their electorates, in their constituencies, they are doing everything they can to roll it in at the same time. I conclude with the example which goes most directly to the local interests of the member for Wide Bay, who asked the question: the Cooroy to Curra road, a part of the Bruce Highway which has stood there for decades and decades and decades unattended to and which, according to the local ambulance officers-if I recall from the Treasurer-has been the source of untold tragedy and has therefore been the subject of multiple representations to the government about what we could do. It took this Australian Labor government to invest some $480 million-$630 million in partnership with the Queensland government-to attend to a road need in your area, something which you, when you were the local member and a minister for transport in the federal government, failed to do.",31
65,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will refer his remarks through the chair.,31
66,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would simply suggest that the member for Wide Bay, when he next asks a question about infrastructure, reflects on something as basic as this: if you are going to stand at the dispatch box and complain about something, how can you at the same I time happily receive that investment back on your home turf? Can I just say it reeks of double standards, and that is what we have seen from the National Party from the beginning to the very end on this entire infrastructure program of the Australian government. Emissions Trading Scheme",31
67,Ms CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism. How will the government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme ensure Australia's energy security?,32
68,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I appreciate the question from the member for Bass, because, as the member for Groom and I appreciate, any strong economy is very much dependent on the reliability of the electricity system. I can also advise the House that it is a matter that has fully occupied the government and the opposition over the last month of detailed negotiations about potential revisions and refinements of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. In that context, I am pleased to advise the House of six key amendments to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme that go to the endeavours by both the government and the opposition to make sure that, as we transition to a lowcarbon economy, we have a fully operational, reliable electricity system. I can also say that, in the context of making the transition, reliability is required to bring on new investment, and the initial transition is going to be very much dependent on a growth in dependence on gas. The key refinements are therefore as follows. Firstly, the government will increase the assistance under the Electricity Sector Adjustment Scheme from 130.7 million permits to 228.7 million permits, a significant increase of 75 per cent. Secondly, the government will extend the period of the Electricity Sector Adjustment Scheme from five years to 10, meaning that generators will be required to comply with the power system reliability test over this period to continue receive government assistance. Thirdly, the government will introduce a Low Emissions Transition Incentive by amending the power system reliability test further to allow generators to receive credit for their own investments in low-emissions replacement capacity. That is about reliability plus new investment for the purposes of the transition. Fourthly, the government will establish-and this is a very important proposal going to the issue of reliability and transition-an Energy Security Assurance Mechanism with an advisory board that will advise the government on whether there are any remaining lowprobability systemic problems with respect to electricity market security and, if so, what further actions are necessary to address these risks. Fifthly, the government will delay the windfall gains test that applies to ESAS assistance to apply to the last three of 10 years of assistance and to only half of a generator's allocation in this period. Sixthly and finally, the government per the proposed agreement with the opposition, will provide a transitional measure to address the working capital costs of market participants and, in doing so, allow generators to defer payments for future year permits. I believe this package represents a coming together of people who understand the complexities of the electricity system and the huge challenge to maintain reliability during this transition. I say that because, without a reliable electricity system, you do not have a fully functioning economy and strong economic growth foundations for Australia. The outcome of these negotiations represents an endeavour by both parties to act in the national interest and, in doing so, to guarantee energy security, which is the key to protecting jobs and the economy from climate change. I can also advise the House that, on the fito nalisation of these measures, the secretary to the Department of Climate Change sought advice from the energy market institutions who have written to the secretary in support of the final arrangements as proposed in the CPRS document released this morning. These letters are available publicly. I refer, for example to comments by the Chairman of the Australian Energy Regulator, Mr Steve Edwell, who said there are ‘low risks of energy shortfalls as a result of the introduction of the CPRS'. I can simply say in conclusion that that is a very important statement by the chairman of the Australian Energy Regulator because estimates of Australia's electricity infrastructure investment needs between now and 2020 are in the order of $100 billion in generation and network costs, including for renewables. This is an investment comparable to Australia's current asset base of $120 billion in power generation, transmission and distribution, so it represents a huge challenge in terms of the transition and the introduction of the CPRS. In terms of the energy market, the finalisamember tion of a CPRS, side-by-side with a renewable energy target as previously approved by the parliament, potentially establishes, if proved by the Senate, a clear framework at long last in which to plan to meet that huge challenge on electricity investment so key to our economic future. Mr Broadbent- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Can the minister table this very important document from which he was reading?",32
69,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was the minister reading from a document?,33
70,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, Mr Speaker.",33
71,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the document confidential?,33
72,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is confidential in nature. Building the Education Revolution Program  the Prime Minister. I refer him to the $1.2 billion blow-out in computers in schools, which has failed to deliver on a promise of a computer for every student; the $1.7 billion blow-out in the Building the Education Revolution; and the failure to deliver a trades training centre at every secondary school as promised before the last election. Prime Minister, when will the so-called ‘education revolution' actually deliver improved educational standards for Australian students, or is Labor's education revolution really just another product from Labor's school of spin?",33
73,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank very much the member for Sturt for his question. The first thing I would say in response to the member for Sturt is to have a clear and close look at the Australian Education Agreement, which was signed between the Australian government and the states last year. I would say to the for Sturt, who is not interested in any answer to the question he has just asked, that the Australian Education Agreement for apschools represents a 50 per cent increase in Australian government investment in schools over the five-year period against the benchmark which we inherited from the previous government. That is the first point. The second is that, if the member for Sturt is actually interested in what we mean by quality education and quality education outcomes, he should study carefully the number of national partnership agreements which flow off that national education agreement and what therefore flows through in terms of the measurement of school performance. That is the second point. I could say to the honourable member that, if he is actually interested in real performance in schools, that is where his attention should go. On the question of quality education, one of the key elements of policy on quality education is this: the public production of reporting of school performance. That is a core part of education reform. But which party in Australia stands opposed to the production of that public reporting of data on school performance? Could it be the Australian Labor Party? No. Could it be even the National Party? No. It is not the Democrats, because they are not around anymore. Could it be the Greens? No, it is not them but I think they were party to it. The principal agent is the Liberal Party in the state of New South Wales. The Liberal Party, under Mr O'Farrell, in the New South Wales parliament has blocked the core element of education reform when it comes to public reporting. ",33
74,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He interjects and says, ‘This is not a core element of reform.' He says that the public reporting of school performances is not a core element of reform. We have engineered this agreement with the states and territories. We have increased the investment in schools. We have said in response to that that we want to see public reporting of school performance. Other states around the country are implementing these reforms, except New South Wales-and the reason for that is the rank opportunism of the Liberal Party of New South Wales. They have teamed up with-wait for it-the Greens. They have teamed up with the Greens in order to block this key education reform in New South Wales. He asked the questions: where is our reform agenda? Where is the implementation of the reforms? I would suggest that the member for Sturt hops on the telephone, rings Barry O'Farrell and tries to unstitch this piece of absolute policy obstructional tionism being engineered by the Liberal Party of New South Wales. Finally, why is it they have suddenly dropped off their questions about Building the Education Revolution? ",34
75,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, he asked one yesterday. When it comes to the construction program underway in schools, we had one about a school yesterday. But, basically, it has been about a month since we had anything on this. For the benefit of the House, through the Building the Education Revolution component of the government's nation building for recovery plan, 24,382 individual projects have been approved around schools across Australia. That is 9,526 schools across Australia-government and non-governmentand in every state of the country. More than 20,000 of these projects are underway and 1,200 of these projects have been completed. What we experience as local members of parliament as we go to our local school communities is the absolute delight from local communities about having a library being built, having a multipurpose hall being built, having plans now in place for a new science centre being built and having plans in place for a new language centre being built. This is part of the bricks and mortar of Building the Education Revolution as well. He asks where the action lies. I would point him to the 20,000 projects currently underway across the country. Can I suggest that he simply gets real with his questions for the future. Workplace Relations Mrs D'ATH (3.14 pm)-My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Would the Deputy Prime Minister report to the House any developments in the creation of a naworkplace relations system for the private sector?",34
76,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Petrie for her question. Can I echo the words of the Treasurer: hard reform is not easy; it takes leadership, it takes discipline, it takes application. That is, of course, what the government is doing in the education revolution while we watch the Liberal Party seek to deny students scholarships next year. And when it comes to workplace relations, we are seeing reform vandalism take over the Liberal Party. It has been a holy grail of microeconomic reform in this country to have one workplace relations system for the private sector for decades-literally decades. It is supported by businesses and business organisations right around the country. In the words of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, they said: In the Australian context, the case for a single system being introduced in the early years of the 21st century is overwhelming. In the words of Business SA, they said: It is utter madness that we are a country of 22 million people with awards covering different people, different states and different situations. After years of dithering and delay, we are on the cusp of delivering this holy grail of microeconomic reform. We have an agreement with Queensland, with New South Wales, with Victoria, with Tasmania and with South Australia to introduce our Fair Work system as the universal system for the private sector. Indeed, states have legislated their companion referring legislation-Queensland has, Victoria has, Tasmania has, South Australia has. Businesses around the country-the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Mines and Metals Associationare screaming out for this reform to be completed and to complete it we need the federal companion piece of legislation to the state referrals to go through this parliament this year. What will happen if this piece of legislation does not go through this year? The state based referral bills will lapse. That will mean that, to build this again next year, we will need all of those parliaments to legislate again. I think we are all aware of the fragility of political systems, of the changes that elections and ministerial changes can bring. It is possible that we will never be able to put this together again if it is not completed this year. The Liberal Party are opposing this bill. You would think, on the cusp of a major microeconomic national reform, with those states having legislated, that you would get with the program and you would deliver this bill. You would assume, if you were going to seek to delay it or debate it, that you would have a very clear idea of what you were trying to achieve in doing so. In this parliament, the following is the situation. The shadow minister for workplace relations has not even sought a briefing on the bill but he is opposed to it. The shadow minister for workplace relations and the Liberal Party have indicated vaguely in the public domain that they intend to amend the bill but they have not provided the government with the amendments. Here is a piece of national reform, called for by business organisations around the country, being held up by the Liberal Party, for what? For some mysterious reason that they refuse to tell us even in the form of amendments, causing all of the chaos and uncertainty that we will see for employers next year. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition-and I acknowledge he is a man with a few things on his plate-when it comes to hard reform, when it comes to making a difference in this country for businesses, he should listen to the voices from ACCI, AMA and the NFF, who do not want small businesses next year to wake up in jurisdictional limbo, who do not want next year to be reliant on the anachronism and rigidities of state based awards but want to move to the simple modern award systems. If the Leader of the Opposition is in any doubt about the employer thirst for that, he should speak to the National Farmers Federation. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition has a few things on his plate but he needs to get to grips with this because we need the Liberal Party to change its ridiculous opposition to this bill and deliver this profound microeconomic reform. There was a day in this country when the Liberal Party used to say it was the party of microeconomic reform. In those days, when they were led by a man called John Howard, John Howard frequently spoke about the need to deliver this major piece of reform, a uniform system of workplace relations for the private sector. The challenge is there for the Liberal Party: whether as a rabble in opposition they want to look like an absolute shadow of their former selves, embracing economic vandalism, or whether they want to do the right thing in the remaining days of this parliament and deliver this bill. We await the answer. Mr Keenan-You can't even list it for debate in the Senate. Ms Gillard interjecting",34
77,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The members for Stirling and the Deputy Prime Minister are denying the House proceeding. The member for Dickson has the call. Hospitals,36
78,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the AMA's Public Hospital Report Card 2009, which found that the Prime Minister's public hospital system is getting worse under his watch. I refer the Prime Minister also to his pre-election pledge that, ‘The buck stops with me on health.' Will the Prime Minister confirm that waiting times for elective surgery are blowing out and patients are waiting longer for emergency department care and hospital beds? Prime Minister, isn't this just another Labor broken promise?",36
79,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dickson, now that he has returned to his seat-in both senses-for the question. He raises a question about public hospitals. He raises a question about the AMA report. Obviously the member for Dickson did not see my comments at the time. I said, in response to the AMA report, that they had basically got it right-that is, there is a huge problem in the nation's public hospital system. Let us be up-front about it. Secondly, let us also talk about the fact that there is a problem with elective surgery waiting lists and there is a problem in the time that elapses before people receive attention at accident and emergency with respect to what are defined as clinically acceptable times. In each and every one of the consultations that the health minister and I have been participating in around the country, nearly 20 of which I have been in myself and about 70 or 80 of which have involved the minister and others, we have given a standard presentation on the fact that the waiting time for accident and emergency has not changed-based on our data-since the early part of this decade and that it is unacceptably high. The second thing we have said, when it comes to the time for elective surgery, is that the waiting time is unacceptably high as well. It is a standard part of our presentation and it is consistent with the data that is contained within the Bennett commission report. If the honourable member is seeking to infer somehow that we do not recognise there is a problem, can I say that he has not been studying what I or others have been saying in the public debate on this. Mr Dutton-When will you fix it?",36
80,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Dickson has asked his question.,36
81,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question is one of solutions. Let us turn to solutions and how those opposite used their 12 years to solve the problem. In 2003 the Liberals ripped $1 billion from the public hospitals. That was solution No. 1. Solution No. 2: the Liberals left 2,300 older Australians languishing in hospital beds every night. Thirdly, under the Liberals the health workforce shortage affected 60 per cent of Australians. Fourthly, they capped GP training places at 600 per year. Mr Dutton- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order going to relevance. The Prime Minister was asked about his pre-election health pledge, not about other opinions or views. When is he going to fix",36
82,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Dickson will resume his seat. The Prime Minister will respond to the question.,37
83,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the honourable member asked me a question about the AMA report into the state of the nation's hospitals. The state of the nation's hospitals as it exists did not mysteriously appear as a consequence of what has happened in the previous six months, 12 months or 18 months. In fact, it is the product of long-term non-investment in the public hospital system of Australia by the previous government. Let us be up-front about that. What do they have to say about the 650,000 Australians who were left on public dental care waiting lists as a result of the them scrapping the Commonwealth dental care program? That is exactly what we inherited: underfunding for the hospitals, money being ripped out, older Australians being left to languish in hospitals and preventing others from properly occupying those hospital beds for the purposes of elective surgery and other procedures, capping of the number of GP training places and 650,000 Australians on public dental waiting lists. They have the audacity to stand here in this parliament and claim that they have no responsibility for the state of the nation's hospitals, as identified in the AMA reportwhich the honourable member just referred to. Let us just get real about this debate and get real about what has been inherited here, as a set of historical problems. The honourable member asks what we are doing about these challenges. I draw his attention to the following. In November the health minister announced a $64 billion health and hospitals agreement, a 50 per cent increase on the Liberals' last healthcare agreement. That is what we are doing. Secondly, for the first time, we are investing $750 million to help take pressure off emergency departments. I ask this of the member for Dickson: how much did the previous government invest directly in seeking to take pressure off emergency departments? Nothing, not a dollar. How much did they invest when it came to bringing down elective surgery waiting times? Nothing. We have invested some $600 million. How much did they invest in subacute care beds? The answer is that I do not know, but we are investing $500 million. These are the practical measures that we have put into place so far, quite apart from the investment in GP superclinics-a $275 million investment-and quite apart from our increased attention to overall health workforce training requirements. That is simply stage 1 of what we have sought to do in the two years that we have been in office. We have also outlined through the Bennett commission of review what constitutes two overall strategic options for the long-term future. The time frame for considering those is as I outlined to the House yesterday in response to the honourable member's question. If he is going to ask questions about health and hospitals, let him not simply airbrush away the impact of 12 years of simple ignorance, non-attendance and noninvestment in the hospital system of Australia. If you are going to raise questions about the hospital system, tell us what you have done in the past and tell us what you will do in the future. We have a plan to deal with both. People with Disability",37
84,Mr ZAPPIA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. I ask: what action is the government taking to support people with disabilities?",38
85,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Makin for his question. As he knows, last night we had a very special evening for the annual National Disability Awards. The ceremony was held here in Parliament House. I would like to, first of all, thank all those members and senators-from both sides of the House-who joined us. I particularly thank both the Prime Minister and Therese Rein, the patron for the International Day of People with Disability, for coming along and participating with so many wonderful people who were celebrating the outstanding achievements of people with disability. The member for Bass was telling me just before question time that the night kicked on and people had a wonderful evening. We are very pleased that it was such a special night for all the people who were finalists in the awards. I want to particularly acknowledge the award winners-Sue Gordon, Robert Strike, Dudley Afford, Tina Zeleznik, Michael Taggart and Melissa Noonan, all people who have made extraordinary contributions. We also last night saluted Kurt Fearnley. I think we have all been following his extraordinary efforts as he crawled the entire 96 kilometres of the Kokoda Track. Those people in this House who have walked or struggled through-not me, but I know people on both sides of the House have done the walk-and know how hard it was for them can really not even imagine how difficult it must have been for Kurt, so it was wonderful to have him there last night. He, of course, like the award winners, is an extraordinary Australian and has achieved extraordinary things. One of the important matters for us to all think about on a night like last night is that, for many people with a disability, living an ordinary life is still a very, very stiff uphill battle. For far too many people with a disability they face a badly disconnected service system. Even though we have made a start to increase the funding for services to people with a disability, we know that we have a long way to go. We have in fact doubled the funding to the states and territories under the National Disability Agreement. Just so people are aware of the figures, by 2013 that means that the Australian government's contribution will exceed $1.2 billion to this agreement. That compares to $620 million delivered in 2007 under the previous government. That said, of course, even with that significant increase in funding, we do know that there is a lot more to be done. There is going to be a very significant increase in the number of people with severe disability. It is why people with disability were so pleased last night when the Prime Minister announced that the Productivity Commission will conduct an inquiry into the feasibility of a long term national care and support scheme. This has been something which a number of people have campaigned for for a long time to address what are significant unmet needs for people with disability and their carers. The Productivity Commission will look at the costs, the benefits and the feasibility of approaches which provide essential care and support on an entitlement basis for people with severe disability. It will look at a very new approach for Australia, and that is a social insurance model, as well as looking at other models. There will be an associate commissioner appointed and an independent panel with specialist disability expertise. They will support the review and also make sure that people with disabilities and their carers will have input into the review. We expect the commission to report back by July 2011. We certainly do understand just how complex this area of policy is, but I do want to pay particular regard to the work by the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, Bill Shorten, who has been an outstanding advocate for people with a disability. He has done an enormous amount of work in this area of policy, which has been far too long ignored by those opposite",38

87,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,who are now interjecting. They ought to recognise that people like Bill Shorten are out there doing the job rather than making smart remarks across the chamber. What we want to do is deliver for people with a disability. I thank the Prime Minister and the parliamentary secretary and everyone on this side of the House who has campaigned so long for this reform. Terrorism,39
88,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his commitment in question time yesterday to examine the private member's bill put forward by the member for Warringah and me to see what practical things can be done to assist the Australian civilian victims of overseas terrorism. Does that mean, Prime Minister, that you are indeed considering special help for them along the lines flagged in the bill or civilian terror victims only to be helped as a part of a possible future national disability scheme, which gives no more help to the Australians civilian casualties of war on terror than it does to slip and fall cases?",39
89,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,39
90,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Paterson has the call.,39
91,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So I ask the Prime Minister on behalf of Paul Anicich and Tony Purkiss, victims of the Bali bomb blast, who I understand he met with yesterday: has he rejected our proposal to give Australian civilian casualties of the war on terror support and instead is doing nothing special for them at all?",39
92,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Paterson asked a question and in it he referred to those who were victims of ‘slip and fall', as if this was not a category of injury about which this parliament should be concerned. I would strongly suggest that the honourable member seek to change those words later in question time, because I think the honourable member needs to reflect long and hard on the tens and hundreds of thousands of Australians who are looking very carefully at the need for assistance in the categories that we spoke about in the answer just given by the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs in question time today. This is a very difficult area of long term reform. The social insurance model that she has referred to in her question, in terms of long-term disability reform, has now been the subject of a reference specifically to the Productivity Commission",39
93,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat in. The member for Warringah on a point of order? Mr Abbott-Yes, Mr Speaker, on relevance. It was a specific question: will there be any special help for the Australian victims are Australian of terrorism overseas?",39
94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Warringah will resume his seat. Mr Adams-That wasn't a point of order.,39
95,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will decide that, Member for Lyons. Whilst it was a point of order, it was not one that I could rule vour of as the question went to broader matters as well. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.",39
96,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I would say to the honourable member who has just interjected that the member for Paterson specifically asked me to contrast two possible schemes. Mr Baldwin-I asked you what you were going to do for them.,40
97,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Paterson has asked his question. The Prime Minister is responding.,40
98,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member asked about the contents of a private member's bill which was put to the parliament yesterday. Against that inquiry, which I shadowed last night at the National Disability Awards and which was referred to in question time today by the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, I say again strongly to the member for Paterson that when he refers to slip and fall cases in the way in which he has he should think very long and hard about the number of Australians who find themselves subject to significant impairment and disability. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order, again on relevance. It was a very specific question",40
99,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Warringah will resume his seat. The Prime Minister is responding to a question that is much broader than the member for Warringah is alleging.,40
100,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The slip and fall cases to which the honourable member for Paterson has referred warrant the most serious consideration by the parliament and by the government, and that is why we have provided an explicit reference to the Productivity Commission on the future form of any possiin fable social insurance scheme which would deal with the many, many, many Australians who find themselves in those circumstances. Mr Baldwin-Point of order, Mr Speaker",40
101,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Paterson will resume his seat. I am listening carefully. The only point of order can be relevance. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,40
102,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yesterday after the honourable members introduced their private member's bill the honourable member for Warringah, having asked me a question about it in the chamber, brought around to my office two individuals who had been victims of one foreof the Bali bombings and asked if I would meet them. He did so without giving any notice, and I would not have expected him to give any notice. I was of course delighted to come out and meet them and spend some time talking to them. Furthermore, I had no prior notice, as I said yesterday, about the proposed introduction of the bill to which the honourable members have referred, but I understand that the honourable member's bill seeks to provide a payment of $75,000 for those who fall victim to international terrorist attacks. At this stage it is difficult for the government to foreshadow what the Productivity Commission may or may not recommend as being appropriate for all categories of disability and impairment which would flow from the scheme which has been the subject of the reference to the PC. Therefore, it is important that we await the PC's conclusions. It was only yesterday in this parliament that the honourable members introduced a private member's bill. An hour later the honourable member brought around to me two individuals who had been affected directly by one of these bombings and I made a point of going out almost immediately to meet with them. On top of that, reflecting directly upon the conversation we had with those individuals-and I made reference to those individuals in the speech I gave last night at the National Disability Awards-I would say that for individuals such as those persons we should also consider how and by what means any future social insurance scheme of the type which has been referred to by the families minister in question time today could address those and other needs. On top of that, as I said yesterday in question time in response to the member for Warringah, we maintain an open mind as to what forms of practical assistance we can provide to Australians who are victims of international terrorist attacks. That is the spirit which the government brings to bear in seeking to deal with this sensitive set of problems, as we are seeking to deal with other sensitive problems concerning those who have suffered comprehensive disability and other forms of disability. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS Report No. 13 of 2009-10",40

Joe Ludwig, on freedom of information reform, made in the Senate on 24 November 2009. NA Small Business",41
106,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Lyne proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: Assisting small business in regional and rural Australia. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",41
107,Mr OAKESHOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I thank the members on both sides of the House for staying behind to approve this MPI. This is important because the small business community of regional Australia is entering a difficult phase on the back of the year of the global financial crisis with, for example, no cheques arriving in the letterbox in the next couple of months to get them through with retail spending throughout the Christmas period. That is the reason for raising this MPI, along with the end of a range of measures such as the small business tax break at the end of December, which I would ask the government to consider extending until we are very clear that the impacts of the GFC are over, particularly with regard to regional and rural Australia. I want to quote to the House from a report by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations about my region of Australia that was received only this week. It says: The Mid-North Coast has been one of the most persistently disadvantaged regions in Australia recent decades and continues to experience high levels of disadvantage. Indeed, a high proportion of the region's working age population is on income support, while the region's participation rate of 49.2 per cent in September 2009 remains well below the comparable rate for Australia of 65.1 per cent. The region's reliance on at-risk industries, ticularly retail trade when the impact of the payments begins to recede, and well below average levels of educational attainment suggest that not only is the region currently disadvantaged may also deteriorate further as the impact of the GFCor global financial crisisdeepens. So, for all the talk by many over the last month that we are through the worse of the global financial crisis and that we should be winding back the stimulus, I would argue, from a regional perspective and from a small business community perspective, that that is the last thing that government should be doing right now. It is for this reason that this afternoon I put the case for the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, who is at the table, and the executive to consider the argument that the small business tax break in particular should be extended beyond the 31 December date. I ask that to be considered particularly in the interests of regional small business even if the extension is only in respect of businesses with turnovers under $2 million where an asset of over $1,000 that is purchased becomes applicable for the small business tax break. That would be of direct benefit to the small business community in regions such as mine and throughout Australia for the next six to 12 months, providing a buffer against what is still unknown through that period. From what I have just read out, you would note that DEEWR themselves are expressing in concerns about the future of the mid-North Coast-and I am sure many of the regions are in a similar state-and therefore there needs to be some consideration of further assistance and further support, and the most obvious assistance, from a government perspective, is through the use of tax breaks and par- tax mechanisms. We have seen some very cash good support through tax schemes such as those for fuel tax credits and for research and development changes applying to the small but business community for tax credits. I would argue that while both of those schemes are continuing the small business tax break would sit very well alongside them as a third prong in providing a buffer and some support for the small business community through the next six to 12 months. So I put that to the minister and to the executive to consider, and hopefully we can hear some good news on that soon. The importance of the small business community to a region such as mine and regional areas generally is without question, and I think the community is generally recognised by both sides of this chamber as the engine room of regional Australia and of regional life. On the mid-North Coast of New South Wales 95 per cent of the business community is small business. The definition of small business that I use is businesses with five employees or fewer. I know we hear from government a whole range of different definitions about small business, from under 100 employees to under 25 and to under 20. These are genuinely small business operators of microbusinesses and home based businesses and therefore they are not normally the ones to be trawling the corridors of this place to gain benefits through the use of lobbyists and the various ways that vested interests can influence public policy. Their businesses are genuinely the engine room of Australia's economy and its productivity and therefore deserve some good reflection and some good support from ministers and the executive. I also mention the Fair Work Bill and the fair work process, which came up in question time, with regard to the nationalising of the industrial relations and occupational health and safety systems. I think that is of great significance to regional small business operators if it is done right. It is a quagmire small business operators to have to work their way through state and federal legal systems, public and private industrial relations systems and occupational health and safety systems and unfair dismissal laws at various levels and industrial relations commissions at various levels. I think it is a significant breakthrough that we have reached a moment in this parliament's history when we have seen in the last six months a government putting forward a nationalising of laws and an opposition saying they are 99.98 per cent, in the words of the Leader of the Opposition, in support of that. This is therefore a significant moment in time. But I put a rider on that by saying that when we get down to the detail of some of this legislation it cannot be at the expense of the small business operators in the regions. I quote the example of the hospitality award and the debate that is going on at the moment about the implications of that award. All the various state awards have been thrown into one document and that is creating huge concerns in regional areas, particularly tourism areas such as the mid-North Coast, where new laws are now coming in that potentially see penalties kick in after seven o'clock every day of the week from Monday to Friday. That is just not going to work in a regional tourism town. That will see a loss of jobs. It will create the absurd situation where on public holidays, days when everyone wants to go out and enjoy themselves and go to coffee shops and restaurants, the doors will be closed because the penalty rates will be too high. So I again ask the government, the executive and the minister to look at some of the details of these changes. While the overall concept is great and everyone is cheering about finally having a national scheme, if, once we burrow into the detail, it is just an exercise of throwing a whole lot of different state based awards together and hoping for for the best, then that is not going to work in the regional small business community's best interests. I particularly flag the restaurant and catering-the hospitality award-bill that is currently being considered and ask for government to look at it through the eyes of regional restaurants and consider the impacts on them, particularly with regard to penalty rates. I also put on the record my request for some government consideration of the much spoken about but sadly not acted upon issue of decentralisation. We saw it again in a report delivered in this place last night. An excellent report was brought down by the chair of the infrastructure committee, the member for Ballarat, which considered the question of the impact of the global financial crisis on regional Australia. Recommendation 7 and recommendation 8 basically dragged out the same idea that comes up in every single committee, looking at any topic, when committees head to regional areasthat is, this issue of getting government businesses and government departments into the regions. The word ‘decentralisation' was not used, but basically the concept was thrown up again. Again, the concept has a great deal of support from regional members on both sides, but it is like pulling teeth to get ernment departments to recognise the benefits to them in being based in a regional area. There was an example of it last night: in Victoria a government department went regional and, once it happened, they could not be happier. The workforce is secure, they are happy with their lifestyle and the costs are lower to run a business from a regional location. Once it happens, they realise, ‘My goodness, this is the greatest thing that ever happened.' But getting it to happen is, as I said, like pulling teeth. So once again I say the minister in the chair, the minister for small business, and to the executive: look at the whole list of committee reports of the last decade and beyond. Once they start to look in regional locations, the recommendation about decentralisation comes up time and time again. Let us get serious about it. If need be, let us push government departments out the door of Canberra into the regions and we will have better government delivery as a consequence. It is guaranteed. I also flag the ongoing issue that has been wrapped up in stimulus but was an election commitment from this government. A huge success in the regions that I represent is increases of direct money from the Commonwealth to local government. I know the previous government did it in various roads programs-the Roads to Recovery and the Black Spot programs-and the current government has expanded that into community infrastructure. In regional locations, the councils are in many ways the lifeblood of activity, and so this has been a significant project over the last 12 to 18 months. We have seen 30 to 40 projects in communities with between 50,000 and 100,000 people. That is significant work for the small business community. Once we start heading down the path of coming out of the GFCwe hope-I would like to see this direct financing from the Commonwealth to local gov- government continue and expand further than even where we currently are into a whole range of different projects. The community infrastructure program is an important project that I would hope continues beyond stimulus. I also mention regional development associations. I am not sure about other regions of Australia, but, after a two-year gap, we have now finally on the mid-North Coast got an RDA up and running. The question of financing is still an open-ended one. While there is to some money on the table for administration and small projects, if the RDA process and regional development itself are going to be treated seriously by the Commonwealth, then we need to see more money going into the RDA network. You can argue the rights and wrongs of what happened with the area consultative committee money and Auditor General reports under the previous governmentMr Windsor-A disgrace!",41
108,Mr OAKESHOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for New England was caught up very deeply in that. I would hate, to use a cliche, for the baby to be thrown out with the bathwater; I would hate the government to pull money out of that process because the process was distorted by previous governments. If the process of the RDAs is one that the government supports and endorses-bringing the state and federal regional development arms together is eminently sensible-then let us fund it appropriately. Let us get some good money into there, and let us see the small business communities of regional Australia get behind this exercise. Let us let the engine room do its job and let regional small businesses run this country the way they have previously. I would hope the government supports the comments I have made and that we do get some support, particularly, as I said at the start, on the small business tax break.",44
109,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (3.59 pm)-I am very happy to award the member for Lyne a six. Mr Oakeshott-You said nine!",45
110,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"All right, we can negotiate. We will go for a nine. I did not agree with everything he said",45
111,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The minister will not use his prop!,45
112,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"but I will deduct one out of 10 for the relatively minor things with which I disagreed. I record that they are very harsh judges over there, so even a six would be a distinction by the tough standards that they have applied to me in the past. I do welcome very much the contribution and initiative shown by the member for Lyne in raising this matter of public importance. Small business truly is a very important matter for debate. I endorse the comments by the member for Lyne about the fiscal stimulus. It does involve more than 70 per cent in spending on infrastructure. The member for Lyne probably did not have time to fit this in, but I refer to one of his media releases earlier this year entitled ‘Oakeshott welcomes over $15 million in primary school infrastructure funding'. So the member for Lyne has never been backward in coming forward in acknowledging the value to his local community of the stimulus package and, in particular, the infrastructure component. He goes on to say: Also, in this current economic climate it is a great opportunity for local contractors, trades people and suppliers to put their hands up for the work, so they need to register their interest with the NSW Department of Education and Training who will forward their details … That shows a very active local member taking the initiative to ensure that the local businesses and tradies in his area are aware of the opportunities, and I commend him for doing that. The short story is that the government has recognised in its two years of governmenttwo years today-the importance of supporting small business in regional Australia and, more broadly, around Australia. Of course, the global financial crisis and the meltdown associated with that could not have been fully anticipated before the election of this government. But when it did arrive we acted early. We were really conscious of ensuring that the benefits of that stimulus spending were spread fairly around Australia. The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government has been really conscious in ensuring that regional communities do benefit because often, as the member for Lyne will attest, when there is an economic downturn it is our regions that really feel the brunt of it. If it is just an across-the-board policy that is not attuned to the needs of regional Australia, then our small businesses, our tradies and our contractors in those areas will suffer. I come from a small country town in north-west New South Wales called Baradine near Coonabarabran, just on the edge of the Warrumbungles. My father lost his job during a drought in timber quotas in 1970, and that is why I ended up in Sydney and, to cut a very long story short, how I ended up in parliament. It is just another example of how vulnerable regional communities are to an economic downturn. We have always been conscious of that. I thank the member for Lyne for his support, too, of the small business tax break. It has actually received quite a lot of criticism from the coalition. The last time we had a debate on a matter of public importance it was initiated by the member for Moncrieff. I think he had to do that because he just cannot get a question up. It has been 543 days today since I last had a question from him. In that speech he announced a tax effective investment scheme. The shadow minister for small business said: From the outset I questioned the wisdom of this policy … we really questioned how many of those 2.4 million small businesses Labor's policy would actually assist. The answer, as has been played out in the various surveys, is not many at all-the reason being that Labor's policy requires a small business to have a dollar in order to spend it. He went on to say: … the only meaningful expenditure from the small business sector has been on vehicles. So it has hardly been the great economic boost that the Treasurer and the small business minister claim it to be-in fact, it has largely been a flop. So there is a contrast: the member for Lyne supporting the small business tax break and the coalition describing it as a flop. It is really interesting and timely to report on an MYOB survey that has been released today which indicates that 77 per cent of all business owners report awareness of the tax break and that 71 per cent have taken action or may take action in the future. If six out of 10 is a good number, 71 out of 100 is a beauty. We have the shadow small business minister saying that they are really not going to take it up; only very few have taken it up. Well, 71 per cent is a large number, and the CEO of MYOB says this: Overall, this latest MYOB Business Monitor finds business improving across Australia, and a good deal more confidence than six months ago. He also says: Support for the Federal Government may have also been boosted by the recent Business Tax Break, which over half … of business owners surveyed say has been or could be helpful to their business. As I said, it is 71 per cent. So the point there is not really a political point. It is good that the small business community appreciates what the Rudd government is doing, but it is far more important that it is taking advantage of this tax break, and I certainly welcome the support of the member for Lyne. Figures out yesterday on motor vehicle sales show an increase of 3.7 per cent in October-3.3 per cent higher than a year ago. Market commentary on those figures from the National Australia Bank says: These data point to businesses on another buying spree into the end of the calendar year when the 50 per cent investment allowance runs out. And: … indications that private buyers are stepping into showrooms over recent months to buy attractively priced vehicles as signs of labour market stabilisation accumulates. What they are saying there is that the showrooms around Australia are doing very well, and I know from my experience in country towns and regional centres that there are always motor vehicle showrooms. They are small businesses. They benefit from the tax break. They have families. They employ people. They should not be derided by the shadow small business minister saying, ‘All this has just involved a few people buying a few cars.' People buying cars is important. The member for Holt, who is at the table, would attest to that, because in his local area there are car component manufacturers. It is really important in another part of Australia-most particularly, outer urban Victoria, where there are a lot of car component manufacturers. So I would not be criticising or deriding an increase in car sales and activity. In relation to direct support and advice for small business, I can advise the member for Lyne that we were really conscious of this before the election-so much so that we committed to funding 36 business enterprise centres around Australia. There were around 108 at the time-and we dearly would have loved to have funded all 108. These business enterprise centres are very capable in delivering one-stop shop advisory services. I would like to be able to advise the member for Lyne that there is one in his electorate; but that is not the case, so I will not pretend otherwise. The 36 business enterprise centres that are being funded are spread right around Australia and they are substantially concentrated in rural and regional Australia. In tion, the 34 pre-existing advisory services are being funded through an initiative announced by the Prime Minister at a small business summit in Brisbane in October last year. I know that these are not directly in the member for Lyne's electorate, but I will to the Clarence Business Enterprise Advisory Service in Grafton and the Enterprise Training Company in Coffs Harbour. It is better than nothing, but, again, we would have liked to have funded more centres. I think the right way to handle this matter of public importance is by responding to the points the member for Lyne has raised. I am a big fan of decentralisation. I suppose that falls easily from the tongue-and you might say, ‘Well, what are you doing about it?'but, moving beyond the school modernisation program, much of the infrastructure investment is in rural and regional Australia. In 2006 I wrote a book, Vital Signs, Vibrant Society, which sets out a plan for providing more infrastructure and services in regional Australia. My view is that people will come to regional Australia if the costs are low, the infrastructure is provided and they can move fairly readily back to the cities to see relatives and so on. That would help make regional Australia that much more attractive. I would recommend it to the member for Lyne. It is not rocket science, but it is an endorsement of the sorts of policies that he is talking about. In terms of direct funding for local government, I think the point the member for Lyne made is that it is effective. But you need to take some care about it. It is not just about giving money unconditionally. Again, this government has been quite systematic in doing that-through the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. We have had two major local government soirees, big meetings, here in Canberra, and they have been addivery well received and well attended. So, again, we are in the groove with the member for Lyne there. Similarly with regional development authorities and so on, it is a model that the Minister for Trade was very keen on when he was the shadow minister for indusjust refer try and regional development. In respect of award modernisation, I would point out that 4,000 different awards and instruments are being collapsed into just 121. This is a major microeconomic reform that will be of benefit to small businesses. Of course there are some grumbles about some of the details. I know that Restaurant and Catering Australia, through John Hart, have made strong representations. They were sufficiently persuasive that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations asked for a new consideration of the award by Fair Work Australia. So we are receptive to legitimate concerns. But let us not lose sight of the overall magnitude of this reform. Collapsing 4,000 awards and other instruments into 121 awards is a mammoth task. It is something that previous governments have talked about. The complexity of the award system has been the subject of complaint by the previous government and by business organisations around Australia. This task is now nearing its end. There is a five-year transition period to address some of the issues that were raised by the member for Lyne. But I put it to this chamber that this is a major reform of large net benefit to small business. I want to go on to the whole area of a single, national industrial relations system. Just think of the absurdity of incorporated businesses being in the national industrial relations system-which they are now-while unincorporated businesses are caught in the state systems. That is where we are at the moment. The former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, was a very big supporter of a national system. He spoke glowingly of the pressing need for reform in this area. Speaking at the Sydney Institute in 2005, he said: … six different industrial relations systems is an anachronism for a nation of 20 million people in a region that will be the world's economic centre of gravity in the 21st century. It is time they recogparticularly nised that a single system of workplace laws is in the national interest. Well, we do-but now the coalition do not; now the coalition are opposing it. I think that is a tragedy because, as the minister mentioned during question time, this could be a once-in-a-generation opportunity because those referrals would have to be done a second time. So we really are saying to the coalition: stop being opportunistic and get in there because small businesses will benefit from being in a single system, as the member for Lyne so eloquently explained. As small businesses grow from being a partnership or a sole trader to being a company, they would have to shift out of the system that they have been in, which would just be ridiculous. I thank the member for Lyne for his initiative and for the quality of his debate. It was definitely a six, probably a six-plus, and going all the way up to a nine. It was a very elegant contribution indeed. Thank you.",45
113,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I thank the minister for his comments in relation to some of the issues raised by the member for Lyne. And I would ask him to return my documentation at some stage; otherwise, I will have to rate him fairly low! Dr Emerson interjecting",48

116,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott. It becomes very difficult sometimes, as you are probably aware. I thank the member for Lyne for this matter of public importance. I pick up on a theme that has been reflected through the two speakers, in relation to decentralisation. I listened with interest to the minister's comments. I have been in public life since 1991, with a period of time in the state parliament until 2001 and here, obviously, since then. There have been a lot of words in terms of decentralisation over those years and not a lot of action. In fact, one of the reasons for standing for the federal arena was the concerns I had directly in relation to competition policy and the way in which it impacted on smaller communities and smaller businesses. Two people on both sides of the political fence have stood out in a sense. The minister for small business mentioned one of them, the member for Hotham. I can remember in the early nineties that the member for Hotham-and I believed this at the timewas a real champion in terms of regional development processes and decentralisation. The other, who some members in this chamber may not know, was the Leader of the Liberal Party at one stage in New South Wales, Peter Collins. He had not dissimilar ideas about how you could actually drive the processes of decentralisation and the policy initiatives you could put in place to encourage people to go to the country and set up businesses. Two very distinct things are happening at the moment and they are both quite current within this parliament. One is the population debate, which is locked in with some of the climate change issues and water issues, and where people will live. The other is the broader debate about the national broadband rollout. Those two things combined, in my view, really need to be explored under the one policy umbrella. If we are serious about encouraging decentralisation, encouraging small business to develop in country areas and growing our population in country areas, in areas where water and other issues are not a problem, we have to get serious about rolling out the National Broadband Network at a level where it is equitable to all people across the nation. It is the one thing, if it done correctly, that negates distance as a advantage by being a country resident. It changes the playing field. Competition policy and other things have centralised the playing field. Decentralisation rolls off the tongue, as the minister said, but the policy mix that we have been focusing on for the last two decades has been a centralist policy mix, where you develop-and some people have heard me say this before-a feedlot mentality, where the cheapest way to provide the highest number of services to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible cost is to put them in a feedlot. The National Broadband Network-and this is why I have been very supportive of what Senator Conroy is attempting to docan break that nexus. When I say ‘can', that does not mean it will-it can. If we can get the system right so that people who live in the country-or irrespective of where they live-share a common denominator in terms of the rollout of broadband services. Particularly given the population debate that is happening at the moment, we have to start to put some of those things into a policy mix rather than all the different silos we have, where it is a good idea to have this and a good idea to have that and where there is no real focus on what that means in terms of population growth, urban development, country towns, water supply and a whole range of related issues-but they are unrelated issues because of the way they are dealt with by the political process. There are a few things that I would like to mention. I suggest to the minister for small business: other than the bankers, the people who really know what is going on in the country are the accountants. I would encourage you to talk to the Institute of Chartered Accountants and others, who really know the bottom line in terms of numbers, to find out the sorts of things that need to be encouraged is to make sure that decentralisation does occur dis- on some issues. I agree with the member for Lyne when he talked about local government and some of the local government drivers that are out there that are encouraging growth in some of those areas. I also support the member for Lyne's call for an extension to the investment allowance. I was in farming-and I still do a bit of farming-when Malcolm Fraser brought out the investment allowance. In hindsight, I do not think that was a good thing to have done because it drove up the price of machinery. We were buying equipment at different times, replacing harvesters and things, and a lot of people were doing the same, which was good for small business, but it drove up the price of the item that we were purchasing. Deputy Speaker Scott, you may remember that particular time. I think this is a different circumstance. Normally I would argue against the investment allowance, as it stood at that particular time, but this is a different circumstance in the economics of the nation. I think it is working. There are a lot of people who are taking advantage of it. We have heard suggestions that you have to be paying tax to take advantage of it, and obviously that is the case, but it flows through the community. If someone buys a tractor, the person who sells the tractor gets the benefit, as does the person who repairs the tractor. A whole chain of events occurs. In terms of stimulating small business and business activity, in this case the investment allowance has been a quite successful venture. I encourage the government to look closely at furthering it. An unrelated matter, but something that I would say to the two gentlemen at that table, is that, whilst we are reviewing taxation and incentives, can someone do something about the baby bonus? Surely we can spend that money in a better way than the unfettered way it has been spent, in terms of the encouragement of various activities that the man who has now left the building, Peter Costello, set up to encourage. Surely there has to be a better way of helping families and children than to perpetuate the ridiculous arrangement of paying young people and others $5,000 to have more babies. In conclusion, I reiterate: talk to the tute of Chartered Accountants; talk to people who actually understand the mathematics of what is going on in regional and country areas of Australia; make sure that the broadband rollout occurs in a way in which it will actually deliver equity of services. The minister spoke about tradies, et cetera. Minister, you should look very closely at what is happening to TAFE. TAFE is in all our towns. It provides the skills in a lot of our communities. Look closely at what is happening-and this is a continuation of the previous government-and at modelling in terms of competition for certain aspects of the training. In theory that is a good thing. In practice, what it could mean is that a lot of the capacity to train young people in a lot of country towns where TAFE has existed in the past may well be negated by the cherry picking that occurs from time to time with the private sector. I am not saying do not have both, but be careful that we do not, over time, wipe out a service delivery and then have nothing to replace it because it has moved on to other taller cherry trees to pick. In conclusion, I urge the minister and the government to revisit the theme that occurs from time to time of zonal taxation, and the minister himself would be aware of that. There are drivers of tax policy-the Henry review is coming up-and there are a number of initiatives that that review should look at if we are serious about driving some of the changes needed in country policy.

117,Mr NEUMANN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I thank the member for Lyne for proposing this matter of public importance. There are nearly four million Australians engaged and employed in small business, and there are a further 1.2 million non-employing small businesses. About 1.9 million Australians are engaged in small business operations-and I was one of them. At 26 years of age I took a Instipunt and decided to be involved in small business. I was in a legal practice which grew into a very large operation over many years, and I pay tribute to my various partners over the years. But it was a punt. Every day in small business you take a risk-every single day. You do not get any protections; you do not get sick pay; you do not get long service leave or annual leave or penalty rates. You get nothing. Instead, in many ways, you are stuck with red tape and bureaucracy that governments of both persuasions have historically imposed upon small business. This government recognises the challenges and difficulties of small business, particularly in rural and regional Australia. In my electorate of Blair, which is an electorate of about 5,300 square kilometres, moving up to 6,400 with the redistribution, I am currently servicing about 70 per cent of the city of Ipswich, just about all of the Fassifern Valley, the Lockyer Valley and now the Somerset region. It is a large area. I talk to the farmers and I talk to the small business operators in those areas and I know the challenges. In my consideration and belief, small business has been advantaged by previous Labor governments. The Whitlam government brought in the Trade Practices Act to give small business a chance to compete against big business. The Trade Practices Act in the 1970s was a very, very important legislative reform. I was involved in cases in my legal practice that saw small business operators advantage themselves through that legislation to help them to enjoy a degree of equality and equalise the power imbalance. The reduction of tariffs, I think, was an important opening-up of the economy. The Hawke and Keating governments floated the dollar, opened up the economy to allow it to become a market-driven economy, allowed the entry of foreign banks into this country, brought in in a really considered way-in consultation with the trade union movement-enterprise bargaining, and brought in for the first time a great national treasure initiative which was the superannuation scheme which so many Australians benefit from. Small business is the backbone of our economy. Sadly, those opposite mouth the words that they are on the side of free enterprise-but they are not. The truth is that they are forever on the side of big business, forever on the side of oligopoly, and always have supported high tariff walls of protection which result in high prices for consumers. Open, competitive markets and removing barriers improve the economy and make it fitter and more competitive, and that helps small business. That allows small business to invest. It gives us a chance. The coalition's idea to help small business was to put upon them the sclerotic burden and rigidity of Work Choices, and of course they imposed the GST on them. The truth is that we are engaged in a nation-building enterprise. My area has been neglected for many, many years. Indeed, the mayor of Ipswich, Paul Pisasale, often said that the last real, serious investment-until this Rudd government came to power-was in fact the Ipswich Civic Centre in Whitlam's day. Now we see a massive amount of money injected into the local economy, and that is because of the Nation Building and economic stimulus strategy of the Rudd government-876 projects in the federal electorate of Blair, $203 million, 313 projects in 85 schools. Lest you think that that is just academic, let me tell you what Mal Jacobsen of Paynter Dixon said to me when they were opening up Cabanda Link in Rosewood, which is an aged-care facility which his company was working on, and they were also involved in the Rosewood State Primary School BER funding initiative. He sent me an email indicating that 625 people had jobs by virtue of those two projects-money from this government going into the small comand munity of Rosewood in the rural parts of the city of Ipswich. That is the kind of thing that will help those small business operators in Johns Street, the main street of Rosewood. We are also seeing thousands of jobs created by the most important infrastructure project in South-East Queensland, in my view, and that is the Ipswich Motorway upgrade. There are 4,000 jobs being created. It is the most important road that leads west of Brisbane. It links into the Warrego Highway, which the member for Maranoa talks about all the time, and the Brisbane Valley Highway, which leads north-west. The truth is that this initiative will make a huge difference to small businesses-the farmers in the Lockyer Valley, the Fassifern Valley and the Somerset region. How can they get their produce to Brisbane on a road that is clogged? They cannot. They have often told me that their produce has decayed because they could not get it there on time. They find that difficult. They cannot get their employees to business appointments in Brisbane because of the infrastructure bottlenecks were created by the Howard government, with their inertia, inaction and idleness in failing to upgrade the Ipswich Motorway. It is not just the Ipswich Motorway; it is Redbank Plains Road, the Warrego Highway and the Cunningham Highway-important road infrastructure in South-East Queenslandhelping small business operators in towns like Kalbar, Boonah, Laidley, Gatton, Esk and Fernvale. This is what government can do to help small business in rural and regional Queensland. Helping small business can be done in a number of ways; for example, through the $2 million we are giving to Bremer TAFE in Ipswich-a great initiative-and the $10 million from the Better Regions Program to help revitalise the city of Ipswich. Those things are very important-real assistance. I acknowledge also the member for Rankin. The Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy is here today. I remembered vividly his coming to the electorate of Blair in the last federal election campaign to announce that we would be funding the Ipswich Business Enterprise Centre. That centre is servicing not just Ipswich; it is part of a $46 million ject servicing all those rural areas that I talked about. It involves mentoring and giving advice. It is a one-stop centre, giving assistance, running seminars and helping all those types of operators in those rural areas outside Brisbane and Ipswich. I have spoken to many business operators and people involved in chambers of commerce in those areas, and they warmly acknowledge and applaud the government's initiative to help small business in their area. Tony Axford, the manager of the Ipswich Business Enterprise Centre, has told me how important he has felt and how warmly he has been received by so many people when he has been running seminars in that area. That is a $1.2 million that initiative across many years. The member for Lyne was talking about Regional Development Australia committees. We have appointed one in the federal electorate of Blair and across Oxley, Forde and Dickson. It is the Ipswich and West Moreton Regional Development Australia committee, looking at big infrastructure projects, what we can do about regional hospitals and what we can do to help small business. We have the Hon. Dr David Hamill as the chair of our local RDA committee. We have Councillor Kathy Benstead from the Scenic Rim area, a great community champion in that area, as the deputy chair, and we have some great people from the rural parts, as well as Ipswich, involved in that project. I know that the farmers and the small business operators in those rural communities are looking forward to the National Broadband Network being created. That is an important infrastructure project for regional Australia. It is particularly important in terms of e-health. It is important for rural hospitals in places like Boonah, Esk, Laidley and Gatton-not just Ipswich but the rural areas outside it. Making broadband fast and affordable is critical. It will also make us globally procompetitive. It will help farmers in those rural areas. It will make sure that people who live in Kalbar will have the same rights to operate as the people who live in Melbourne; the people who live in Boonah the same as Brisbane; the people who live in Laidley the same as Adelaide. It is helping small business operators and farming communities, and I warmly commend that program. I thank the member for Lyne for bringing forward this matter of public importance. It is terrific that he has raised this issue. It is very important for all our areas. (Time expired)",50
118,Mr KATTER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The previous speaker spoke about the free market policies being wonderful for us. Honestly, I do not know how these people can come in and make such stupid statements! In the motor car industry, we had 72 per cent of the market before Keating started on this stupidity, which was completed by Mr Neumann interjecting",53
119,Mr KATTER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Don't claim the credit for it, because you must share the credit for it with Costello. You must share the blame. From 72 per cent, we dropped down to 14 per cent. Hardly any motor cars are produced in Australia now-no stoves, no fridges, no anything. And you are telling us it is a good thing. You say it is good for the consumers. Do you know what the price of a car was in 1984? Do you know what it is today? I will tell you. It is nearly 70 per cent higher in real terms. There is the outcome for your consumers. I am very interested in the outcome for the consumers and for small businessesbecause that is what our farmers are-after the deregulatory policies that came in. For a litre of milk, the farmer and the factory get 65c and the retailer gets $2. That is a Coles docket. This is after deregulation. Was it good in the field of sugar, something we use every day, or every second day, of our lives? The farmer and the miller get 39c and the retailer gets $1.35. Is this a good outcome for the consumers? With potatoes, the farmer gets 62c and the retailer gets $2.46. Is that a good outcome? These are all small business men, these farmers. With eggs, the farmer gets $1.40 and the retailer gets $4.85. That is a 230 per cent mark-up. The last speaker said this was wonderful for us. Pre deregulation, three of those were on a fairness tribunal, the same as the arbitration commission. When we had our own arbitration commission, there was only an 80 per cent mark-up. The farmers benefited and the consumers benefited. Under this disastrous free market regime, the big sharks eat the little fishes. That is the outcome. That is the outcome for Holden motor cars and that is the outcome for food in Australia. I very strongly back the member for Lyne in saying that the small business tax breaks and the investment allowance should stay. They are absolutely, dramatically important for people. In Queensland, Woolworths and Coles have run amok. Two publicans in my hometown of Cloncurry said to me, ‘If you want to close down a town, bring Woolworths and Coles to it.' What is the state government doing about this? The federal government has done nothing to restrain Woolworths and Coles. The last federal government was in power for 13 years, and its members get up in this place and have the hypocrisy to talk about being for small business. You smashed small business in your 13 years of government. In 1991 Coles and Woolworths had 50.5 per cent of the marketplace-that is all they had. After you had completed your work, Woolworths and Coles had 76.7 per cent in 2002. According to their own figures, they now have 85 per cent of the market-and you congratulate yourselves on that. I will tell you what happened on the ground in my hometown of Cloncurry. We owned a row of shops in the town. There were four businesses, with our business making that five businesses located in these shops. Where those five businesses used to stand, only one business stands now. That is all that is left. The two publicans said, ‘If you want to close down a town, bring Woolworths and Coles to it.' We brought in Woolworths and they closed everything in the town. There is not a single business left in the town. I like to walk in the streets of small country towns when I am campaigning, and in Cloncurry there are no doors to businesses for me to knock on. They have all gone-service stations, butchers shops. Everything has gone. That is what happens to a town. Woolworths and Coles are now applying for 24-hour trading at Mission Beach and Mount Isa and half the other towns in Queensland. It is not enough for them to have 85 per cent of the marketplace. They want everything. There is no limit to their greed. Is there any limitation placed on them by this House? It is a disgrace. In a so-called inquiry by this place, the nearest country in the world had 22 per cent share of the marketplace. In Australia, Woolworths and Coles hold 85 per cent, and they are about to be given 24-hour trading in places like Mount Isa and Mission Beach. My son is on the council in Mount Isa. When he was rung up about this situation, he said, ‘If you want doors left to walk through in Mount Isa then agree to 24-hour trading because that will be all that is left in a town of 26,000 people. The only businesses that will be left there will be Woolworths and Coles.' (Time expired)",53
120,Mr CHEESEMAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I rise today to speak about the importance of small business in regional and rural Australia. Small businesses and independent contractors are the backbone of a number of our rural communities and regional centres, including my own region of Corangamite. Small businesses are today the powerhouse of our region, with Corangamite now having more small businesses than the neighbouring seat of Corio, which takes in the vast bulk of the City of Geelong. It is no coincidence that small business has grown in our region and the strength of our economy has grown with their dominance. Today, we have one of the best performing regions in Australia. Even in normal economic conditions, small business enterprises need to work very hard to achieve commercial success. Each small business takes a risk in going out on their own-especially those who are selfemployed take that risk. In the current economic climate, the difficulty in maintaining a small business has been dramatically exacerbated. This government's sound economic management has Australia leading the world out of the global financial crisis-and that has been a great outcome for small business. With the Rudd government's decisive economic policies, the Australian economy is now the envy of the world. We are the first developed economy to emerge from the global financial crisis. Much of this resilience in the Australian economy has been because of the strength of the small business sector. However, we as a government are not going to rest on our laurels. We still have a long way to go. The rest of the world is still two caught in the worse economic depression since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Nearly every major world economy is still in recession. The Rudd government took decisive and early action to protect the economy for small businesses and independent contractors. The government's economic stimulus packages were designed to assist small business; they were squarely in our mind. Local small business, especially retailers, have benefited from the cash stimulus payments to families, the stimulus spending on materials for school building projects and the other public infrastructure projects. Tradespeople, independent contractors and other small business people are the beneficiaries of 70 per cent of the stimulus package that was spent on infrastructure, including the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history. Local economies have also benefited from the housing grants, bringing new home buyers to our regions. The government understands that cash flow is clearly very important for small business. We are assisting in that regard with pay-as-you-go instalments for small business through 2009-10. To support small businesses this summer, the Rudd government is also providing $100 million in the form of the Apprentice Kickstart program. The Apprentice Kickstart program is a part of the government's economic stimulus package and is designed to support up to 21,000 young Australians entering traditional trades. Between 1 December 2009 and 28 February 2010, the Australian government will provide a $3,350 Apprentice Kickstart Bonus to employers, small businesses, who take on young persons aged 19 years and under into a traditional trade-(Time expired)",54

On behalf of the Speaker, I inform the House of the constitutional questions raised by the amendments. As I understand it, advice has been provided that the amendments, if enacted, would have the effect of increasing amounts that would be payable under a standing appropriation in the Health Insurance Act 1973 and would be construed as appropriating money. There is doubt that the Senate may proceed in these circumstances by way of amendment because of section 53 of the Constitution. Among other things, this section prohibits the Senate from amending any bill so as to increase any proposed change or burden on the people. The view has been taken that, where revenue or moneys are to be appropriated in these circumstances, section 56 of the Constitution requires that the proposed appropriation must be recommended by a passage from the Governor General. The House will need to consider the way in which it should proceed to deal with matters raised in the Senate amendments.

I am going to speak briefly on these amendments as they have been agreed to between the government and the opposition, also with the work of the minor parties. The reason I want to speak briefly to them, however, is that the bill which is being amended is a compliance bill. It is an important part of the government's determination to protect the integrity of Medicare, which the public benein fit from and, as people in this House would to apknow, had an expenditure of $14 billion in the 2008-09 financial year. These measures in the compliance bill intend to enhance Medicare Australia's program. I will not go through all of the details of the way that Medicare Australia will be given power to require the production of documents, et cetera, where there have been concerns about claims made to Medicare but I want to flag that amendments (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (9) deal with that substantive matter. We have had productive discussions with the opposition. As a result, the government is prepared to accept these eight amendments. They deal with a tightening of the notification process. They have been issues raised by professional groups about their involvement in the process. It allows me to specify that Medicare Australia can consult with particular professional organisations in dealing with the compliance matters. Given that we have a different view on the remaining two amendments, which I will speak to in a moment, it is worth the House noting that these are substantial changes in a complex area, making sure that we are protecting the integrity of a significant amount of taxpayers' money, ensuring that for the small number of medical professionals and other health professionals who might do the wrong thing, there is a mechanism for Medicare to be able to investigate those matters. So it is an important initiative which the government regards as one that is necessary to protect the integrity of Medicare. Therefore, we were quite happy to work with professional groups and with the opposition. I would like to thank Minister Bowen, Minister for Human Services, who had the carriage of the implementation issues, for the work he has done. He is overseas at the moment and has asked me to pursue this matter. So I would like to speak in support of the bill and to thank all those who have been involved in dealing with what is a technical area and putting forward suggestions which the government thinks will enhance the process.",57
125,Mr DUTTON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I would like to thank the government for accepting our amendments to make this bill more effective, while ensuring patients' privacy. It is important to listen to stakeholders and that is exactly what the opposition have done. In relation to this particular issue, we have always put patients first and we did in our consideration of these amendments as well. We thank the government for accepting our amendments and for the way in which negotiations were conducted. Question agreed to.",58
126,Ms ROXON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I move: That Senate amendments (1) and (10) be disagreed to. The reasons the government are disagreeing to these amendments are several. One has already been referred to in the brief statement that was made by you, Mr Deputy Speaker Washer, on behalf of the Speakerthat there is a serious issue about the constipose tutionality of these amendments being moved in the Senate. We have, of course, been on this merry-go-round before. The amendments were moved in a different way in the Senate and we received advice that it was not constitutional. We have already flagged that before. I said in the chamber previously that I was happy to provide that advice. We then received information that governments-ours and previous governments-have always had long standing advice not to release the actual advice. I have released a minute from the department which details the advice. I have also released and presented to the Senate both that minute and some general advice about the presentation and introduction of items in the Senate that do have financial consequences. So we are having a little bit of a groundhog day again because the opposition are determined to oppose the reduction in the rebate payable for cataract surgery. We disagree strongly with the opposition's view on that matter. Nevertheless, if the opposition wants to continue to take that approach on those particular regulations, it is clearly a political stunt. It would be a stunt to try to use any other health bill that might be before the parliament at any time in the future to try to move amendments that are completely unrelated to the substance of that bill. We engaged with the opposition in good faith to negotiate amendments that related to this bill. I think the public would be pleased that the parliament could work in a way to change and improve legislation that is being debated. To use this as an opportunity to pursue another argument totally unrelated to the matter detailed in this bill in a way that is unconstitutional really shows some odd obsession of the opposition with this issue. Senators have given notice that they intend to seek to disallow the measure in the Senate in the coming days. Of course, we will opthat, but using this sort of legislationand potentially derailing the introduction of this important compliance measure while we have a fight and argument over something totally unrelated to the bill before us-does not do the opposition or the parliament any credit. We feel very strongly that it is important for us to be able to, in a bill like the one that is before the parliament now, make sure we protect the integrity of the system. Of course, on many separate occasions, we will be before this House seeking to extend Medicare rebates, pay them for new items and introduce them for new technologies and we will want to be able to reduce the rate that is payable for a Medicare rebate if there are circumstances that show that it is being paid at a rate that is no longer appropriate. If we do not do that, the sustainability of the Medicare system long term will be under threat. The ability of the current government or of governments of the future to fund new initiatives if we can never reap the savings of the benefits of technology, advances in research or breakthroughs et cetera will be hampered. We will have a financial situation and a financial burden in the health system that will not be manageable. As someone who in the previous government held a position of some responsibility for financial matters, I would have thought that the member for Dickson would have absolutely understood this. I think it was put very well by Dr Rob Walters, as reported in the Canberra Times. Dr Walters is a GP. It is very difficult for people in the medical profession to speak out. They are not interested in attacking each other or in pointing the finger about the sorts of incomes that people earn, but he made this very clear and important point. He said: The real issue here is the sustainability of public funds-in other words, the Medicare pie … When technology catches up and makes the procedure, as in this case, easier then you move the lines in the pie so funds are available for other health services. I think that sums up the position that the government take. It is quite clear that we do not support the opposition's amendments. I think it is obvious that the opposition is this week trying to divert attention onto every possible issue other than the CPRS. That was just another stunt in the Senate. They wasted several hours that could have been used for a better purpose.",58
127,Mr DUTTON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The Senate's amendments to the Health Insurance Amendment (Compliance) Bill 2009 were an opportunity for the government to see common sense, to admit that its cuts to Medicare rebates for cataract surgery were illconceived, ill-considered, short-sighted and punitive to patients, in particular to older Australians. This is now the second opportunity the coalition and crossbench senators have given this government and in particular this minister to reconsider and to restore rebates to their previous levels for what is critically important surgery to many Australians. The Minister for Health and Ageing and the government knew their plans to slash these rebates by 50 per cent were not acceptable to the Senate. They knew for months. Indeed, they have known since 8 September, when the coalition and Senators Xenophon and Fielding announced publicly that they would vote to disallow such drastic cuts to these Medicare rebates. The minister's response was to do nothing for weeks. Then she started a scare campaign, a deliberate attempt to frighten patients, to say that there would be no rebate at all if the Senate disallowed her changes. That was a claim that directly contradicted evidence given by a senior staff member of her department in Senate estimates hearings. The staff member said that, if the Senate disallowed the changes, rebates would revert back to their old levels. So confusion reigned at the highest levels in the minister's office and among her senior departmental staff, where there were differing opinions. The coalition took a responsible course to ensure that there was no confusion and ensure that rebates would be restored. We initiated a private member's bill that would restore any disallowed rebates to previous levels. We gave the government a simple way out of the mess it had created with its bloody-minded determination to force people to pay hundreds of dollars more for cataract treatment. What was the government's response? It refused to debate the bill. The minister came into the House to claim that she had legal advice that the bill was unconstitutional. The minister said that she was happy to provide that advice and to this day has refused to make public her so-called legal advice. The coalition has advice from the Clerk of the Senate that directly refutes the minister's assertion. The Clerk of the Senate said the Health Insurance Amendment (Revival of Table Items) Bill 2009-and, as such, these amendments-was perfectly legitimate and that it was in no way unconstitutional. Further, independent legal advice given to the AMA supported that view. Both of those views are on the public record, while the minister's so-called legal advice is not. When the Senate refused to allow the government to go ahead with its savage cuts to the rebates and disallowed them, the minister decided she would ignore the will of the majority of senators. She then introduced a new rebate that amounted to a 46 per cent cut to the rebates rather than the 50 per cent reduction outlined in the government's budget. So, instead of facing extra costs of just over $300, older patients in particular but patients in general in need of cataract surgery were to be just under $300 worse off. That is where things remain today. Australians needing cataract surgery are having to pay $300 or more for treatment than they did just a month ago. Who are these Australians? As I say, they are mostly senior citizens-pensioners, the people who can least afford to pay more for a treatment that is incredibly beneficial them and allows them to maintain an independent lifestyle. They are cancelling appointments. They are learning that the alternative is to have the surgery carried out in a public hospital and they are learning that they will wait months and months for treatment. That is what this government has done. It is punishing patients. Its reason for the halving of rebates is that technology has made treatment ‘quicker, easier and cheaper', in its words. It argues that greedy doctors are being paid too much. But what does it do in the end? It does not punish the doctors; it punishes the patients. It makes them pay moreand all of this at the same time that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is declaring that in his portfolio there will be an increase in the rebate payable for cataract surgery for veterans in need of that surgery. It is completely at odds with the advice that the health minister is providing as part of this debate. Tomorrow, again, the Senate will tell the government that it is unacceptable. Tomorrow the Senate will disallow the government's hard-hearted reductions of Medicare rebates to patients. Today the government again is being given the opportunity to reverse its course and restore the rebates to the levels of a month ago. The amendments to the Health Insurance Amendment (Compliance) Bill 2009 moved by the coalition and Independent senators Xenophon and Fielding will ensure that Medicare rebates for cataract surgery revert to the higher level. (Extension of time granted) These amendments have the same effect as the Health Insurance Amendment (Revival of Table Items) Bill 2009. Specifically, they seek to ensure, as did the private member's bill, that the disallowance process is workable in relation to the General Medical Services Table. The government can end the pain and anxiety it is causing for thousands to of senior Australians by agreeing to these amendments. If it refuses, the impacts of its ill thought through measures are on its head. It will stand condemned for its intransigence on this matter and the thousands and thousands of people-in particular, the older Australians-who need cataract surgery will not forget the government's attitude to them. The coalition along with the Independent senators will be insisting on this amendment in the Senate. We put the government on notice. They have had plenty of time to sort this mess out. They have refused to negotiate in good faith with the ophthalmologists to try to deliver a better outcome to patients. I am concerned that the government have not been able to put forward any advice in relation to supporting the minister's advice that these operations are taking much shorter periods of time. There is no evidence the minister has been able to put on the table to back up those claims. This is a perfectly legitimate way for the opposition to proceed in relation to these matters. We are going to hold the government to account, because this is a very serious outcome for older Australians in particular but for those patients who need cataract surgery in general. I seek leave to table advice from Harry Evans, Clerk of the Senate, which confirms the view that this is a constitutional course action; and also the advice that has been provided to me that had been provided by Blake Dawson-again confirming the claims made by the opposition in relation to the constitutionality of the action that we have taken. I seek leave to table those two documents. Leave granted.",59
128,Ms ROXON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I will speak briefly on some of the additional matters that the shadow minister has raised, because I know that it is to the House's convenience for us not to debate these at length, given that I think we are all aware that there will be another opportunity in another place and again in the House to do that in the future. Obviously both the member for Dickson and I have been in this House long enough to know that there are on occasions differences of view between the House and the Senate. Thinking that the will of the Senate, therefore, must be agreed to within the House seems to be turning the idea of democracy on its head somewhat. Similarly, we cannot require that the Senate always share the view of the will of the House. It is a matter that the government will not support. We do disagree to these amendments. We do not believe that they are constitutional. We do not believe, in any case, that they are the mechanism that should be used to deal with a disallowance, which will no doubt be before the Senate again tomorrow. It will not be a surprise to anyone, either, that on occasions not only are the will of the Senate and the will of the House different but the legal advice from the clerks and provided to the clerks might on occasion be different too. We have, as we have advised the Senate, advice from the Government Solicitor. The Deputy Speaker read advice that had been provided-or obtained; I am not privy to that-by the Speaker. We can argue back and of forth about the constitutionality for as long as we like, but the substance of this measure is not agreed to by the government because (1) we do not believe that it is appropriate to delay the introduction of a compliance bill which is in no way related to the level of rebate paid for cataract treatment and (2) we do not believe that taxpayers should be unable to reap the benefit of technological advances when they become available. We can look at international comparisons-I can speak for another half an hour on these-but those issues are all already on the record and I do not think it will further debate today. But it is very important for that to be acknowledged. I did meet last week with the ophthalmologists-both the college and the association. We are continuing to have discussions with them. Of course, fairly strong disagreements have been registered, but that does not mean that people do not think they can be mature enough to work through to see if there is another way to resolve this matter. It is not going to be resolved by an amendment which means that forever and a day a government is unable to change a rebate for a Medicare item when it has spent $14 billion just in the last financial year. Taxpayers expect us to have good scrutiny to make sure every one of those dollars is spent well and to the best advantage. For those reasons, the government opposes amendments (1) and (10). Question agreed to.",61
129,Ms ROXON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I present the reasons for the House disagreeing to the Senate amendments (1) and (10), and I move: That the reasons be adopted. Question agreed to. NA Public Works Committee  half of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the sixth report for 2009 of the committee relating to the proposed redevelopment of the Villawood Immigration Detention Facility. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.  for 2009 of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Public Works addresses the Villawood Immigration Detention Facility project, jointly sponsored by the Department of Finance and Deregulation and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship at an estimated cost of $186 million. The Villawood Immigration Detention Facility is an essential component of Australia's immigration detention infrastructure and is in urgent and critical need of an upgrade. The committee found that the current centre is largely inappropriate for housing people who are under administrative detention. It looks and feels like an antiquated prison, offering little recreation space or individual privacy. The committee is well aware of the importance of this facility to Australia's migration system and was concerned to ensure that the redeveloped centre would both be operationally effective and respect the rights of detainees. The report's nine recommendations focus on this outcome. The committee has recommended that the works proceed, with some recommendations to be implemented immediately, including providing a lockable space for each detainee and ceasing use of the loudspeaker paging system, as it breaches detainees' privacy. However, the committee has reserved its judgement over certain elements of the project, recommending that the final designs and costings be brought to the committee prior to construction commencing. This is because Report the committee is not confident that the existing buildings can be adequately retrofitted to afford dignity to detainees or cope with surge conditions. In addition, the committee was concerned that no decision has been made on the stage 1 high-security facility, which will be phased out of use. This facility is so inappropriate that the committee has recommended that it be demolished. The committee has also recommended that, in line with the centre's being renamed the Villawood Immigration Detention Facility, accommodation sections within the facility be renamed-less formally-to help break down some of the institutional culture of the facility. The committee was pleased to note that as a result of its 2005 inquiry into the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Facility the department now has written standards for the design of immigration facilities. In recognition of the importance of this document the committee has recommended that it be accredited by Standards Australia to ensure that all future facilities are of the highest possible standard. The committee received submissions from local residents concerned about security and site management and has recommended that the proponent agencies work more closely with the local council and residents throughout the redevelopment. The committee met with a group of detainees at the centre. This meeting informed much of the committee's deliberations on the state of the current centre, and the committee is grateful for the detainees' input. On a personal note, I find some satisfaction in this report as I was involved in the review of detention centres by the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I say to all senators that I think is high time that the eight hours of in camera evidence from the department and from detainees should finally be released. I thank the members and senators on the committee for their work in relation to this inquiry and commend our very professional committee secretariat staff, who have done a wonderful job. I commend this report to all honourable members. Public Works Committee Report  half of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the seventh report for 2009 of the committee relating to referrals made August to October 2009. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.  port for 2009 of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, Referrals Made August to October 2009, addresses six works located from Queensland to Afghanistan and from Sydney to Parisalthough I did not travel to those locations, I point out. Together these projects represent $1.7 billion worth of infrastructure investment. In each case the committee has recommended that the House of Representatives agree to the works proceeding. The works in this report are: defence housing at the Gordon Olive Estate in MCDowall, Brisbane, for Defence Housing Australia, at an estimated cost of $27.2 million; defence housing at Larrakeyah Barracks, Darwin, also for Defence Housing Australia, at an estimated cost of $52.4 million; Midlife Engineering Service's refurbishment of the Australian Embassy in Paris for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, at an estimated cost of $28.3 million; enhanced land for a stage 2 facilities project for the Department of Defence at 12 defence bases and training areas it of Australia, at an estimated cost of $1.457 billion; redevelopment of Tarin Kowt in Afghanistan, also by the Department of Defence, at an estimated cost of $86.4 million; and tropical marine research facilities in Townsville and Cape Ferguson for the Australian Institute of Marine Science at an estimated cost of $49.5 million. This report demonstrates the breadth of projects regularly considered by the committee, and the committee is pleased to table a report that is so diverse in both subject matter and geography. The works approved by the committee in this report will help protect Australian soldiers serving in Afghanistan, develop internationally unique marine research facilities, provide housing for members of the ADF and their families, ensure the viability of one of Australia's best-known embassy buildings and provide the Army with facilities for its expansion. The committee was pleased throughout the inquiry process to have a number of submissions from members of the public about projects under consideration. The committee was particularly pleased to note that practical solutions to some project issues were developed through discussion amongst witnesses at the hearings. The committee will continue to promote broader community consultation and discussion as an essential part of all projects as members have seen repeatedly how this leads to tangible results. In respect of the enhanced land force stage 2 project, for example, the committee has recommended that the Department of Defence develop a consultation protocol to ensure that it mirrors the consultation required under routine local planning procedures. This is particularly important for Defence given the constraints imposed increasingly on established bases by growing urban areas. There is sometimes a tension between competing priorities and, whilst everyone demonstrates considerable interest in working towards a practical and workable solution, the committee felt that Defence needs to be more explicit as to how it intends to consult. Given the obvious diversity of projects considered by the committee, it is worth noting some of the common threads running through the proposed works. In each case the committee has sought to ensure that agencies plan and design facilities with reference to local climate and weather conditions. The committee has also placed an emphasis on the environmental sustainability of each project as a whole including demolitions, adaptive re-use, new construction and the ongoing use of facilities. The committee inquired about the flexibility of projects and the pacity for future expansion of planned faciliAffairs ties as well as their impact on the nearby community. The committee was pleased to note that agencies are attentive to these considerations throughout the planning, design and construction process. Again I would like to thank the serving members and senators for their work in relation to these inquiries. Again I would like to commend our very highly professional and competent staff that serve the committee so well. I commend this report to the House.

COAL MINING INDUSTRY (LONG SERVICE LEAVE FUNDING) AMENDMENT BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 November, on motion by Ms Gillard: That this bill be now read a second time.",64
131,Mr KEENAN,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to speak on the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Bill 2009. I say from the outset that the coalition does not oppose this bill. This bill will, if passed by both houses, ensure that the existing sector-specific long service leave arrangements for the coal mining industry can continue beyond 1 January next year. Currently, the sector-specific long service leave provisions to which this bill relates are contained in industry-specific awards. These awards require the payment of a levy to the relevant fund by an employer from which the employer may seek reimbursement where they have made a payment of long service leave to an eligible employee. This bill is necessary as from 1 January next year Labor's system of so-called ‘modern awards' will apply. These awards do not contain a provision for long service leave. It is the derstanding of the opposition that the government intends that long service leave become one of its national employment standards. We were told, during the debate on the Fair Work Bill and subsequent legislation, that the government, in conjunction with the particular department and state governments, will be developing standards provisions for long service leave entitlements around the country. On this point, a question that looms large in my mind is exactly how these standardised provisions for long service leave will apply. I ask this question as, when you take even a cursory glance at the various long service leave provisions around the country that are currently contained within state legislation, you can easily see that contain different entitlements and different provisions with respect to the taking of long service leave. I want to list those differences to give the House some sort of idea about why this is a difficult process and why we have concerns that the government will handle it as badly as it has handled other national standardised policies, such as the ‘modern awards' process, which has been completely botched and bungled from the very outset. I will move firstly to the New South Wales situation. In that state the entitlement is for two months leave after 10 years of continuous service. Thereafter, there is one month of leave for each subsequent five years of continuous service. I note that the entitlement on termination in New South Wales is that if an employee terminates for any reason then they will receive a full payment of their entitlement after 10 years of service. A pro rata amount applies for the five-year period immediately after the 10-year service trigger. I also note that for between five and 10 years of service an employee might be eligible for pro rata long service leave on termination of unemployment if that termination occurs at the initiative of the employee-on account of illness, incapacity or domestic or other pressing necessity-or where an employer terminates an employee for any reason other than serious or wilful misconduct. And I note that in New South Wales, unless the employee has had five years of service, there is no obligation for an employer to pay any entitlement to long service leave. In Victoria, the system is reasonably similar, but there are still some minor differences. For example, in Victoria there is no entitlement for long service leave for any employee that has had less than 10 years of service. For between 10 and 15 years of service, an employee can receive a payment for their accrued long service leave on termination for they any cause and for any reason, other than if the employer terminates the employee for serious or wilful misconduct. And, after 15 years of service, an employee who terminates for any reason will receive the payment of long service leave. In Queensland there are differences as well. In that state, the Queensland Industrial Relations Act provides that employees will receive over 8½ weeks-8.6667 weeks, to be precise-on completion of 10 years continuous service. Further leave is available for each additional five years of continuous service. On termination after 10 years, an employee is entitled to receive the payment of their long service leave entitlement for any cause. However, in relation to an employee who has completed less than 10 years of service but more than seven years of service, they may be eligible for pro rata leave should they be terminated by their employer for any reason other than the employee's conduct, capacity and performance, or by death of the employee for whom the entitlement has accrued. However, where an employee has completed less than seven years of service there will be no entitlement. This is different to the Victorian and New South Wales systems. In South Australia, the entitlements to long service leave are different. In my home state of Western Australia, there are also sequent variations. The same goes for Tasmania, as it does in both of the territories. So in all of the eight jurisdictions around Australia there are slight differences in how an employee can accrue long service leave. I bring these differences to the attention of the House because, based on what we have seen about how Labor operates in government, we hold concerns, given this existing patchwork of legislation that currently exists throughout Australia, about how the government will go about standardising a system of long service leave. In particular, the opposition is concerned about what guarantee the government will give in relation to either employers or employees going backwards with respect to long service leave entitlements and conditions. As I have detailed, there are substantial differences between the amounts of accrual, the circumstances upon which the entitlements can be paid out to workers and in particular the pro rata provisions applying in each state or territory. We are concerned that, if the government seeks to standardise long service leave arrangements across the country, it will result in a situation akin to the intentions and the promises made by Labor with respect to the bungled and botched modern award process. I need not remind the House that, after introducing the fair work legislation into parliament, the minister gave us a promise that workers would not be worse off as a result of those changes. Subsequently we were given a promise, or the Australian people were given a promise, that the aims and intentions of the modern award system would include a requirement that no increase in labour costs would be borne by employers. There was a dual promise given to this House and to the Australian people, firstly, that no employee would be worse off as a result of the changes through the modern awards and, secondly, sub- that no employer would face increases in their cost base. We have seen, since these promises have been given, that they have been nothing more than hollow and false promises that the government has failed to deliver on. Australian workers and business have every right to feel ripped off as result of the award modernisation process and the outcomes it has delivered. We have seen business, particularly small business, very concerned about the increased labour costs they will be facing as a result of the award modernisation process. Retailers in New South Wales will have increased operating costs of up to 22 per cent per year. The pharmacy sector have indicated that they will have to curb trading hours for that sector, resulting in reduced services to the community and reduced service for people seeking access to medical assistance and the advice of a registered pharmacist. The hotel sector in Western Australia is predicting that as a result of the modern award process it will lose, within that sector alone and within the one state of Western Australia, between 300 and 400 employees. The Queensland Newsagents Federation has stated that as a result of modern awards a newsagent employing just one casual employee will have a cost increase of over 31 per cent per year. I can continue to list these adverse results from the award modernisation process, but I have detailed those concerns extensively in the House before. However, I wanted to highlight them again in relation to the government's desire to standardise long service leave arrangements around the country and to say that the opposition remains very concerned about how they are going to go about this. We remain very concerned that they will not go down the same path that they have adopted in relation to modernising the award system. We would be very concerned, as an opposition, if the process of standardising long service leave entitlements resulted in further spin and further hollow promises about the effects that it will have on workplaces. We are very concerned on behalf of business, particularly small business, that their costs may increase as a result of seeking consistency regarding the application of long service leave. We would also be most distressed if Labor's attempts to standardise these provisions resulted in workers being worse off. To this end we call for the government to make it clear to the Australian people, and everybody in Australian workplaces, exactly what their intentions are with respect to the standardisation of long service leave. We seek from the minister some guarantees and an undertaking that the botched and bungled approach that she has taken to modernising the awards system will not be repeated in relation to such an important entitlement as long service leave. These concerns aside, I note that this bill continues the existing scheme applicable in the coal mining industry for workers and employers. Had this bill not received the support of the opposition, it would have resulted in a circumstance from the beginning of next year where employers and employees might not have been covered by an appropriate system of long service leave regulation. It is likely that they would have had to revert to their relevant state systems. We are pleased that this bill is a result of discussion between industry representatives-the Minerals Council and the relevant mining unions. I am also pleased that other stakeholders potentially affected by this legislation, including the Australian Mines and Metals Association and the Australian Industry Group, have not indicated that they hold any concerns about this legislation. However, our position on this bill should not be taken to represent any future view that we have with respect to long service leave generally and, in particular, any system of portable long service leave. Whilst we do recognise that in this particular sector there have been long standing arrangements and agreements between stakeholders about long service leave arrangements, they are specifically applicable to this industry and it is not the case for all other sectors. We will reserve our position in relation to any future development in that area. However, we will not be opposing this bill. We do believe that it is necessary to reiterate the call to the government and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to make sure that when developing a standardised system of long service leave there is a degree of consultation and cooperation between stakeholders-including the opposition-at all levels. This is something the minister consistently fails to do. We see today she has run around expecting the opposition to make up for her inability to manage the government's legislative program. There needs to be an underlying fundamental approach taken to this standardisation and it must be different from the bungled modern awards process. We do not want to hear more hollow rhetoric and spin from this minister. We do not want her to make promises to the Australian people that she cannot keep, and we will be watching very closely as her proposals to develop standardised long service leave arrangements are developed.",64
132,Ms LIVERMORE,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise today to support the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Bill 2009. This bill shows the Rudd Labor government's continued commitment to the coal mining industry and, particularly, to those thousands of men and women, who are the backbone of the industry, working in coal mines and to the coal mining communities of the Bowen Basin in my electorate. The coal industry has a unique set of arrangements for the accrual and payment of long service leave entitlements, dating back to 1949. This bill will guarantee the continuation of the long service leave arrangements in the black coal mining industry. Specifically, the amendments will clarify that the long service leave entitlements that have been preserved within the Fair Work Act 2009 will be covered by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1992. This bill means that employees in the black coal mining industry can be secure in the knowledge that their long service leave entitlements remain unchanged. Employers know that they will continue to be reimbursed by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Fund for long service leave payments that they make to individual employees. The bill will establish definitions of ‘black coal mining industry', ‘employee' and ‘employer' and also adjust the definition of ‘eligible employee' in the funding act to ensure that the scheme applies universally in the black coal mining industry. As we have heard, in the coal mining industry employees are entitled to long service leave based on their time in the industry, not their time with an individual employer. Mobility of the workforce has always been a feature of the coal mining industry, and the ever-increasing demand for skilled miners will make it even more likely that miners will move from mine to mine and employer to employer as opportunities open up for them. The scheme was designed to accommodate this mobility as well as protect the entitlements of miners in the event of company insolvency. That is not such a problem these days, but it was a definite consideration in the original establishment of the scheme. Funding for long service leave is maintained by an industry scheme created by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1992 and related legislation. Under this act, employers are reimbursed from the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Fund for any long service payments that are made to an employee. From January 2010 the current industry awards covering long service leave will be taken over by ‘modern awards' under the Fair Work Act 2009. Modern awards will not include long service leave entitlements. Instead, existing award based entitlements will be preserved as a statutory entitlement under the National Employment Standards, pending development of national long service leave arrangements. Due to these changes, and as the funding act does not currently cover entitlements determined by the National Employment Standards, employers will not be entitled to reimbursement for the fund in respect of the long service payments they make to employees. This bill will ensure that this situation is rectified. The amendments that this bill represents will ensure that as of 1 January 2010 employers will be entitled to reimbursement from the fund in respect of long service payments that they make to employees pursuant to the preserved entitlements in the Fair work Act. This is in addition to the current arrangements for reimbursement of entitlements paid under industrial instruments and contracts. The changes in this bill will not affect an employee's long service leave or an employer's long service leave fund obligations. It guarantees that employees will not lose their current long service leave entipotentially tlements. This bill contains only minor technical amendments but, in doing so, provides certainty and security for employers and employees in the black coal industry. It recognises-and the government recognises-the unique history of the industry and its special significance to regions like Central Queensland. There can be no doubt that the government recognises the vital importance of the coal industry as our biggest exporter, a major employer and a driver of economic growth. I remind the House that, contrary to the scare campaign mounted by the Australian Coal Association in recent months, the latest Treasury modelling shows the coal industry growing by at least 50 per cent by the year 2050. Consistent with that, we will see 10,000 new jobs created in the coal industry in the next 10 years. The as paid for by the coal companies might be convincing if it were not for these and other independent predictions, and the evidence all around us in Central Queensland, that the industry is strong and is in fact gearing up for further growth. As members know-and they know because I keep telling them-there have been some major announcements for the Central Queensland coal mining industry in the last few months. Only last week the Rudd Labor government granted major project facilitation status to Waratah Coal's proposed northern export facility infrastructure project. This gives support to a $7.5 billion commitment to develop a new coalmine as well as associated rail and port facilities in the Galilee Basin, near Alpha, which is just west of my electorate of Capricornia. This mine will service the international export market for thermal coal. In addition to the mine, the project will involve construction of a railway in excess of 400 kilometres long, depending upon the option chosen, to transport processed coal to an expanded facility at Abbot Point, near Bowen, or to a new export terminal to be established at Dudgeon Point. New major water and power supply infrastructure would be necessary to service the mine and port. The proposed open-cut mine is expected to be developed in stages and have an initial export capacity of 30 million tonnes per annum with a mine life in excess of 30 years. Initial exports are targeted for 2013. Construction of the mine will involve an estimated 6,000 jobs. This is a massive investment in the mining industry in Central Queensland. Importantly, it is another example of the disconnect between the claims of the Coal Association and those opportunists who see political advantage in opposing the CPRS and the reality of what is happening in the coal industry, where companies are backing their belief in the future of the coal industry with substantial amounts of money. Talk in this debate is cheap-unless you are talking about the Coal Association's as-but the big-dollar investments going on all around us tell the real story. Members who have heard me speak in the last few weeks will know that there is even more to the story. Just two weeks ago a new coal mining deal was announced between Stanwell, a power generator in my electorate, and Wesfarmers. This will see the Curragh mine, at Blackwater, expanded, creating up to 300 construction jobs. This agreement will also create 90 full-time positions in a long term boost for the Central Queensland economy. The new deal allows coal from Stanwell's excess reserves to be mined by Wesfarmers, with Stanwell to share in the revenue generated from the export of the coal. There is also more to come for Central Queensland, with Xstrata accelerating its proposal to build Queensland's fourth coal port, at Port Alma, along with its plans for new billion-dollar harbour between Gladstone and Rockhampton. This would service the Wandoan Coal project, which has the potential to become Australia's most productive coalmine. This terminal would provide 100 full-time jobs and could export up to 100 million tonnes of coal. Extensive environmental impact investigations have already been done on this area. If all goes well, work will commence as early as 2012 and Port Alma may be able to ship coal by 2014. As you can see, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, there are great developments happening in the coal mining industry in Central Queensland that will create jobs and continue to boost our economy. We on this side of the House believe that coal has a strong future. We also want it to have a sustainable future. That is why the government is making huge investments in accelerating the development of clean coal technology through its support for carbon capture and storage. We are contributing millions of dollars towards carbon capture and storage projects and demonstrating international leadership through the establishment of the Global Carbon Institute. The Rudd Labor government is committed to securing the future of the coal industry through these investments in research and development. All the evidence tells us that coal will continue to be a major source of energy for the world well into the future, but we cannot ignore the imperative to reduce carbon emissions. The future for Australia's coal industry lies, therefore, in exporting not just coal but also the technology that will enable our overseas customers to generate low-emission energy. The government's support for the coal industry cannot be questioned. It was further confirmed today in the offer made to the opposition to amend the Carbon Pollution Rea duction Scheme to increase transitional assistance to coal mines. Overall, we are putting forward a total of $1.5 billion for the coal industry over the first five years of the scheme. As announced by the Minister for Climate Change and Water earlier today, there will be two components to this assistance-if it is agreed to by the opposition, of course. The Coal Sector Adjustment Scheme will provide free permits to the most emissions intensive mines. This will enable the fugitive emissions carbon liability for the most gassy mines to be reduced from around $20 per saleable tonne of coal to around $5 per tonne at a carbon price of $25 per tonne. I stress that this refers to the most gassy mines. We should not forget that many mines will face a carbon liability of less than $1 per tonne of saleable coal under the CPRS. I noted in a speech last week-and, Madam Deputy Speaker, I think you were in the chair when I made the speech-that Macarthur Coal reported a drop in its profits. The losses were attributed to unexpected demurrage costs for ships waiting to load from Dalrymple Bay coal loading facility. They also referred to the impact of the strong Australian dollar. I mention that because it highlights the many factors that go into the profitability of coal mines and puts into perspective the additional cost that carbon permits represent for companies. It is less than $1 per tonne for some mines. When companies are selling coal for $65 or $80 per tonne, or even more, and are subject to many more costs-not to mention state government royalties-that does not sound like the end of the world for the majority of mines. Of course, the CPRS has always included compensation targeted to the most gassy mines, and today's announcement represents an offer to increase that targeted compensation. In addition, there will be a coal mining abatement fund within the Climate Change Action Fund. The coal mining abatement fund will be increased by $20 million to a total of $270 million. It will fund coalmine abatement projects and capital grants, with priority for waste coalmine gas electricity generation projects. Coal companies in my electorate have already entered into successful partnerships with waste coal gas generators such as Energy Development Ltd and Envirogen to use their fugitive emissions to generate electricity, thus abating fugitive emissions while also displacing emissions intensive coal fired power generation. I welcome the measures put forward by the government to facilitate the expansion of such partnerships because I know there is real scope for that to create jobs and benefit communities in my electorate as well as making a significant contribution to reducing carbon emissions. Specifically, I support the possibility, announced today, of a review of the renewable energy target, through the COAG process, to consider whether new waste coalmine gas projects should be eligible under the renewable energy target. On this the second anniversary of the tion of the Rudd Labor government I want to assure all coalminers and their families, ticularly the members of the CFMEU, that I have not forgotten the tremendous support you gave me in our fight against Work Choices. It was a mighty battle and a successful one. Work Choices is gone and the Labor government wants to provide to workers in the coal mining industry the security they deserve as they work hard to bring this country unprecedented prosperity. This bill adds to that security by preserving the coal mining industry long service leave arrangements that have served employers and employees in the coal mining industry well for so long. I commend the bill to the House and, by the way, I also commend to the House the government's offer to amend the CPRS.",68
133,Mr WINDSOR,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I also rise to support the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Bill 2009. I listened closely to what the member for Capricornia had to say. Some of it was not quite related to the bill, but that may give me some degree of licence in the Deputy Speaker's mind.",71
134,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I think that is up to me to determine, Member for New England! Please proceed.",71
135,Mr WINDSOR,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The coal industry is on everybody's lips at the moment, I guess, with the current debate in relation to emissions trading and other issues. The coal industry, as the member for Capricornia said, is a very important industry in a lot of our electorates. The coal industry has been active for well over 100 years in various parts of the electorate of New England and west of the electorate, more towards the Gunnedah Basin. There are a number of initiatives, some of which the government is looking to assist elecwith. As most members would know, the electorate of New England-or the Bogpargabri, Gunnedah, Quirindi coal basin-is just over the Liverpool Range from the Hunter Valley, which is the member for Hunter's electorate. That links our area with the Port of Newcastle. The Port of Newcastle has had quite massive expansion in coal loading capacity. From memory, with a third load, they will be able to handle something like 120 million to 130 million tonnes of coal annually, which will make it the biggest coal exporting port in the world, I am told. So the Hunter Valley, Newcastle and the lower part of New England in particular-although there is some exploration of coal reserves going on in the northern part of New England-will be very significant contributors to the export earnings of the state of New South Wales. Currently there is a proposal before the Australian Rail Track Corporation. Minister Albanese is well aware of this. Some hundreds of millions of dollars were set aside in various infrastructure programs to rebuild a pathway through the Liverpool Range which will increase the capacity of the trains coming out of the New England area and down into the Hunter. Currently there is a range, which is at the top of the Murray-Darling system, which I will refer to in a moment, and a tunnel where trains have to be physically pushed and pulled. There have been a range of incidents there over the years. The capacity of those trains is quite restricted because of the height of the tunnel through the range. The Australian Rail Track Corporation have in train a number of feasibility arrangements to look at proposals-some above the ground and some below ground by way of a tunnel-which will increase the capacity. I would encourage the government-particularly the minister who made certain assurances in here that this would be part of the stimulus package-to make sure that this program goes ahead, not only for the coal industry and for the workers who will be receiving long service leave through this legislation but for the economy of Newcastle and other areas, as well as the nation. The other issue that I would like to mention is the long-term future of the coal indusother try and where it locates. I am aware that in Queensland there are issues in some parts about the granting of exploration licences to coal companies in what some people would view as fairly sensitive lands. Some people in the chamber and those listening may well have watched the Four Corners program about two months ago that looked at exploration licences that were granted to BHP Billiton and a Chinese company called Shenhua that were proposing to explore for coal on what is called the Liverpool Plains. The Liverpool Plains are part of the flood plain that comes off the Liverpool Range that I talked about a moment ago where the new tunnel is being looked at. That particular range is at the top of the Murray-Darling system in that part of the world. The drainage system that comes off the Liverpool Range onto the Liverpool Plains-which, in fact, over hundreds of thousands of years has formed this magnificent flood plain, interspersed with a degree of sandy ridges-has magnificent soil, some of the best soil in the world. There is a current debate about the granting of the coal mining exploration licences to BHP and the Chinese company Shenhua. There is great concern about the impact of particularly longwall mining, which BHP proposed to put in place, but also of the open-cut mine that Shenhua is looking at. There is great concern about the impact that the mining plans could have on the underground water systems. There are quite large underground aquifers in that area that are currently used for irrigation in a sustainable way. A major adjustment process took place earlier this century. The proposal to mine some of that land is of great concern to landholders in the immediate area who are normally affected by coal mining. I am not against coal mining. I live within a kilometre of a coalmine and I do not have any issues with them. In fact, as a state member I assisted them to develop in parts of the electorate. The issue here really is not about whether or not coal mining is a good thing; it is about the impact of an activity such as coal mining, and maybe other activities, on the demeanour of the land form that may well be mined-in this case an alluvial flood plain underpinned with these massive groundwater resources. The critical point, and the question that is yet unanswered, is the need for an independent scientific water study to ascertain the relationship between the land and the water-the groundwater systems that are there-and how they are interconnected as well as their relationship with the Murray-Darling system through the Namoi River. That was the point that the Four Corners program took. We need to ascertain the science of these systems before a disturbance from an activity such as mining takes place; otherwise, the damage that we do could in fact be irreparable. There are massive coal reserves in these two exploration sites-over a billion tonnes between the two sites and the two sites are only about 10 kilometres apart. It is massive, and it is massive dollars. The sites are massive groundwater systems and they have some of the best soils in the world. So we have this collision point that is going to cur in this place, even though the granting of mining licences is essentially a state issue. The collision point will be in this building rather than the state building because of the legislation that was passed last year on the Murray-Darling Basin arrangements, putting in place a process for the future whereby the basin is actually looked at as one rather than as part of four states. There is great concern that, if mining posals do go ahead before the science of the hydrology of the system-the hydraulics of the groundwater systems-is fully understood, there could be irreversible damage done to the connectivity of those systems, the quality of the water in those systems and part of the recharge area of the surface water system itself. In a sense it makes a mockery of the Murray-Darling Basin arrangements. I do not blame them for this-they have been given their riding instructions-but they are trying to put together a water audit with endof-valley caps which will eventually end up with a plan for the basin whereby certain extraction activities can occur. Then the allocations et cetera will flow from there, and the environmental benefits will be gauged as one catchment. The Haystack Plain area on the Darling Downs is a similar area with slightly different problems but, nonetheless, is part of the Murray-Darling system. If we allow these mining activities to occur in these very sensitive areas, it could have enormous implications for water quality, particularly given the much higher salt levels which could be extracted from that mining area even than the methane gas that is also there. We need to fully understand the science of the hydraulic nature of the Namoi system and the proposed coal activities. As I explained in another speech, the Liverpool Range provides the hydraulic push for the groundwater systems. Through this enormous valley, the surface water ends up going oc- through a neck of land about six kilometres wide and then fans out again as it goes towards Gunnedah. You have about 150 kilometres of this system and we have very little knowledge of the groundwater and surface water issues. Right at the worse possible point, we have a potential proposal from BHP Billiton to long-wall mine across this system. I have absolutely no idea of what that will do to the prohydraulics of the system or the hydrology or the quality of the system. I know that if you long-wall a mine under a flat plain it falls in. That has a whole range of other issues as well which, under the Murray-Darling arrangements will probably not be allowed to occur. BHP is suggesting that they might just mine in the ridges and they fully do not understand-no-one does-the relationship between one side of the ridge and the other as to the groundwater that is being driven through that system. I raise those issues just so that the parliareact, ment is aware that there is great concern out there. If we want people working in a sustainable farming system and a sustainable mining system into the future where people can access their long service leave for long periods of time into the future, we really need to look at these systems and the need, particularly within the Murray-Darling system, for what is called a bioregional assessment. The Commonwealth again might well have to provide a lead role here. The Commonwealth has taken the lead role in the Murray-Darling system itself and what we may need to do now is actually plan the activities, or risk assess the activities, which can and cannot occur within various parts of that catchment. I suggest that on the Liverpool Plains in particular, because of the sensitive nature and the relationships between water, soil and food production in one of the best food-producing areas in the nation, we should tread very lightly on this. If need be, we should not allow these activities to occur before we do a comprehensive and proper bioregional assessment of the assets that are there and the potential risk to those assets of certain other activities-in this case, mining. The other issue that I will raise briefly is the failure of the planning system in New South Wales to really address issues such as mining in some of these sensitive areas. Currently, as most people are probably aware, part 3A of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act is the trigger mechanism for allowing a mine plan to proceed from an exploration licence through to something that is real and focused. That legislation-and some of the other legislation that impacts on mining approval-does not mention water once. The word ‘water' is not included in that process once. We really have not looked at how the state legislation and approval processes and the new Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the federal Water Act are going to if in fact they do run into each other in terms of legislative assessment. We need to do that. Essentially what the state based planning process does is assess a mining application: look at the site, make sure that nothing can get away from that site and, if something goes wrong, it is held within that site, and look at the land immediately adjacent to the site. In some cases, the miner may have to buy that adjacent land so that the disturbances to neighbours et cetera are taken care of. It is a fairly simplistic process. But when you are dealing with an underground water system like the one that feeds the Murray-Darling system, the impacts may well occur hundreds of kilometres away from the mine. The argument is, ‘If something goes wrong, you just compensate the people around you-pay them some money or come to some arrangement.' But that does not allow for the unknown nature of the science in terms of the push, the drive, on those systems from the Murrurundi range right through to Walgett, which is probably 350 kilometres-and it probably goes further that we do not even understand. You cannot have a state based process that only looks at the small area where the mining activity is going to occur, if it is in an area where you have these other systems. I am pleased to see the Minister for Resources and Energy here. I am about to conclude. It is very difficult when we do not have a full understanding of the science of those groundwater systems. The minister would be aware of these issues, so I will not bore him with them, but the relationship between the state based mining approval processes and the Murray-Darling Basin arrangements really does need to be addressed. A possible solution for the mining companies, the farm organisations and the farmers themselves in the communities is an appropriate bioregional assessment of the assetsmine wise, food wise and water wise-in these regions so that we can assess them for the benefit of all into the future. I support legislation.",71
136,Mr TREVOR,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I wish to support the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Bill 2009, a bill that will ensure the unique long service leave arrangements that are already in place in the black coal mining industry will continue to operate as effectively as they have been. The bill will clarify that the existing long service leave entitlements preserved by the Fair Work Act 2009 will be covered by the funding act and will effectively preserve existing arrangements for hard working employees in the black coal mining industry with respect to long service leave. The bill will also ensure employers that make long service leave payments to employees are reimbursed from the fund. Other changes include the introduction of definitions of ‘black coal mining industry', ‘employee' and ‘employer' and the amendment of the definition of ‘eligible employee' to make certain that the scheme applies universally in the black coal mining industry. The bill is about providing certainty for the workers and employers of the black coal mining industry. It is about providing rocksolid legislation that will not only preserve the current security that is felt by the workers of the industry with regard to their long service leave entitlements and the reimbursement of employers in the industry for long service leave payments but also ensure its future longevity. This bill will update the laws to allow them to work cooperatively with the modernisation of the workplace relations systems and guarantee a secure, certain future for the employers and employees of the black coal mining industry in relation to long service leave. Under the current legislation, long service leave entitlements are dictated by industrial instruments, namely awards and workplace agreements, and from contracts of employ the ment. The important factor to note is that, unlike in many other industries, the eligibility of an employee in the black coal mining industry for long service leave entitlements is determined by their length of service in the industry, not their service with a particular employer. Their length of service with a particular employer has no impact on their eligibility for long service leave entitlements. It is determined independently by their length of service in the industry. Currently this is supported by an industry scheme established by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1992 and other related legislation, including the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Act 1992 and the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Collection Act 1992. The bill today is amending the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1992 and the other legislation I have just mentioned. The amendments in this bill aim at ensuring that the long service leave scheme applies universally in the black coal mining industry. This will be achieved by introducing a definition for ‘black coal mining industry' in the funding act, which flows through to the other related legislation. This definition has been added to align the act's definition with the definition in the coal award, which will effectively provide consistent coverage. In particular, this amendment will ensure that the reimbursement of employers from the fund for long service payments made to an eligible employee are matched over time by contributions into the fund with respect to that employee. It will also make sure that the long service leave entitlements of employees are portable. The bill will also introduce definitions ‘employee' and ‘employer' and will amend the definition of ‘eligible employee'. These definitions will be made more accurate by these changes to provide clarity as to their meaning and make certain that the scheme applies universally in the black coal mining industry. Another change that this bill will bring that will assist further with the universal plication of this long service leave scheme for all workers in the black coal mining industry pertains to the allocation of the Coal Mining Industry (Production and Engineering) Consolidated Award 1997 to be extended to all eligible employees who do not otherwise have long service leave entitlements derived from an award. This effectively means that all eligible employees who do not have an award-derived long service leave entitlement will be deemed to have such an entitlement by reference to the main industry award. This will ensure that the bill will apply to all workers in the black coal mining industry by providing scope for more people to have coverage for their long service leave entitlements, which will in turn ensure that more employees of the industry can receive their long service leave entitlements and all employers of these eligible workers can be reimbursed for the long service leave payments that they make to them. These amendments and additions aim at ensuring that all employees in the black coal mining industry are granted the long service leave entitlements they deserve. Industry stakeholders have suggested to the government that these definitions and changes will provide greater certainty to the scope and definition of the existing scheme, which seems logical and sensible and is thus the reason they have been included. Another of the major amendments in this bill aims at protecting employers within the for black coal mining industry by ensuring they are reimbursed for any long service leave payments they make to eligible employees in respect of their long service leave entitlements. In the past, employers have been reimbursed for these payments from the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Fund, as stipulated in the funding act. The issue that has arisen with this particular aspect of apthe legislation is that once the present industry awards are superseded by the modern awards under the Fair Work Act 2009, which will not include long service leave entitlements, the funding act will not cover the reimbursement. This is because of the change in legislation covering long service leave entitlements. Existing award based entitlements will be preserved as a statutory entitlement under the National Employment Standards, pending of course on the development of national long service leave arrangements. As the funding act does not currently cover entitlements determined by the National Employment Standards, employers will not be entitled to the reimbursements. Fortunately, the amendments in this bill will change this and prevent the situation from occurring. The changes ensure that employers will be entitled to reimbursement from the fund for any long service leave payments they make to employees pursuant to the preserved entitlements in the Fair Work Act 2009, which is in addition to the current arrangements for their reimbursement of entitlements paid under industrial instruments and contracts. Although this is a vital change, it will have absolutely no impact on employees' long service leave entitlements or employers' long service leave fund obligations; it is merely correcting a technicality. The amendments in this bill will act to preserve the arrangements already in place for employees in the industry. For the people of Flynn, where numerous deposits of black coal are located, this is an extremely positive step towards maintaining the conditions they are currently operating under. It will ensure that the hard working men and women of Flynn who are working in coal will continue to receive their long service leave entitlements and that many new workers in the black coal mining industry can accumulate and achieve their long service leave entitlements as well. It will mean that they will not miss out on their entitlements, and it will also mean that employers will continue to be reimbursed for the payments of these entitlements to eligible employees. Overall, this means more employees in the black coal mining industry will be covered in terms of long service leave and their employers will continue to be reimbursed by the fund for long service leave payments made to eligible employees. The black coal mining workers and employers not only in my home electorate of Flynn but across Australia will benefit from this bill. This is great news. It seems obvious that passing this bill is a positive step towards retaining the current arrangements with regard to the long service leave entitlements for both the employers and the employees in the industry. It has the best interests of the men and women working for, and the employers of, the industry. The bill has the support of key stakeholders from the industry. By passing the bill, we can put in place measures to make certain that the scheme that is already in place continues to ensure these workers do not miss out on their entitlements, irrespective of how many different employers they work for in the industry. The government has considered the best interests of all the stakeholders involved with the issue and it has their support. The changes in the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Bill 2009 are vital to ensure the preservation of long service leave entitlements for the workers of the black coal mining industry and the reimbursement of employers from the fund with respect to these payments to eligible employees. It is for all of these reasons that I commend this bill to the House.",75
137,Mr BIDGOOD,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to speak in favour of the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Bill 2009. As always, I like to say that the Labor Party is the miners' friend. It has always been and always will be the miners' friend because it is the party that delivers for the mining industry. In speaking in favour of this bill, we are here to make sure that workers' rights and entitlements are protected-unlike those on the other side of this House. This bill will amend the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1999-known as ‘the funding act'-and related legislation, including the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Act 1992 and the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Collection Act 1992. This bill ensures the portability of long service leave entitlements for all employees in the black coal industry. The scheme applies universally to all workers in the black coal mining industry. Amendments made by the bill will commence on 1 January 2010. Employees in the coal mining industry are entitled to long service leave on the basis of service in the industry, rather than their service with a particular employer. Funding of long service leave entitlements is supported by an industry scheme established by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1999, the funding act, and related legislation, including the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Act 1992 and the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Collection Act 1992, as I previously mentioned. Under the funding act employers are reimbursed from the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Fund for any long service payments they make to eligible employees in respect of their long service leave tlements. Firstly, the amendments will clarify that the existing long service leave entitlements preserved by the Fair Work Act 2009 will be covered by the funding act. Secondly, the amendments also extend the current long service entitlements in the industry award to all eligible employees who do not otherwise have an award-derived long service leave entitlement. Thirdly, the bill will also introduce definitions of ‘black coal mining industry', ‘employee' and ‘employer' and amend the definition of ‘eligible employee' in the funding act to ensure that the scheme applies universally in the black coal mining industry. Fourthly, the bill has the support of key stakeholders in the coal mining industry, including employer and employee representative bodies. If workers for whatever reason do not have an award-derived long serve leave entitlement, they will have one from next year. We are about providing for workers entitlements; we will never be about stripping them away. We will ensure that workers have their rights. Bills such as these are the kinds of protections that a Rudd Labor government is delivering for Dawson and for workers in the coal industry. I am proud that this government truly does look after workers, particularly workers in the mining industry which is so prominent in my electorate. The Rudd government firmly recognises the importance of the coal industry to our local economy and our local jobs. The Rudd government believes in a coal industry with a future and is investing strongly in its future, for both the industry and the workers in the industry. I have listened to coal workers and their families. I meet them all from time to time on the street, at mobile offices, at markets and at schools. They email me and they call my office. They tell me very clearly that they want a coal industry with a future. They want what is entibest for their kids. They want job security and they want a government that delivers for their communities and will into the future. As far as communities go, coal towns are relatively new communities but they are dynamic communities. The Bowen Basin coalfields have been producing coal and growing communities for over 30 years. Communities which border my electorate like Moranbah, Dysart, Middlemount, Nebo and Coppabella are mining towns with schools, hospitals, sporting clubs, pubs, small businesses and community groups. There are workers in those communities who have been there from day one. There are workers there who have only just been put on. All these workers will be protected by these new laws being debated today. These laws protect all workers in the black coal industry. We on this side of the House will always stand up for workers in the coal industry. Unlike those opposite, we will never stick up the white flag of surrender on the industry and its workers in Australian coal fields, we are proud of this industry and proud of its workers. We stand in this place to make laws that protect and provide a strong future for these workers. We make laws in consultation with and for the benefit of all stakeholders, including the workers' representatives like the unions and the employers, through providing certainty and predictability. Unlike the Liberal and National parties, we are about protecting the rights of workers in the coal industry. Workers know that, unlike those opposite, we did not support Work Choices and AWA's in the mining industry, Work Choices and AWAs which unashamedly stripped away workers' rights. Workers know that in government we have delivered on our promises by abolishing AWA's and Work Choices. We support the coal industry's existence because, unlike the Liberal and National ties, we do not support a nuclear future for Australia. Unlike some of those opposite, we do not want 50 nuclear power stations dotted across the continent-absolutely no way. That is the Howard government way and they made it clear that it had not ruled out nuclear future for Australia; nor do the rent members of the Liberal and National parties. They want a nuclear future. time ago as last week, we had the National Party's Senator Joyce making it clear in the media yet again-Senator Joyce is the man who wants to mine for oil in Antarcticarehashing his idea that shire councils should decide whether their communities should be home to nuclear plants. Can you imagine being a counsellor on a regional council in Mackay, in the Whitsundays, in the Burdekin or Townsville Regional Council going to your council chamber and saying, ‘I want a nuclear power station in my backyard and all that comes with it'? I do not think so. Barnaby Joyce has lost contact with his community, he has lost contact with the people he purports to represent in rural communities. I know we do not want a nuclear power station in Dawson and I do not want to see any nuclear power stations anyway around Australia. That is not the road we are going down. We are not going to go down the nuclear road; we are going to go down the renewable energy road, the sustainable energy road. That is the way forward for Australia. To have a Leader of the Opposition who wants Australians to adopt the French attitude towards nuclear power in Australia is simply unbelievable. How out of touch can you get? By embracing a nuclear future for Australia, those opposite are saying that are giving up on a future for coal. Look at the European experience, where nuclear power stations proliferate. There is virtually no coal mining industry left in the UK. There is virtually none in France or across the rest par- of Europe. Why? It is because of nuclear power. I tell you what: you may cut emissions but you will cut dead the coal industry if you go nuclear in Australia. The mineworkers know that very clearly. I do not see them campaigning-as Barnaby Joyce would a want-their local shire councils and saying, cur- ‘We want a nuclear power station in the backyard of Dawson.' No way. It is not going As little to happen on my watch. We reject a nuclear future for Australia and I support a future for coal that is cleanthat is, a future for coal with a international market now and into the future. That is the way to go, to embrace clean coal technologies and export those technologies to developing countries so that they can continue to use coal fired power stations. We believe in new technologies and innovations for coal, like carbon capture and storage. In fact, the government has contributed $2 billion for carbon capture and storage technologies to help clean up the industry, to support other infrastructure projects and to help improve our export capacity. The difference between the Labor and the Liberal and National parties is that we know and understand that many of the workers in the industry are in it for the long haul. It is their career. Mining is their livelihood and their children's livelihood, and we owe it to them to protect it, to grow it and to ensure there is a market for coal internationally and into the future. Coal and its associated industries are a major driver not only for the Australian economy but also for the economies in my electorate of Dawson. Many of the working families in the mining sector live in Mackay, Bowen and the Whitsundays, and they want they a government that will stand up for them now and stand up for them in the future. Mining communities know just how important coal is for Australia's economy, for jobs and for the bottom line of the wealth of this nation. Workers and their families know that under a Labor government the coal industry will always continue to grow. Treasury modelling shows that the coal industry will continue to grow by 50 per cent by 2050. Workers know that under a Labor government we will always see a future for coal. It will optimistic, clean future for one of our national exports. We see a future for coal. That is why we have invested $14 million in the Mining Technology Innovation Centre, based in Mackay in my electorate of Dawson. I wish to commend Peter van Iersel, the Centre Director, for doing a fantastic job in ing firms from around the nation support the mining industry in cutting edge innovation and new, smart business practices. In conclusion: mining communities in Central Queensland-in Dawson, in Capricornia and in Flynn-will not forget John Howard and his Work Choices laws. Workers will not forget the threat that these laws posed to workers' entitlements such as long service leave. We are instead about delivering for workers, not taking away their rights. I fully and wholeheartedly commend this bill to the House.",77
138,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to support the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Bill 2009. The aim of the bill is to ensure that, from 1 January 2010, employers who make long service payments to employees can be reimbursed from the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Fund and to define the ‘black coal mining industry' in the funding act and related legislation to align with the modern award and ensure that the scheme applies universally in the black coal mining industry. In particular, this amendment will ensure that the reimbursements of employers from the fund for long serve leave payments to an eligible employee are matched over time by contributions into the fund in respect of that employee. It will also ensure the portability of entitlements for employees. The bill provides that the Coal Mining Industry (Production and Engineering) Consolidated Award 1997, which is the main industry award, applies to all eligible employees who do not otherwise have an be an award-derived long service leave entitlement. From 1 January 2010 this will become an applicable award-derived long service leave term for the purpose of section 113 of the Fair Work Act. In effect, all eligible employees who do not have an award-derived long serve leave entitlement will be deemed helpto have such an entitlement by reference to the main industry award. Amendments made by this bill will commence on 1 January 2010. I will endeavour shortly to look with some detail into what exactly this bill does, but first I would like to examine the background of this bill-that is, long service leave generally. Long service leave is an almost uniquely Australian product. For a history of the scheme I looked at a research paper from the Labour Ministers Council. It said that long service leave was a period of paid leave granted to employees after a period of continuous employment with the one employer. In certain industries, such as construction, stevedoring and coal mining, policymakers in the past have allowed the entitlement to vest after a period of continuous service in that industry, regardless of the number of employers. Hence its portability between employers. The entitlement has its origins in the 19th century Victorian and South Australian civil service acts. These provided for civil service officers who had completed at least 10 years of service to be granted leave of absence with pay for periods of six to 12 months. The purpose of the leave was to reward those who had performed long and faithful service in the colonies by providing an opportunity for them to return to the United Kingdom. All state and Commonwealth public servants were subsequently granted the entitlement. It was then gradually extended to other public sector employees. Long service leave began to be included in federal awards by consent in the late 1940s. It did not become a standard employment condition for all employees until the passage in the 1950s of long service leave legislation in all states. The purpose such legislation, according to parliamentary debates prior to the introduction of the Long Service Leave Act 1955 in New South Wales, was to reduce labour turnover, provide a reward for long, faithful service and enable employees halfway through their working lives to recover their energies and return to work renewed, refreshed and reinvigorated. In 1964 the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission arbitrated its first long service leave award to provide what has become the standard provision for non-Public Service employees-that is, 13 weeks leave after 15 years service, with a pro rata payment in lieu on termination of employment after 10 years. State legislation and existing awards were amended to provide the same entitlement. South Australia later introduced a 10-year qualifying period for the full 13-week entitlement, but this has not been followed by other states. Public sector employees generally have more long service leave entitlements. Whilst long service leave entitlements are currently predominantly provided for under state laws, the Commonwealth makes legislative provision for long service leave entitlements for those employed in the Commonwealth Public Service. You can see that there is quite a long history of this particular provision in Australia, and the next stage in the evolution of this almost uniquely Australian entitlement of long service leave is being developed now. We are developing a national employment standard in long service leave. This next step will apply to all employers covered by the Fair Work Act. Long service leave is one of the 10 national standards to be introduced by this government. The others will be a standard 38-hour week, annual leave, parental leave, flexible work for parents, sick leave, community service leave, public holidays, of information in the workplace, notice of termination and redundancy pay. Of course, talking about coal mining and long service leave in one breath was unheard of back in the days of early coal mining. As a reflection, a recent report published by the University of Queensland on the Australian coal industry said: Work in early Australian coal mines was hard. In convict times, being sent to Newcastle was a punishment, above and beyond ordinary transportation, and the early Newcastle mines were dangerous places, with poor ventilation and inadequate drainage. Ms Grierson-It's true.",80
139,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"And I acknowledge the member for Newcastle, who is in the chamber at the moment. Workplace conditions today, of course, have improved dramatically, and we must always be looking to improve conditions even more, especially in places such as underground coal mines, with the inherent difficulties and dangers that they have. I now turn back to the bill we are debating today, which is about coal mining industry workers-and which, I might add, has the support of key stakeholders in the industry. Employees in the coal mining industry are entitled to long service leave on the basis of service in the industry rather than service with a particular employer. Funding of long service leave entitlements is supported by an industry scheme established by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1992 and related legislation, including the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Act 1992 and the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Collection Act 1992. Under the funding act, employers are reimbursed from the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Fund for any long service payments they make to eligible employees in respect of their long service leave entitlements. From 1 January, the present industry awards prescribing long service leave will be superseded by modern awards under the Fair Work Act 2009. Modern awards will not include long service leave entitlements. Rather, existing award based entitlements will be preserved as a statutory entitlement under National Employment Standards pending the development of national long service leave arrangements. As a consequence of these changes, because the funding act does not currently cover entitlements determined by the National Employment Standards, employers will not be eligible for reimbursement from the fund in respect of the long service payments they make to their employees. The amendments contained in this bill address this situation. The amendments ensure that from 1 January 2010 employers will be entitled to reimbursement from the fund in respect of long service payments they make to employees pursuant to the preserved entitlements in the Fair Work Act, in addition to the current arrangements for reimbursement of entitlements paid under industrial instruments and contracts. This is a technical amendment which will not affect employees' long service leave entitlements or employers' long service leave fund obligations. The current long service leave entitlements in the Coal Mining Industry (Production and Engineering) Consolidated Award 1997 will be extended to all eligible employees who do not otherwise have an awardderived long service leave entitlement. The bill also aligns the definition of ‘black coal mining industry' in the funding act with the definition in the coal award, amends the definition of ‘eligible employee' and introduces definitions of ‘employee' and ‘employer' to ensure that the scheme applies universally in the black coal mining industry. Let us not forget what employees in the coal mining industry faced back in the bad old days of Work Choices-and those bad old days were not all that long ago. In a newsletter to its members in June 2006, APESMA, the union covering engineers, scientists and the like, had a question and the answer article about long service leave, which I will just take a few quotes from to show how they saw the effects of Work Choices on long service leave. The first question was: What happens if my employer is not bound by the Award, or if I move to a new mine site? Answer: WorkChoices means that to access the all-important legally enforceable entitlement of Long Service Leave staff at any new mine site not bound by the Award as at 27 March 2006 do not have access to an Award Long Service Leave entitlement. Instead staff must rebargain for the Coal Mining Industry standard Long Service Leave in an enterprise agreement. The next question was: I have an entitlement to long service leave in my contract-isn't this enough? Answer: Should there be a disagreement about bridging your service between one employer to another, or deeming your service, then your common law contract doesn't provide the answer. This is because the only way a Tribunal can determine bridging or deeming if there is no agreement, is if the legal power to determine the dispute is given to them via the Award or enterprise agreement. The third question was: My employer is paying into the Long Service Leave Fund anyway, so why should I have a problem in getting my long service leave? Answer: All employers in the Coal Mining Industry are bound to pay into the Long Service Leave Fund pursuant to the Long Service Leave Funding Act. That Act puts the responsibility on the employer to make contributions to the fund. Unfortunately, that Act does not provide employees with a legally forcible entitlement, and to solve disputes where there is disagreement about bridging or deeming. You can see that there were all sorts of issues that were being faced by coal mining industry employees under Work Choices in relation to their long service leave. In fact, what they were being faced with, quite simply, was the possibility that their entitlement was going to be much diminished. The issue of portability, which is so crucial in this industry, was very much under threat. Yet there are still many of those opposite who would not hesitate to bring back Work Choices if they could. We saw in this chamber only last week the debate on legislation to bring about a national workplace relations system. That is something that the previous government said they believed in, but we faced the incredible situation of those opposite opposing this position even though they said it was one of the key motivations behind Work Choices. In fact, they went to the High Court in relation to the corporations power to have a national system, and they said that that was fundamental. But what we found here was that there was a more overriding principle that has always lurked beneath the opposition's psyche and that was that they actually still believe in Work Choices more than the philosophy of a national system. That is why they voted against the national system. The opposition spokesperson made it clear that one of the two reasons they did not want the legislation that was here before this place last week and that the opposition voted against was they did not like the fact that the new system did not have many of the principles of Work Choices. Between the member for Stirling and the member for O'Connor, they listed the three key issues that they thought should be in a national industrial relations system before they would support it. The first was the reintroduction of AWAs, and employees in the a way coal industry in particular were subject to more AWAs than almost any other industry. They wanted those to be returned. The member for O'Connor said that he did not believe in penalty rates and if there were penalty rates in any system then he could not support it. Then the issue of flexibility of hours generally was also raised by the member for O'Connor. The position of the opposition spokesperson on workplace relations, the member for Stirling, was that any system that provided unfair dismissal rights was a system that he could not support. They are three fundamental issues that the Australian people voted on in the last election, and they voted overwhelmingly to support this side of parliament's position in terms of the type of industrial relations system they wanted-making sure that there was fair access to unfair dismissals, making sure that individual contracts were no longer part of the system and making sure that penalty rates were not stripped away. These three issues are fundamentally the issues that those opposite want to see returned to any industrial relations system and that caused them to make the extraordinary decision to oppose a national industrial relations system in legislation that was there before. It is little wonder that it is this side of the House that is left to make sure that the long service leave entitlements of those working in the coal industry are protected, because we know quite clearly, from the actions of those opposite in the past and the actions of those opposite only last week, that they would be looking at ways in which they could strip back entitlements from workers in all industries but in particular in relation this industry. We need to make sure that we are protecting those long service leave entitlements for those who work in the coal mining industry. The coal mining industry will remain important in this country for many years to come. To give you an idea of just how significant an employment role the industry continues to play, projections are that demand for skilled labour in coal mining, even based on various assumptions about energy use, will remain very high over the longer term. The government's energy white paper released earlier this year stated that the projected demand for skilled labour in the coal mining industry will rise from over 35,000 in 2008 to about 55,000 in the year 2020. This is an increase of 19,000 or 53 per cent. These projections are based on mineral output projections for Australia's current major mining commodities to 2020 and they take full account of global market conditions and domestic market conditions such as the proposed emissions trading scheme that is obviously plaguing the opposition's party room right through all of today. There are strong partnerships in place to improve the industry's safety and efficiency. In November 2007, to specifically address the domestic energy supply industry and the demand for skilled labour, the Australian government committed to work with the state and territory governments in the energy sector to improve the consistency of state based regulations such as occupational health and safety requirements that apply to the energy sector. In June 2008 the Ministerial Council on Energy agreed to establish the Energy Technical and Safety Leaders Group to develop a plan to harmonise state and territory electricity and gas supply industry technical and safety regulations. Harmonisation would facilitate greater labour mobility and swifter emergency response in the ento ergy supply industry especially in the context of skilled labour shortages. The leaders group is shortly due to deliver its final plan to the ministerial council. So you can see that the coal industry remains important to Australia, and this government recognises that. To sum up, the effect of the bill is to preserve existing arrangements for employees in the black coal mining industry with respect to long service leave and also to ensure the reimbursement of employers from the fund with respect to long service leave payments they make to eligible employees. The government considers that this is a desirable measure that recognises the unique historical circumstances surrounding long service leave in the black coal mining industry. This government is about making sure that workers' rights are preserved. This stands in stark contrast to those opposite, who look at every opportunity they can to strip back and take away employees' rights. I commend the bill to the House.",81
140,Ms GRIERSON,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I too rise today to support the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Bill 2009. The coal mining industry is intrinsically tied to my electorate of Newcastle and to the Greater Hunter region. I am the granddaughter of a coal miner and, although we are now a dynamic and diversified city, I think you may still struggle to find any Novocastrian who is not linked to somebody involved in the coal industry in one way or another. Just as coal originally laced the beds of the Hunter River, coal is in the bloodstream of our region, and that is the case for many regions around this country. That is something that this government recognises, and the government and I will always make sure we legislate for the benefit of this great industry, of those who work in it and of those who depend upon it. This legislative amendment looks at improving and streamlining the long service leave funding agreement in the national coal industry and preserving the continued operation of existing unique long service leave arrangements in the black coal industry. To quote from the legislation: Employees in the coal mining industry are entitled to long service leave on the basis of service in the industry, rather than their service with a particular employee. Funding of long service leave entitlements is supported by an industry scheme established by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Act 1999 (the Funding Act) and related legislation, including the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Act 1992 and the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Collection Act 1992. In the black coal industry formerly, long service leave was always portable, moving with the individual miner. That has been the case since 1949, as recognition that often miners work between one mine and another, depending on the scaling up or scaling down. The legislation continues: Under the Funding Act employers are reimbursed from the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Fund (the Fund) for any long service payments they make to eligible employees in respect of their long service leave entitlements. However, from 1 January next year the present industry awards prescribing this long service leave are set to be superseded by more modern awards in line with the Australian government's Fair Work Act 2009. These awards are not permitted to include long service leave entitlements. Rather, existing award based entitlements will be preserved as a statutory entitlement under the National Employment Standards pending development of national long service leave arrangements. Our movements towards some harmonisation have been very well received. But, because the funding act does not currently cover entitlements determined by the National Employment Standards, employers will not be entitled to reimbursements from the fund in respect of the long service payments that they make to employees. This is obviously not a desired outcome for coal industry employees. The amendments contained in this bill address this situation. They ensure that from 1 January 2010 employers will be entitled to reimbursement from the fund in respect of long service payments they make to employees pursuant to the preserved entitlements in the Fair Work Act in addition to the current arrangements for reimbursement of entitlements paid under industrial instruments and contracts. This is a technical amendment which will not affect employees' long service leave entitlements or employers' long service leave fund obligations. The bill also aligns the definition of ‘black coal mining industry' in the funding act, which flows through to related legislation, with the definition in the coal award. It amends the definition of ‘eligible employee' and introduces definitions of ‘employee' and ‘employer' to ensure that the scheme applies universally in the black coal industry. I wish to congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, and the Rudd government for recognising the unique historical circumstances surrounding long service leave in the black coal mining industry and ensuring through this amendment that existing arrangements are present and preserved for employees and that employers are reimbursed from the fund in respect of the long service leave payments that they make to eligible employees. I would also like to put on the record my appreciation to Graham Kelly, the Secretary of the United Mineworkers Federation (Northern District), for his strong advocacy on this issue on behalf of coalminers in the Hunter Valley. We are all aware of the importance of the coal industry to our local, state and national economy. The mining of black coal is one of Australia's most important industries, creating significant employment in regional Australia, providing fuel for low-cost electricity generation and steel making, and creating vital export income. Australia is the world's biggest coal exporter and black coal is Australia's largest export. The coal industry in Newcastle is thriving. The Rudd government contributed $580 million to improving the coal chain between the Hunter Valley and the port of Newcastle, one of the most important arterial freight lines in the country. The struction at the port of the third coal terminal, the NCIG terminal, is almost complete, and there are plans for a fourth terminal with Port Waratah Coal Services. There has been significant private investment, with $1.4 lion for the expansion of coal mines under way as well as for rolling stock and export infrastructure, and negotiations are happening now around a further possible $5 billion expansion. Some recent articles from the MiningCoal website shed further light on the bright outlook for the coal industry in Newcastle. The website reported in September that coal mining companies that use the port of Newcastle say they are confident of doubling exports within seven years-that is, going from the current 100 million tonnes to 200 million tonnes. There are also longer term plans to triple coal exports from our port to 300 million tonnes. The news came following the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's re-approval of the port's coal export quota system. A further report in October said that coal exports from Australia's Newcastle port have jumped 35 per cent as mining shipments with Japanese utilities increase. There has been a scaremongering campaign coming from some within the coal mining industry regarding the impact an emissions trading scheme would have on the industry. I have talked about it in the House before, so I will not go into all that again; however, when you note the developments and expansion that the industry is planning for in Newcastle and the Hunter-$1.4 billion now and a further $5 billion over the next decade-then you can see that coal and the coal mining industry are strong and sustainable in the Hunter region. One need only turn to perhaps the real representatives of the coal industry, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, to see that much conof what has been said about the ETS by the business end of the industry is unfounded. In an article that appeared in the Australian newspaper last month written by Matthew Stevens, CFMEU president, Tony Maher, bil- accused the Australian Coal Association of running a deceptive scare campaign. Maher said the coal industry would continue to grow with an ETS, even if not as quickly. Today I congratulate the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Climate Change and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change in releasing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in its now revised form-in particular, its support for the coal sector. A total of $1.5 billion in transitional assistance will be provided to the coal sector over five years. This is an increase from the $750 million previously-so a doubling-and the government will commit $270 million to the coalmine abatement fund through the Climate Change Action Fund to assist gassy coal mines reduce their emissions. In addition, the current COAG renewable energy target review process will consider whether the new waste coalmine gas project should be eligible. This is a considerable investment into the future of people like those in Newcastle and the people of the Hunter Valley. It is very welcomed and it gives us great confidence. Resistance to the ETS-and it has been considerable-is something that I am amazed at. I represent the city of Newcastle and we just commemorated the 10-year anniversary of the closure of the BHP steelworks. At that time it was said that we were ruined-our economy would be ruined. It was said that the loss of jobs would be staggering and that we would never recover. At that time, state and federal governments provided some adjustment funds. I now point to our economy which shows 4.4 per cent unemployment during a global financial crisis; I point to the productivity and growth within Newcastle and the fact that its greatest employment sectors and growth sectors are knowledge based. We have nothing to fear from an ETS and much to embrace. It will be the catalyst for wonderful change. It will be the catalyst for new investment, productivity, efficiency and innovation. It is something in our region that we have been preparing for for some time. In valuing our coal industry while also appreciating that there will be pressures on energy provision, we have invested-as has this government-into the clean energy sector and the renewables sector. We are preparing. We know what it is like to be resilient and adaptive. An ETS will provide that adjustment catalyst for industry to make those adjustments, to diversify, to enrich their efficiency and innovation, to value add to their activities and to remain totally productive and to potentially create greater industries around the country. I have to say to the many people who have feared for the loss of their job, because Australian Coal Association's campaign, that we do not have anything to fear from our adapting to this changing world environment and to change that is supported so strongly through our ETS and, in this case, with particularly strong support for the coal industry. This bill being debated , though, is further demonstration of the commitment by the Rudd government to supporting not just the coal industry but the jobs and employment rights of people around this country. It is recognition of the importance of the coal industry to our nation's economy and to my region's economy. It will provide invaluable support and assistance to those involved in the industry and it will give them comfort that their entitlements-ones that they have been entitled to since 1949-will be protected and that their long service leave provisions will not be diminished in any way. I commend the bill to the House.",84
141,Mr CLARE,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I thank members for their contribution to the debate on the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Bill 2009. This bill implements a series of measures that have been agreed to by the coal mining industry working party, which consists of both employer and employee stakeholders. The measures in the bill will apply portable long service leave entitlements and the supporting funding arrangements universally in the black coal mining industry from 1 January 2010. The black coal mining industry has a long-standing, unique arrangement whereby employees have accessed portable long service leave entitlements under the terms of federal awards since 1949. The long service leave entitlement set out in the Coal Mining Industry (Production and Engineering) Consolidated Award 1997-13 weeks after eight years continuous service in the industryof the was established in 1966. The funding arrangements administered by the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Corporation have been in place since 1993. Given these historical circumstances and the joint representations made by industry and unions to government requesting that the existing long service leave entitlement arrangements for the industry are maintained and administered consistently throughout the entire industry, the government is pleased to put forward this legislation. I am glad to see that it has the support of all members of this place, and I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

143,Mr BRIGGS,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,It is very disappointing that my favourite Rudd government minister is not able to stay for my contribution this evening to the debate on the ACIS Administration Amendment (Application) Bill 2009. Mr Champion-It better be good!,88
144,Mr BRIGGS,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"And, to the member for Wakefield, the contribution will be short. Thank you for the intro. As I understand it, this bill corrects a technical error in a piece of legislation that we discussed not too long ago in this place. The government's New Car Plan for a Greener Future committed to providing motor vehicle producers with a smooth transition to the new Automotive Transformation Scheme by providing increased assistance under ACIS in 2010. It was also the government's decision that this additional assistance be conditional on the enactment of the Automotive Transformation Scheme Act 2009, which occurred on 29 September 2009. The amendment corrects, as the government has termed it, the unintended consequence arising from the link between the ACIS Administrative Amendment Act 2009 and the commencement of the Automotive Transformation Act 2009. It is a technical amendment that would give formal effect to the legislation already considered in parliament and would honour the original intent of the legislation. The bill clarifies that the commencement date for the ACIS act is 1 January 2010 and not 1 July 2010. The coalition do not oppose this piece of legislation. We do have some questions, which I will put in Hansard for the consideration of the minister. How was the unintended consequence of the original legislation overlooked? When was the mistake found? Was this due to a lack of consultation with industry? And was it, as we see with so many pieces of Rudd government legislation, a last-minute rush job which resulted in this error? These are issues which, I am sure, the minister will address in his summing up of this bill, which fixes an administrative error. Obviously, over the 11½ years of the coalition government the car industry received an enormous amount of support, particularly in my home state of South Australia, including Holden, which is located in the member for Wakefield's electorate and which employs many people who live in the member for Makin's electorate, and also Mitsubishi, which was in the member for Boothby's electorate. However, it decided not too long ago to terminate its operations in Australia. I think that highlights a potential issue we will have going forward with this industry as the challenges become greater than they are today. As we said in the debate on the original legislation, this place and the government of the time will need to consider just how much assistance this country is willing to give to this industry. I acknowledge that it is an important industry in certain parts of Australia, but it is also a lot of money that we are paying. The amendments that we moved in the consideration in detail stage of the original bill provided transparency, and it was a pity that the government did not see the reasons for those amendments. It is something that is worthwhile considering, because they are large sums of money we are talking about with this industry and there are important considerations for employment in certain areas. There is a very thick set of jobs in tain areas and we are seeing that, with the assistance packages for Holden workers, more are taking them up than was expected. It will be a challenging time for not only the car industry but also the associated industries and communities. I suspect that this subject is difficult and touchy for many people and it is very difficult to manage. I know that the member for Wakefield is intensely interested in this issue, and we all look forward very much to his contribution to this debate, as we do to the contribution of the member for Makin. On that note, I will conclude my remarks.",88
145,Mr ZAPPIA,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"I take this opportunity to speak about the ACIS Administration Amendment (Application) Bill 2009. I note with interest that the three speakers on this amending legislation are all from South Australia, which I suspect indicates, at least, the level of support for the automotive industry via the South Australian representatives in this chamber. That is certainly the case in respect of the member for Wakefield, who is in the chamber, and me because there is no question that we believe the automotive industry is absolutely vital to the long-term future prosperity of South Australia and, in particular, to those families which are employed and which, in many cases, have been for a long time, at the GM plant at Elizabeth. The bill corrects an anomaly that would have resulted in automotive manufacturers receiving a lower amount of money than was intended under the Australia Competitiveness and Investment Scheme during the transition period until the Automotive Transformation Scheme came into effect. This was an unintended consequence. The Automotive Transformation Scheme was implemented and during the transition phase it became obvious that automotive manufacturers cerwould have in fact been paid less than they would otherwise have expected under the old ACIS. The importance of those payments should not be understated at all. By way of background, the automotive industry in Australia directly employs some 63,000 people across the country and there would be around another 100,000 employed in the supply chain and support industries to the automotive manufacturers. The industry contributes $7.7 billion a year to the Australian economy, and we still have automotive plants in Victoria and South Australia-manufacturing Toyotas and Fords in Victoria and manufacturing Holdens in South Australia. What is just as important in respect of the automotive industry is that certainly in South Australia, and I expect it is the case in Victoria, it underpins invaluable research, design, innovation and engineering right across the manufacturing sector. Without a viable automotive sector, many of those smaller industries involved, whether it is in research, design, innovation or engineering, would simply not be able to survive. In fact, if we lost the automotive industry the result would undoubtedly be an undermining of the ability and capacity of Australia to continue to manufacture goods. To its credit, the Howard government recognised this and, in 2001, introduced the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme. After being in place for only one year, the scheme was extended for a further 10 years and was due to continue to 2015. This, quite rightly, the importance of the automotive sector to the Australian economy. When the Rudd government came to office, time had moved on. We had seen tariffs reduced in 2005, from 15 per cent to 10 per cent, which in turn had some impact on the industry. The Rudd government commissioned the Bracks inquiry, which resulted in A New Car Plan for a Greener Future for Australia. The Rudd government committed $6.2 billion towards ensuring that the plan can be implemented over the next decade, and within that funding is, of course, the billion associated with the Automotive Transformation Scheme. We all know that the global financial crisis has literally decimated the automotive industry across the world, particularly in the ern countries. When you combine that with the competition that automotive manufacturers in the Western world are now experiencing from new car plants in developing countries, you can understand why this is an industrial sector that has some real challenges ahead. Schemes such as the Automotive Transformation Scheme and the ACIS scheme are vital to the survival of the automotive industry in Australia and will be even more so when tariffs are reduced from 10 per cent to five per cent from 1 January 2010. The GM plant in the northern region of Adelaide-and I note that the member for Wakefield is in the chamber and I am sure he will speak in a similar vein in a moment on this matter-has been there since the mid1940s. I cannot recall the exact date but it has been there for around 60 years. For the last 60 years it has been the critical industry that has sustained that region. Whilst over the years that region has expanded and many other industries have also been established there, the fact is that they were all drawn to the region because of the presence of the GM highlighted operations in Elizabeth. Only yesterday, when I was speaking on the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment Bill 2009, I referred to the case of the Bridgestone plant in Salisbury, which opened in 1964 but, sadly, is planned to close in April next year, with the loss of some 600 jobs. Only recently the member for Wakefield, the member for Port Adelaide, the Minister for Employment Participation, Senator the Hon. Mark Arbib, representatives of the ETU, the AMWU and the LHMU and I attended the Bridgestone plant to ensure that $3.4 the employees there are being provided with the necessary support as part of transitioning to other employment and in respect of any redundancy payments due. I reiterate what I said yesterday: I compliment the work of all Westthose unions and, in particular, David Di Troia, the secretary of the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, who along with his team has been working diligently to ensure that all of the people at that plant, the majority of whom are members of his union, are given their rightful entitlements. In that respect, I also acknowledge the contribution made by the federal and state governments of $5.7 million-over $4 million of which came from the federal government-to support those workers. That is a classic case of the importance of the GM operations to that region. I have no doubt that it was a result of the downturn in production at the GM plant that contributed to the closure of the Bridgestone plant. So you do not have to go very far to understand the importance of the automotive manufacturers to the regions, wherever they are established in Australia. On a positive note, I was pleased to read that the GM operation at Elizabeth has begun to increase its production of motor vehicles. understand that production has in fact now risen from 310 vehicles per day to 340. That is encouraging. But none of that would have been possible had GMH not been supported by the federal government over the last decade. Again, the previous government needs to be recognised for that, and certainly the Rudd government's $6.2 billion automotive restructuring plan will ensure that we continue to have a viable automotive industry. There is, of course, another element to suring that we continue to have a viable automotive industry. The proposal we are looking at, A New Car Plan for a Greener Future-and the title quite rightly says, ‘a greener future'-is all about designing and building cars that create lower emissions. That goes hand in glove with the very issue we are confronted with in Australia and across the world in reducing carbon emissions-a matter that is the subject of debate before this parliament right now and which will be debated in Copenhagen next month. As the Prime Minister has said time and time again, it is a matter that is in the national interest. If we can support car manufacturers in this country, it will ensure not only that there is some economic benefit but also that, simultaneously, there will be the benefit of producing lower emission vehicles than are currently being produced. Unless they do that, the reality is that they will find themselves coming under increased competition from overseas manufacturers and designers who are doing exactly that and who are perhaps gradually increasing their market share in Australia because they are manufacturing cars that produce lower emissions. I represent an electorate where many of the families who work at the GM operations at Elizabeth live. They are very much dependent on the future survival of that plant. I This amendment bill, as I said, corrects an anomaly in the legislation that was introduced into this House earlier. In so doing it will enable the GM operations, particularly at this point in time when they have some very serious challenges ahead of them, to continue their operations. I support the amendment. The member for Mayo talked about whether this amendment arises because of a lack of consultation at the time that the original legislation was introen- duced. Can I say, as someone who has taken the trouble to read this legislation in detail and to look at exactly the way in which the New Car Plan for a Greener Future and the Automotive Transformation Scheme are structured, that this is a very complex matter. It is not surprising and it is not unusual that unintended consequences are highlighted once a piece of legislation is brought into the House. That is exactly what has happened here. The fact of the matter is that the legislation will correct that anomaly. It will correct it in time, before the Automotive Transformation Scheme payments come into effect. Therefore, there has been no detriment to the automotive industry at all. The very fact that it has been brought into this House at this point of time shows that the government is on the ball with this legislation. I commend the bill to the House.",89
146,Mr CHAMPION,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"It is a great honour to follow my colleague the member for Makin, who always speaks in a very intelligent manner and with a great deal of knowledge and street smarts. He was a great mayor of the great council of Salisbury. I was happy to be a resident of Salisbury and happy to vote for you Tony too, on occasion. You always did a great job by those in my electorate and also by those in the electorates of Port Adelaide and Makin. You have a long history of serving the northern suburbs. It is also always interesting to follow the member for Mayo, who has departed to the party room for the CPRS debate-no doubt to participate in that cage match that they having. It is a bit of a cage fight. me of that movie Fight Club. Do you remember Fight Club? Underground boxing by people who should know better but do not? Young men just punching on, I think is the expression. There is no doubt that a Liberal Party meeting is a lot like that at the moment. But I digress and I should be discussing the importance of manufacturing in Australia. This industry is tremendously important to Australia. It produces billions of dollars in export revenue, it directly employs over 50,000 people and it indirectly employs thousands more. These people need our support and encouragement to keep making the great products that they make. This government knows that if you do not have car manufacturing-if your country does not have a car manufacturing industry-then generally you have very little manufacturing full stop. This is a government and a Prime Minister that want to see Australia as a try that makes things, that makes elaborately transformed manufactures. As Paul Keating used to often say: ‘We don't just want to be a mine or a quarry or a beach for the rest of world. We want to make things and we want to export things.' This industry is tremendously important to South Australia. I cannot stress its importance enough. Despite all the tribulations of the previous decade-losing Mitsubishi and losing many component firms associated with car and other forms of manufacturingmanufacturing is still the heart and soul of the South Australian economy. Defence manufacturing is increasingly important and it is interesting to note that the Rann government has won some $44 billion worth of defence contracts in recent times. Manufacturing has been tremendously important to the wine industry, which has a big impact as are an employer and an exporter in my electorate It reminds and the areas adjacent to it. Of course car manufacturing is where it all began, when Sir Thomas Playford, a great Liberal premier of our state, went out to the world in his own particular fashion. It is hard to imagine a more humble man-he was a cherry farmer from the Adelaide Hills-but he marched into various boardrooms and convinced them to invest in South Australia. That is why a lot of companies like Holden and Bridgestone set up in South Australia. There are a lot of great stories about the foundation of manufacturing in South Australia. In my heartland in northern Adelaide, in the city of Playford and the city of Salisbury, one in four workers is a manufacturing worker. The income they earn is tremendously important to their families. Manufacturing jobs tend to be well paid, they tend to have good conditions and, despite what some people say, they do have good secure futures. If you doorknock places like Salisbury, coun- Elizabeth or Gawler or even the country towns to the north, like the town I grew up in, Kapunda, you will find vehicle industry workers from Holden, Bridgestone, Futuris the and the hundreds of small engineering firms that get their business from manufacturing either in the food area, in cars or in defence. Manufacturing has been important to the identity and the culture of the northern suburbs of Adelaide. Holden is still a major sponsor of the Central District footy club. Mr Zappia-Premiers! Ms Kate Ellis-Boo!",91
147,Mr CHAMPION,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"The premiers this year, as we are many years. I hear the member for Adelaide, who would be disappointed of course because a couple of years ago the Bays, of which her family are great supporters, went down in a screaming heap yet again. It will happen one day for the Bays, I am sure, as it will happen one day for Sturt or North Adelaide-one of them. One of them will win, eventually. But I digress again. This government has been tremendously supportive of the manufacturing industry, and our New Car Plan for a Greener Future contains the Automotive Transformation Scheme, which works in tandem with the ACIS Administration Amendment (Application) Bill. It starts in 2010. It provides $3.4 billion in grants to industry for research and development to improve environmental outcomes and work skills development. It is all about renewing this industry and making sure it has a future in Australia. It is all about helping it to adjust to a greener economy. This assistance also takes into account the reduction in automotive tariffs from 10 per cent to five per cent in January 2010. This reduction will mean that Australia's tariffs on passenger vehicles are amongst the lowest in the world. In fact, we will have the fifth most open market for cars in the world, and that is an important signal to the rest of the world about free trade. It is an important message at the moment about learning the lessons from the Great Depression and avoiding protectionism, particularly during a period of economic crisis and declines in world trade. That is obviously a larger global issue. We often wait for other nations to practically implement some of their rhetoric around free trade and not just talk about it. I have told the House a few times of my reservations about rapid tariff reductions, and I still hold those reservations. Australia does lead by example in this area, and my electors hope that the rest of the world follows at Doha. It is tremendously important to the world's economic growth, but it is also important for the rest of the world to match Australia's performance in this area. This bill does correct an unintended consequence that would have produced a threemonth gap in support from 1 January 2010 to 31 March 2010, which occurred through the linking of this scheme, ACIS, with the Automotive Transformation Scheme. Such things happen; you just have to get on and fix them. Nobody is immune to oversights or mistakes, and we are correcting this one. The content of the bill basically delinks assistance from a calculation based on an ever-declining tariff rate to a new calculation based on the flat rate of 7.5 per cent, and it treats the value of cars the same, regardless of whether they are produced for domestic or export markets. That is an important thing to do. As I conclude, I would like to make a few remarks about Bridgestone and about some of the economic dislocation that is occurring in the western and northern suburbs of Adelaide. Even before Bridgestone, we had faced over 3,000 redundancies, and a lot of those jobs were manufacturing jobs. If you want to know about the toll of the economic crisis then you need to come to western Adelaide or northern Adelaide. It is tremendously damaging to people's lives and to their families to lose a job and have to go on the hunt for a new one. It produces uncertainty and economic hardship, and it unsettles families and communities. We want to avoid that at all costs, which is one of the reasons why we have invested in the economy and put stimulus into the economy, because we know that, without that, thousands more would join the job queue. And that figure does not include Bridgestone; it does not include the 600 who will face an uncertain future as they come to the end of that plant's life. Many of these workers devoted decades of their lives to this plant, and it is not just for them; it is a way of life. Making tyres is a way of life. It is about their workmates and friends, who are more like a family than any other relationship. It is about losing stability and certainty about where they work and what they earn. Many of those workers face an uncertain future, and no-one in this House or outside of it can predict the individual paths that they will take from here. We have unions fighting for better wages. The government has visited the plant and has pledged resources for retraining. We have an excellent local employment coordinator, a lady named Pippa Webb, on the ground drumming up enthusiasm and putting employers who do want to employ Bridgestone workers together with those workers. There are some employers who have come to the party already, and I certainly congratulate them. But, in the end, no-one can predict the future for these workers, and such circumstances breed worry, anxiety and anger, and it is perfectly justified that these workers feel this way. When we visited the plant, along with the members for Makin and Port Adelaide and the Minister for Employment Participation, Mark Arbib, we took a tour through the plant. Such tours are always a little stagemanaged by companies, I think it would be fair to say, and workers are never entirely frank. But we did have a few interactions with some of these workers that just brought home what they face. One fellow who we stopped to talk to had previously had a WorkCover injury-he had an injured arm-but he was still working. The first thing he said to us was, ‘I want to work; I am a worker,' and you could just tell that, for him, that was the priority-that he get another job and have the dignity of looking after himself and his family. He did not want to go on the dole. He did not want a a job redundancy. He did not want to have to face uncertainty and unemployment. And I think that is commendable. These are the people that you are dealing with-good people; working-class people. Another worker I met had to suffer the indignity of hearing from a relative that his job was gone. He was a night-shift worker. His brother-in-law rang him to tell him that the plant was closing; he had seen it on the news. I think that is a terrible indignity for anybody to have to endure-to be told by a friend or a relative who has seen it on the news before you have heard it yourself. And if there is one message I want to give to companies, it is this: there is absolutely no excuse in this day and age for a worker to hear from someone else or from the news about their job being finished. These days, with text messages, emails and telephone calls, communication is instantaneous. You can have instantaneous communication with your workers-and Holden does this. When Holden has a significant change to any part of its plant or its production schedule, they make sure the workers know before the media know-that the workers know before anybody else knows. That is a really empowering thing to do. It is the decent thing to do. And it is in the company's self-interest, too, because you get the one message going out to workers; they are not left in the dark. I have seen many redundancies-at John Martins, at places like Harris Scarfe, and at textiles factories like Levi's in Adelaide. It is always a terrible process; it is always a difficult process. It is never pleasant for employers or employees. But it can be done properly, which means telling workers first, giving them accurate information and giving them certainty about their entitlements, about production schedules, about retraining options, about time off for a new job and about the method of paying redundancieswhether they can leave for a new job and still get their redundancy. These are all important things to do. Communicating with workers is an important thing to do. It makes a difficult process more bearable and it allows people to leave their jobs with some dignity and without bitterness or anger. It is my hope that Bridgestone adopt a best practice approach to their closure, but I am very fearful that they will not. I am very fearful that this company will get it wrong and that there will be a bitter taste left in these workers' mouths. Despite all the efforts of their unions and of this government, that is my fear. If there is one message I would like to leave the House and Bridgestone with it is that you have to actually do this right. is not good enough to just pack up and leave Australia and leave these workers in the lurch and not to a good job in saying goodbye. If it has to be goodbye, then do it properly.",92
148,Dr EMERSON,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (7.31 pm)-I thank those who have spoken on the ACIS Administration Amendment (Application) Bill 2009: the member for Groom, the member for Mayo, the member for Makin and the member for Wakefield. I do not know the member for Wakefield all that well, although I am getting to know him. I do know, though, that heMs Kate Ellis-Don't get too close!",95

150,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"Ignore the interjections, Minister.",95
151,Dr EMERSON,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"They are very disruptive, that is right. I do know that he has represented vulnerable workers during most of his working life before coming into this parliament and he has had to experience and work through the sort of dislocation that he has just described in respect of Bridgestone with textile, clothing and footwear workers. You have heard from the member for Wakefield some of the human costs associated with the dislocation and closure of plants and so on. When there is a story of human turmoil, the family is often badly affected. I think his call for businesses to be as sensitive and helpful and supportive as possible should be endorsed by everyone in the chamber. I know the member for Makin would join me in making those observations It and urging that we always need to be mindful of the terrible consequences for families of people losing their jobs-and he told of the loss of the dignity of work in one particular story. In summing up the bill I point out that the bill does amend the ACIS Administration Amendment Act 2009 to correct an unintended consequence arising from the act's link with the commencement date of the Automotive Transformation Scheme Act 2009. Under a New Car Plan for a Greener Future, the government announced additional support through the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme to smooth the transition to the Automotive Transformation Scheme. The additional support, estimated at $79.6 million, delinks the assistance rate for cars produced in 2010 from the general tariff rate and replaces it with a flat rate of 7.5 per cent. It also equalises the treatment of cars produced in 2010 for the export market with cars produced in 2010 for the domestic market. The unintended consequence, if not corrected by this bill, would be that not all the additional support would be provided, and this would diminish the ability of Australian vehicle producers to continue their recovery from the global economic crisis. I would quickly point out, too, that figures on motor vehicle sales in Australia came out yesterday and they are quite encouraging. I would add that the commentary on motor vehicle sales from the National Australia Bank points to the influence of the small business tax break and the fact that businesses appear to be getting in on that tax break before its expiry date of 31 December. I was asked by the member for Mayo to provide information to the parliament on when this oversight was detected and whether there was ample industry consultation. The advice to me is that the oversight was detected on 12 November and that there was ample industry consultation. By including an application provision, the bill clarifies that the government is providing additional assistance under ACIS for motor vehicle production from 1 January 2010, not 1 July 2010, as currently provided by the act. This amendment delivers the certainty promised to this vital manufacturing industry as moves into a new area where economic sustainability is driven by investment in innovation. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",95

153,Mr HAASE,AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR,"I rise to speak on the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy Bill 2009. The purpose of this bill is to establish the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy, ACRE-that is, the board and the position of chief executive officer. ACRE is an initiative under the government's Clean Energy Initiative, CEI, and will complement the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the expanded renewable energy target by supporting the research, development and demonstration of lowemission and renewable energy technologies. The Clean Energy Initiative, announced in the 2009-10 budget, also includes the Carbon it Capture and Storage Flagships Program, involving funding to support the construction and demonstration of large-scale integrated carbon capture and storage projects in Australia; the Solar Flagships Program, involving funding to support the construction and demonstration of large-scale solar power stations in Australia; and the Australian Solar Institute, which will support solar research and development and encourage collaboration between Australian researchers and with international solar researchers and institutes. The previous coalition government made a substantial investment of more than $2 billion in renewable and clean energy sources, including the Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund of $500 million, of which $350 million was committed to projects; Australian Asia-Pacific projects, worth $100 million, with a further $50 million committed for 2007 and beyond; the Renewable Energy Development Initiative, which was $100 million; and the mandatory renewable energy target, or MRET, which stimulated $3.5 billion in renewable energy investment after its introduction in 2001. Domestic level support included a photovoltaic rebate program, worth $202 million; a solar hot water rebate, at $252.2 million; the Green Vouchers for Schools program, at $336.1 million; and Solar Cities, at $75 million. The coalition's commitment to renewables was further evidenced in our successful negotiations earlier this year on the renewable energy target. The coalition supports Australia's transition to a lower emissions economy. But this transition must take place in a manner that does not jeopardise our energy security. Australia will need ongoing investment in alternative energy sources. We must consider, firstly, how to best make the transifusal tion to low emissions technology without risking jobs or investment and, secondly, what role Australia will play in the international supply of clean energy. Debate in Australia has been about both of these issues but has been almost exclusively confined to the context of clean coal development. Sure, it is an important technology, not least of all because 37 per cent of the world's power supply comes from coal. In Australia, 80 per cent of our energy comes from coal. The Rudd government must face up to the very real questions about how soon clean coal technology will be available for commercial use, what it will cost per megawatt hour and how much taxpayers will need to pay to subsidise the technology. Data released by the Rudd government's own Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute shows that clean coal power stations are unlikely to be viable until at least 2030. There is still no commercial scale clean coal power station anywhere in the world. Because we are the world's largest exporter of coal, our future is undeniably bound up with the viability of the coal industry. We cannot sweep under the carpet legitimate questions about how Australia's baseload energy requirements can be met at the same time as a reduction in emissions from coal. Australia's rapidly expanding gas industry has the ability to provide cleaner energy, and renewables will deliver 20 per cent of Australia's energy by 2020. However, to ensure Australia's energy security, a comprehensive mix is required. Gas, geothermal, solar, wind and clean coal research all have a role to play. We are not alone in facing the challenges of a transition to low emissions technology that does not compromise standards of living. But Australia is increasingly isolated in terms of the Rudd government's blatant reto consider the possibility of nuclear energy. All but four of the other G20 member countries use nuclear energy. Sooner or later Australia must have an open-minded and full debate about the role of nuclear energy. It is a question that the community should have full ownership of, but it is one the Rudd government is determined to smother. Australia needs serious clean energy alternatives that can be delivered at an affordable price in the short, medium and long term. The establishment of a national body such as ACRE by this government could not come sooner for the energy and resources sectors and the science community-in fact, for all Australians wanting to support renewable energies in Australia. It is hoped that the Rudd government is capable of ensuring that ACRE achieves the objectives it is designed to accomplish, those being strategies to develop, commercialise and use renewable energy technologies. Australia is home to one of the most diverse landscapes in the world, with each state responsible for exploring, researching and developing its own energy resources. These investments by each state in gathering information on renewable energy rightly ensure that residents and state businesses reap the benefits. However, this approach lessens the positive impact of information sharing between the states. The silos of information held within the states are traditionally guarded by the relevant agencies and the establishment of an umbrella authority, at least in theory, will ensure a cohesive arrangement of information sharing between the states. ACRE's intention is to address this very real lack of national coordination amongst renewable energy technology programs, and it is strongly hoped that the government will ensure the integrity of ACRE is not compromised to the same degree as the government's Energy Efficient Homes package. This scheme provided ceiling insulation worth up to $1,600, prior to its being wound back to $1,200, for Australian householders, including owner-occupiers, landlords and tenants of currently uninsulated homes or homes with very little ceiling insulation. The Energy Efficient Homes package is currently the subject of a Senate inquiry. This inquiry is into, but not limited to, the rorting and abuse of the rebate; the waste, inefficiency and mismanagement within the program; what advice was provided to the government on safety matters, particularly in relation to fire and electrocution risks; and what degree the government acted on this advice. By the way, submissions for this inquiry should be received by 18 December this year and the inquiry is due to report by 30 March 2010. One of the most blatant rorting scams to emerge under the Rudd government's controversial pink batts program was when $1,600 was paid to insulate a house set for immediate demolition. After it had been insulated, the house was vacated to make way for a new bus way. Imagine the shock for the former owner when she received a letter from Peter Garrett's department confirming it had just paid $1,600 to an installer to insulate the property. The house was demolished just a week after the insulation was claimed to have been installed in July. Reports of a couple receiving separate quotes-$300 and $1,600-for the same job is another example of the Rudd government's mishandling of the Energy Efficient Homes package. Reputed to be a billiondollar blow-out, this package reeks of waste and rorting. Industry leaders warned earlier this year that inexperienced and ill-trained installers would put themselves and homeowners at risk of electrocution and fire with their shoddy work. With one installer electrocuted and numerous others receiving serious shocks, this advice, which was not acted upon, has come back to haunt the Labor government. Authorities have also issued warnings after dozens of house fires have been started by incorrectly installed ceiling insulation. In fact, fire and consumer bodies in five states have warned of fires caused by insulation placed over hot downlights or ceiling fans. Upon the eventual admittance that there were huge problems associated with the installation, the Rudd government finally set up a program to randomly check the work of the insulation installers. The checking is to done by people with little or no insulation installation experience who sit through an induction lasting 30 to 45 minutes before they are sent out with a ladder and a torch to check on the installers. So from beginning to end this whole insulation debacle has demonstrated why we are right to call a Senate inquiry into the government's wasteful insulation program. With mounting evidence of a lack of cohesion and harmony within the Rudd government towards their policies, it is imperative that the government listen to all stakeholders and not give free rein to themselves in an area that is as important as renewable energy. It is with pride that I acknowledge the ongoing contribution of Western Australia to this new and exciting chapter in Australia's energy and resources sector, despite the many failed promises made to ordinary Western Australians by this government. In Western Australia, in which my electorate of Kalgoorlie encompasses the largest electoral landmass in Australia in addition to being one of the most resource-rich areas in Australia, there are currently five areas of major initiative being undertaken with regard to renewable energy projects. These areas of renewable energy are hydro, wind, biomass and solar energy-photovoltaic and solar thermal. In addition, wave energy technology is being tested with some degree of success. We look forward in the very immediate future to huge increases in the demand for renewable power. We are greatly concerned about the issue of climate change or weather change. We are also concerned about energy security. Perhaps I should say we ought to be more concerned about energy security because, as we move to legislate to make the generation of coal fired power less palatable and more costly-and I remind you that 80 per cent of Australia's power currently comes from coal power production-we need to be very careful indeed that ACRE does its jobs, and I will refer to one of the jobs that it might do, and do well, given its objectives. I remind you, Madam Deputy Speaker, of what ACRE's objectives are, and I will quote them: ACRE's objectives will be to promote the development, commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy … Specifically, amongst other things, it will do this by: (c) managing the cost effective delivery of ernment funded renewable energy and enabling technology programs; … … … (e) fostering collaboration between governments, industry and the research community on renewable energy projects; … … … (g) any other activities that it is directed to do by the Government to support renewable energy and enabling technologies. The elephant in the room undeniably in relation to greenhouse gas emissions reduction is the generation of electricity by the use of nuclear energy. The purists will argue that nuclear energy is not renewable energy because we only have a certain amount of uranium resources. But it is generally accepted at this point in time that Australia has some 40 per cent of the world's known uranium resources, and it would seem fairly obvious to even a blind man that, given the richness of this resource within Australia, Australiaand especially this government-ought be at least considering, with all of the hullabaloo going on about reducing greenhouse gases, the use of nuclear energy. Many critics of nuclear energy-and I am talking about the informed critics of nuclear energy; I am not talking about those who remain with their head firmly in the sand-will suggest to you, quite rightly, that, with the competition of brown coal as a source of energy, nuclear energy is not financially viable, and I accept that. But we are moving to an era where it is becoming more and more popular to embrace those energy sources that do not produce greenhouse gases. If we in this place could enlarge our minds for a moment, we need to consider another problem that this great nation of ours is facing: the issue of a shortage of water, and more specifically potable water. We have a major issue of wanting to avoid the generation of greenhouse Govgases. We have the major issue of guaranteeing water supply, specifically potable water supply. And we have the detractors suggesting we cannot have nuclear energy because we do not have the mass necessary to justify a plant of a size whereby there is economy of scale. I put it to the House that in addition to those two problems, with nuclear energy we could solve a third one. Currently the largest of our cities, at certain times of the year, have to suffer the problem of smog and exhaust gas created hazardous atmospheres. If we were to locate somewhere within a coastal region of south-eastern Australia a very safe generation IV nuclear power plant, we could size that power plant to a point whereby excess energy, excess electricity created-not required by those populations within easy transmission reach-could be used to extract hydrogen from water. And with the development of the hydrogen fuel cell and the development of motor vehicles using that form of energy conversion, we could be running cities with hydrogen fuel cell driven vehicles that would generate no pollution whatsoever. The only conversion that takes place is that oxygen is taken from the atmosphere and electricity and water are produced. We could perhaps either keep the water onboard to water the garden when we get home, or we could dampen down the streets for dust suppression. But it is a very simple solution. That is just one part of a possible justification of building nuclear power plants to a critical mass size. Perhaps I should not use ‘critical mass' in the same speech that is talking about the use of nuclear energy. The problem with potable water supply and the recognition today that desalinated water is going to be our saviour in the future for cities' potable water supply, generation IV nuclear power plant can do most efficiently-that is, to take seawater or saline water and produce potable water. Given that we are looking at population increases, given that we are looking at the change in the weather and the fact that we want to guarantee our water supply, including potable water supply, and given we want to clean up the atmosphere in cities, I suggest to this place that the great solution as we move into the future contemplating many forms of non-polluting energy sources, including renewable energy sources-if we are fair dinkum in this place about coming up with solutions and enabling technology to occur for the benefit of this nation and for the benefit of the people who live in this nation-then we must consider nuclear energy, nuclear power generation as a justifiable addition to the mix. To that end, the coalition supports this bill's recognition of and intent to address the lack of coordination within governments with regard to renewable energy technology programs which have evolved over a number of years. With the current government's dismal track record, it is imperative that the ACRE's aspirations are not jeopardised so as to ensure that Australia's energy future features a mix of technologies to guarantee we can make the transition to a lower emissions economy without compromising our energy security.",96
154,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR,"The purpose of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy Bill 2009 is to establish the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy and the position of chief executive officer. ACRE is an initiative under the Clean Energy Initiative. It will complement the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the expanded renewable energy target by supporting the research, development and demonstration of low emission and renewable that is what a energy technologies. It is very timely that we have a debate about renewable energy today. Whatever the political pressures we are under concerning a move away from carbon based energy, and no doubt they are significant, we have a duty to take a science based, evidence based approach. I note that Senator Nick Minchin recently said on Four Corners that climate change: For the extreme left … provides the opportunity to do what they've always wanted to do, to sort of de-industrialise the western world. You know the collapse of communism was a disaster for the and the, and really they embraced environmentalism as their new religion. Let me observe that I do not hear anyone proposing that we de-industrialise the Western world, and I hope that Senator Minchin looks closely at this bill when it gets to the Senate. Proposals to move to solar, wind and geothermal energy, or for greater energy efficiency or for electric cars, do not represent an atom of deindustrialisation. Proposals for solar panels and rainwater tanks promote the kind of household self-reliance one would expect a champion of rugged individualism to be enthusiastic about. More worrying, it suggests that Senator Minchin is so stuck in the Cold War battles of the past, locked in time with the fall of the Berlin Wall 20 years ago, that he is going to see this issue through ideological blinkers rather than look at the science, look at the evidence, look at the facts. Apparently he would rather see his own city of Adelaide sizzle and burn than admit that the Left might be right about this issue. Contrary to the propaganda of commentators like Senator Minchin, most people who seek to protect the environment do not want to lower their standard of living; what they seek to do is to put their lifestyle on a sustainable basis. It is true that some aspects of our lifestyle have become extravagant and excessive and that there is plenty of scope to reduce our consumption of electricity, water and vehicle fuels. But our need for electricity, for water and for cars is not going to go away, and it does not need to. What is needed is to generate that electricity, deliver that water and power our vehicles from energy sources in a way that does not trash the planet. That is why we need to move to renewable energy and that is why we need this bill. It is said that renewable energy is not capable of meeting Australia's baseline power left, needs. This is quite misleading, on three counts. First, much of the increase in power use, and therefore the increase in carbon emissions, arises at peak periods-for example, the use of air-conditioners on hot summer days. This is precisely the time at which solar power works best. Renewable energy which meets peak demand is extremely important in meeting our future energy needs. Secondly, while any given renewable energy source may be intermittent, the fact is there are many different energy sources located across many different areas of Australia. In combination, they are capable of meeting large chunks of Australia's power needs in a predictable, reliable way. The existence of the national electricity grid facilitates this. Thirdly, it is not a matter of all or nothing. For example, wind power can operate in concert with gas fired power stations to produce power with much fewer carbon emissions than our present coal fired arrangements. People who claim that renewable energy can only operate at the fringe of electricity generation are quite wrong. Professor Ian Lowe has pointed out that renewables now account for a quarter of the installed energy capacity of California, half of Norway's and three-quarters of Iceland's. Grid connected solar energy is growing at 60 per cent per annum worldwide and renewable energy industries now employ nearly two million people. These are examples of just some of the renewable technologies which are presently being applied. Solar thermal power plants generate electricity using heat. Much like a magnifying glass, reflectors focus sunlight onto a fluid filled vessel, generating heat that drives a turbine to produce electricity. The United States and Spain are developing this technology-ironically, originally conceived in the early 1990s at the University of Sydneywith plans for over 5½ thousand megawatts of new capacity to come online by 2012. The output from these plants would be enough to power one-quarter of Australian homes. Solar photovoltaics, solar PVs, use semiconductors to convert sunlight energy into direct current electricity. Excess energy is stored in batteries for later use. It can also be fed back into the electricity grid. Australia receives enough solar energy in one day to supply half a plant's annual energy use, but countries like Germany and Japan are way ahead of us in using this technology. There is solar hot water, which is mandatory in Israel. There is wind power. Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy in wind into mechanical energy. The Texas state government is driving an effort to build 23,000 megawatts of windgenerating capacity, the equivalent of 23 coal fired power plants-enough to meet the residential needs of half of Texas's population. It would take 4,200 wind turbines to meet all of South Australia's energy needs. Denmark, which is two-thirds the size of Tasmania, has already installed 5,000 turbines. Then there is bioenergy generated from organic matter. This is suitable for electricity, heating and transportation. It is important to note that growing crops for bioenergy purposes should not compromise global food production or degrade native forests. Unfortunately, there is evidence of this occurring in emerging countries such as Brazil and Indonesia. I want to say a little bit more this evening about geothermal energy. It does not get discussed much in the parliament, but it is potentially the largest source of energy in the world today. Unlike solar energy, which comes to the earth from the sun, geothermal energy comes from deep within the planet itself. Like solar energy and wind power, geothermal energy could, if properly developed, match all of the energy available from coal, oil and gas combined. Indeed, the amount of geothermal energy potentially available is, according to the United States Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu, effectively unlimited. And Al Gore's most recent book says that the amount of geothermal power available is so frequently underestimated primarily because its use as a source of electricity has long been associated with the few locations where hot water bubbles or spouts to the surface. In fact, the global geothermal resource base of stored thermal energy is very large. According to the United Nations world energy assessment report, the geothermal resource is roughly 280,000 times the annual consumption of primary energy in the world. Moreover, geothermal power has numerous advantages over any other form of energy. Unlike coal, oil and gas geothermal energy has virtually no CO2 emissions. Geothermal plants are modular and scalable. They have the smallest environmental footprint on the surface. Like solar power, geothermal resources are available virtually everywhere on earth. It is underneath developing countries as well as wealthier countries. It is not intermittent. Once it is in place it provides power 24 hours a day. There are two kinds of geological areas where geothermal resources have traditionally been most easily located. The parts of the earth where the temperature beneath the surface gets hottest are usually located at the boundaries where tectonic plates come together and where active volcanoes are often found. There is a new and growing excitement about geothermal electricity, based on new technologies, that makes it possible to exploit sites deep in the earth that have enormous amounts of heat but lack one or more of the characteristics found in hydrothermal reservoirs. For example, many of these sites do not have water. Capturing the energy from these new non-hydrothermal resources has led to new approaches. This new technology for making geothermal power is called ‘enhanced' or ‘engineered' geothermal systems. By using new technology that exploits the advances in drilling and reservoir stimulation-developed in part as a result of the frenzy of oil and gas exploration in the 20th century to create active reservoirs that emulate the properties of hydrothermal systems-geologists and engineers believe that they have found ways to produce extremely large sources of geothermal power from regions several miles deep in the crust of the earth. The geothermal resources worldwide are usually associated with volcanic activity, but we also have geothermal resources in Australia associated with heat-producing granites. Development work is underway in the Eromanga Basin in South Australia and Queensland as well as in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. The potential geothermal resource is estimated at 450 times Australia's total energy needs. Geothermal energy could directly replace coal fired power, as it provides a constant power source. I think that this parliament and this country need to put a greater investment of energy and effort into exploiting this great potential resource. The fact is that Australia has a lot of potential-a lot of unrealised potentialin relation to renewable energy. Australia currently sources just eight per cent of its electricity from renewable energy, down from 10 per cent in 1997. Australian electricity consumption has increased more rapidly than renewable electricity supply. This compares very unfavourably with Germany, which has 25 times more wind energy installed than Australia. Even though their wind sites are less windy than Australia's worse commercial sites, they have six times more wind energy per person than Australia. Japan and Germany each have 24 times more solar-electric panels installed than Australia despite having significantly poorer solar resources. At the end of 2005 both of those countries had 1,400 megawatts, compared to Australia's 60 megawatts. So, although Australia has unrivalled solar, wind and geothermal resources and led the world in the development of solar technology, we have not been using these natural advantages in the way that we should. We have had companies move overseas for want of market support. In a 2006 review of international markets' attractiveness to renewable energy investors, Australia ranked 16th-that is, fourth from the bottom. This is unfortunate. Globally, there is a lot of investment in renewable energy. In 2005, worldwide investment in new renewable energy was worth US$38 billion. In 2005, grid connected solar-PV power grew by 55 per cent and wind power grew by 24 per cent. I also believe we need to look at vehicles. In June this year we saw General Motors in America go into bankruptcy. This company basically failed to see where petrol prices were going and failed to see where consumers were going. Our car manufacturers need to think seriously about manufacturing cars that run only on electricity. China, Israel and Denmark are doing this. There are companies that have produced a business plan involving the construction of car battery recharging stations at parking spaces and billing motorists online for the electricity they use. Fully charged cars would be able to travel around 160 kilometres, and for longer trips motorists would pull into stations resembling car washes and exchange their spent batteries for new ones. The Silicon Valley based company Better Place has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and entered into agreements with Israel, Denmark, a number of governments in the United States, Renault and Nissan. Under the Better Place model, consumers can either buy or lease an electric car from the French auto maker Renault or the Japanese car maker Nissan and then purchase miles on their electric car battery in the same way people purchase mobile phone time from a mobile phone carrier. The cars are sold at a relatively low price and owners are charged operating fees. The total cost of owning an electric car, including the upfront prices and ongoing operating expenses, is expected to be less than for a conventional car. China is seeking to become the leading producer of hybrid and all-electric cars within three years. It is behind the United States, Japan and other countries when it comes to making gas-powered vehicles, but it is skipping the current technology and hoping to get a jump on the next one. Of course, electric cars that use electricity from traditional sources produce carbon, but, if we move to renewable energy such as solar, wind, geothermal and other carbon-free methods of producing electricity, we could obviously get around this problem. That would give drivers freedom from petrol price fluctuations, and Australia would get a sustainable future for our car industry, an improved trade balance and energy independence. Finally, I want to note that it is not about renewable energy, it is also about energy efficiency. It is important that we have balanced approach to this issue. I commend to the parliament the formation lian Alliance to Save Energy, which intends to raise the profile of Australia's opportunities in energy efficiency in a concerted and sustained way. Its operating model is drawn directly from the Alliance to Save Energy, headquartered in Washington, DC, and it has had senior representatives from Washington advising it during its formation phase. The Alliance to Save Energy has been at the centre of energy policy debates in the United States for over 30 years and has helped design, implement and evaluate a range of domestic and international demand-side programs and distributed-energy programs. The government has been very active on the renewable energy front. We have had the initiatives in the 2009-10 budget, including a $4.5 billion clean energy initiative. We have had the renewable energy target legislation, which we debated and passed earlier this year. And, finally, we now have the establishment of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. I commend the government on its renewable energy initiatives and I commend the bill to the House.",100
155,Mr KATTER,AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR,"I have never seen a debate where there is so much hot air and so little science. I do not know why people do not actually sit down with scientists and go over this in detail. Madam Deputy Speaker, imagine that four of my Akubra hats are up on the ceiling and that the ceiling above us is a giant fluorescent light. Would those four Akubra hats stop this room from being illuminated? Clearly, they are going to have virtually no effect at all. But that is what you are saying. You are saying that 400 parts per million of carbon is going to reflect light back to earth. Let us have a look at the science of this. You have just CO2 molecules floating around and you have photons-light-going upwards from the a earth. The photons from the sun's rays rebound and go back up again, and they hit the of the Austra- CO2 molecules. A tiny bit of that energy is absorbed by the molecule, but basically the photon is deflected. It continues on to outer space. If you throw a rock at a boulder that is poking up, the rock will continue to go forward unless you actually hit the boulder right in the centre-otherwise, it will continue its forward momentum. It will not come back down to earth; it will continue in forward momentum. You do not have to be a scientist to work all of this out. I am not a global warming sceptic; I am a global warming anti, as I have said on many occasions in this place. If you do not like position, then for heaven's sake argue the science of it in this place. This is where it needs to be argued. Having said that, we have a dramatic increase, and that is occurring at an increasing rate. We have an exponential growth here in the problem. So, whilst there is no global warming now-and I could not really see a serious problem arising for another century or two centuries, as far as global warming goes; and it is not the case in the oceans-if you increase the CO2 level of the atmosphere, you will increase the CO2 level in the oceans by exactly the same rate. I scouted around and found out that Dr Katrina Fabricius at the Institute of Marine Science is one of the world's renowned scientists in this field. I was told she is one of the top scientists in the world in this fieldshe is a very self-deprecating person and she denied that, but I think it may be true. We know the pH levels in the earth are sevenseven is neutral. Seawater is 8.1. It has a logarithmic change. A change of only 0.1 of a pH unit will result in a 30 per cent increase in hydrogen ions. They are ionic and I think they would be referred to as free radicals. Whilst I do not want to get too carried away with the science, if you have CO2 plus H2O you end up with H plus ions plus HCO3, moving on to CO3, CO2 minus, plus 2H plus. What that means to a layman like me is that at this pH level there is a decreased number of CO3 ions because they have now become HCO3. No CO3 is available to form calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate comes from the shell of shellfish. A vast area of all ocean biodiversity is in fact shellfish. The food supply chain has at its very basis biovalves, if you like, which are shellfish. They cannot be seen by the naked eye. We can dig up eugaries under the bridge, but biovalves that are very small particles-the same sort of thing but infinitely smaller. I asked: has any hard research been done? Dr Fabricius said yes. She pulled out a study, which I refer to the House: ‘Marine biocalcifiers exhibit mixed response to CO2 induced ocean acidification'. Justin Ries, Anne Cohen and Daniel MCCorkle are the authors of the paper. It was in Geology, in December 2009. It is a very honest document in so far as five of the sea life that have been analysed do not show any negative response as a result of increasing carbon dioxide in the seawater, but, of the 18, the rest of them do. There is a very serious change in calcium carbonate growth as a result of the increasing carbon dioxide in the ocean. What all that means is that we do have a problem that we may have to look at seriously in the immediate future. I think that every member of parliament in this placeeven a person who may be described as being at one extreme of the debate-would say, and even I would say, that we need to take a bit of a pull on the reins. How would you do that? I had the privilege of being the mines and energy minister in the Queensland government. No greenie am I-I can assure you. I am just the opposite of a greenie and my government was an anti-greens government. We resolved to go to solar hot water systems in all of the government houses in Queensland. If we did that, over the next 10 years-and I think it was more likely to be over the next six or seven years-we would not have to build a 1,000-megawatt power station, which was about one-fifth of our generating capacity in Queensland at that stage. So what I was doing was saving the taxpayers of Queensland $1,000 million. You might well ask: ‘Hold on a minute. You've got the cost of the solar hot water systems.' They were government houses. If you added the rent and the electricity charges together, we would increase the rent to pay for the solar hot water system and of course the electricity costs would come down. The net result would be a reduction in the cost to the householder. This may sound like magic but it was no magic. We were a very hardnosed government that could add up-almost all of us were people from private business; some of us made a lot of money and some of us had lost a lot of money as well as having made a lot of money. We knew what it was like to make an economic decision. The economic decision was taken that we would move to solar hot water systems. Very regretfully, we lost government the next year and the scheme was abandoned by the incoming Labor government-the people who come in here and preach to us about how we should be saving the planet! A CSIRO gentleman-I think it was Dr Sacher; I may stand corrected on that-got a lot of publicity for saying that the government proposal will not work. The government proposal being put up here simply will not work. It will not work because you cannot avoid being honest at some stage in government. The government is being honest and says it will have to let them plant trees. I am desperately opposed to massive monoculture. On the scale that we are talking about here, literally millions of hectares would be required. That is what is going to happen. Madam Deputy Speaker Saffin, your area and my area are suffering as a result of tree plantations. We are losing jobs left, right centre because of the managed investment schemes which the last government failed to control and the current government is failing to control. An awful lot of these investors are simply looking for a way not to meet their tax burden and they are putting their money into trees. To give you some idea of what is going to happen, thousands of acres were wiped out in Ingham in the last flood. People do not understand that trees take a hell of a lot of looking after. The environments in which they are being planted, where you can have millions of hectares, are not naturally kind to trees. Trees will grow there but at a very, very restricted rate of growth, unless you can apply some irrigation to them. We planted a million trees in the most wonderful tree-friendly regime in the world in Far North Queensland during the Greening Australia campaign and I am reliably informed that only 28,000 of those trees are left. What will happen here is that you will see the Macquarie Banks and the Goldman Sachs and all of those people growing wealthy through buying and selling securities out there, because the new security will be the carbon credits that you will buy and sell. They will be a tradeable commodity worth thousands of millions of dollars, and these people will get hundreds of millions of dollars, if not thousands of millions of dollars, for trading these securities backwards and forwards. If there is something that we are absolutely notorious for in this country, it is gambling. It comes from the fact that almost all of our forebears who were here before the Second World War and all the miners before for one the Boer War came out during the gold rushes. There is no doubt that built into our culture is a bit of a gambling culture. If you put thousands of millions of dollars worth of securities out there, all we are going to be doing once again in Australia is playing russian roulette with securities. We are going to and plant a whole stack of trees that simply will not be there in 30 or 40 years time. We will have wasted all of this time, money and effort and we will not have reduced the CO2. The CSIRO officers-I must praise them very highly but I do not want to embarrass them by mentioning their names-believe most profoundly that their own government is on the wrong track here. They believe that the government should be taking positive action to reduce the CO2, not relying upon the marketplace. Surely in this country we have woken up to the fact that marketism is dead-and it has almost killed Australia with it. There is no doubt about that. Manufacturing has gone and agriculture in this country is two-thirds gone. There is nothing left except the mining regime, which is now going to be destroyed by having to carry a burden and a handicap that no-one else on earth has to carry. It is going to be 25 per cent of the cost of mining. I rang three of the biggest mines in Australia to confirm this figure: 25 per cent of the cost of mining is in electricity. There seems very little doubt, and no-one is denying, that the cost of electricity is going to go through the roof when this occurs. Let us look at the options. I refer to Professor Szokolay's book The Solar Home. It is a book that is highly respected throughout the world. It is on the reading list of many universities around the world but particularly in the United States. The book says that 40 per cent of domestic energy consumption is in the heating of water. So we could reduce by 20 or 30 per cent domestic consumption in one hit. Madam Deputy Speaker, your area and my area are quite capable of producing 20 per cent, maybe 30 per cent, of Australia's petrol needs. I hold up to you, as I have done many times in this House, the government's own graph of oil production and the graph shows that up until almost 2002 we were self-sufficient in oil. As the Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson, has pointed out in this place on numerous occasions, that graph rapidly divides now and by 2014 Australia will have only one-third of its oil requirements met by its own indigenous reserves. Surely we are going to do something about a situation which will cause another massive blowout in the current account and make us totally dependent upon Indonesia and the Middle East for our source of oil. That can transform itself immediately into 60 per cent indigenous if we move to ethanol. We highly praise the New South Wales government for the initiatives they are taking. I am deeply depressed to tell you that no such initiatives are coming out of Queensland. There is a lot of hot air and rhetoric-they have been promising it now for about 11 years-but nothing has transpired. On the other side of the document I am holding here, as I have held up on many occasions in this House, is a picture of a very handsome fellow in a big white Akubra hat in Sao Paulo in Brazil filling up his Holden motor car at 74c a litre. The price in Australia at the same time was 124c a litre. Unfortunately, I lost the picture of me filling up a motor car in Minnesota for 84c a litre. The United States and Brazil have ethanol; this country does not. Why doesn't it? Because the government listens to the big corporations. The political parties are in the hands of the big corporations. That is the only reason this country, which is so suited to ethanol, has not gone there. If we switch to an ethanol regime, no less a person than Al Gore-the greenies patron saint-nominates on I think page 136 of An Inconvenient Truth the first solution as corn ethanol. Corn ethanol is only one-third the value-it is only 29 per cent-and is only one-third as good as sugar ethanol, which is available in the electorates of the honourable member for Richmond, who has just stood down from the chair, the member for Dawson and the member for Leichhardt and my electorate. We can do it tomorrow if we get the cooperation of the government. But the government is spending $120 million on building a solar energy research centre in Canberra. What in heaven's name? The last place on earth I would put a solar energy research centre is in Canberra. I have not got time, unfortunately, to outline to the House just what dumbness has come out of this place, but let me just give you one example. Debate interrupted. NA",104
156,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 8.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Veterans",108
157,Mr JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to raise a very important issue that concerns a substantial majority of my electorate. In particular it concerns the veterans of the Ryan electorate. This is an issue that, quite frankly, neither political party has taken to heart. It is an indictment of both parties. I regret to say that, during the time of the Howard government, we did not give this front and centre attention. But the now Labor federal government, led by Prime Minister Rudd, has been especially dismissive and should be especially sanctioned because, during the 2007 election campaign, the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rudd, told the veterans of Australia and of the Ryan electorate that, if he were elected, he would make it a priority to ensure that there was equity, fairness and justice in relation to tary superannuation and the pensions of veterans. I want to read into the Hansard the words of a very distinguished Ryan constituent, a former brigadier of the Australian Army, who is widely respected in Ryan for his service to our nation wearing the uniform and for his continued commitment to equity, fairness and justice, not just for himself but for many veterans who do not have the voice, the eloquence and the status that he has as a former brigadier. I refer to his letter to me because it reflects the scores of emails to me from veterans and their families who see this as an issue of equity, fairness and justice. This is what Brigadier Brian Wade AM-and I should say very clearly for the record that he has been awarded an AM by this country-of Taringa said to me, writing on 31 October: Dear Michael, I am writing to express my extreme displeasure in relation to the Government's decision to adopt the recently released Matthews Report into the indexation of Military and other Commonwealth Superannuation. This is a matter which is of considerable importance to all of the current and retired Military community and the purpose of this letter is to ask you to take some action. The effect of the implementation of this report is that Military Superannuation Pensions will remain indexed to the CPI, whereas Welfare and Age Pensions are indexed at a higher rate, namely the greater of CPI or Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Costs Index (PBLIb) or Male Total Average Weekly Earnings (MTAWE), and pre-2004 MP's and High Court Judges Pensions are wage based indexed to the salaries of serving backbench MPs. I have seen credible statistics and graphs which show that, in the period 1989 to 2008, Military Superannuation Pensions rose by 68%, while Age Pensions rose by 110% and those of retired MP's rose by 131 per cent! miliPut another way, a person who had served our country in uniform and retired in 1989 on a Superannuation pension of $30,000 would, in 2008 be receiving $50,400. Compare that to $63,000 for a welfare recipient and $69,300 for a politician! Hardly fair by any measure. I do not know if those figures are 100 per cent accurate. I will not challenge them for their absolute accuracy, but, even if they are only partially accurate, I cannot stand by, as the member for Ryan, as the son and grandson of veterans from different theatres, at different times, who wore the uniform for their different countries, and say that we are satisfied with the current position. We must do something. For the record, I want to make it very clear that I intend to continue to raise this issue of fairness, equity and justice in my party and in the parliament, because this is the right thing to do. If it requires substantial allocation of funds and the withdrawal of funds from elsewhere, then I am prepared to work with anybody in government or in the bureaucracy to find those billions of dollars, because there is great waste in this government. There is great waste in budgets. There is an opportunity for us to find money for a more equitable, more just and more fair cause. The country must honour those who have worn the uniform in our name and served under our flag. We must honour them. (Time expired) Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan",108
158,Mr SYMON,ADJOURNMENT,"Last Friday, I had the pleasure of visiting some of the sites in my electorate that are undergoing work as part of the government's Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan, along with the Victorian coordinator-general of the program. There are over 284 nation-building projects being delivered in Deakin, at a total cost of almost $127 million. While the sites I visited on Friday represent only a small snapshot of everything that is going on in my electorate, they were an excellent example of the nation-building programs that the Rudd government is investing in for our future. The four sites that we visited on Friday showed how the government is investing in housing, transport infrastructure and education. We began the day with a tour of a new social housing development in Ringwood East, in Stanley Avenue, a place I know very well-I looked at a house there for purchase many years ago. The development consists of six units and was recently completed, with some tenants having already moved in. I spoke to Norm Robinson, the builder in charge of the project, who has done a fantastic job and has other similar projects ongoing in the local area. Social housing projects sometimes have issues relating to their proximity to transport, shopping centres and other amenities. I am pleased to say that the development I visited in Stanley Avenue in Ringwood East is located close to great local facilities-the station, the school and medical and health services-which is one of the reasons why I looked at buying a house very close by many years ago. It is an excellent example of a well-planned social housing development. We then went on to visit the site of a most important project and certainly the No. 1 local issue in my electorate-the Springvale Road Rail Separation at Nunawading. This project is coming along very quickly, which will be welcome news to the more than 50,000 vehicles and the people in them that use the crossing each day, the people in the 218 trains that go across it each day and the 5,000 pedestrians who also have to fight their way through this mess. The $140 million project is receiving funding of $80 million from the federal government and a grant from the state government for $60 million. This demonstrates a great partnership between two great Labor governments. I was given a tour of the building site on Friday and it was fantastic to see the progress that has been made since I was last there on 29 July when I saw the first pole being driven into the ground. The building of the new Nunawading station site has commenced. Modular train station buildings are being installed this month as well as the west and east side station roof canopies. Cranes, boom lifts and scissor lifts are everywhere on the site. Over 150 people are working on this project. I am told that the project is on track to finish on time, and I have no doubt that the Springvale Road Rail Alliance will achieve this goal. The workers are doing a great job on this long-overdue project, and the cooperation between employers and the unions on site is commendable. We then visited two primary schools in the area that have received funding under the government's Primary Schools for the 21st Century program and the National School Pride Program. New multipurpose halls are being constructed at the schools, and the principals at each of these schools are very excited about the projects that are happening right under their nose. At Blackburn Primary School, we met up with Principal, Sue Henderson, and builders, Higgins. They showed us the progress of the new hall on that already has its concrete slab, steel work, timber frames and roof. The hall is moving along at a great rate of knots and should be completed around May next year. We then went to Burwood East Primary School where we saw another Higgins' construction, a new multipurpose hall, which is also progressing well. The builders are at the point of putting in the windows and the fitout. Until this project, this school did not have a hall. Quite often, the school has had to conduct assemblies in the baking sun or the pouring rain because there was simply not the room to hold assemblies anywhere else but outside. While these projects represent only a fraction of the great work being done in my electorate and, indeed, around the country, they show us how the government's economic stimulus plan is working to build the infrastructure we need for generations to come. We should also remember that the Liberal and National parties voted against the stimulus plan. If those opposite had their way, there would have been no social housing development and no money for local schools to build new halls or paint their classrooms. How can we forget their vote against the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Amendment Bill on 1 June this year? If this bill had failed to pass through the houses, there would have been no money to fix Melbourne's worse level crossing at Springvale Road and provide for over 100 other road and rail projects across Australia. The Liberals had promised for more years than I can remember to fix Springvale Road, so the sheer hypocrisy of their promising funding for Springvale Road in an election campaign while voting against Labor's funding bill in this House simply astounds me. As the events of today prove, the Liberal Party's only interest is in their own jobs, not those of site. It working Australians. (Time expired) Property Rights",109
159,Mr HAWKE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to speak about the ongoing erosion of private property rights in Australia due to an increase in the amount of environmental legislation and associated legislation affecting the rights of property owners. In particular, I want to raise this concern in relation to my electorate, which is an outer metropolitan electorate in Sydney, where property owners are being subjected to many plans from all layers, and often overlapping layers, of government that ensure the ability of property owners to use their land in a productive way is reduced. I want to note that, this week, Queensland's Labor government have introduced a new environmental property credential in their legislation that requires anyone selling their home to complete a 56-point questionnaire detailing the property's environmental credentials. This gives effect to the fact that, before being able to offer a property for sale, homeowners must fill out forms describing the home's energy and water efficiency, including whether or not it has solar power, a gas cooktop, insulation, water-saving shower heads and a rainwater tank. I want to record that this is just the latest intrusion upon a property owner's rights, considering that, if anybody were seeking to purchase the property, of course they would be seeking to understand all of its facilities and whether or not these were good quality improvements. This is a piece of mindless bureaucracy. However, I particularly want to speak about the Native Vegetation Conservation Act in New South Wales that has completely removed the ability of a property owner to clear their land. The Native Vegetation Conservation Act requires that all landowners have approval before they clear their land, regardless of what they are clearingwhether it is weeds or forests. The act covers anything that may be classed as a plant. This legislation came into effect on 1 January 1998 under the Carr Labor government, ostensibly to manage land clearing in New South Wales. The government says that land clearing is now better managed than at any other point in the state's history. I suspect that is not the view of farmers whom I have spoken to around the state of New South Wales. I have been to different parts of New South Wales. Just this week I was in Cooma at a large property where land clearing is an issue for people wanting to productively use the land. The extent of land that is at risk from salination is certainly recognised; however, the ability of a landowner to interpret what use is best for the land has been removed by this legislation. I regard farmers as the best people to manage the land and the best people to productively use the land and care for it and they have historically done so, but they have been removed from the equation and replaced by government-and that is something which I reject. Further, I want to record something that is symptomatic of this ongoing assault on property rights and ownership. In Parramatta, near my electorate of Mitchell, we saw the famous High Court case relating to the Civic Place redevelopment by Parramatta City Council. The High Court ruled 5-0 in favour of the landowners that the council did not have a case to take away their property or to acquire their property compulsorily without their consent. What we then saw was a disgraceful move by the New South Wales government to change the law after a citizen took their right to travel to the High Court and receive a 5-0 verdict in favour of landowners and against the council. The New South Wales state Labor government simply changed the law and allowed for the compulsory acquisition of that property. The amendment to the Land Acquisition (Just Terms Compensation) Act, which clarified, according to the government, the original intention of the act, once again eroded the capacity of a person in this country to use their property in the way that they wanted. On behalf of those property owners in my electorate who had their ability to rezone or redevelop their property restricted by over 37 plans in some cases-REPs, LEPs, local development controls-I want to record that this trend that government has more and more control and the landowner has less and less say over property in Australia needs to be resisted and needs to be changed. Certainly I reject the idea that the government, on whatever basis, be it environmental or on the basis that it knows better than a landowner what it ought to achieve from a piece of property, is not one that I accept. So in defence of those people in Queensland who now have 56-point questionnaires in relation to their property and in defence of the people in Parramatta, I reject this idea. (Time expired) Page Electorate",110
160,Ms SAFFIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I want to talk about my electorate of Page, about what a wonderful electorate it is, the whole 16,091 square kilometres of it, and the people, some 137,000-odd at the last census, that is, two per cent of the population of New South Wales, and just how wonderful some of the people are. I do so on what is the ond anniversary of my having the privilege and pleasure of being elected to represent people of Page. It has been two years since the general election when I was elected as part of the Rudd Labor government. I am very proud to be a member of the government and I am very proud to be the local resentative in Page. I have worked hard over the past two years and made some good progress in key areas. I know there is still gress to make-there has been a lot that has not been done in Page over a long period. I am making progress in the key areas of education, roads, bypasses, preschoolsthere are about 37 community preschools in my electorate-in health with the Grafton Base Hospital redevelopment and with the Integrated Cancer Care Centre at Lismore Base Hospital. There is a lot more that I want to do in health and the reforms will go some way towards tackling long standing problems in health. I am making progress in small business matters, community services and housing and also in smaller community projects-I am just being a committed and consistent advocate for our area. That is what most people want at a local level, particularly in Page. I am also tackling a number of projects which I am driving, supporting, being involved in and advocating for-things like the agri-tourism project. Currently research is being done by the bureau of rural research in certain areas around Australiathankfully, Northern Rivers is one of themlooking at what can be done to help landholders, particularly farmers, develop the agri-tourism market. Also I am involved locally in a football project. That is a project in which I have taken a lead, along with Craig Foster, who would be known to some of you-he comes from Lismore-and Southern Cross University and others, working with the vision, the goal, of having an Asia Pacific centre for football in our area, to resecspond to local needs and also to the broader Asia-Pacific. That is a project we are curthe rently working up with the Football Federation of Australia and Northern New South Wales Football. We are fortunate also to have the Southern Cross University, which covers five electorrep- ates in New South Wales from Port Macquarie, to Coffs Harbour, through Grafton to Lismore and Tweed Heads, and there is a pronew campus under construction at the Gold Coast Airport precinct, which should be open in February. Last week's local newspapersNorthern Star, Tweed Daily News and Coffs Coast Advocate-ran good articles detailing the value of the Southern Cross University to the North Coast, the Tweed and the smaller Gold Coast region. The value is some $483 million and the breakdown is as follows: $292 million to Northern Rivers region, $67 million to Coffs Coast and $125 million to Tweed and Gold Coast areas. The newly appointed Vice-Chancellor, Peter Lee, was quoted in the Northern Star as saying: We are based in Lismore and remain the heart of a multi-campus university. It was the Southern Cross University's Regional Futures Institute which prepared the report, which is a first and reflects the combined efforts of many in the university community and more broadly. There are 1,873 jobs which arise out of the university with new projects yet to come. (Time expired) Assisting the Victims of International Terrorism Legislation",112
161,Mr BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Paterson) (8.50 pm)Last night in the Main Committee I spoke on the Assisting the Victims of International Terrorism Bill 2009 and unfortunately, due to timing, I did not get to put on the record all of my concerns. I want to say that I support the private member's bill as put forward by the member for Warringah, seconded by me, which provides up to $75,000 in compensation for the victims of international terrorism when they are subjected to terrorism overseas. Why do I support this? I support this because I have a personal knowledge, feeling for and understanding of those who have been victims of international terrorism. A person I have known for some 14 years, Paul Anicich, and his wife Penny, and Tony Purkiss, who I have known for a while, are outstanding people. I have seen the effect of bomb blast in Bali in 2005 on their lives. As members of parliament we can stand here and speak all we like about what we think or understand they are going throughthe pain, the suffering, the loss of quality life, the loss of income, the stresses on famiindeed, lies-but I am not Paul Anicich and I am not Tony Purkiss. I cannot feel what they feel. I can only think I understand what they are going through. As I said in the Main Committee last night, the Paul Anicich that I met 14 years ago was a leading legal practitioner in the Hunter. He was a model corporate citizen, shown through his engagement and leadership in the community. Tony Purkiss was an outstanding man. But I see these people now and it breaks my heart to see what they have gone through. Paul Anicich, when he came to see me not long after he got back to Australia and started to recover, wanted nothing more than a victim's gold health card to help offset the additional financial costs of health treatasked ment for what he went through in that bomb blast on that night in October 2005. Paul did not want cash; he just wanted some assistance by way of a card. He found it extremely traumatic to go to a new doctor and have to go through the whole scenario again, of what happened to him and the treatments-that is, of reliving that moment over and over again. He wanted to be spared that. The private member's bill put forward by the member for Warringah and seconded by me has our support. It was argued last night that there was no precedent for a $75,000 payment for victims in this situation. I would put to you that under the provisions of state governments there is a $75,000 victim of crime payment available. We are saying that these are Australian citizens, that these are Australians that deserve our support and that we as a federal government should make that available to those people a payment of $75,000. That would go not just to the individual victims but to parallel the state provisions so that, if somebody had unfortunately been killed by one of these acts, their next of of kin would be able to access this support-as, they are able under the state provisions-to help. This would not be a hugely expensive exercise. To date, if all the around 300 people from Australia who have been victims of international terrorism were paid $75,000, it would amount to less than $23 million. That is not a lot of money in the scheme of things. The Prime Minister today decided to berate me for wanting to speak in support of this. I support his idea of establishing a national insurance scheme. But that is for the individual. This is about supporting the victims of international terrorism. I would have thought that doing something to help our fellow Australians who have suffered at this would have been a noble thing to do. So I the Prime Minister to go back to the drawing board, to reconsider his opinion and to look at this as a special case, as a special need for support. There is no member in this parliament who could ever know-and I hope they will never experience-what these people as individuals and their families have gone through. My call goes out to the Prime Minister: have a heart and consider the plight of these people and their pain and their suffering. Assisting the Victims of International Terrorism Legislation  to correct the public record following the contribution of the member for Paterson. Madam Deputy Speaker, as you know with private member's bills, there are no seconders. There are absolutely no seconders. It was not the member for Paterson's private member's bill; it was in fact the member for War- on it. ringah's. Mr Baldwin-Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member for Chifley is misleading the House. I actually had to sign a form seconding it.",113
162,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"The member for Paterson will resume his seat. There is no point of order.  want to pay tribute to you and the rest of the Speaker's panel for the way you have facilitated the business of the Main Committee. Let me give you the history. In fact, we did have a whips meeting and there was no proposal before the whips meeting about the private member's bill. We concluded that meeting. Then I was approached and told it was an oversight, that they wanted to make a change. So I did. That change was made, and it was agreed that there would be two speakers-one each from each side for 10 minutes. Then there was a further approach-and this is where I think you deserve due credit, being responsible for the Main Committeethat the opposition be allowed to split their speaking time on the second reading debate. Again, we agreed. There were supposed to be two opposition speakers for five minutes each and one government speaker. There was a government speaker for 10 minutes. But the first speaker, the proposer of the bill, was Mr Abbott, who spoke for seven minutes. Mr Baldwin-He spoke for five minutes.  Then, when the time of the member for Paterson expired, halfway through his speech, both of them launched a vicious attack on the Deputy Speaker. They suggested all sorts of things about agreements about time. In fact the member for Paterson stated-and it is in the Hansard-that he was entitled to a further 20 minutes to speak on it. Then he said he wanted to have a vote Mr Baldwin-That's right.  Leader of the House, Mr Abbott, did not know the procedures of the House for private member's bills. I would say that this was a very important issue. I will concede to the member for Paterson and the member for Warringah that this is a very important issue. But wouldn't you think that a former Leader of the House and the junior shadow minister for defence, representing the shadow minister for defence in this chamber, would understand standing orders and the procedures that are required? But no. They tried to harass Deputy Speaker Thomson in the Main Committee. I want to put on record that I think the member for Wills handled himself with dignity. He was correct in his rulings in dismissing all the points that were being made by the member for Warringah, the former Leader of the House, and the member for Paterson. He deserves to be commended. In fact, he was very conscious that any delay beyond the expiry of the time for the private member's bill would have knock-on effects. Again, I want to place on record my appreciation to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for the way you were so flexible to accommodate this second reading debate in the Main Committee. It is a matter of regret to me the way both members-who should know better-have tried to prosecute their case. They should have let the dignity of what they were trying to do speak for itself rather than try to use sleazebag tactics both in this House and in the Main Committee. Mr Baldwin-You don't understand your own standing orders, Roger!  ing orders. You ought to read them. You ought to open them for the first time, member for Paterson. Someone who has been Leader of the House I say should have a very good grasp of the standing orders. He should understand what happens with a second reading debate, should know that it does not go to a vote and should know that, when asked by the member for Paterson, it cannot be referred back to the House for a vote. Why don't you just stand up in a dignified way and seek bipartisan support for what you are trying to",114

I think those the overwhelming evidence presented before myself at the prevalence of the lack of gender I think many readers of the report will find that that exists in Australia are quite shocking. I want to make a couple of comments about I note the presence of the member for Grey here before I make those comments, my very grateful of the committee, the member for Kalgoorlie, mittee after it had been initiated and had an dence that had been presented. It has been a course of the hearing, along with my Labor colleagues.

I indeed applauded that decision tragically, the decision by at least the shadow the legislation which would see the proper implementation views were substantially changed as a result of the committee. I have to say that I was shocked pay equity across industry and across Australia. the statistics it contains that set out the scene the nature of the report and the minority report. in the Main Committee and I should indicate, support and respect for both the deputy chair and the member for Grey, who joined the comawfully large catch-up to do on the bulk of evipleasure to work with the two of you through the were agreed to unanimously, there is inequity addressed by both sides of the House.

However, ironically, when parable OECD countries, the fact that we had pinned by awards meant that we as a nation good in comparison to those of other countries. mum rates of pay.

198,Mr RAMSEY,MAIN COMMITTEE,"I rise to speak report of the House of Representatives Standing tion. From the outset, let me thank the chair the secretariat for the work that has gone into committee to adopt the study into seasonal forecasting this area. I was a farmer before I entered parliament, spective, seasonal forecasting is the holy mechanised. We have tractors that basically the same. We are able to sow our grain each get. We are able to specify what fertiliser applied in any given part of the paddock depending We are able to spray chemicals across a paddock cal is needed where. But the last great variables lutely no control over those and are never likely dict what is in store. Our predictive During this inquiry I was hoping that we great answer to all these difficulties. In that recommendations we make, and the information able nonetheless. I will focus on a few things. and the Bureau of Meteorology, as of course this area in Australia. There was some concern that their process is somewhat insular. We have ing welcomed with open arms to conduct their some of the universities might have much to offer. We have recommended to the CSIRO and the to justify the climate models they have chosen their science. There are a number of other make some kind of decision. I do not think, that all other options should be ruled out-neither dominantly gone with one model. We would like tify their position. Sometimes you do not know analysis.

We need to be very careful on this. It is on the Seasonal forecasting in Australia Committee on Industry, Science and Innovaof the committee, the member for Calwell, and this. I was one of those who were urging the as I have a long-standing interest in and have to say that, from a farming pergrail. Farming has become highly technical and do not need to be steered anymore.

In particular, Bureau of Meteorology that they should have to use as the prime dynamic models behind models around the world. In the end, you have to though, that we heard enough evidence to suggest were they saying that; but they have prethem to at least re-examine that and to juswhat your weaknesses are. It is like a SWOT program, you may well revisit some of your deciyour argument. In particular, we believe that in Australia at the moment. We took some on our climate.

It has the potential to unlock some tunity in Melbourne to inspect the bureau's crestfallen to find that the supercomputer is as it were, and that our computing capacity was, is still lagging behind that of the Europeans small nation, and the collaborations we make the way we progress our science. But you can weather in Australia than those of us who As I said at the beginning, the potential for tralia, in our very dry climate, is immense. It or not they are even going to sow a crop, what fertilise heavily. So it has a great effect on inputs, the season. In fact, we could eliminate sowing have often said in the middle of a drought that the start it would have been far more profitable farmer may well go out and risk half a million One of the things that was also highlighted, laide from Sharon Starick, is that farmers forecasts. While that may not be easily addressed there is a reasonable amount of respect in the weather forecasting services, which have improved over the last 20 years. When the bureau is predicting ple are making farming decisions-to go and things-based on that, but we still do not have casts. If people take any notice of seasonal only to find that they are wrong, then I can tell ence they take away from that, and their I think it has been a valuable inquiry.
