2,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"Yesterday I asked the Prime Minister whether the Government intended to discontinue the publication of the historical records, and I was informed that the matter is at present the subject of negotiation with Dr Watson. To-day I have received a letter from Dr Watson, in which he says that he was astounded by the Prime Minister's reply to my question, as his editing of the records has ceased, and no negotiations are takiug place - Can the Prime Minister throw any further light on the subject ?",14
3,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"There have been considerable differences of opinion between the Government and, Dr Watson, in regard to the work he was doing. The original contract was between the Government and Dr Watson, but the control of the contract and the work of that gentleman was transferred to the Library Committee, which is representative of all parties in this chamber and in another place. I understand that pro-: tracted negotiations have taken place between Dr Watson and the committee without any decision having been reached. Only yesterday I wrote to the Chairman of the Library Committee asking that the consideration of the matter should be expedited, as the Government is desirous of having it - settled ""without further delay.

""Will the Prime Minister explain whether finality has been reached in the negotiations between the Commonwealth and the Government of New South Wales ?",14
7,Mr BETJCE,Unknown,"About twelve months ago the Commonwealth Government was asked by the Government of New South Wales if it would be prepared to subsidize the construction. of a proposed dock at Newcastle. The Commonwealth Government offered a subsidy of £120,000, on condition that the dock complied with the requirements laid down by the naval advisers of the Commonwealth. Subsequently it was found that .the dock would have to be increased from 13,000 tons to 15,000 tons, and, notwithstanding the original condition that .the dock must comply Will naval requirements, including a capacity to lift the two new 10,000ton cruisers, it agreed to increase the sidy to £135,000. The New South Wales Government has since put forward new proposals involving an increase of the Commonwealth subsidy. Mr Lang has been told definitely that the Commonwealth would have use for a dock of that character only if it could be shifted, in time of war or great emergency, to any port of Australia where it might be required, aud, - having regard to the other defence expenditure which the Commonwealth desired to incur if the state of the finances would permit, any increase of the subsidy beyond £135,000 was impossible.

29,Mr YATES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Adelaide) [11.18] .^-1 do not intend to raise any objection to the motion. I merely wish to know if the Government were given a mandate to refund certain income taxation, and if the Treasurer made it clear to the electors that if he were returned to office such a bill as this would be introduced. The people ought to know to whom the refunds are to be given, and the need for a dating measure. That information would have been much more to the point than the display of glaring placards that helped to give this Government a mandate to govern this country; and I suggest that the Treasurer would have justified his election to office if he had explained the people the necessity for making legal the refunds of taxation given to large pastoralists, who evidently supplied wealth that was splashed about Australia to give the Government its present date. . Mr BRENNAN (Batman) [11.20] - I approach the subject in the spirit of tolerare, ance and magnanimity that distinguished the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr. Yates). It occurs to me that in this motion for leave it would be proper submit the names of the persons to whom these public moneys are to be restored, and to inform honourable members to what extent these gentlemen have contributed to the party funds to secure the mandate to which the Government is now effect. I wish to have that information at my disposal before leave is granted introduce the bill.",17

What I notice, as missing this case was present in the other case. Empire. Previously we had the information that it valiwas proposed to make refunds, and I wanted to kuow to whom the refunds were to be made and to what extent the persons obtaining them had contributed to party funds. The Treasurer, instead of improving his methods, has gone from bad to worse. In this case he does not tell to us whether any refunds are to be made, much less does he supply us with the names of the persons who are to get this public the grant. I ask him before we go any further to let us have a little information. manI presume, of course, from past experience, that the bill proposes to make refunds to some friends of the Ministry, and at least we ought to know who they and why the refunds are to be made.",18
32,Mr YATES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Adelaide) [11.24] - I have a vivid recollection of the war to fervour that permeated honourable) members in this House when the original bill was introduced. The statement was then made that all profits arising from ther Avar that were considered unduly high would be regarded as immoral, giving and should be taken from those who were making them. But when to the bill . was introduced, it was debated by certain honourable members in defence of the profiteers for as many honweeks as it took hours to pass the bill providing for a bachelor tax, .which imposed the maximum tax on incomes only £1 above the exemption. ' The' original War-time Profits Act provided for a tax of 75 per cent., and many honourable has members contended that it should be 100 per cent. To prevent a long debate the second reading and in committee, the Treasurer should make the operation' of this provision retrospective to the war period, and let his mind become possessed by the atmosphere of patriotism which surrounded the whole nation during the war. If this is not done the Treasurer lend belief to the statement of the man who said that patriotism was the last Not only in but in other parts of the world, people spoke about bleeding nations, and the sacrifices that should be made for the Sir William Irvine said that, if and need be, the farmer must put the firestick to his crop. But neither he nor the war profiteers put any fire-stick into their in crops in an effort to save the British They did not sacrifice one penny of their wealth, and they are still drawing war-time profits from 5 per cent., o i per cent,, and 6 per cent, bonds. The Treasurer has now an opportunity to enhance his chance of being placed upon the same plane as Senator Wilson.",18

Question resolved in the affirmative. TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY. control PORT AUGUSTA TO ADELAIDE.",19
34,Mr HILL,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Echuca-Minister for Works and Railways) [11.29] - I move That, in accordance with the provisions the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1021, the following proposed work referred to the Parliamentary Standing Couiunittce on Public Works for it3 investigation and report thereon, i.e,, Extension of Trans-Australian railway from Port Augusta to Red Hill (South Australia), and the laying of a third rail to provide a railway of 4 in. gauge on the South Australian of t gauge railway between Red Hill central railway station, Adelaide. The necessity for the execution of these works was fully dealt with on the submission to the House, on the ISth September, 1925, of the ratification of the agreement with South Australia, in connection with the construction of these lines and the extension of the railway between' Port Augusta and Oodnadatta to Alice PRATTENSprings. The length of the new line from Port Augusta to Red Hill will be 83 niiles, and that of the 5 f t . 3 in. line from Red Hill to the central railway station, Adelaide, on which it is proposed to provide a third rail, is about 107 In compliance with section 60 of the Commonwealth Railways Act the plan and all documents furnished by the Comducts, monwealth Railways Commissioner under section 59 of the Act are being laid on the table of the House. The estithe mated cost of the railway from Port Augusta to Red Hill , including station buildings, signalling, &c, is £734,923, and of the provision of the third rail from Red Hill to central railway station, Adelaide, £380,000. The estimated cost of the additional rolling-stock, required is £104,250. The estimated working expenses of the railway from Port Augusta to Red Hill, including traffic, locomotive, and maintenance charges, and the net amount of working expenses of the Red Hill to Adelaide section, which will require to be borne by the Commonwealth in compliance with paragraphs 12 and 13 of the agreement of the 18th September, 1925, is £63,879. The probable revenue which would be derived from the railway is estimated at £100,755. Mr E.

Debate resumed from 21st January (vide page 289), on motion, by Mr. That the bill be now read a second time.",19
36,Mr CHARLTON,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Hunter) [11.39] gauge This is a small bill, which provides for bounties being granted on goods produced or manufactured in Papua and New miles. 'Guinea. The products on which the bounty will be paid are specified in the schedule to the Bill. Being tropical prothey will not, so far as I can see, enter into competition with the products of Australia. The principle underlying bill should, therefore, receive the support of all honourable members, because Australia, being responsible for these territories, should do everything possible for their development. Australia has already loaned to Papua sums amounting to £100,897, of which £93,3'02 still remains unpaid. In addition, for a considerable time, subsidies varying from £20,000 to £50,000 per annum have been granted by the Commonwealth, the total of these subsidies being £752,000. We cannot for ever continue 'to grant bounties, and, therefore,. every effort should be made to enable the Territory to become self supporting. I welcome this mea: sure as a step in that direction. At the same time, I suggest to the Minister that one or two amendments should be made in committee. The bill refers to goods, the produce or manufacture of the territories of Papua and New Guinea. As drafted, it would enable produce from other islands to be shipped to those territories and there manufactured into goods, and so entitle the manufacturers to receive a bounty from the Commonwealth. I feel certain that that is not intended. Our desire is to encourage production in the territories under our control, and we should not permit the products of other countries to be imported to them so that by their mere manufacture into goods the manufacturers would be entitled to receive the Commonwealth bounty. Subject to the amendments which I have indicated' being made in committee,. I shall support the Bill ; otherwise, I shall be reluctantly compelled to vote against it. I think, however, that the Minister will see the necessity for an alteration being made.",19
37,Mr YATES,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Adelaide) [11.35] - I commend the Minister on having duced this bill. The commission which inquired into the working of the Naviing gation Act visited Papua, and in the dence there tendered before it the comI plaint was general that Papua received no assistance from the Commomvealth. It was stated that, while 'conditions verning the employment of labour were imposed on the employers by the Comwhat monwealth, no benefits were conferred. The natives, realizing the advantages working under Australian conditions, manded better treatment, including the provision of receptacles for their clothes, and repatriation to their homes on completion of their term of employment; and, consequently, Papua was at a dising^on a new scheme. advantage compared with other South Sea islands, with the result that the place was beginning to stagnate. The honor will remember that at one place in Papua we visited a sisal hemp farm which was more than 2 miles in extent. In our desire for knowledge, we cut down one of the fronds of the sisal hemp plant, and stripped it. Afterwards, we learned that hemp equal to that produced in any other part of the world can be satisfactorily grown in Papua. The sisal hemp used in Australia comes chiefly from Java. I consider that we should encourage its production in the Territory under our control. Complaints were also.made that the production of rubber, coffee, cocoa, and other tropical products in the Territory was not encouraged by the Commonwealth. Because of what I heard when in Papua, I asked the Minister last session whether the Government would consider the claim of Papua to preferential treatment. If encouragement is given to these territories in the manner proposed in the bill, it is possible that, instead of the Commonwealth facing an annual deficit in regard to them, there may be a credit balance. If we impose labour conditions, we should also support the men to whom those restrictions apply. This bill is an attempt to do that, and I believe that its effect will be beneficial. If it does what those who gave evidence before the commission hope for, it is probable that our experience in connection with Papua may, in the future, be very different.  present is an opportune time for a stateintroment to be made by the Government showing the relationship existbetween Australia and the terrievitories over which it holds a mandate. do not object to these bounties being given, but I should like to have information as to Australia's financial responsigobility in relation to these territories. Where is this kind of thing to end? For period is it intended to grant bounties in respect of the different products of of these territories? I . understand that dePapua places an export duty on copra, and that in other ways the people there tax themselves to pay the expenses of the government. The proposals embodied in this measure indicate that we are embark",20

The Bill itself answers the honourable member's questions.  today holds a mandate over New Guinea, I should like to know what power we shall exercise over that territory in the future. If we develop New Guinea, who will reap the benefit ? I had thought that, in endeavouring to assist these territories, the Government would have given some for m of preference, and granted greater freedom of trade. Australia would benefit materially, as well as assist the territories, if she encouraged the production of sugar there. Tobacco, I understand, also j;ro\vs well there.",21
39,Mr FORDE,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Does the honourable member stand for importing sugar into Australia from New Guinea ?  under the control of the .Commonwealth, and, therefore, they are entitled to every consideration that is granted to Australia itself. Sugar produced in them could compete in the world's markets with sugar from other countries, and that would prove of distinct advantage to Australia as well as to the territories over which we hold a mandate.",21
40,Mr MARRS,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Wentworth) [11.42] It is evident that this measure has the support of all honourable members.' In 1922, at the request of the then Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), I visited the mandated territory of New Guinea to inquire into the grievances of the people there in order that they might, if possible, be removed. I went through the territory from end to end, visiting New Britain , New Ireland, W it u Island, Madang and others, and I was greatly impressed with the beauty of the islands. That was my first impression. Next, I realized how heavily timbered they were, and what enormous expense would have to be incurred to clear the country for plantations. But the greatest impression my visit made was that the people there felt that they had been forgotten by the Commonwealth, because their products, on arrival in Australia, were subjected to heavy taxation. This b i ll would remove their cause for grievance in that respect. [24] ' to be sometimes wonder whether we realise how frequently big questions arise from small beginnings. Do honourable members realise that this bill will, perhaps, have a bearing upon a matter that will come before the League of Nations? When I was in Berlin recently, I was confronted with' the fact that the return of the mandated territories to Germany would some day have to be considered. A deputation waited upon me in Berlin. It was headed by a man who; but ior the war, would today be worth £1,500,000 sterling, but who is actually almost penniless. Prior to the war he owned practically the whole of the plantations in the mandated territory of New Guinea. He suggested that in view of the enormous losses incurred in connection with that territory, a syndicate in which he was interested, together with a Danish and an Australian syndicate, should combine, the Commonwealth Government holding a preponderance of the shares, and that together they should run the mandated territory as a trading concern. He was certain that if that were done, the net return would be from 15 to 20 per cent, on the capital invested. That shows what he, as one of the original land-owners in that territory, thought of its possibilities if it were properly handled. It was put to me then that if Germany joined the League of Nations it would certainly request the return of the mandated territory of New Guinea. Only a few weeks ago we noticed in the press that this question had again come to the fore. Just as we have no right to hold Australia as a white labour country unless we use and fill it , we are not entitled to hold the mandated territory of New Guinea unless we use it . We certainly cannot fill that territory with white people, but we can use it by encouraging the investment of capital from the southern portions of Australia in the growing of products we need. The proposed bounty represents a step in the right direction, and the sooner we proceed to encourage development there the stronger will be on me our argument, when Germany enters the League of Nations, for the retention by Australia of that territory. I congratulate the Government upon bringing in the bill, and am glad that honourable members on both sides of the House support it . I",21

While I realise that the bill is intended', and wisely so, to extend help to the industries established in that territory, I call attention to one obvious handicap put upon it . Efforts are continually being made to deflect the trade from the northern ports of Australia to those in the south. The proper Avay to develop this trade is to foster closer relationship between the mandated territories and the northern ports of Queensland.",22

44,Dr NOTT,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Not naturally. Ports like Townsville, Cairns, and the at present neglected Cooktown, are much closer to the mandated territories than Sydney and Melbourne are; and they are the natural ports for the discharge of passengers and cargo. Under the existing shipping arrangements, it costs the ordinary passenger £5 more to reach the mainland than it would if he disembarked at Cooktown, Cairns, or Townsville.

The honourable member a supporter of the Government, and, I am pleased to see the Government to assist Papua and the mandated territory in every possible and legitimate way, I do not stand'for any interference with a great Australian industry such as sugar growing.

48,Mr FORDE,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Yes ; one of the fundamental principles supported by the Labour party. What will the sugar growers think when they know that a certain section of the supporters of the Government believe in encouraging the production of sugar in islands where black labour is employed? I know that the honourable member for Forrest has been a bitter opponent of the Queensland sugar industry for some time, and I hope that the bounty will not be extended to sugar grown in Papua or the mandated territory of New Guinea.

50,Mr FORDE,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"That amounts to the same thing. We were told by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) last night that there was ample evidence that his party stood for the upholding of the White Australia policy because an embargo had been placed on the introduction of sugar produced by black labour. If I had spoken on that occasion, I would have reminded him that the embargo was introduced at the urgent request of the Labour Government of Queensland, by the Hughes Administration. Now honourable members opposite are advocating that the mandated territories should be developed by the production of sugar, a crop .that can be grown profitably in Australia, keeping in employment some 25,000 persons.",22

52,Mr FORDE,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"More than one holds that oxjinion. The Minister for Works by and Railways (Mr Hill) is reported New in Hansard to have stated, on the is 2nd April, 1924, that he would ""rewhile move the sugar embargo, and do away ready with Arbitration Courts and high - tariffs."" I do not intend to allow statements of that nature to go unchallenged, and I am surprised that the honourable member for Herbert did not take the honourable member for Forrest to task. It would be suicidal of the Government to be induced by the alleged Country party representatives to abolish the embargo . on the introduction of black-grown sugar. But for that em- the strain that he has. bargo, the sugar industry in Queensland would decline, and there would be hundreds of thousands of unemployed throughout the Commonwealth. honourable members on the Labour side subscribe to such a policy.. I have visited the mandated territory of New Guinea, and I am as sympathetic towards its development as any honourable member. Therefore, I support the bill, and share the view advanced by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) that an amendment should be introduced to prevent manufacturers in New Guinea or Papua from importing raw material from other countries and utilizing black labour in the territory for the manufacture of articles to be sent to Australia to compete with goods produced here. ""What the alleged, representatives of the Country party desire is to wipe out the tariff and the embargo on sugar, and allow hundreds of thousands of niggers to be employed in growing sugar in the islands to the detriment of Australia. That would mean r u into towns in Queensland such as Cairns, Mackay, and Bundaberg. It affords only further evidence of the inconsistent views held by some honourable members who are supporting this composite Ministry. If it had not been for the consistent fight by the Queensland Labour Government and Labour representatives on this side of the chamber, the sugar-growers in Australia would not be enjoying the protection that they have today.",22

I heard with regret the statement by the honourable member for Forrest, who at least ought to respect the promises made to the States when Federation was established. He always insists on the carrying out of those promises so far as Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania, are concerned; but he takes a different attitude with regard to the rights of Queensland. It shows that if he were in power no respect would be paid by him to the agreement entered in to upon the inception of federation. I am sorry that the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) has spoken in It was gross misrepresentation to say that honourable members on this side had any sympathy with the remarks of the honourable memNo ber for Forrest. The majorit y of honourable members from this side of the House have proved in years gone by that they are in favour of giving the Australian sugar industry fair support. It 'was not Labour members, but Nationalists, who placed that industry in its present satisfactory position. The honourable member for Capricornia tried to suggest that, because one honourable member on this side had made an unfortunate remark, that this party held the same view.",23

Whatever the honourable member said, I think, he did not mean to repudiate the agreement. That . agreement has always been respected by most honourable members on this side. Honourable members must admit that if we interfered with the sugar industry we should strike a severe blow at the White Australia policy. How could we expect to keep Australia white if we killed the only industries that can be carried on in one portion of the continent, and 9,000 farmers and tens of thousands of employees were thrown out of employment. The sugar industry could not be replaced by any other.

The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) said that "" one swallow does not make a summer,"" and A that I should not blame the Government We because of the utterances of the honourable member for Forrest.

Honourable members may not be aware that when the carriage of mails between Britain and Australia was being arranged the Commonwealth Government, as a con : cession to Australian sentiment, agreed to pay a subsidy for the carriage of mails to the Orient Company and not to the Peninsular and Oriental Company, whose vessels carried coloured crews. The committee is called upon by the amendment to say whether it will permit boats employing coloured crews to convey passengers and goods between Australian ports.",25
67,Mr SEABKOOK,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,Passenger s only. None of these boats have ever carried cargo between .Australian ports.,26
68,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"I take very little notice of what the honourable member says, because in these matters he is so biased. He is entirely lacking in Australian sentiment, and is an absolute black labour advocate. He does not care where he gets his goods, or by what class of boat he travels, so long as he can secure the service he requires cheaply. The honourable member bows every hour of. the day to the god of cheapness. I do not speak against coloured people as such, because I recognize that they have the same right to live as white men. But if in giving employment I am in a position to choose between a white man and a coloured man, I shall always choose the white man. ""We often glory in the triumphs of our soldiers, and of the sailors who manned our naval vessels in the great war. But we should remember that the men of the mercantile marine played a most important part in it . When the war broke out the British Government demanded that all foreigners and coloured men should leave British boats, because it recognized that the mercantile marine would have most important duties to perform. During the war 15,000 men of Britain's mercantile fleet lost their lives, and 7,000,000 tons of shipping was sent to the bottom of the sea. Australia is an island continent, and if there is one thing which, more . than another, we should take into earnest . consideration, it is the establishment here of an efficient mercantile marine. We cannot establish it if we permit coloured crews to take part in our Australian trade. If I had my way, I would not permit the employment of coloured crews on vessels carrying our mails.",26
69,Mr SEABEOOK,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,The honourable member would prefer German crews.,26
70,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Where the choice is between a white man and a black man, I am for the white man every time. The honourable member should not forget that the war is over now, and that amongst Germans, and descendants of Germans, we have some of the finest Australians in the country.",26

Mr FENiTON- I believe that if I were called upon to vote for a Seabrook or a German, I should vote for the German, if he agreed with me in politics. I presume that, in the event of war, one of the first things the Commonwealth Government would do would be to forbid the employment of foreigners or coloured men in the boats trading ""on our north-west coast.",26

73,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"I am aware that honourable members on the other side intend to vote for the employment of black crews on vessels carrying passengers from port to port in Australia. I do not agree with that. In my opinion, Commonwealth money could be better spent in subsidizing lines of shipping employing white crews in the Australian trade than in the building of cruisers, as, by adopting that course, we might establish an efficient mercantile marine that would be very handy in time of stress. I have every sympathy with Tasmania.",26
74,Mr BELL,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,The honourable member's sympathy will not help Tasmania very much.,26
75,Mr FENTON,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"My sympathy does not extend to permitting vessels manned by black crews to carry passengers to Tasmania. I am aware that the majority is in favour of the employment of vessels carrying coloured, crews in the passenger service, and that though honourable members on this side talked until they were black in the face, they could not induce honourable members opposite to alter their minds. We have ample evidence of that in the fact that the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes), after delivering a speech in favour of the amendment, was next day placed across his knees by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), and given a good caning, and Avas compelled to recant. If the right honourable member could in that Avay be compelled to change his views, Ave can easily understand that Aveaker men on the other side Avill readily respond to the crack of the party Avhip. It is just possible that the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) may stick to his guns, and A'ote with the Labour party on the amendment. If they have not already done so, I should recommend honourable members opposite to read a book I have here by Sir Leo Chiozza Money, in which reference is made to the part played in the war by Britain's mercantile fleet. If honourable members were to adopt some of the principles laid down by the author of this book, they Would not be found voting for the employment of black creAvs to carry tourists to Tasmania.  interjection and otherwise, honourable members opposite have referred to me so frequently that I take this opportunity of explaining again my attitude towards this bill. In my second-reading speech, - I said, and I repeat noAv, that if I thought the White Australia policy would be jeopardized by this proposal I would A-ote against it. I accept as a compliment the. almost fatherly interest taken in me by members of the Opposition so early in my political career. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) suggested that the electors of Angas are not getting good value from their representative, and he ventured to predict what they might think and say in the future. One who invades the realms of prophecy is on very dangerous ground, and I remind the honourable member of hoAV the Labour party's gloAving predictions regarding the division of Angas were falsified on the 14th November. The professed concern of honourable members opposite for the White Australia policy is very touching; if it were sincere, it Would almost reduce me to tears. I am a firm believer in that principle, and I have heard nothing .in this debate to convince me that it is menaced by the bill, or that the relief proposed is not in the best interests of Australian ideals and development.",26
76,Dr NOTT,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Herbert) [12.32] - On the opening day of the session, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) said that, although the Opposition Avas reduced in numbers, its output would not be less than hitherto. In his generosity he might also have warned the House about the standard of that output. I have listened with considerable attention and no little pleasure to the speeches upon this bill, and, whilst most honourable members opposite side-stepped the issue Will which the measure deals, their remarks, neA'ertheless, had the merit of being amusing. I congratulate the Minister for Trade and  duction of the' Bill, which represents an earnest desire on the part of the Government to do something for Avhat has been hitherto the Cinderella State of the Commonwealth. I discern in the bill, also, a means of partial relief for portions of Queensland from the inconvenience and distress which sometimes develop, under the present industrial conditions - The assurance given by the Prime Minister Avili free honourable members of any anxiety as to hoAV the provisions of the Bill may be applied. When the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) spoke on the second reading, he, apparently, had not been so carefully tutored as were some of his folloAvers who spoke later. Possibly because he knew the depressing tendency of his speech, he essayed to become humorous, and stated that he had in mind the establishment of a Commonwealth service to meet the exigencies of Tasmania. He did not indicate how he would establish such a service. No doubt it would be fashioned after those highly successful State enterprises in Queensland, which, as experiments in the socialization of industry, haA'e - placed an OAerwhelming burden r of taxation upon the people of that State. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West), who followed him, ""boxed the compass,"" but Avas so unfortunate as to ahvays miss the bill.",27
77,Mr YATES,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"On a point of order, I ask whether the honourable member is entitled to discuss the second-reading speeches of other honourable members?",27
78,The CHAIRMAN,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Strictl y speaking, the honourable member for Herbert was not in order in so doing, but I allowed him some latitude as a new member who is unacquainted with committee procedure. I now ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to clause 4.",27
79,Dr NOTT,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"I thank you, sir, for the leniency you have extended to me, and hope that I shall not trespass.again. So far as I can see, the Bill does not contravene the White Australia policy, to which honourable members on this side subscribe their allegiance in as sane and. practical a fashion as do honourable members opposite. We have been told that the conversion of some critics of the bill must have been the result of severe caning in the' Ministerial party rooms. But it is significant that all the squealing comes from members of the Opposition. They have declared that, unless this amendment is adopted, the bill will set aside the White Australia policy; in other words, the defence of that principle consists in the preservation of the Seamens' Union, the only organization of labour which advocates ""and canvasses for the inclusion of coloured workers in its ranks. any union the final arbiter of the destinies of a White Australia? Most decidedly not! Are not the primary producers, and those Tasmanian residents whose prosperity is partly dependent upon the tourist traffic, entitled to play a certain part in the fulfilment of that policy? We have seen the conditions that apply to Tasmania operating in the north - of Australia, and that experience strengthens our advocacy of this proposal, which is intended to give relief to Tasmania and other States under the stress of abnormal circumstances. I do not propose to discuss the question of sterilization which so thrilled the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley), but I suggest to him that the brief visits of black crews to our ports will not be as great a menace to Australia's racial purity as will the attitude of the Seamen's Union in welcoming coloured seamen into its ranks. As a subscriber to the White Australia policy, I welcome, this bill as a means of practical help to Tasmania and other parts of Australia in times of necessity.",28
80,Mr A GREEN,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Kalgoorlie) [12.44]. - I am surprised at the attitude of the honourable member for Herbert (Mr. Nott). If the majority of the people of Australia consulted only their own selfish interests, as the honourable member for  sacrifice the White Australia principle, and allow coloured labour to be employed in the sugar industry of Queensland. In its adherence to-this ideal of racial purity the Commonwealth stands alone amongst the nations of the world, and because that policy is misunderstood abroad, because other nations, and even large numbers of people in the' Motherland, are hostile to it, we should do nothing that would even remotely suggest that our allegiance to a great ideal is waning. What is the difference between permitting coloured men to be employed, on Australian vessels trading only between Australian ports and permitting them to work in our industries on shore? After all, it is only a matter of degree. The right honourable member for North Sydney'(Mr Hughes) yesterday, in trying to explain his attitude, said that for years we did not discover the fact that we were permitting But is apples to be carried from Tasmania by coloured crews, thereby inferring that that happening could to some extent be compared with the Government s intention to permit passengers to be carried to Tasmania on vessels similarly manned. The position is entirely different. I doubt if we could force oversea boats trading with Australia to carry other than their present crews, whether black or white. But we can say as a Commonwealth what men are to be employed in our interstate shipping, and what wages and conditions are to obtain. Our power over that trade is just as sovereign and complete as our power to determine what wages and conditions shall apply to our workers on the land. Even if our own kith and kin overseas do not quite understand the White Australia policy, at least we in this national assembly should stand four-square to it . Indeed, we shall be giving a gre.at deal away from the industrial point of view if this chamber permits Peninsular and Oriental vessels to carry passengers between, say, Sydney and Tasmania. I do not agree with the proposed method of assisting Tasmania, because there are other ways in which this can be done. To prevent any interference with the White Australia policy we should at least prohibit our intra-state trade boats from carrying black crews. This country's future depends entirely upon the maintenance of the White Australia policy. I have been in China, Java, Central America, and the United States of America. The southern states of the United States of America furnish us with a most striking example of the inter-mixture of races, showing how careful we must be respecting the racial question. When walking along the streets of Vicksburg, over which city ' flies the American flag, I encountered thirteen negroes to one white person. The f r u it s of the work of the colonists of the southern states are now entirely in the hands of the coloured people. They are not to blame, because that condition is the result of the slave system that was voluntarily entered into by British colonists. It was a short-sighted policy, and the consequent inter-mixture of races has caused a narrow class hatred the like of which will never exist in Australia so long as we keep intact the White Australia policy. Honourable members opposite have said that the bill , if will not affect that policy, but we cannot be too careful. Tasmania will receive little benefit if we permit a few passengers to travel on Peninsular and Oriental steamers to and from that State. There are plenty of British boats manned by white seamen ready to help in our interstate trade, and I ask honourable members to stand behind the White - Australia policy by accepting the amendment.",28
81,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Lang) [12.51]. - It is surprising to hear honourable members opposite endeavouring, for reasons of their own, to persuade themselves, as well as their supporters outside, that there is some sinister design behind this simple proposal to relieve Tasmania of some of her financial difficulties. If there were the slightest danger of the White Australia policy being jeopardised by this measure no honourable member on this the same game? side of the House would support it . The Prime Minister in his speech yesterday clarified the position. He pointed out when justified by circumstances. that the bill would not in any way ennot danger the White Australia policy, and its attitude. that we could not accept the proposed amendment, because its inclusion i - the bill would be an - impingement upon the right of British shipping companies to employ whatever crews they desired, and that only in cases of absolute emergency would the Government give effect to this legislation. Honourable members on the other side loudly criticized the measure as having some sinister design on the White Australia policy; but I could not help reflecting that, during the recent British seamen's strike, they did not evince any a l i r m when black labour was employed in removing Australian products to oversea markets. While British ships were held up, there was no hesitation on the part of the Labour party, or its outside organizations, to facilitate the employment of all sorts of coloured labour-black , yellow, or brindle. Mr E . EILEY - Where did this happen ?",29
82,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"In various ports in Australia. No Labourite voice was then raised about an attack iipon the White Australia policy. The employment of black labour evidently had the sanction, if not the passed, approval, of the Labour party. It certainly did not express its disapprobation. British and Australian seamen witnessed the spectacle of vessels manned by all kinds of coloured crews leaving Sydney Harbour, and carrying, with the full concurrence of honourable members opposite, Australian produce to overseas markets. In that case, there was more danger to the White Australia policy than there is in a bill of this description. A great deal of the opposition to this measure does not arise from a genuine fear that the White Australia policy will be adversely affected. Every measure that is brought down to this House, no matter how remote it may be from the suspicion of party complexion, is used for party purposes by honourable members opposite.",29
83,Mr YATES,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"When the honourable member was in Opposition, did he not play",29
84,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Possibly ; I am finding fault with the Opposition for I merely wish to show the unreal grounds upon which honorn able members opposite oppose the bill, so that their remarks may not be taken too seriously by their supporters and the general public, who do not know, as we do, the tactics that are usually resorted to by the Labour party respeetiug all measures brought down by the Government.",29
85,Unknown,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Sitting suspended from 1 to 8.15 p.m. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [2.15] - Certain statements have been made by honourable members to which I think a reply is necessary. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) and the honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson), as well as the present speaker (Sir Littleton Groom), have always been proud of the Navigation Act, but now that a bill to amend it is before us we are told that the White Australia policy is not endangered. If that be so, why was it necessary in the original measure to legislate against the employment of coloured labour on vessels engaged in the Australian coastal trade ? It is generally agreed that the Navigation Act protects the Australian shipping industry against the employment of such labour. While I should like to see Tasmania relieved of her burdens, I cannot be a party to legislation which has for its object the employment of coloured crews in vessels calling there. We have been told by the Minister that of the 37 overseas ships about to visit Tasmania, 30 carry white crews.  teen are cargo boats, the balance being one-class passenger boats. Mr E . RILEY - The Government's proposals will not cause any more ships to call at Tasmania, because the overseas shipping is in the hands of a huge combine controlled by Lord Inchcape. That combine was rendered necessary to protect British shipping against the keen competition of German vessels. The German Government granted subsidies to German shipping companies in respect of all trade derived from British colonies. The British combine today controls most of the overseas shipping of the world. Not only does it control the deep sea shipping on our coast, but it has also a controlling interest in the Australian interstate shipping companies. It is not likely that the passing of this legislation will affect the policy of that combine, which is out for profits. If the Tasmanian trade does not pay, ships controlled by that combine will not call at Hobart. The mere fact of this bill becoming law will not relieve Tasmania; any relief must come from the shipping companies. The Leader of the Opposition said that if he had the power he would in stitute a regular Commonwealth steamer service between Tasmania and the mainland. That would prove of direct benefit to Tasmania. The honourable member for Herbert (Dr N ott), sneered at the idea of any government enterprise proving a success. As a new member of this Parliament, he, perhaps, is entitled to criticize the standard of debate in this chamber, and to lecture on the decorum which should be observed by honourable members. We shall see how he conducts himself as time goes on. I was grieved by the statements of the honourable members for Forrest (Mr . Prowse), Franklin (Mr Seabrook) and Swan (Mr Gregory), who said that they would be glad to see the Navigation Act repealed. An y one who remembers the conditions under which the seamen employed in the Australian coastal trade worked prior to the passing of that act, should hesitate before advocating its repeal. The Navigation Act has assured to Australian seamen a reasonable measure of comfort and cleanliness, particularly in regard to the places in whioh their meals may be provided. If it were repealed, those privileges would soon be withdrawn, because of the competition of foreign vessels. It has been said that fewer ships now trade with Tasmania than was the case some years ago. That is due to the general increase in the tonnage of ships. A few years ago vessels of 10,000 or 11,000 tons were considered large, but today the tendency is to provide vessels of 20,000 tons displacement for overseas trade. While it may be true that fewer ships are running, those ships are of a better class.",30
86,Mr JACKSON,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"'We complain that they do not always run . Mr E . RILEY - The shipping companies w i ll not send their ships to Tasmania unless a profitable cargo is assured. The passenger traffic to which this bill refers will not provide sufficient inducement to cause them to alter their policy. I have visited Tasmania during the apple season, and while I found that the accommodation on the ships was very good, that in Hobart was far from satisfactory. If the Tasmanian people desire overseas vessels to call at their ports, better accommodation will have to be provided for tourists after they land.",30
87,Mr JACKSON,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"The first necessity is a continuous shipping service; if that is provided the accommodation referred to by the honourable member will follow. Mr E . RILEY - This bill will not provide a continuous service. We on this side are anxious to assist Tasmania, bu t we contend that this bill will not do it . All that it ""does is to authorize the shipping companies to employ coloured labour in the Australian coastal trade. In so far as it is the fulfilment of the Prime Minister's promise, I have no objection to the bill, but I feel certain that in time the people of Tasmania will realise the correctness of the contention of honourable members on this side.

Certain honourable members opposite are consistent only in their inconsistency. They are always declaring in favour of protection being given to Australian industries, and now they intend to expose the Australian shipping in dustry to unfair competition from overcommittee seas vessels manned by black labour. I do not propose to traverse the argu. . IT ments that have been so effectively ad. . 42 vanced by honourable members on the Opposition side in favour of the previous Majority 25 amendment, which sought to exclude from the coastal trade ships manned AYES. by black labour. I suggest, however, that my amendment is one that should be acceptable to both sides, and I submit it in all sincerity. The Australian shipping industry is a most important factor in the development of this country, and it is only fair that a uniform rate of wages should be paid by all vessels competing in the interstate carrying NOES. trade for the time they are so engaged. Mr J . FRANCIS - There is no competition at all.",31
89,Mr COLEMAN,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"There is. We have nothing more than the assurance of the Minister that unlicensed ships will be allowed to engage in the Tasmanian trade only during a certain season of the year. Clause 3 as it stands gives the Minister power to permit unlicensed ships to enter into any trade in any part of Australia, provided he is "" satisfied"" that tourist traffic is being retarded. There is nothing in the bill about Tasmania, nor about the apple trade, or the various other excuses that have been advanced by Ministers for 1 bringing the measure down. I , for one, am not prepared to trust the Government in the administration of the navigation laws. We have had experiences already which clearly show that this Ministry cannot be trusted to apply those laws in accordance with Australian sentiments.  member mention one?",31
90,Mr COLEMAN,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"I am not prepared to give any specific instance at the moment, because there are so many. If it had been intended that the measure should apply only to Tasmania, a sufficient safeguard could have been inserted in the bill to make sure that it would be so applied. A number of honourable members on the Government benches have suggested that their States should have the benefit of this proposal, and, in fact, one or two suggested that the Navigation Act should be repealed. W it h supporters having such anti-Australian views, the present Government cannot be trusted in this matter. I direct attention to the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), in - objecting to the amendment by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), suggested that it would discriminate between British and Australian ships. But this bill discriminates against Australian ships, and I say that that discrimination should be removed. It is reasonable that for the actual period in which British ships are engaged in carrying passengers to Hobart, or any other port, they should pay the difference between the British and the Australian rates of wages.",32

If he is con-' sistent in the view he has enunciated in this debate and on previous occasions, he will vote for the amendment; but, as the honourable member for Hume (Mr On no occasion was the whole of the Parker Moloney) has said, one tell what the right honourable member may do.",32
93,Mr YATES,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Adelaide) second the amendment. As I pointed out in my previous remarks, the evidence the Government a confidence equal given on behalf of the shipping companies before the royal commission on the Navigation Act was that they could not be expected to engage in the regular trade if they were to be prevented from taking the cream, of it . I contend that if the overseas companies are to be honourable allowed to scout for the interstate trade, they should be. compelled to make some little contribution in return for that advantage, especially when the overseas vessels are said to be required, so far as the interstate trade is concerned, for a service only needed, in the words of the right honourable member for North Sydney, by "" the fastidious few."" Although in this debate direct reference has been made only to Tasmania, it may be the intention at some futur e time to apply the bill to any and every part of the Commonwealth which the Government could be induced to regard as suffering fro m certain disabilities. On page 298 of the minutes of evidence of the royal commission there is a schedule submitted by the steamship^ companies having reference to the passenger traffic between Sydney and Hobart from the 6th December, 1922, to the 28th February, 1923. The steamers Zeaiandia and Biverina cannot be regarded as second rate vessels. They are sufficiently commodious to give satisfaction to persons who desire to travel such a short journey.

100,Mr SCULLIN,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Y a r r a ) this stage I propose only to say two or three further words on the clause. I wish to tell honourable members that, in my opinion, there was great significance in the last division, which was revealed chiefly by the enlightenment on the purpose of the bill given by the persistent question with which the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) interrupted the speech of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates). The Government might have been frank when it introduced this bill, and have told honourable members what the real purpose of the measure is. That is what it did not do. We learn now bhat the real purpose of the measure is to enable the Peninsular and Oriental and other oversea boats to be - used as strikebreakers. I confess that I was somewhat slow in waiting up to that. We have been discussing the bill in the belief that, it represented an honest endeavour on the part of the Government to deal with norma] shortages in coastal shipping. It is really a strike-breaking proposition. Whether the Government is or is not entitled to exempt oversea vessels from certain provisions of the Navigation Act for the purpose of breaking a strike affecting shipping between the mainland and Tasmania is a question the merits of which I shall not go into at this stage. From its point of view the Government may feel itself justified in such action. The honourable member for Adelaide demonstrated by the evidence presented to the Navigation Commission that there is no need for this measure, because every month of the last year for which evidence was available to the commission, space was available on boats going to Tasmania; The honourable member was persistently interrupted by the honourable member for Fawkner with the question, ' ' Can you say that no occasions"" will arise when there will be no boat travelling between the mainland and Tasmania?"" honourable member for Adelaide, at the same time as myself, woke up to what is really behind this measure. . It is to be used to deal with a hold-up of shipping communication with Tasmania.",34
101,Mr MAXWELL,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,Certainl y it could be so used.,34
102,Mr SCULLIN,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"It has been introduced for that purpose, and that alone, as the evidence submitted to the Navigation Commission proves. [3.0] - At Mr Foster - The honourable member has shifted his ground.",34
103,Mr SCULLIN,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Honourable members on this side put up a case to controvert that which they believed had been submitted sincerely by the Government, but which they now find was merely a subterfuge. The significance of the last division is that the Government wants this measure, not only to hold up the navigation laws of the country to permit ocean-going boats manned by coloured labour to trade with Tasmania, but also to put them, when there is a strike in the Australian shipping industry, in a position to break it by making use of the cheap labour of other countries. I suggest that if the Government wishes to utilize ocean-going boats as strike-breakers, it should at least insist that the owners shall comply with the Arbitration Court awards of this country. I leave the matter there.  Trade and Customs) [3.5] - I wish to say a word or two' in absolute contradiction of some of the extravagant statements that have been made during the debate on this bill. We have had a more or less in teresting debate, which has covered the field of the White Australia policy in its racial and economic aspects, and the field just referred to by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin). I repeat emphatically the words uttered by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) yesterday when he said that this party by word and deed is standing for the White Australia policy. It has been admitted by honourable members opposite that the racial aspect of that policy is not affected by this bill. I assert definitely that this bill wil l help Australia economically. Let me say that during the tourist season certain steamers are scheduled to call at Hobart to take oversea cargoes from Tasmania. Whether Then the they carry passengers to Tasmania or not they will complete their itinerary. Whether they are manned by white or coloured crews will not alter that itinerary. This bill provides that these vessels may be allowed to take tourists to Tasmania, and thereby, in my opinion, divert some special passenger traffic that now goes abroad. I deny emphatically that the Government has the slightest in tention to infringe in any way the White Australia policy in its racial or economic aspect, and I further absolutely repudiate that it has at the back of its mind any more than is set out in the measure in the very plainest language.

Motion (by Mr Bruce) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.  Trade and Customs) [3.27] - In view of the very great interest of honourable members, and the public generally, in the recent complaints concerning the export of allegedly inferior canned fruits, I desire to inform the House that at a meeting of the Board of Trade in Melbourne yesterday the Eromanga shipment of canned ... 41 f r u it s was discussed. At the request of ... 18 the Department of Markets and Migration, the Department of Trade and Cus23 toms made available samples of f r u it taken at the time of packing into cases and immediately prior to shipment. The examination of this fruit was - held this morning, when many members of the Board of Trade saw the tins opened and inspected and sampled the fruit - It was found to be of excellent flavour and well graded as to size and colour, and the syrup strength was satisfactory. In . no tin was any green, mushy, discoloured, or over-ripe fruit seen, and the members of the Board of Trade are at a loss to understand the reasons for the complaints that have been made. Samples of Californian fruit also were on view, and the fruit from the JUromanga shipment generally compared more than favourably with the American article.",34
104,Mr MANNING,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Macquarie) [3.28]. - - I draw the attention of the Postmaster General to the disabilities imposed upon persons who desire to take out licences for listening-into the wireless broadcastname ing stations, and I ask him to arrange for such licences to be available at as many post-offices as possible throughout the Commonwealth. Another grievance is that the wave-length used by the broadcasting station of the Trades and Labour Council in Sydney prevents the users of crystal sets from listening-into the programmes broadcasted by Farmers and Broadcasters Limited. Cannot the Postmaster-General make arrangements for the Trades Hall station to use a wavelength that will not interfere with the programmes issued by other stations?",36
105,Mr GIBSON,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Corangamite - Post master-General) [3.29] - The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) brought the question of listening-in licences under my notice some time ago, and I then promised to inquire into his suggestion. The department haa since made arrangements for licences to be obtainable at practically every post-office in the Commonwealth. In regard to the second complaint, it is very difficult to fix wave-lengths to suit everybody. The measure of interference of one broadcasting station with another depends upon the degree of selectivity of the receiving set. Interference is inevitable in some cases, but we are doing our best to minimize it .  [3.30] - The statement by the Minister  regarding the sale of inferior canned fruit abroad, hardly covers certain questions that have been asked from time to time since the House met. For instance, Mr Frank Clarke, M.L.C., made serious charges, by which he cast a slur upon the departmental officers who control the exports from this country. Those charges, if true, are very serious; if not true, those upon whom the slur is cast should be protected. I am not sure whether the Minister has said that he would investigate those charges, but I am under the impression' that the matter came up a few days ago in a question on the notice-paper. The charges made by Mr Frank Clarke-and he, no doubt, is prepared to accept responsibility for making them-were to the effect that exporters, by bribing the Customs officers, were able to send out of this country fruit considerably below export standard, the sale of which would greatly injure Australia's good abroad. If this has happenedand I hope that it has not-it is a serious thing for Australia. But, if the charge is. untrue, steps should immediately be taken to' clear the names of the Customs officers against whom allegations have been made. I should like to know from the Minister if any steps have been taken by him or any one in authority to investigate thoroughly ""the charges made by Mr Frank Clarke, M.L.C.",36
106,Mr BRUCE,PAPUA AN D NEW GUINEA,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.33] - The Minister for Trade and  even before any question was asked in this House, announce that a f u ll investigation was being made regarding portion of a shipment of canned fruit, some 5,000 cases, that was declared not up to standard, and therefore should not have been exported. We are trying to ascertain how that fruit left this country. The honourable member can rest assured that all steps are' being taken to ascertain whether there is the slightest justification for any suggestion against the integrity of the Customs officials who inspected this fruit. The other charges do not affect the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth's investigations are confined to the functions for which we are responsible. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.34 p.m.",36
