The shadow minister talks over the four years in extra funding to secure the comments about the US free trade agreeof the package. The government agrees that it is we would have wished that it was. But there from the US free trade agreement. So the real shadow minister is whether he is going to stand US free trade agreement. All the state governbecause they know that it means significant perhaps gains more than any is the agricultural NA sector, with at least $1 billion a year in benefits dairy, fruit and a whole range of commodities. Australia that this agreement is supported. I would have actually expected that by now speaking out publicly, demonstrating-like benefits of this agreement for Australian farmers think it is time that the shadow minister stood agreement and made it clear to the doubters around something that must be done for Australia The second thing that he mentioned frequently has in negotiating agreements with the states The ADP program followed the old Regional partners to that program, but for some reason the Agricultural Development Partnerships program. designed to identify and help areas that are where there may be a need for structural change. some money into a fund to help that industry Sadly, except for South Australia, the states program-and I will make a comment about why it over recent times. We have approved a number they are all going to work very well. Sadly, no point in keeping on putting money in the take it up. So we have given up. Instead, we duce these sorts of reform measures in association will be able to enter partnerships with industry not been prepared to cooperate. I will also talk about FarmBis. This is a case have not been prepared to put up their share been any question-I do not think any of the states program. In fact, when it comes to promoting cent of the credit and do not give any acknowledgement reality is that, over the years, the states have money.

We think we organisations where state governments have where I am criticised because the Labor states of the FarmBis program. Again, there has never have even argued-that this is a fifty-fifty these programs, the states try and take 100 per to the federal government.

Sadly, I have to even take up the money that we are offering them have allocated $0 in their state budget for week with a record $2 billion budget surplus and Victoria have slashed their budget allocation NA for FarmBis in half.
