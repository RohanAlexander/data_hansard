1,Mr MALONEY,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"-Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to the following statement by Professor Allen, reported in today's Age, in which, alluding to the registration of persons whom some have termed as licensed to kill and privileged to murder- a very true description, I should say, in this case-h e saidThe gentleman whose case had been cited came to the Melbourne University as' a single subject man in 1905. He had never matriculated, sad never passed the University's examinations in English, Latin, &c - subject s that were postulated in the matter of medical training ; and whatever' work he. did in Melbourne could count for nothing in their University. He had been just eighteen months at the Melbourne University, and none of the work he had done would count at the University for the medical degree. After that eighteen months' course he proceeded tcAmerica, and returned in July, 1907, with the degree of M.O., Boston. (Laughter.) The total from the beginning in Melbourne was two years and less than six . months, and yet the Medical Board had no option but to register him. In answering the question I should like the honourable and learned gentleman to bear in mind the provision of section 51 of the Constitution, under which, perhaps, something may be done to protect the people from unqualified medical practitioners.",14
2,Mr DEAKIN,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"I have not read the statement, because, as - the control of themedical profession, is wholly within the jurisdiction of the. States, I am happily relieved of responsibility. No doubt' the case demands the attention which, from a° professional point of view, the honourable member has given to it. PORT PIRIE POST OFFICE.  General any information to give concerning - the negotiations with the State Government an exchange in connection with a site for House to a post office at Port Pirie?",14
3,Mr MAUGER,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"The State Government has the matter under its consideration! T answer wrote to it on the subject some ten or twelve days ago, asking that the matter should .be expedited.  sideration for months. . Mr Mauger - I understand that one of the South Australian Ministers will shortly be in Melbourne, and I hope to have an opportunity to confer with him. PAPUAN LAND LEASES. Mr KING O'MALLEY asked the Minanswer ister of External Affairs, upon noticeIn view of (he attempted land ""dummying"" by some of the Papuan officials, and the consetional quent creation of land monopoly in its worse form for the benefit of special privileged specumonwealth? lators, will the Government, by Executive proclamation, limit all leases to a period not exDepartment ceeding ten years, until the whole question has payment (on Excise been examinedand settled by this Parliament back fixed for imported in the interest of posterity's struggling multisury have paid away on such Excise sugar e.\ tudes ?",15
4,Mr DEAKIN,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question isThe existing law is so stringent in its conditions as to improvements that there is no reason for fear that unused land can be held locked up by land speculators, none of whom are in any way privileged, or even encouraged. The attention recently called to the land applications now proceeding, and the prompt action taken, will add another safeguard to support the Administration. As the honourable member is aware, only leaseholds are obtainable in Papua.",15

6,Mr DEAKIN,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Amply . DRAWBACK ON. EXCISE SUGAR.,15
7,Mr CHANTER,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"for Mr Mahon) asked the Treasurer, upon notice I. Did not the statement of the Comptroller General of Customs, in October last, that "" a drawback of duty is allowed"" on Excise sugar, mean that the Department had actually been paying out such drawbacks; if not, will he explain the true meaning of the statement? 2. If no claim for drawback of duty on Excise sugar had been received or anticipated, why did the Customs Department issue a regulation making provision for the payment of such drawback ? 3. Is it considered economical to expend money in the preparation and printing of regulations which, on the showing of the Customs Department itself, provide for conditions which have not arisen and are not expected to arise? [376]-2 . 4. Can he see his way to furnish a relevant instant :to the following question, put on 23rd If drawback is paid on Excise sugar sent abroad for consumption, will not the results of such payment be- (a) That the Treasury will have paid away in bounty and in drawback £ 2 per ton more than it has received from Excise; and (*) That the Australian people will have been taxed in order to provide cheap beer, jams, jellies, Sc., for foreigners, though themselves paying the full Australian market price for these commodities? 5. Referring to the third paragraph of his on 23rd inst., does he undertake to say that the policy of the Commonwealth is to give a double bounty on sugar- a bounty of £ 2 per ton to the grower of the cane, and an addibounty of £ 3 per ton when the sugar made from such cane is exported fro m the Com6. In the event of the "" precautions"" of the proving ineffective to prevent the. sugar exported) of the drawsugar, will not the Trea: ported £ $ per ton more than it has received? 7 - Will the Treasurer give a direct answer to the following queries put to him on the 23rd inst. :- - Referring to ""his reply that the Constitution Act provides ""authority for the payment of bounty ""(a) Does he contend that the Constitution entitles him to pay, on his own motion and without the sanction of Parliament, a. bounty on exported sugar? (i) Can he mention any other product ex. cept sugar which obtains a bounty on export without the authority of an Act of Parliament; and (<:) If he considered that local sugar, when exported, was entitled to be assisted by bounty, why did he not include that 1 commodity in the measure recently before this House which appropriates revenue for the payment of bounties?",15
8,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1 . This was answered in reply to question 1 of yesterday. See also answer to question 2 of today. 2. A claim might at any time be made, and regulations are framed covering all matters necessary to be prescribed under the Excise Act. 3. See answer to No. 2. 4. The answer of No. 3 of questions asked yesterday is considered relevant. 5. No. As stated yesterday, the question of bounty on cane produced by white labour has no connection with that of the ultimate destination of the sugar produced from - such cane. 6. There is no likelihood of the precautions proving ineffective. 7. It is difficult to give any other answer than that there is no bounty on exported sugar. JAM MANUFACTURERS' COMBINE.",15
9,Mr MCDOUGALL,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Whether it is true, as alleged, that the Monbulk Fruit Growers' Co-operative Factory is being squeezed out of the market by the unfair trading practices of the Victorian Jam Manufacturers' combine ? 2. Is it a fact, that, through unscrupulous trade pressure on the part of the jam combine, the working staff of the Monbulk Co-operative Factory has been reduced from sixty hands to four? 3. It is stated that the jam combine has so forced down the price of raspberries that growers at Monbulk and other places are being compelled to give up cultivating them. Will the Minister ascertain if the statement is true; Cook, Hume and, if it is true, will he take effective steps to prevent the raspberry growers from being crushed by the combine in question? 4. Has he noticed the press statement that the jam combine is now in a position to absolutely dictate prices to the. raspberry growers. If he has, what does he propose to do in the matter?",16

13,Mr KELLY,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Wentworth) [10.55] - I should like to know why the Minister proposes not to accept the request of the Senate in this instance. It seems rather a peculiar thing to do. This is, I understand, purely a revenue duty. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Curtain s are made here in many places.",17
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Parramatta) 3 [ro.56] - We are entitled to have some 18 fuller' explanation.,17

19,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Hume-Trea surer) [10.58] - I move That the requested amendment be made. I am moving, with some reluctance, that the request as to the wording of paragraph A be agreed to.",17
20,Mr WH IRVINE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Are gloves made here? What are the facts?,17
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,I know that gloves of all kinds are made here.,17
22,Sir JOHN FORREST,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,The Minister did innot prove this statement on the last occasion when we were dealing with the item.,17
23,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Yes , I did; Tariff), and I gave the names of the firms.",17
24,Sir JOHN FORREST,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,The Minister's statement is - contradicted absolutely by glove makers.,17
25,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Ver y reluctantly, and in consequence of the large vote in the Senate, I feel that I must accept the wording of this request, whilst not propos-ing - to agree to their request in respect of the duty.",17
26,Mr WATKINS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Newcastle) [11.0] - It seems to me that if we amend the wording of paragraph A as proposed we shall impose a duty of 30 per cent, upon gloves used by the poorer classes of the community, namely, harvesting, driving, housemaids', and gardening gloves. If such gloves are not made here, I shall not vote for the imposition of a high revenue duty upon them.",17
27,Mr HUME COOK,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,They are made here.,18
28,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Hume-Trea surer) [11.2] - I think that the honourable member is under a misapprehension. invite the Committee to amend the wording of paragraph A as requested ancl to disagree with the proposed alteration of the duty. When we come to the next requested amendment, which provides that gloves n.e.i. of all kinds and materials, including mittens, shall be free, I also propose to ask the Committee to adhere to the duty. Mr W . ' H . IRVINE (Flinders) [11.3]. - I understand that the Minister intends to ask the Committee to disagree with the request that the .duty of 30 per cent, under the general Tariff and of 20 per cent, in respect of imports from the United Kingdom under paragraph A be'removed.",18
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,I-do .,18
30,Mr WH IRVINE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Then what is the object of specializing these' particular classes of gloves?,18
31,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,I cannot do other than ask the Committee to agree or disto agree with the requested amendment as 'the duty.,18
32,Mr WH IRVINE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,There is no ocmust casion for the Treasurer to lose his temper.,18
33,Mr WILKS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Dalley) [11.4] - This is a free. very fair revenue item. The honourable member for' Newcastle is squeamish taxing what he describes as the gloves of the poor, but when the item of blankets under consideration the same feeling was not manifested, although blankets are far more importance than are gloves to the poorer classes.",18
34,Mr WATKINS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Blanket s are made here high. and sold at prices below those of the imported goods.,18
35,Mr WILKS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"The Committee was also very keenly in favour of a heavy duty on carpets, although in a country like this carpets are not the sole concern of the rich. Driving gloves are not used by the poorer classes in Australia, and housemaids' gloves as a rule are provided not by the housemade, maids, but by those who employ them. Sir WILLIAM LYNE. - And so with garwhich dening gloves.",18
36,Mr WILKS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Exactly . poor people in Newcastle have large gardens and wear gloves when they them. I am pleased that the Treasurer is resisting the abolition of the duty requested by another place-whic h must be a swell House-havin g in view the fact that, while it favours the abolition of the duty on these gloves, it is prepared to put a heavy duty on blankets.",18
37,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Franklin) [11.7]. - I fail to follow the honourable member's I contention that this is a legitimate item for a high revenue duty. He holds that it is reasonable to impose duties of .30 per cent, and 20 per cent, on harvesting, driving, housemaids', and gardening gloves, whilst dress gloves are dutiable at 15 per cent, and 10 per cent. The honourable member holds that it is reasonable to impose lower duties on gloves worn purelv for ornamental purposes.",18
38,Mr HUME COOK,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"But the last-named class are not made in Australia, while the others are produced here.",18
39,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"If the honourable member for Dalley regards this as a fair distribution of taxation, I , for one, do not.",18
40,Mr BAMFORD,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Herbert) [11.8] - It seems to me that in this case, as in several - other cases, the Committee is in somewhat of a difficulty. I should prefer to adhere the paragraph as originally passed by to this Chamber, but it would appear that we have no opportunity of doing so; that we either impose a duty of 30 per cent, in respect of these gloves or make the line",18
41,Mr WILKS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,The ' Treasurer may proabout pose an alteration of the duty.,18
42,Mr BAMFORD,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Apparentl y he is not was inclined' to do so, and we have either to accept his proposal, or that suggested by of another place. I do not wish to vote to place these gloves on the free list, but I think that a duty of 30 per cent, is too",18
43,Mr TUDOR,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Yarra) [11.9] - There has been some discussion on the question of whether or not the gloves described in paragraph A, as proposed to be amended, are made in Australia. I could take honourable members to a factory within fifteen minutes' journey of this House, where they are being' and since the manufacturers have to use certain imported leather in respect of a duty is levied, I do not think it would be reasonable to allow the finished How many article to come in free.",18
44,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Kid-skin s are work in being produced in Australia.,18
45,Mr TUDOR,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"T know the leathers that are being made here, and that they are very good leathers. An excellent glac6 kid is being made here at the present time. I trust that the Committee will agree to the Minister's suggestion to accept the requested alteration of the wording,- and to retain the duty as passed in ""this House. Motion agreed to. Requested amendment made. Requested amendment, making item 120, paragraph A, free, not made.",19
46,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Hume-Trea surer) .[1.1.13] - I wish, sir, to ask whether I should be in order in moving an amendment on the wording of paragraph B of the item. It is the desire of the Department that we should insert after the word "" materials "" the words "" not coming within item 326!"". Item 326 covers ""fancygoods,"" and the object of that suggested amendment is to exclude from this item cricketing and other sporting gloves.",19
47,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"North Sydney) [11.14] - The Committee are entitled to receive some explanation of a proposal to .insert these words. Without such an explanation they are left to discover the reason for themselves, and so are led to waste the time of the Committee. I find that item 326 coversFancy Goods; including Card Cases; Snuff and Match Boxes, Purses, n.e.i.; Wallets; Thimbles; Serviette Rings; Button Hooks; Shoe Horns and L if t s ; Glove Stretchers; Toys, other than Dolls undressed; Ivory and other ornamental figures; Feather Dusters; Paper Parasols.",19
48,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,The member is wasting time now.,19
49,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"It is the Minister's fault if I am. Item 325 also coversArticles used for outdoor and indoor games; Fishing Appliances n.e.i., and Articles n.e.i. used for ornamental purposes or partly for use and partly for ornament, including Fancy Ground and Cut Glass Bottles of over 5 drams of fluid capacity, containing goods not subject to ad valorem duty, and Stoppers for such Bottles. There would have been no reason for this statement if the Minister had explained what he proposes.",19
50,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,I did explain.,19
51,The CHAIRMAN,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"I cannot accept the proposed amendment of the wording of paragraph B of the item. The ruling given last night' in connection with sugar bags must, I think, be held to cover this case also. Honourable members will observe that the Senate agreed to the wording of paragraph B. of this item, as it passed this - House, and has disagreed with the action of this House in this case only in respect to the duty. If the Committee were now to go back upon the work it did when the item was previously before it, the Senate might desire to do the same, and there would be no finalitv. Sir WILLIAM 'LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [n.18] - The honourable member for North Sydney has said that I gave no explanation of the amendment I propose to make in the wording of paragraph B .of this item. I said that the intention was to exclude gloves covered by item 326 such as cricketing and other sporting gloves'.",19
52,Mr CHANTER,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,The proposed amendment has been ruled out of order.,19
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,".^I am aware of that; and it was because of the decision given last night that I asked the Chairman to say whether I should be in order in moving such a.n amendment. I propose now that the Committee should agree to the alteration of the dates requested by the Senate, and shall not accept the request to make, the item free.",19
54,Mr WH IRVINE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,What is the estimate of the revenue to be derived under the item?,19
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"It is £25,000. In reference tp the alteration of the date from 14th October to 14th November, 1907, I should say that I am informed by the Clerk that it is merely a correction of an error which was made in this House.",19
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Parramatta) honourable [11.1.9] - I am in agreement with the Minister in connection with this item. For the life of me, I am unable to get up any enthusiasm in opposition to a duty on gloves, when we are taxing people's blankets and food of every description to the greatest possible extent. In the circumstances, it is not unreasonable to ask persons who can afford to wear decent gloves to pay a fair duty on them. Requested amendment, altering date of operation of duty from October to November .(item 120, paragraph B), made. Requested amendment, making item 120, paragraph B, free, not made. ' Item 121.

Request - Mak e the duty (General Tariff), 16s. per dozen, or 35 per cent, ad val., whichever rate returns the higher duty; (United Kingdom), 12s. per dozen, or 30 per cent, ad val., whichever rate returns the higher duty.",19
57,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Hume-Trea surer) [11.21] - I m o v e That the requested amendment be made. Ir has been considered that the requested amendment represents a better method of dealing with the item than that adopted by the House of 'Representatives.,20
58,Mr WH IRVINE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Flinders) [11.22]. - This is an item which was debated in this Chamber at considerable length, and with considerable heat; and the general impression was that the imposition of a specific duty of 16s. per dozen should be contested whenever opportunity arose. This is a duty which,. in many cases, amounts to over 100 per cent, on the lower-priced articles; and a simple method presents itself of abolishing it. I move That the motion be amended by adding the words "" but that the words ' 16s. per dozen or,' and the words ' whichever rate returns the higher duty,' be left out.""",20
59,Mr TUDOR,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"I rise to a point As this House agreed to the rate of 16s. per dozen, I submit that all .that is before us now is the alternative rate suggested by the Senate.",20
60,The CHAIRMAN,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"The whole of the suggested amendment is now before the Committee, and the honourable member for' Flinders is quite in order in proposing any modifications he desires. - Mr WH IRVINE - The effect of the amendment is to strike out the specific rate, and restore the duty to that which, I think, was originally proposed by the Government, namely, 35 per cent.",20
61,Mr WILKS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Dalley) [11.25] - This item l e ft the House of Representatives as a specific duty-on e of the few in the Tariff-and it is now returned with an alternative duty. The feeling right through the debate in this Chamber was against composite duties, and during the consideration of the first Tariff, the evils of such duties were distinctly shown, and they were abandoned, even after a strong.appeal made by the then Minister of Customs. Apparently, the intention of the Senate is to tax the cheapest articles the most heavily in the interests, I suppose, of one particular, factory, or several factories in Australia. But if we treat the hatmaking industry in this way, why not treat all industries similarly, seeing that every industry produces cheap articles? I am strongly against any such step; because I regard such duties as a distinct levy on those who can least afford to pay high prices. The duty of 16s. per. dozen means a tax of 150 per cent, on some of the cheaper hats; and if the public, who purchase these articles, were aware of fhat fact, they would lose much of their enthusiasm on behalf of this industry.",20
62,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Thos e people do not pay the tax because the hats are cheaper.,20
63,Mr WILKS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,They pay in the sense that the local manufacturers desire the high duty in order to keep the cheapest imported articles out of the country.,20
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Thos e articles can be produced more cheaply here.,20
65,Mr WILKS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"The Treasurer is a protectionist in cxcelsis; and I am not prepared to follow him. I intend to support the proposal of the honourable member, for Flinders.",20
66,Mr TUDOR,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Yarra) [11.27] - I think that the Chairman, has made a mistake in admitting the amendment of the honourable of order. member for Flinders.",20
67,The CHAIRMAN,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Order 1,20
68,Mr TUDOR,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"I withdraw any reflection which my words may appear, to cast upon the Chairman. There is no doubt, however, that the item, as it l e ft this House, imposed a specific duty of 16s. per dozen; and all the Senate has done is to suggest an alternative duty. In my opinion the words ""16s. per dozen,"" which appear in the Senate's request, are a printer's error. If the Senate had not suggested an alternative duty, this item would not have, been before us; and no one knows that better than does the honourable member for Flinders.",20
69,Mr BOWDEN,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Is the honourable member in order in traversing the ruling of the Chairman ?,20
70,The CHAIRMAN,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,I do not understand the honourable member for Yarra to be traversing my ruling.,20
71,Mr TUDOR,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"When I desire to challenge the ruling of the Chairman, I shall do it in a proper way, and in all friendliness. Mr W. H. IRVINE - The honourable member is challenging me for asking for a good ruling 1",20
72,Mr TUDOR,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"T he honourable member knows that if the Senate had not desired to have an alternative rate, in order to reach the higher priced hats, this matter would not be before us.",20

101,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"There was not a division taken on this item with more than thirty-five members present. Mr TU t i OR - W it h pairs, practically every vote in the House was accounted for. It was decided to impose a fixed duty, mainly on account of the position that the industry was put into through the hat trade being a season trade. The shapes and fashions this year will not prevail next year,, and, therefore, the manufacturers in Great Britain are glad to dispose of their stock at less than it cost.them to make. It was to cope with that unfair competition that the fixed duty was agreed to. ' I know that stock is dumped here at less than it costs to make.",21
102,Sir JOHN FORREST,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Who ' gets benefit ?,22
103,Mr TUDO R,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"The importers in Flinders-lane. I trust that the Committee will retain the. fixed duty and adopt also the alternative rates proposed by the Senate to catch the higher-priced hats, which are sold in Collins-street to people who insist on havingimported hats at over j Q i is. each.",22
104,Sir PHILIP FYSH,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Denison) [11.35]. - The honourable member for Yarra always speaks with very great authority'; but he certainly makes statements at times, and has made one this morning, which may have a great effect, upon honourable members' votes, but which are not correct. .1 stand now in, front bf a gentleman who knows something-of the hat trade, and I say, in his presence, that there is no such thing as buying up the end of a season's stock of the particular class of hat with which we are now dealing. They are never out of date; they do not lose their value; and the shapes hardly alter. .The common hatto which these rates refer is now almost prohibited from importation, and all those people whowear felt hats are thrown back upon whatever class of article the. Denton mi-lls happen to prefer to make. I refer to the Denton mills with all respect, because, notwithstanding the higher rates of duty now operative, they have not found it necessary to make any addition to their prices.",22
105,Mr MAUGER,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"I think their prices are less now than ever they were before; and that is undoubtedly owing to the increased duty. . Sir PHILIP FYSH - It shows that the effort which was made to bolster those mills up by'giving them an increased rate of duty on felt hats was quite unnecessary. On the hat known as the bowler, which is worn. by a very large' number of people, and manufactured in England, possibly, at' from 8s. to ios. per dozen, - a fixed duty of 16s. reaches the 150 per cent, referred to by the honourable' member for Flinders. I hope honourable members will disabuse their minds of the idea that there is any possibility of large quantities of hats being dumped here by reason of tlieir being unseasonable at Home. Nothing of the kind ever occurs with respect to felt hats ",22
106,Mr HUTCHISON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Coul d not an Australian importer have an understanding at the beginning of the season with an English maker to send out his left stock?,22
107,Sir PHILIP FYSH,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"There ' is no house in England that keeps - any stock of the hats. They are all made to order, and just as I would have to place an order with the Denton mills here a month or two months ahead, so with respect to all felt hats and f u r hats which are made in England a man must place his orders weeks if not months ahead. There is no such thing as keeping a stock, as the hats are all made t'o order.",22
108,Mr HUTCHISON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Yes , but they are not all sold.",22
109,Sir PHILIP FYSH,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Probably they are sold before they are made. If they are not sold during one month they will be sold during the next month. It is-just like selling so much bread and butter. Hats are sold every day, and there is no question as to a change. A very small change in the shape of a brim is very easily made, but even that does not affect the question. We are now dealing with only wool hats, and the next item deals with f u r hats at a higher rate.",22

But. this Tariff imposes such a high rate, that if compels men to pay 3s. or 4s. or 5s. for a hat which they had been in the habit, of buying for about 2s. I remind honourable' members that the Denton Hat Mills here do not want a high duty,' as they have indicated by not having increased their prices. I repeat that there is no such thing as dumping a quantity of these hats here towards the end of a season by reason of their having got out of fashion in the Old Country.",22

116,Mr MAUGER,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"My experience teaches me that unless this duty be retained it mean disaster to the Australian hat mills. I speak without any interest, except that of in order, sir? an Australian who wants the work to be done here. I can assure honourable memGeneral bers that previously the factories were working only half-time, and that under old Victorian Tariff two out of five tories were closed down.

136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"The honourable gentleman should not imagine that because he does not, I do not know anything about hat-making.

138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Certainl y not it under sweating conditions. The honourable member will not find any sweating going on at the Denton mills in Lancashire. The honourable member for Yarra will not contradict my statement. It is true that the workmen inthose mills are not 'paid as much as the workmen here, but considering the relative values of money, I venture to say that the former are getting very good wages indeed. A good hat-maker in the Denton mills today will get from 35s. to £ 2 a week. The honourable member for Batman will not deny that statement, and, therefore, it is idle to suggest that the are made under sweating conditions simply because they happen to be cheap. It is the poorer class of hats which are most heavily hit by this specific duty.",23
139,Mr MAUGER,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"They are the hats which want hitting, too.",24
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"I wish that every man was able to buy as good a hat as the honourable gentleman can afford to get. But, unfortunately, there are men who cannot afford to pay a high price, and therefore they' must buy the next best article,",24

142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Are they made under sweating conditions?,24
143,Mr MAUGER,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,That is not the question.,24
144,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"When I spoke Will of cheap hatsin the Old Country, .the honacounted orable member for Batman wanted to know whether they were made under sweating conditions.

146,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"That is the plain English. It is not a question of sweating, but a question of what people can afford to pay. On the; poorer, inferior class of hats, which are being imported, .this specific duty will fall very heavily, In some cases, it will amount to 100 or 120, or 130 per cent. There is no sense in imposing a duty of that kind. It is required, because of the difference in wages or conditions. A moderate duty of, say, undervaluations to be presented25 or 30 per cent., would make up for every difference which can be imagined in charge. regard to wage rates or conditions.

I agree with those who think that there is no need for so high a duty. The difference in wages is more than covered by a duty of 35 cent., which would be a perfectly safe to adopt, even from the protectionist standpoint, and one which would prevent the charging of unduly high prices under cover of practically prohibitory rates. I think porters. that when the honourable member for New England reconsiders the matter, withdraw his charges, which I hope have been made thoughtlessly.

If honourable member for North Sydney would only pay a visit of inspection to the hat instances. factories liere, and see the. beautiful long threads taken from Australian wool, and ' woven into hats, and if he would compare those threads with the tiny atoms cemented together which are to be found in the foreign shoddy, I am sure that he will not have much admiration for the latter.

It is true asks that we do read from time to time of fines being imposed upon importers by the Comptroller-General of Customs. - Let me give three instances in which such fines have been imposed. In the first place, honourable members will recollect that the the old Tariff .practically exempted wadding duty. I well remember the discussion which took place in this ""House upon the It was considered that wadding should be admitted free because it was the raw material of some manufacturers. the abWhat happened? A merchant imported wadding and was fined, because the Minto ister controlling the CustomsDepartment had, in the interim, declared by regulation 1 in that wadding came within the category of cotton piece goods, and was, therefore, of liable to duty. In that case a small fine Another case had reference to stitched hats. Any perof son who has had experience of felt hats so knows that the felt hat, which was made liable to duty under the old Tariff, contained a large amount of stitching, together with certain ornamentation. But, one day, how the Customs authorities opened a case of goods and took out a number-of girls' hats the trimmed with liberty silk, and bound round with wire that had been stitched into the The Collector of Customs immethe diately declared that these goods' were "" stitched "" hats, and therefore liable to The third instance which occurs to for me relates to a piece of cotton gingham, y one side of which had been passed over a hot roller, with the result that the fluffy appearance had been taken off. The other up, side had not been so treated, and, conseinto quently,- there was an apparent "" scribbling "" of the cloth. This gingham was described in the invoice as cotton piece but the Customs authorities declared the that it was flannelette, and accordingly a small fine was imposed. These are typical",27

201,Mr FOSTER,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"What about the case of Messrs. Stevenson and Sons, which occurred in Victoria in the old days ?",28
202,Sir PHILIP FYSH,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"I am not aware that anything was proved against the Messrs. Stevenson, although I know that an officer tendered some information which was supposed to implicate them. These are the only two cases which have occurred during the past ""forty years. My association with! Customs Department extends over many years. Until fifteen years ago I was a large importer. I had a great deal to do with various commercial houses in England, ancl I - say that anything like a desire to defraud has been the exception during all these years. If one dared to approach the English or German houses with a request that he should be supplied with false invoices, the idea would be scouted.",28
203,Mr FOSTER,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Will the honourable member assist me to get a Commission of Inquiry into this matter? - Sir PHIL IP FYSH - There is a Commission of Inquiry every morning in the Department of the Minister of Trade anil Customs. He has his experts up and down Flinders-lane daily, with a view to accurately ascertaining the value of goods. He has experts connected with every branch of trade, and very often the Customs autliorities know a great deal more about invoice values than clo the importers themselves. The honourable member for New England ought to justify, the honourable member for North Sydney's statement that practically there are no cases solute fraud is committed. Of course, I know that some ""time ago a case occurred in which a parcel of goods imported from the East was seized by the Customs authorities, who deemed the consignment to be undervalued. They accordingly exercised their power of adding 10 per cent, to the declared value of the goods, and seized tbem, with the result that when they were sold a large profit was made upon them. But what were the circumstances of the case? A merchant who resides in Japan spends the whole of his time in travelling throughout that Empire and purchasing goods at local prices. He sent the consignof ment in question to Australia, invoicing them at the price paid for them in Japan. The Customs authorities were unable to prove that they were not invoiced at their value at the place of export, but, having a suspicion that they were undervalued, seized them. It is seldom, however, that an instance of that kind occurs. Upon the whole, business is conducted upon the lines which have led to English-speaking merchants being regarded all over the world as merchant princes and honest gentlemen.",28
204,Mr SAMPSON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Wimmera) [12.18] I do not think that there is any necessity for me to discuss the ethics of importers at this stage. I clo not believe that cases of fraud amongst that class are more numerous than they are amongst the manufacturers. I wish to intimate, however, that my opinion in respect of the duty upon hats has undergone a change since the item under consideration was dealt with by this Committee last year. I believe that the general desire of our manufacturers is that we should impose a fixed duty upon hats, - so as to keep out goods of inferior quality, and, therefore, I intend to support it. I . also believe that the ad valorem duty which the Senate has proposed as an alternative to the specific duty agreed to by this Committee is a reasonable one. The fixed duty will have the effect of ' excluding the cheap manufactures of Europe and Asia, whilst hats of - the Woodrow class^which will be required to pay 35 per cent, ad valoremwill not be affected by it. . If we are going to encourage Australian industry, I know of no industry which is. worthy of greater encouragement than is the hat industry. We possess both the fur and the wool necessary for the manufacture of hats of all descriptions-fro m the cheapest grade to the highest. I see no reason whatever why there should be any importation of hats in which abinto the Commonwealth.",28
205,Mr ATKINSON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Does not the honourable member think that as the wool, the fur, and other raw material are obtainable in this country, 35 per cent, is a very good protective rate?",28
206,Mr SAMPSON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"If we compare the wages paid in Italy, W/fiich are about is. per day, with the wages paid in Australia, where they range up to ios. a day, it wili be seen that that rate of protection is not so very high. We also know that the freight from continental countries to Australia is no greater than the freight on any our Australian raihvays, in the case of journeys of 100 to .200 miles. Therefore, 35 per cent, is not a large protection against the cheap kind of hats that are 'imported to Australia. It is true that-1 voted against what I considered to be a high duty on woollens, because most of our woollen goods come from Great Britain, and there is reason for giving consideration in that respect.",28

It is obvious that a fixed duty upon hats becomes greater according as the class of Honourable members are deliberately imposing a prohibitive specific duty upon the cheapest imported into ' Australia.

Invoices generally come from reputable, honest traders other parts of the world who would not knowingly make a mis-statement. Generally their invoices may be accepted, and indeed have to be accepted. It would be impossible for the Customs officers to examine one-twentieth part - of the goods that are imported, and we have to depend collection to a large extent upon the assistance given by merchants themselves and the fact that, as no one can tell which box or package may be opened and tested, there is consequently always great risk in misdescription, undervaluing, or attempting to cheat the me next day.

As a matter of fact, the same system is followed in the woollen industry and the boot manufacturing trades. Many boot manufacturers refuse to supply retailers direct.",32
238,Mr MAHON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,But do two wrongs make a right?,32
239,Mr TUDQR,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"I am not suggesting that they do. I pointed out, on a former occasion, that manufacturers in England who had been supplying retailers direct had gone out of the business. Those who adopted the same system here would have to keep a number of travellers on the roads, and to incur advertising and other charges, whilst they would also find it necessary to keep a watchful eye on the financial position , of their customers. One manufacturer in Victoria commenced to supply retailers direct, but the Civil Service Co-operative Society-for which, by the way, I . have every respect-di d not come to his assistance. It could buy caps today direct from the manufacturers, but it prefers to purchase them through the warehouses. I fail to see why the whole trade should be penalized because of any practice' on the part of the Denton Hat Mills, of which the honourable member for Coolgardie disapproves.

A majority of honourable members appear to have made up their minds to back up the Government in every proposal that is made. We have a well-compiled schedule before us, but apparently only honourable members on this side are bothering AYES. about it. They desire to secure reductions of duties suggested by the Senate, or at least to retain the duties as the Tariff left this House. I am here defending the work already performed by this House. I ask honourable members opposite why they do not adhere to what was done, when the Tariff was previously before the Committee. If they do not do so it will be because some of them are prepared to go back upon the votes which they previously gave. The honourable member for South Sydney as an ardent protectionist may be delighted with what is taking place, but I certainly NOES. am not.

254,Mr MATHEWS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Because the Tariff is scientific.,34
255,Mr WILKS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,This Tariff contains more anomalies than did the old Tariff.,34
256,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Nonsens e ! are scarcely any anomalies in this Tariff.,34
257,Mr WILKS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Of course^ the Treasurer looks upon his own child as without blemish. When the acting leader of the Opposition was complimenting the Treasurer on the - completion of the first consideration of this Tariff, I objected, because, after ""a scramble, the Tariff had emerged much more unscientific than was the Tariff of 1902 ; and I have seen no reason to alter that opinion. The friends of this particular industry - seem to have been able to marshal enough forces to upset-the decision; arrived at by this House a tew months ago; and I should very much like to know the reason for. the' change of front on the part of some honourable members.",34
258,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,The honourable member knows perfectly well that Sydney is becoming a great protectionist centre.,34
259,Mr WILKS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"That is another question with which I shall deal at the proper time; but I remind the Treasurer that I can distinguish a motor lamp, for instance, as quickly as he can. I did a little scrambling when the Tariff was last before us, and had openly expressed my intention of doing so; but I never pretended that I was voting for "" s c i e n t if i c "" protection. On the present occasion, honourable members are scrambling in the interests of what is distinctly a Victorian industry;. but they have not the pluck to admit the fact. Fbr years', the honourable member for South Sydney has been before the public as a democrat ; and I ask him whether he is prepared, for the sake of protection, to allow the Senate to be supreme in matters of taxation ?",34
260,Mr WATSON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,I always back the Senate when it is right.,34
261,Mr WILKS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Then the honourable member thinks that the Senate is right in increasing taxation ? - Mr WATSON - No ; I think they are right _ insuggesting that we should increase sc. taxation.,34
262,Mr WILKS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"L e a n only enter my emphatic protest againsf the proposed amendment; but I utterly lack the power of language to express my feelings. When we back down to the Senate and . impose heavier taxation on the people, in the interests of, practically, one big factory, I say that such conduct is damnable.",34
263,The CHAIRMAN,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"The honourable member, I think, will see that such language is scarcely parliamentary. There Mr Wilks - Do I understand theChairman to rule that the word "" damnable "" is not parliamentary? It is a word which is to be found in the scriptures; and I should like a ruling on the point. '. The CHAIRMAN - It is not a question of my ruling, but rather a question of propriety ; and I think the honourable member will acknowledge that the use of such language ought not to be encouraged.",34
264,Mr WILKS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Le t me inform honourable members who are so squeamish that the adjective figures most prominently in some .of o . our greatest works; and, if honourable memtheir bers are not aware of - that fact, their lack of classical culture. I can onlyrepeat that legislation of this character damnable. If we feel strongly on an)' question, we cannot use rose-scented senter tences; and the people, who have to pay these duties, have no time to be .mealyany mouthed, especially when they know that the duties are imposed practically in interests of one flourishing manufactory. The honourable member for Coolgardie has shown that the particular company to' which .1 refer is able to give away 15 per cent, per annum to its shareholders, so that cannot be said that these duties are necessary to rescue a' languishing concern. It is common report that those connected with this Victorian manufactory have openly boasted on each occasion that they knew how the numbers stood in Parliabers on that side. ment; and I must say that they seem to have very successfully piloted these items through the Senate. I know that be useless for me to submit an amendment, and, therefore, I can only enter my protest. It is most remarkable that there should duty of 2s. i d . on a hat that may possibly, ing. cost only iod.; and such duties are calculated to make any one angry. I am ticularly astonished at. the action - of.

I have voted all through for the lowest possible duties on the necessaries of life, and I shall continue to not the desire of the workers that tax should be heaped on tax.",34
265,Mr COON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,This is not a tax ,35

One thing I noticed most forcibly this morning, when we had a unique opportunity of voting with the ayes, was that the Ministerial benches were denuded even of the schedules with which the it - Committee is now dealing.

The lack of interest on the part of the Committee in the passage of these items - and in that - connection what has occurred with regard to hats is very significantexplains to some extent the. extraordinary reversal of form shown by some honourable members. ' Every one regrets to see honourable members changing their votes unless they are able to show that that change has come about because they have better appreciated the facts, or because new facts have come before them. I have noticed that not one. of those honourable members who have reversed their votes on this question has seen fit to give the Committee any reasons for his change of attitude.

281,Mr KELLY,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Every honourable member is answerable to the country if he changes his attitude upon a public question, and cannot, or does not see fit to explain to the country, through the Committee, the reasons for that change. I do not say that honourable members who have reversed their votes on this question cannot explain their action, but the fact, remains that they have not attempted to do so.",36
282,Mr HALL,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,It is very unwise to explain anything at any time.,36
283,Mr KELLY,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"If the honourable member considers it unwise to take one's constituents into one's confidence, and impolitic to express one's opinions fearlessly, I shall not attempt to argue with' him.

I do not wish to repeat the arguments which were used in connection with the previous request. I am really unable to find any words with which to express adequately the attitude of honourable members on the other side today. But the time will come when they will be found protesting against the exercise of such power by the Senate. I venture to prophesy that if this course be persisted in, the people leaving out of Australia will eventually be called upon to alter the Constitution.",37

302,Mr WILKS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Fanc y the hat manufacturers of Victoria being so weak that they require a duty of 7d. on a sewn hat which Here is is retailed at 8d. ! It will be a crime to impose a duty of that kind. How is it that the hat industry has so many friends in this Chamber and the Senate? How is it that it now can marshal its forces so well?

Certainly, it is of no use to appeal to the majority of my honourable friends opposite j because they seem disposed to vote for any duty which will act in the way of prohibition. That is their goal, pure and simple, and, therefore, they are only consistent.

Such duties would make up for the difference between rates of wages and conditions in Australia and elsewhere. There. is no than reason, justice, or equity, in imposing the Federation rates which are asked for. On a cap for which a wearer pays about 3s., the rates will be only 35 per cent., but' the ad valorem percentage increases as of the cap decreases, so that the lowest priced cap, which, of course, is purchased by the poorest, will have to bear a duty vation. of from 100 to 150 per cent.

Would it not be better, instead of sending abroad anuse nually £30,000 for the purchase of hats and caps, to let die money filter through class our own factories, providing employment fer our own people at good wages, instead of paying for sweated labour elsewhere. can control the conditions of employment here, but we cannot control those memwhich obtain upon the Continent.",40
362,Mr KELLY,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"We can control the conditions of employment in Melbourne, but not those which prevail at Braybrook. Theremade in fore, go to Braybrook.",40
363,Mr CHANTER,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"There is no need for me to say any more to show that, if the inbe properly encouraged, it will capture the whole of the local trade.",40
364,Mr KELLY,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Wentworth) |_3- ]-- 12 During the course of this debate we have heard a good deal of the benefit which the imposition of the proposed duty will confer upon the workers in the hat industry. We know perfectly well what it will accomplish for the manufacturers, and if I thought that they were entitled to the advantages which it will give them, I should not offer any - strenuous opposition to it. But, in my opinion, the protection which is already afforded them is ' exorbitant. However, I chiefly rose for the purpose of eliciting a little more information from those honourable members who appear to be absolutely certain that the workers will obtain their share, from these burdens being placed upon the taxpayers of the country.",41
365,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,There is no burden.,41
366,Mr KELLY,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"The Treasurer may not regard a duty of more than 50 per cent, upon caps as a burden, but the poor persons who have to purchase them will certainly find it so. The honourable member for Riverina stated that we can control the conditions of employment and the fixing of wages in this country, but does he not know that some time ago one of the largest manuf acturers of agricultural implements in Victoria removed his works from one locality, where his operations would hiave been subject to the control against them. of a Wages Board, to another locality where they would be free from such control",41
367,Mr CHANTER,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,What has that to do with the question? There was no new protecSenate. tion law in existence then.,41
368,Mr KELLY,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"I am aware that-there a new protection law in existence now, but I also know that its validity has been chalthat lenged.",41
369,Mr BATCHELOR,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Will the honourable member assist us to bring the new protection into operation ?,41
370,Mr KELLY,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,I ' 'am now anxiously awaiting the judgment of the High Court in regard to the validity of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act.,41
371,Mr BATCHELOR,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Will the honourable member assist us to give effect to the new protection ?,41
372,Mr KELLY,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"If the honourable member will vote with me to secure lower duties 7s. per dozen. upon all these items in the Tariff, and it is afterwardsfound that it is possible to give effect to the new protection, I shall prepared to dp all I can to meet rates him in that direction. In the meantime, appeal to the Committee to defer the position of these high duties until we have been assured that it is possible for the workers to obtain some benefit from them.",41
373,Mr BATCHELOR,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"If we cut down all the high duties, it will be impossible to give effect to the new protection.",41
374,Mr KELLY,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"If we cut them down to a normal level, and it is subsequently found possible to give effect to the new protection, there may then be. some reason to ask for the imposition of higher duties. But if honourable members opposite merely wish to assist Messrs. MCKay and Company, and others, who establish their factories outside the jurisdiction of the AVages Boards, let them be honest enough to say so.",41
375,Sir JOHN FORREST,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Swan) [3.16] I am not able to support the request made by the Senate in regard to caps. This Committee has already imposed an ad valorem rate upon them, and I fail to see why its decision should be departed from. Of course, it may be said that in the last two divisions-in which I voted with the Government- I supported somewhat similar proposals. That. I submit, is not so, inasmuch as the fixed duties of 16s. per dozen and 25s. per dozen ini those cases were the rates sanctioned by this House.",41
376,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,But when they were imposed the right honourable member voted,41
377,Sir JOHNFORREST,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"It is not, in my ? opinion, within our powers to deal with the rate of 16s. per dozen already agreed to by this House and not objected to by the",41
378,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"The 35 per is cent, rate is a new duty.",41
379,Sir JOHN FORREST,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"It seems to me that duty is nothing compared with the > specific duty of 16s. per dozen, which is equivalent to about 100 per cent.",41
380,Mr SAMPSON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"It only represents that percentage upon the low-grade hats, which can be manufactured locally.",41
381,Sir JOHNFORREST,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"I am altogether opposed to 35 per cent, duties, but as this House has already agreed to 35 per cent. and 30 per cent, in respect of this paragraph, it has not now the power to reverse its decision. I cannot support the alternative request of the Senate to make the duty",41
382,Mr BATCHELOR,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Boothby) [3.19] I do not like fixed duties to be imposed upon be these articles. I should prefer ad valorem to be levied. Upon this class of goods I specific duties are equivalent to very high imad valorem rates, and we know .that competition is most severe in regard to the lower priced articles. I feel impelled to vote for the Government proposal, because a duty of 35 per cent, has already been imposed upon the raw materials from which. caps are made.",41
383,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Why do not manufacturers use Australian wool ?,42
384,Mr BATCHELOR,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"The same question might be raised as the objection to all these duties? Why not wear Australian made caps? I repeat that we have to recollect that 35 per cent, has been imposed on the materials of which these caps are made. Consequently the proposal to levy a similar rate upon the completed article would afford it no protection' whatever. I prefer an ad valorem, duty to a fixed duty, in order that the higher priced goods/may pay more to the revenue - So far as' the amount of duty is concerned, 35 per cent, does not seem to me to give any margin for the local manufacturers, bearing in mind the fact that the material from which the goods are made pays about the same rate of duty.",42
385,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Appare l and attire are taxed at 40 and 35 per cent.,42
386,Mr BATCHELOR,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"I see no reason why hats, caps, and bonnets should not pay 45 percent. Then there would be a margin for the local manufacturers. Honourable members cannot maintain that the freight on made-up goods of this character is higher than the freight on the piece goods out of which they are made.",42
387,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Will the honourable member vote for a duty of 35 per cent. ?,42
388,Mr BATCHELOR,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"I am afraid that we cannot get that. If there is a proposal to make the duty 45 per cent. I shall support it. If such a proposal is made and lost I shall vote for the fixed duty, because I am not going to place the manufacturers a.t a disadvantage. We must consider^the fact that under the 35 per cent, duty there was a very great increase in the number of hats imported. The imports increased from a few thousands of oounds' worth to over £30,000 worth in two or three years.",42
389,Mr GLYNN,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Angas) [3.22] - I think that one may be excused for again drawing attention to the fact that we are yielding too' much to the requests of the Senate. We are approaching some very, important items, and we must remember that under the Constitution the Senate has not the power to initiate Bills dealing with taxation. But substantially the Senate is doing that verything if the Minister comes down and accepts a great number of suggestions for increasing duties, and, with the aid of a majority which has changed opinions, places them on the - statute-book. If honourable members will refresh their memories by looking up section 53 of the Constitution, the they will find that it sustains my view.",42
390,Mr MAUGER,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,We have thrashed this matter out.,42
391,Mr GLYNN,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"I think the honourable gentleman needs reminding of it. ' The very first words of that section areProposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate. All that we have to do, however, is to push a little further the principle of - suggestions, making it applicable to almost every one of the items in this Tariff, and we shall have the Senate acting as the controlling spirit in matters of taxation. The real privilege of the Senate lies in its power of negativing Bills in detail. That is different from the power possessed by the. House of Lords. The whole Budget-the whole scheme of taxation for the year-is submitted to the House of Lords in one Bill. We cannot do that under our Constitution. The great protection to the Senate against any domineering' by this. House is that we must send up a Bill dealing only with one matter of taxation at a time. But it was never intended that the Senate should be enabled, with the aid of .a Minister, to usurp the constitutional functions of this House in the matter of originating taxation. Again I remind honourable members of this fact. Suppose that a dissolution takes place on this question of the Tariff-. If we go to our constituents on what are we to rely? If the Senate, say, "" We'reject your Bill in to to, and send you to your . constituencies for a'fresh mandate,"" are we to go to our constituents on the question that was before'this House before this Bill was sent to the Senate, or on the Bill after it cameback from the Senate? A' pretty muddle we should bein if , having given our deliberate opinion upon a Bill sent to the Senate, we afterwards reversed that opinion, and went to our constituents, not for correction of our opinions as originally declared by our votes, but for the correction of the new opinions which we .have adopted from the Senate. The thing is ridiculous from a constitutional stand-point; and I call attention to it again, acknowledging that, while we are bound to consider suggestions from the Senate, we are not bound to consider suggestions of a character which practically amount to the initiation of taxation by the Senate.",42
392,Mr STORRER,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Bass) [3-2 7 ] - - I heard so much about the powers of themoveSenate that I wish to say a few words on that aspect of the question, The Senate, as stated by the honourable and learned member for Angas, has made certain sugshould gestions. The honourable member has complained that the Minister is asking us adopt too many of those suggestions. But I would remind' him that nothing can be done by the Minister if a majority of House is opposed to the Senate's requests. cent."" It is the right of every citizen of the Commonwealth to approach this House, and ask for an increase or decrease of taxation. have during our Tariff debates received rearises. quests in the form of petitions from manufacturers, merchants, and importers for the increase or decrease of duties. Surely the Senate ought to be able to make this House as freely as outside individuals can do? Therefore, I tliink that these flections on the power of the Senate to make requests are altogether uncalled for.",43
393,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Franklin) [3.28]. - The suggestion that bas been made by the honourable member for Boothby is one that the Committee might very well conother place sider. There can be no doubt that we are here increasing taxation according as the value of the goods decreases. say, we are imposing a far heavier tax upon articles worn by the poorer classes than similar articles worn by those who have more money to spend. I intend to propose that the duties be 45 and 40 per cent. The Senate has accepted those rates of duty other articles of apparel.",43
394,Mr BATCHELOR,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,- I cannot vote for honourable member's proposition if it is in that way.,43
395,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Surely that is the suggestion which the honourable member made.,43
396,Mr BATCHELOR,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,But consider the form in which the honourable member is making it.,43
397,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,What we have to consider is not so much the form in which the proposal is put. as the rate' of duty trade ? that should be levied.,43
398,Sir JOHN FORREST,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,The honourable memslop-made ber cannot move an increase.,43
399,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"We could bring this item under the heading of apparel, so secure in respect of it the duty mentioned. In order to mittee an opportunity to vote that the duty, on caps and sewn hats shall be-the same as that on slop-made clothing and other goods have coming under the item of ""apparel,"" I ; That the requested amendment be modified by leaving out the words "" 7s. per dozen or.""",43
400,Mr SOLMON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Laanecoorie) [3.31] - I like to know, Mr Chairman, whe. ther it will be competent for the honourable to member for Franklin, in the event of his proposal being carried, to move the omission of the words "" 35 per cent.,"" with the this object of inserting the words "" 40 per",43
401,The CHAIRMAN,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,I think it would We not be wise to deal with that point until it,43
402,Mr SALMON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,I would urge the honourable member to consider what will be our position if the amendment which he has just requests to moved is carried.,43
403,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"If it is carried, the reTreasurer will fake such a vote as an instruction to him to propose that the duty suggested by another place.be increased.",43
404,Mr SALMON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,We should then have to consider what power we have to deal with a matter which has been accepted by an,43
405,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,-We have' had a That is to ruling on that point.,43
406,Mr SALMON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"No : the ruling to on which the honourable member refers related to a case in which an alternative proposal was made. Here - we have no alternative; we simply have a proposition that the duty on shall be increased from 35 per cent, to 40 per cent. I think that the honourable memthe ber for Franklin will find himself in a put dilemma if he presses his proposal. Speaking to the general question, I would say' that I have had some experience of that part of the great city of London . where hats arid caps are manufactured. Any one who has seen the conditions under which work is carried on there, would hesitate to urge that they should be repeated here.",43
407,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Would not that remark apply also to the slop-made clothing Mr - SALMON - The conditions of the clothing trade are bad, but those of the cap-making industry are infinitely worse. The industry is at the very lowest and depth of manufacturing degradation in that I have dreadful portion of the city of London give the Comknown as the East End.",43
408,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,I do not think that the industry there is much worse than is the slop-made' clothing trade there.,44
409,Mr SALMON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"I think that it is; there are influences operating to keep the readymade clothing trade iri a better position."" In the first place, the price of the material used in the ready-made clothing trade is somewhat higher than that used in the manufacture of caps, and consequently the sweaters in the clothing trade in the East End of London require some guarantee that those to whom they issue such material to be made up will return it. Then again there is greater supervision over the clothing trade than there is over the cap-making industry. I know that caps are made there under the most degrading conditions. I would therefore ask the Committee to agree with the request made by another place, with a view of excluding-and I frankly admit that 1 should like to see them excluded-thes e goods, which, both in the matter of manufacture and quality,' are not such as to commend them to our better judgment. Some honourable members appear to think that because an article is offered at a low price it is necessarily cheap. It is well known that the cheapest articles often prove in the long run to be the dearest.",44
410,Mr BATCHELOR,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Why not. exclude the rich man's hat in the same way ?,44
411,Mr SALMON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"If we increase the duty upon such hats by 5 per cent, we shall do something in that direction.",44
412,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,I thought that the honourable member for Boothby and others opposite had been arguing all day that the imposition of a duty does not increase the price of the goods to which it is applied.,44
413,Mr SALMON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,1I have heard no such statement today.,44
414,Mr KELLY,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,I think that the honourable member for Boothby said that if people did not like to pay the. price charged for imported hats they could buy those locally produced. I took that to mean that the duty would not affect the price of the locally-made article.,44
415,Mr SALMON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"The local article is very much cheaper. The best silk hat made in Australia can be purchased for 25s.; but one cannot obtain a good "" Lincoln and Bennett "" for less than 30s. As the Committee has agreed to increase the duty on hats, it must, in order to be consistent, consent to an increased duty on caps. We should go even further, and make the duty higher. A great deal has been said about the increased cost which this duty of 7s. per dozen will involve. Do honourable members know that imported caps are invoiced at 4s. and 5s. per dozeni?",44
416,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Are not some - of the locally-made caps invoiced at very low prices ?,44
417,Mr SALMON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,I hope so; I am quite satisfied' that they would be of much better quality than the imported caps offering at a low price.,44
418,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,The local cap manufacturers import their material.,44
419,Mr SALMON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"They do so because it consists, not of wool, but of shoddv- a by-product-whic h can be purchased at a very low price. Then, again, many remnants are used in the cap-making industry-.",44
420,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,The honourable member wishes to encourage those who use that shoddy by imposing a duty of 150 per cent.,44
421,Mr SALMON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"The local manufacturer has to deal with things as he finds them. There is a demand for a certain class of goods,- ancl he has and will have to supply that' demand until under this new Tariff the people are taught to realise that if they wish to enjoy the true benefit of cheapness they must buy articles of good quality. It is .not always true economy to purchase an article at a low price.",44
422,Mr ATKINSON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Some men have onlysixpence in their pockets.,44
423,Mr SALMON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"They are catered for by the local manufacturer, who uses the imported shoddy tweeds I have referred to, ancl they will not suffer if we agree to the duties proposed.",44
424,Sir JOHN FORREST,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Le t us get to a vote. .,44
425,Mr SALMON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"The honourable member is not more anxious to go to a vote than I am. In this connection I may tell him something that happened under my own eyes recently. A Minister was temporarily absent from the chamber, and the Government whip, or, as I suppose I should call him,.the Secretary to the Cabinet, arranged so that the Opposition whip kept the debate going until the - Minister came back.",44
426,Mr KELLY,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Will the honourable member be good enough to say that again ?,44
427,Mr SALMON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"I cannot be blamed in the circumstances for saying a word or two on the question. We should not lose sight of the fact that these articles are made elsewhere, uncler conditions which we have no desire to see obtaining in Australia. .Tliey are landed at a very low cost, and the imposition of these duties would not increase the cost to the consumer.",44
428,Mr KELLY,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"I wish to make a personal explanation. The honourable member for Laanecoorie said he had seen the Government . whip and the Opposition whip making an arrangement to keep the debate going until a Minister, who was absent, returned to the chamber. The Government whip is present, and I now call upon him to say whether the statement made by the honourable member for Laanecoorie is not absolutely devoid of foundation?",45
429,Mr SALMON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"As a personal explanation, I may say that the Government whip might easily deny the statement made by the honourable ' member for Wentworth. I did not say that I had seen him make an arrangement with the Opposition whip. What' 1 said was that I knew that the Government whip desired that the debate should be kept going. - Mr KELLY - The honourable member said nothing like that.",45
430,Mr SALMON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"I - saw the honourable member for Wentworth jump into the breach, and make one of his .always interesting speeches, and from that I drew the inference that a friendly arrangement had been made with the honourable member to keep the debate going.",45
431,Mr HUME COOK,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"Perhaps I had better say that I made no arrangement with the Opposition whip. The arrangement I made was. with the. honourable member for Laanecoorie to keep the debate going for three minutes. As a matter of fact, however, it was not necessary that the honourable member should do-so, because the honourable member for Wentworth jumped into the breach and kept the debate going.",45

We have already accepted amendments requested by. the Senate in connection with duties' on hats, and I ture to say that we are now dealing with a branch of the industry which is just asimportant'. Last year caps were imported to the value of about £29,000. Some of these' caps were made by persons who received wages of only 3s. per week.",45

434,Mr COON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"^-In Great Britain. workers ir, the industry have also to work for from ten to twelve hours per day. These caps are sent out here invoiced at. per dozen. I ask honoiable members opposite, and especially the honourable member for Parramatta, who only a few months ago stated that the manufacturers of hats in the Old Country did not sweat their employees;, [377] but provided good wages and conditions, to say whether the same can be said' for the manufacturers of caps. Are they not aware that in Great Britain tp-day persons employed in this industry have to work from ten to twelve hours per day for 3s. per week ? .",45
435,Mr KELLY,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Is this a sweated industry all over the world ?,45
436,Mr COON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,It is not a sweated industry .in Victoria.,45
437,Mr KELLY,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Then we do not require a higher duty.,45
438,Mr COON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,Does the honourable member say. that we require a higher duty to prevent sweating?' Mr KELLY - Is it for the benefit of the. manufacturer ?,45
439,Mr COON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"It is to increase the opportunities for employment afforded to people here. When it is remembered thatpeople engaged in this industry, in Australia receive j£i per .week for work which is paid for in the Old Country at 3s. per week, it will be admitted that they require some protection. I ask any honourable member who desires to put down sweating, and amongst others the honourable member 'for Parramatta, not to allow the sweated goods of other countries to be imported - - ",45
440,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,How is it that apparel made in Great Britain under similar conditions is not made dutiable to the same extent?,45
441,Mr COON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,I . should altogether prohibit the importation of hats and caps and other apparel made under such conditions.,45
442,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,That is right; build a Chinese wall around Australia.,45
443,Mr COON,REGISTRATION OF MEDICAL,"The people of New South Wales desire that suchi a wall should be built. The Tariff has had such! an effect on the .prosperity of New South Wales, that on Monday last the Sydney trams carried ven- 580,000 people, or more than ever carried in a single day previously. New South Walesis prospering, and the people of that State are asking for more protection.",45
