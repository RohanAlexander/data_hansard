We are doing it to some extent how we handle them than we were, say, 10 repetitively to floods, I think we have to Councils have land banks. They can cut up Houses that are aesthetically pleasing can be notice that some were done like that in Brisbane there has to be some sort of buyback program to the new estate you will get perhaps a $115,000 or $120,000-not a mansion, but certainly people are coming out of.

But many Granthams, getting some of these towns false economy because when it does happen-and we all hop in and do it.

In Gippsland, unfortunately, we have had a time in the parliament we have dealt with significant now these bushfires. I would like to take the particular, both the paid emergency service Department of Sustainability and the Environment Authority-and the volunteers, whether they staff of the Wellington shire, the Department so badly affected by the 2011 flood. I thank people of Ipswich. I thank the council and the and their commitment and for the great time. I am with them, we are with them, we will by congratulating the member for Blair and they have already made during what I think this place to put on the public record their summer of natural disasters.

In my short floods, the Black Saturday bushfires and opportunity to thank the emergency services in people-the police, the ambulance, the and the paid staff within the Country Fire be with the SES or the CFA. I also thank the of Human Services and the Department of Primary Industries. It is an enormous contribution pulling together when we have these events. It is something that we should be very proud to help our fellow man in very difficult circumstances. organisational capacity and people ready professional people are there, the plans are volunteers who are just so desperate to get into thank, in the time. I have today, the local communities from not only the ABC but newspapers and television stations.

Members of my own brigade in my I think the community of firefighters are pretty that they did not have more people who wanted to go and help in Tasmania.

Obviously the national differently in each state and territory and going to be the last time we are going to be wish it were, but I do not think it will be. strong-lived experiences of how people manage and relief arrangements work or I think it is really important that we make sure we talk to the relevant ministers about happening and that we make policy adjustments the members from the many, many affected electorates, been affected by these national disasters.
