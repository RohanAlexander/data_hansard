To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament petition of the undersigned citizens showeth: That the plan to obUterate the traditional weights and measures of this country is causing and will cause widespread inconvenience, confusion, expense and distress. That there is no certainty that any significant benefits or any benefits at all will follow the use of the new weights and measures. That the traditional weights and measures are eminently PETITIONS satisfactory. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Metric Conversion Act be repealed, and that the take urgent steps to cause the traditional and familiar units to be restored in those areas where the greatest inconveniences and distress are occurring, that is to say, in Uranium meteorology, in road distances, in sport, in the building and allied trades, in the printing trade, and in retail trade.

Taxation: Education Expenses To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Pluhumble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the reduction of the allowable deduction of eduexpenses under Section 82 J of the Income Tax Assessment Act from $400 to $150 is $50 below the 1956/57 figure. That this reduction will impose hardships on many parents who have chUdren attending school, whether nongovernment or government; and particularly on parents with more than one child at school. That this reduction will further restrict the freedom available to parents to make a choice of school for their chUdren. That some parents who have chosen to send their children a non-government school will have to withdraw their children and send them to government schools already overcrowded and under-staffed. sure safeguards against the miliThat the parents to benefit most relatively from educational income tax deductions, in the past and even more in the future, are the parents of children in government schools and this has a divisive effect in the Australian community. act of self-preservation to deThat parents should be encouraged by the Australian government to exercise freedom of choice of the type of school they wish for their chUdren. The proposed reduction means an additionalfinancialpenalty is imposed on parents who try to exercise this choice and discourages them from making an importantfinancialcontribution to Australian education over and above what they contribute through taxation. That an alternative system, a taxrebatesystem, could be adopted as being more equitable for all parents with chilnational economic dren at school. To compensate for the losses that will follow from the proposed reduction and to help meet escalating educational costs faced by all families your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled should take immediate steps to restore educational benefits to parents, at least at the 1973/1974 level either by increasing taxation deductions or through taxation rebates.

NA NA",21
4,Mr SNEDDEN,WHITLAM MINISTRY,"I ask the Prime Minister Is correct that he said a fortnight ago words to effect: 'I will not pick on Mr Crean or anybody else. He has the responsibility in these matters, but I think he has been picked on far too much, quite obscenely.*? Presumably 'these matters' ties, were the highest inflation for 20 years and the highest unemployment for 25 years. Did the Prime Minister add words to this effect: 'I give no assurances or denials on this matter. There is nothing I have done or said that would justify speculation that Crean is going'? Will Prime Minister take this opportunity to state unequivocally his confidence in his Treasurer? Will he do so to end the uncertainty caused continual reports of his bungling attempt make the honourable member for Melbourne increase Ports, the Treasurer, the scapegoat for the econat omic disaster for which he, the Prime raisedpredominantly and the rest of the Cabinet must bear full responsibility?",21
5,Mr WHITLAM,WHITLAM MINISTRY,The quotations that the honourable gentleman has made are accurate. They stand and I have nothing to add to them. NA,21
6,Mr FULTON,SUGAR,"My question is directed to the Minister for Northern Development. Is it a fact that growing pressure and even criticism from overseas are being directed at Austraha for not more positive steps to expand the proof sugar in Australia, particularly in view of the serious world shortage of sugar and the in a abUity of some of the poorer importing countries into pay the current high world prices?",21
7,Dr PATTERSON,SUGAR,"It is a fact that the price of sugar on the world market has reached such heights that sugar is now being compared with gold. The price of sugar is, of course, quite unrealistic, whatever critieria one likes to use. situation has been caused purely by the function of demand and supply. There is a world shortage of sugar. I regret to say that the price of as sugar will go even higher and this will cause further disruption throughout the world's proand exporting countries. The problem is Custhat the amount of sugar traded on the world market in a so-caUed free market is relatively smaU. It is probably less than 10,000,000 tons. Consequently any relatively small variations in world supply can cause violent price movements to the degree that the price of sugar 6 or 7 or even 10 years ago reached £Stgl2 a ton, whereas today it is over $A1,000 a ton. Following our inability to get economic provisions put into the International Sugar Agreement at Geneva last year, I stated to various growers' meetings on my it return to Australia that I thought we should this increase production moderately within existing mill areas as distinct from a major expansion involving tremendous amounts of capital investment in new nulls, raUways, bulk storage facilietc. I must state however, that this matter of production within the State is the right of, is in the hands of, the Queensland Government, not will the Australian Government. I am happy to say that the Queensland Government has now decided that there should be an increase in, I think, the existing iruil areas. I believe this should have been done sometimeago because it will be 1976 before the first fruits of increased production are by borne. I assure the honourable member that the to Australian Government fully supports an in production within existing null areas the present time to overcome this very serious Minister, shortage on the world sugar scene.

8,Mr SNEBBEN,SUGAR,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Because of the hedging answer he has just given I ask the Prime Minister for the second andfinaltime to take this opportunity now to state unequivocally his confidence in the honourable member for Melbourne Ports as Treasurer and to say whether or not the Treasurer will be replaced. With unemployment at record levels and confidence at rock bottom, does he expect Australia to endure another week of indecision as to the future of the Treasurer? Is it a case of waiting until the Deputy Prime Ministerreturnsto Australia so that he can be sworn in as Treasurer?",22
9,Mr WHITLAM,SUGAR,My answer to the right honourable gentleman'sfirstquesdon was clear. I have nothing to add to it. NA,22
10,Mr JACOBI,TAXATION DEDUCTIONS,Can the Treasurer assure the House that the taxation deductions for gifts to charitable institutions and other prescribed causes will continue?,22
11,Mr CMEAN,TAXATION DEDUCTIONS,"I shall shortly be introducing into this House a Bill which will contain all the amendments to the income tax legislation in respect of the period ending 30 June 197S. There is no variation whatever in the provision about gifts. I want to take the opportunity to say that neither I nor any other Treasurer can give assurances into the future as to whether any particular deduction will remain as it is, be abolished or be varied. It would be completely irresponsible to do so. One can only judge the position as it is now and as it will be to 30 June 1975 by the legislation that will be introduced. There will be no variation in respect of gifts. NA NA",22
12,Mr ANTHONY,THE ECONOMY,I direct a question to the Prime Minister. I ask: Will he be making a statement on the economy? There have been many newspaper reports of such a statement. Will he make such a statement because he no longer has confidence in the Treasurer and the Treasurer will not have the responsibUity for such a statement?,22
13,Mr WHITLAM,THE ECONOMY,"As the Treasurer stated on Sunday night, I aim to make a statement at o'clock tonight. I will be seeking leave time to make it. I will be making the statement because it covers responsibUities of several isters. The Treasurer, of course, will later introducing any legislation or making any supplementary statements which faU within his portfolio. NA",22
14,Mr MCKENZIE,RADIATION LABORATORY,"I address a question to the Minister for Health. The Minister will be aware of thereporttabled in the House recently of the ParUamentary Standing Committee on PubUc Works concerning the proposed radiation laboratory. He will be aware also of the concern felt by some of my constituents about the project. Can he inform the House whether there has been an evaluation of the suggestions which I have made regarding the siting of the laboratory? If so, what has been the outcome of that consideration?",22
15,Dr EVERINGHAM,RADIATION LABORATORY,"The honourable member for Diamond VaUey has made representations to me concerning this matter. He will be aware of a Press release on the subject which pointed out that the siting was discussed by an aU-Party committee of this House-the Parliamentary Standing Committee on PubUc Works. That Committee conducted extensive investigations of the proposal, including pubUc hearings on 12 and 13 September last. The departments concerned gave evidence, as did other interested parties-for example, the Heidelberg City Council and the YaUambie Progress Association. It has been proposed, for example, that it could be sited on a less settled, less inhabited side of TuUamarine Airport, but the Committee had to consider things such as pubUc road access, pubUc transport and the distance from tertiary education institutions and also from the hospitals in Melbourne which use the products of the laboratory. I can assure those who have expressed concern about this siting that the danger will be even less than it is with the present siting of the laboratories in several different buUdings situated around Melbourne. There will be no risk of any significant level. In fact, the risk will be of the order of thousands oftimesless than that recommended as permissible by world organisations, even to a person who stood continuously at the boundary fence of the new site day and night. NA",22
16,Mr SINCLAIR,WHITLAM MINISTRY,"I ask the Treasurer. In the 8 Ught of my confidence in the Treasurer-as a at that man if not as Treasurer-in view of the uncertainties created by the responses given this Minmorning by the Prime Minister will he advise the be House whether he has any intention of resigning his portfolio or resigning from his seat of Melbourne Ports? If he has an intention of doing either, why has he developed that intention?",22
17,Mr CREAN,WHITLAM MINISTRY,I can give a very brief answer No. NA,23
18,Mr MARTIN,AUSTRALIAN PRESS,"My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Ivtinister for the Media. Has the Minister noted the biased reporting, particularly in the headlines, which unjustly reflects on the performance of this Government? Can the Minister confirm that this biased reporting is really an abuse of what is loosely called freedom of the Press? Can the Minister confirm also that most national, country and suburban newspapers are controUed by 4 newspaper barons? In view of this situation, can the Minister hold out any hope for the production of a national newspaper in competition with these 4 press barons which could give an unbiased poltiical view for the benefit of aU Australians?",23
19,Mr MORRISON,AUSTRALIAN PRESS,"Somebody once observed that freedom of the Press constitutes a situation where a millionaire owns 10 newspapers and a million people own none. I believe there is cause for concern by the general pubUc at the type of reporting that occasionaUy takes place. But I believe that this Government conforms very strongly to the concept of freedom of the Press. Honourable members wiU be aware also that the platform of the Labor Party caUs for the estabUshment of a newspaper commission. I understand this is being considered by my colleague, the Minister for the Media. I wiU undertake to advise the honourable gentleman on the progress of that consideration. NA",23
20,Mr LYNCH,WHITLAM MINISTRY,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister and foUows earUer questions addressed to the Prime Minister concerning position of the Treasurer. I ask the honourable gendeman specifically: Has he or, on his behalf, one of his intermediaries offered the Treasurer an alternative portfoUo? Has he offered the Treasurer a non-parUamentary appointment?",23
21,Mr WHITLAM,WHITLAM MINISTRY,No; no. NA,23
22,Mr GARLAND,WHITLAM MINISTRY,"I address my question to the Prime Minister. In view of the economic crisis in Australia-mountin g unemployment and price to rises, with worse in sight-and his admitted of expertise in economic matters, and as the Prime Minister has often prided himself on being a good Australian, will he now serve the best interests of the country by stepping down as Prime Minister to make way for the Deputy Prime Minister, Dr JF CAIRNS, the only Labor Minister who takes a close and consistent interest in the critical economic areas of government responsibiUty?",23
23,Mr WHITLAM,WHITLAM MINISTRY,This question catches me by surprise. I ask that it be put on notice. NA,23
24,Mr REYNOLDS,COMPANY TAX,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Will compames experiencing Uquidity problems or difficult trading conditions be entitled to apply for deferment of their quarterly tax commitments now due? If so, will companies granted such concession be Uable for any penalty for such deferment?",23
25,Mr CREAN,COMPANY TAX,"Companie s Uke any other taxpayers, individuals or businesses, can apply for an extension oftimefor payment of any UabiUty. I repeat that the quarterly instalment for company tax is legally due and payable, and in many cases the assessments have already issued. As I indicated here the other day, if any company experiences difficulty it can apply for an extension of time which, at the discretion of the Commissioner of Taxation, may or may not be granted with or without penalty. NA",23
26,Mr KING,WORLD FOOD SHORTAGE,"My question to the Prime Minister foUows upon a statement made by him recently to the United Nations to the effect that Australia would do aU possible to help in easing the present world food shortage. I ask the Prime Minister Has the Australian Government made to needy countries any offers of assistance in the form of meat or meat products that appear to be surplus to our present requirements both at home and on the recognised export markets? If it has not made any such offers of assistance, can he the inform the House of the reasons?",23
27,Mr WHITLAM,WORLD FOOD SHORTAGE,"In addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations I did refer to the food situation facing so many vast areas in the world. I also discussed the matter in Washington, amongst others with the new President who had himself raised the matter in addressing the General Assembly. The honourable gentleman mentioned the position of meat in particular. The Government has considered this question. However, there are great difficulties in providing meat these countries. First, there has to be an approlack priate means of transport between Australia and the countries concerned. Secondly, there has to be an appropriate means of handling the meatrefrigeration, storage and distribution- when it gets to the countries concerned. Unfortunately it is true that there are no regular transport links in respect of meat between Australia and the countries facing famine and drought. The handling of meat is clearly a very specialised problem and whereas for generations, for over 100 years, we have had such provision for transporting meat between Australia and Britain and for the last decade or so for transferring meat between Australia and North America or Japan, those being the largest export markets by tradition or by expectation, we do not have such means of transport with the countries affected by drought and famine and they do not have, the means for storage and distribution of meat. The Government is able to make arrangements for transporting and distributing other foodstuffs which axe not so specialised in the forms of handling and distribution-in particular grains. The Government has done a great deal in this respect already, as I expect the honourable gentleman is already aware. We have a regular Food Aid Convention commitment of 225,000 tonnes which is valued in excess of $30m. Our allocation to the world food program is $950,000. From the $40m committed to the United Nations Special Program we have allocated 100,000 tonnes of wheat with freight paid worth approximately $20m. Part of these freight charges may be paid by the United Nations Special Program, in which case the saving will be devoted to further purchases of wheat. In all, we expect in thisfinancialyear to give approximately 375,000 tonnes of food aid. In his speech to the World Food Conference in Rome last week, the Minister for Agriculture, Senator Ken Wriedt, told the conference of Australia's recognition that the world food situation is extremely difficult and will require cooperative action from both food exporters and other developed countries. Senator Wriedt on behalf of the Government committed Australia to making provision comparable to that being made by Canada, West Germany and Sweden. Senator Wriedt assured the Food Conference that Australia would play its part in meeting the food crisis. The details of allocation of this mitment are still under study. NA",23
28,Mr SCHOLES,GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE,"Has the Prime Minister consideration to proposals for an 8 per cent across-the-board reduction in all forms of government expenditure? Have the Premiers Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland indicated their support for such cuts in allocations to the States which represent close to 40 per cent of Commonwealth expenditure? What effect would such cuts have on areas such as education, social services, and health, as well as the inflationary situation of the State Budgets?",24
29,Mr WHITLAM,GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE,"The Government, of course, regularly considers the effect of government expenditure which it undertakes in its own right or which it undertakes through the States or local government. The honourable member correcdy points out that the increase in government expenditure by the States is very much greater than the increase in government expenditure by the Australian Government, the respective percentages being somewhere about 39 per cent and 32 per cent in the presentfinancialyear. There are very many persons who claim that Australian government expenditure should be reduced or should not grow as fast as it is, and among the persons who make that assertion are some State Premiers. They never make the same claim as regards their own expenditures or each other's expenditures. The fact is that any reduction in government expenditure, particularly in the fields which the honourable gentleman mentions, would in fact have a very great impact on private expenditure, investment and employment. It is the last tiling which any government should be contemplating at the present moment. If there were any reductions in the programs which this Government has initiated and with which it is pressing forward in education, health centres, transport and in general respect to urban and regional development, the people who would be hit most would be the people providing the supplies and services for those government expenditures which my Government has initiated. NA",24
30,Dr FORBES,UNEMPLOYMENT,I address my question to the Prime Minister. Has he said that a Labor Government would never deUberately create unemployment as an instrument of economic policy? Is his Government presiding over by far the highest rate of unemployment for more than 30 com- years? Does he believe that the army of unemployed men and women will be consoled by the fact that they have been thrown out of work as a result of the incompetence and economic mismanagement ofhis Government rather than as a given deUberate act of poticy?,24
31,Mr WHITLAM,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The people in the comof munity for whom the honourable gentleman is showing such soUcitude will be consoled, and he liimself undoubtedly will be frustrated, when they hear my statement at 8 o 'clock tonight. NA",24
32,Mr YOUNG,QUEENSLAND ELECTIONS,"The Minister for Services and Property would be aware that the senior partner of the Queensland coalition Government received 19 per cent of the votes in the last Queensland election. Could the Minister inform the House whether the same system, which denies both the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party a proper say in that State, will survive for the next elections?",25
33,Mr DALY,QUEENSLAND ELECTIONS,"Mr Speaker, before I answer the question I seek the indulgence of the House for a few moments to thank you, members from both sides of the Parliament, members of various staffs and officials for the condolences sent to me in respect of my recent unfortunate accident. I extend my thanks particularly to the honourable member for Moreton who, one night very late when I was struggling against the effects of sleeping drug, endeavoured to recent National Compensation Bill which was before the House. His consoling and cultured voice sent me off much quicker than the sleeping drug. I thank him for his good wishes. In answer to the honourable member for Port Adelaide let me say that it is true that the Queensland Premier survives on 19 per cent the votes of the guided democracy known as Queensland. I understand that on occasion both the Liberal Party and the Labor Party got more votes than the Country Party obtained less seats. The Labor Party, with more votes than any of the other parties, got less than the other parties combined. I know that great democrat who leads Queensland hopes that his 19 per cent of the vote wiU continue. doubtedly he is quite confident of success cause even a most unskilled poUtician ought be able to win if he requires only 19 per cent the votes. Any person who administers a system which aUows a person to survive as Premier of State on that basis undoubtedly would want continuation of that state of affairs as well another election. I am quite confident that Queensland people have awakened to the fact that they are governed by a minority and wiU flock overwhelmingly to the cause of Labor. can assure them that under the democratic progoing. posals of the present Whitlam Government such a state of affairs wiU never happen in the Federal arena where people wiU have to get the majority of the votes to get the results that are necessary any democracy, and that is democratic majority rule. NA",25
34,Mr ANTHONY,CANNED MEAT,"My question, which is directed to the Prime Minister, is supplementary to the question asked by the honourable member for Wimmera. The Prime Minister pointed out correctly that meat was a difficult commodity for food aid because it required refrigeration. I ask the Prime Minister whether his Government will give consideration to aUowing canned meat and brine processed meat to be part of food aid. I ask this question because in many meat works around Australia today low quaUty meat cuts are now going into meat meal. It seems a shocking situation that, in a country which is a great food producer of protein, meat of this type is going mto meat meal processes when people around the world desperately need the meat. If the Government could give consideration to helping finance the canning process as well as aiding export sales it would be of considerable help.",25
35,Mr WHITLAM,CANNED MEAT,I certainly will have cona sideration given to therighthonourable gentleinclude me in the man's suggestion. MINERALS: EXPORT PRICES,25
36,Mr MORRIS,CANNED MEAT,"I ask the Minister for Minerals and Energy: What has been the effect on State Government finances of the Australian Government's action in obtaining higher export prices of for minerals such as coal? Further, has there been an increased demand for employees in the the last extracted mineral industries?",25
37,Mr CONNOR,CANNED MEAT,"The position is that in but Queensland from 1 January 1973 to the end of September last the additional price obtained for seats exports of coal wiU have been of the order of $ 1,860m. In the case of New South Wales it has been much less than that, but very substantial Unindeed. I can only repeat what I said in the House bequite recently: In future Australia rides not on to the sheep's back but on the coal truck. With of regard to the future, we have had clear indications from Japanese consumers not only of an a increase in the demand for coking coal but also a for a commencing and growing demand for as steaming coal. I am in touch at present with the the Joint Coal Board and also the appropriate mining unions to see what can be done in the way of a substantial increase in the labour force in the I coal industry. We know clearly where we are We know that we can plan and we can organise systematicaUy to ensure that Australia, at least in respect of coal exports and within the Umits of its known reserves, can make a very in notable contribution to the welfare and the prosperity of Japan and quite a number of countries in Europe. NA",25
38,Mr HOWARD,ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES,"My question is directed to the Minister for Services and Property and is supplementary to that asked by the honourable member for Port Adelaide. Can the Minister assure the House that in view ofhis emphatic endorsement of the principle of properly drawn electoral boundaries his Government will dissociate itself from the submission lodged with the New South Wales Electoral Commissioners by the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party and which if implemented would produce, on the basis of the 1974 election results, 29 ALP seats out of 45 in New South Wales and, in percentage terms, 64 per cent of the seats in New South Wales although that Party in the May election polled a mere 52 per cent to 53 per cent of the primary votes? (Honourable members interjecting)",26
39,Mr SPEAKER,ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES,Order! This is a very serious matter.,26
40,Mr DALY,ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES,"As the honourable member has stated, a redistribution is under consideration in all States except Western Australia. In accordance with the Act any individual, Party or organisation is permitted to make submissions to the Electoral Commissioners in respect of what they think the changes should be or whether there should be any changes at all. I understand that the time for submissions closed about a fortnight ago and comments are now invited on them. Any person is quite free to make any kind of submission, which will be considered. The honourable member has given an analysis, he said, of the submission by the Australian Labor Party. I do not accept his analysis because I know it to be completely inaccurate and false in every way and consequently ultimately without basis. I know that the Liberal Party made a submission that would give it 26 or 27 seats in New South Wales, two or three of them at the expense of its coalition partner, including the seat of the honourable member for Hume. I have looked at the proposal. In the Liberal Party's endeavour to bring in a gerrymander it went quite outside the scope of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and endeavoured to divide New South Wales into regions to suit the Liberal Party's point of view. Anybody who knows the Commonwealth Electoral Act knows that under the Commonwealth Electoral Act the Commissioners do not go by regions; they must divide the State into 45 divisions. The Labor Party's policy, endorsed by a Joint Sitting of this Parliament, supports the principle of one vote one value and the submissions made by the Australian Labor Party are on that basis. The fact that the Liberal members opposite and members of the Liberal Party seek to falsify the submissions does not do them any credit. Comments are invited on these matters and they will not doubt be made public in due course. But I have enough confidence in the integrity of the Commissioners to know that they will decide justly and properly in accordance with the high standard of their responsibilities and without being influenced even by infamous suggestions made by the Liberal Party. RAILWAY ROLLING-STOCK",26
41,Mr MATHEWS,ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES,Is the Minister for Transport aware of the enormous number of would be railway passengers who are being turned away from Australian railways by the antiquated conditions of passenger rolling-stock? Can he give the would be passengers any encouragement in the form of a progress report on the development of the Australian passenger train? Can he say when this train is likely to come into service and whether its development has been supported by all State Ministers for Transport?,26
42,Mr CHARLES JONES,ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES,"The Government is concerned with the standard of public transport in capital cities and cities with a population in excess of 100,000. For this reason we have already committed $138m to finance programs which will total $207m. The money has been allocated to carry out all sorts of improvements to the transport system. We are now experimenting with the development of an Australian urban passenger train which will incorporate all the latest modern train techniques. A mock-up of the interior of a carriage has been displayed in Adelaide, Perth, and Melbourne and is in Sydney at the moment. It will shortly be displayed in Brisbane. Approximately 300,000 people have already inspected this mock-up. Numerous people have expressed their opinions of the various configurations. This is part of the market research we are doing to deterrnine just what sort of carriage should be developed. Up to this point, all the State Ministers for Transport have co-operated. In every city where the display has been set up, we have had to seek and have obtained their co-operation and assistance in setting it up for public inspection. The carriage was built at the Islington railway workshops in Adelaide. Stage 1 has been approved by all the Ministers. Stage 2 is under consideration.

62,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I have received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The tragic and unnecessary human suffering and national setback resulting from record and rising unemployment caused by the Government and its failure to adopt the rect policies to cure it. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion torisein their places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places)",29
63,Mr SNEDDEN,UNEMPLOYMENT," Mr Speaker, unemployment has reached out to 3 per cent of the Australian work force, and that is at a minimum. One hundred and ninety thousand people are the certain victims of a leaderless, incompetent, insensitive, smug and crippled government. Thousands more are not registered: Women, juniors, executives, salesmen, typists, clerks have yet to register. Their pride will wilt as their personal position worsens. These people and the 190,000 people of whom I have spoken who are unemployed are destined to be followed by tens of thousands more unemployed over the next months. The awful tragedy is that this should never have happened. The social and economic scars yet to be etched on the face of this Government will disfigure its reputation for generations. Three times in the past 40 years Australia has been struck by employment of the magnitude we are facing today. Some still remember the massive unemployment of the late 1920s and the early 1930s-the great depression. That was under a Labor Government. More remember the great unemployment of the immediate postSecond World War years and the accompanying controls and constraints on the individual. That was under a Labor Government. Now we have record and rising unemployment today, again under a Labor Government. The Australian Labor Party is sinking for the thirdtimeunder the weight of its own unemployment-causing policies. Historically it has confirmed itself as the Party of unemployment in Australia. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard Press Statement No. 26 of 1974 from the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) entitled 'Provisional Commonwealth Employment Service Statistics October 1974' and the attached tables.",29
64,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)The labor market continued to deteriorate during October. The rate at which unemployment increased accelerated sharply and there were indications that a wider range of industry was affected than in previous months. As in August and September the increase was more marked in metropolitan than in non-metropolitan areas. In seasonally adjusted terms the total number of persons corregistered for employment at the end of October was 169,542. These are provisional figures and exclude schoolleavers. The actual number of school-leavers registered for employment at the end of October was 3,678. However, it is now possible to give a seasonally adjusted figure for school-leavers according to the new adjustment factors for the school-leaver component which has been made available by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This figure at the end of October was 19,704, giving a seasonally adjusted total (including school-leavers) of 189,246. This is the first time that we have been able to provide figures based upon this new seasonal adjustment factor for the school-leaver component and in future, these will be used to give a total seasonally adjusted figure. In actual, as distinct from seasonally adjusted terms, the number of persons registered for employment at the end of October increased by 28,742 (23.8 per cent) to 149,701 or 2.52 per cent of the estimated labor force. This includes the 3,678 school-leavers actually registered for employment. Seasonally adjusted unfilled vacancies declined by 4,966 (12.1 per cent) to 36,236 as against falls of 6,984 (14.5 per cent) in September and 12,739 (20.9 per cent) in August. Actual unfilled vacancies declined by 1,217 (3.0 per cent) to 40,036. Seasonally adjusted average hours of overtime worked per employee in the Department's Monthly Survey declined from 3.3 hours in August to 3.1 hours in September. At end-October, there were 430 persons employed on projects commenced under the RED Scheme. The numbers in each State were New South Wales 168, Victoria 119, Queensland 65, South Australia 16, Western Australia 40, and Tasmania 22. As more than 400 proposals under the Scheme have now been approved at an estimated total cost of more than SlOm, it can be expected that the numbers of employed on projects will increase markedly in the months ahead.

65,Mr SNEDDEN,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Those are the official figures of only. Last month, when the official figures revealed that 130,000 Australians were out of work in September, we had estimates by trade union leaders, business leaders and private emister ploymentfirmsthat an extra 70,000 people were unemployed and that the true unemployment figure was closer to 200,000. the same test that the realfiguretoday of the number of people unemployed in Australia is quarter of a million.

And the quarter after that there may be no great improvement. That is committing us, as Australian people, to 6 months of this hellish situation. The Prime Minhas abdicated. He says that nothing can be done for 6 months. That is a policy of defeat and despair which the Liberal-Country Parties comWe can assume on pletely reject. During its inglorious term of office the a Government had made countless errors. There have been 4 great errors of policy which have led that directly and inevitably to the unemployment crisis. They are: Firstly, the explosion of Governspending, beginning in the first half of 1973 and continuing tlirough 2 Budgets. That was to the young voters. Secondly, the explosion of wage rises triggered by its adoption of the pacesetter principle in the Commonwealth PubService. That was to win union votes. Thirdly, there was the 25 per cent across-the-board tariff With cut. That was to win the consumer votes. there was the savage and prolonged credit squeeze. That was to win contempt for ever more from those who are unemployed. By those 4 home-grown deliberate acts the Governfor ment has created the twin tragedies of mass unemployment and uncontrolled inflation. In a short 23 months it has achieved stagflation in Mr Chipp-It is not easy to do.",31
66,Mr SNEDDEN,UNEMPLOYMENT,"It is not easy to do. One wonders whether is would have been able to do if it had deliberately set out to try to achieve it.

'If there is also a rise in imports as a result cuts there could well be a recession', Mr Snedden said. He said he would not estimate the potential number of unthe employed because he did not want to make the sort of projections made by the Minister for Labour at the end oflast year, which turned out to be so wrong. Mr Snedden said the economic situation in December 1972 was one of relatively stable ployment. 'During the whole of 1972, the Consumer Price Index risen by 4.5 per cent,' Mr Snedden said. 'Prices are now rising, after 11 months of Labor Government, at a rate exceeding 14 per cent a year'. haverisenat a rate of 10.6 per cent between the quarter oflast year and the September quarter of this year', he said. He said that by the middle of this year it was becoming quite apparent that inflation was rapidly accelerating and remedial measures were needed-the Government's top and economic advisers had told it so. 'They told the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and all the Ministers that aresponsiblebudget was required.' Ministers then totally ignored that advice and buding.' for a record 19 per cent increase in government spendwith this the Government's advisers then told the that because this would mean a huge increase in the public sector's demand on resources they would have to * take measures to cut back private sector demand,' he said.

Whitlam increased some tax rates in the budget, but as they were taxes on petrol and tobacco, they simply added will produce to price increases.' 'Dr Coombs, his personal economic adviser, has advised days him to increase income tax rates, as well.' The Prime Minister has not yet done that, but he has refused to give an assurance that he won't, although in his policy speech he promised not to increase any tax rates,' Mr resorting to unemploySnedden said. He said the second way to go about hitting the private secwas through monetary policies-by increasing interest 'This the Government has done on a massive scale,' Mr Snedden said. long-term bond rate is now 8.5 per cent-up about 2.5 per cent in the last 7 months.' overdraft rate is 9.5 per cent, and the borrowing rate investment in factories, plant and equipment is ask for leave to even higher,' he said. said shortages are occurring throughout the economy and supplies, where they are available, are cripplingly expensive. interest rates rise by this much they make it more expensive for people to borrow and they savagely decrease the value of holdings of'financial' assets,' he said. The Reserve Bank, on October 19th, told the private banks to cut back on their lending activities-'until it hurts'.

'In other words, people are going to be forced to reduce of Labor's tariff their spending,' Mr Snedden said. Mr Snedden said that if unemployment was to be avoided rate of expansion of liquidity, or the money supply, irresponsible needed to be gradually reduced.

He also urged cut backs in the rate at which the Governhad ment'sfinancialtransacuons were adding to the money supply. 'The Government appears to be toying with the idea of further tax increases', he said. 'We would reduce the level of government spending, and we would cut spending on such subjects as natural gas pipelines', he said. 'This is a project for the private sector'. Mr Snedden said the Liberal Party would bring in a responsible, overall programme of economic management. 'We would supplement that programme with a temporary freeze on prices and incomes.' ' We agree with the unanimous opinion of economists permanent controls over prices and incomes cannot control inflation,' Mr Snedden said. ' What is needed is a proper demand management policy'. 'We would call a nadonal conference of the State ments, the unions and employers to get agreement on the guidelines for the right anti-inflation programme,' Mr Snedden said.",32

The credit squeeze must be ended and that interest rates must be slashed so that people can obtainfinanceto biuid their houses. Those members of the Government who have shown concern at the effects of the 25 per cent across the Governboard tariff cut decision have been ridiculed as 'nervous NelUes' and 'pedlars of lies' by the Prime Minister. We have heard much from the Government about lags in economic policy. The Minister has said that the situation cannot thatimprove for 6 months. Why was the economy allowed to deteriorate to this point when the Department of Labor and Immigration has been estimating for months that unemployment would rise as much as it has. Why was no action taken when the Minister for Labor and Immigration can wrote to the Treasurer urging a change of pricourse? Why was no action taken when the Minfor Social Security, Mr Hayden, warned that the Government was presiding over the destrucwUl tion of the Australian economy? Nowadays he not get a single vote in the Caucus because to restore he spoke out at that time. This Government did nothing untU the unemI ploymentfiguresbecame so bad that the trade year.unions threatened to withdraw their support the Party. How sickening it is to read in the a Press of a trade union secretary saying: 'Last we gave $30,000 to Labor Party funds. Unit does what we teU it to do, we will not give it a razoo next year'. The Government has done nothing until the unions have threatened them. At the weekend we were even treated to the spectacle of the Prime Minister of this country going the to the home of the President of the Australian of Trade Unions. He debased the office. was Uke Arthur Calwell waiting in the bushes the Hotel Kingston. The Prime Minister of full emis the man who asked in June: Does anyone really believe that the Australian Labor which owes it existence and survival to wage and salary earners, would pursue policies designed to put those out of work? This is the man who described income tax cuts as economic vandalism. It is he who stands condemned and discredited, pandered to only by the sycophants who surround him. He cannot even knife his Treasurer cleanly. That is a bloody mess. The Prime Minister's days will be haunted by job queues and disguised dole payments. This is a Government and a Leader of Government failed.",33
72,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE," I always admire the sense of drama of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) and how he can work himself into a state of false dignity-o r should I say false indignation rather than false dignity because his dignity, I think, is perhaps not as false as his indignation. What the House has been told by the right honourable gentleman is that the Government deliberately set about to create unemployment. That, as everyone knows, is just not true. Of all the Parties that operate in Australia, the Australian Labor Party is the one which is dedicated to the objective of full employment. It always has been and it always will be. No other Party has such afirmcommitment to full employment as does the Australian Labor Party. The fact of the situation is that in all industrialised nations of the Western world the same problem that we face-risin g innation and rising unemployment-is being faced. No country knows the answer to this problem. If any country does, it has kept that answer from even itself. No industrialised country in the Western world has discovered how to provide for a situation in which unemployment and inflation are rising.",34

75,Mr SPEAKER,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,"That is not a point of order, as the right honourable member knows.",34
76,Dr FORBES,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,There are a quarter of a million unemployed.,34

80,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,"I was talking about the problem that faces the whole of the industrialised Western world. Like all these other countries, Australia has been caught in the twin delemma ofrisinginflation and rising unemployment. This is reflected in the recent statement by the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund who said that the world is facing the most difficult combination of economic policy decisions since the reconstruction period following World War II. The problem we have is world-wide, namely, an accelerating rate of inflation due to factors outside the control of individual governments, and which has tended to become accelerated through sequential but accelerating wage costs. Put in another way, all efforts to combat inflation and hold it to a reasonable level, let alone pull it back, have in one way or another an unfavourable effect on the level of economic activity and on employment itself. In essence, all countries in the Western world are engaged in a juggling act. Obviously we have attempted to curb inflation with as tittle effect as possible on employment. In anticipation that some unemployment could occur we have tried to devise and to implement suitable manpower programs to provide appropriate relief for those unfortunate people who have had to be laid off. Unfortunately these measures with respect to inflation take time and often there is an impatience among observers when the effect of these measures is not instant. I want to contrast the philosphy of the present Government with the position of the Leader of the Opposition, who has just spoken, and his Party. When Liberal and Country Party governments in the past were faced with high inflation, as in 1951-52, 1960-61 and 1971-72, their response was deliberately to induce unemployment. The Leader of the Opposition has, of course, denied that his policies included the creation of unemployment but I can prove, as I will do in a moment, that this is precisely what his policies deliberately set out to do. Fortunately we are able to assess his now hollow promise of attempting to look after unemployment and his promises of what can be expected from a Liberal-Country Party government, because we ought to remember- I want honourable members to take special notice of the date-that on 15 April 1971, just before the horror Budget of 1971, the right honourable gentleman is on record as saying: Every country which has created or permitted unemployment as a weapon against inflation has failed miserably. We take full employment as a cardinal act of political faith and we will not resort to unemployment to achieve our objective. In the interests of open government I propose to read from a minute that was sent to my immediate predecessor, Mr Lynch, who was then the Mmister for Labour and National Service. This minute to the then Minister was about the Budget proposals that were then being put forward by the government. It stated: The second and more implicit assumption is in the labour marketThat means unemploymentMr Chipp- Mr Speaker, Iriseon a point order. I do not know what is in the minute and I rise before the Minister reads it to establish a depressed. point of principle. Has the Minister obtained the permission of the honourable member for It Flinders to disclose the contents of this minute the House before so disclosing them?",34
81,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,The answer is that I have obtained the permission,35
82,Mr SPEAKER,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,It is not a matter for the Chair to decide.,35
83,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,That isright.I give the assurance that I have obtained the permisshould sion of the Minister for Labor and Immigration to quote this minute. He happens to be the son in charge of these records just now.,35
84,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,I rise on a point of theit amounts order. May I take it that when we return to power Is shortly all the private correspondence between going present Ministers will be available to us for with respect tabling in the Parliament?,35
85,Mr SPEAKER,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,That is not a point of order; is a point of view.,35
86,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,"The minute states: The second and more implicit in the labour market would not be undesirable because beneficial effects on inflationary psychology, industrial rest and the willingness of employers to grant increases . . . Our view is that the Budget is more flationary than was necessary. It is our view that this overshoots the mark and labour market will ease significantlyThis means unemployment will get very muchposing worseespecially in the second half of the year. That was the second half of 1971-72. It conceiving tinues: If you are asked a question Budget on the level of unemployment or so, I would suggest a reply Government should be judged on its record. For the last 7 or 8 years the Australian economy has maintained a steady rate of economic growth with rates of unemployment (1 to 144 per cent) which are the envy of many industrialised countries. I am confident that we can maintain our good record. However I am not prepared to forecast to a precise decimal point what proportion of the labour force will be registered as unemployed a year from now. (The currentfigureis 1.2 per cent actual or 1.3 per cent seasonally adjusted). Even with thefinesteconomic management in the world, it is not possible to make such precise prognostications.' While the Department of Labour and National Service was giving that advice to its Minister, the present Leader of the Opposition, who was then the Treasurer, 9 months later in reviewing his that an easing disastrous 1971 Budget and the dismal unemployment figures, which then showed 120,574 people registered for employment-that of is actual numbers-proudl y declared: We have achieved what we set out to do in that we have created an environment in which over-award payments are is clear that the Opposidon parties believe into deliberately setting out to achieve unemployment as a means of dealing with inflation. Part of the cure that the Opposition now puts forward for the present situation is that the Government should drastically cut, or cut by 8 per cent which is a drastic cut, government expenditure; but it studiously avoids telling the country which areas of government expenditure suffer the axe. Is the Opposition going to cut health costs? Does it intend to cut the peramounts that the Government has budgeted for in social service payments? Does it intend to cut we have budgeted for in education? going to cut State grants? Is it going to cut the amounts we have set aside for housing? Is it to cut the amounts we have budgeted for to roads, shipping and transport generally? Does it intend to cut urban and it regional development expenses? Is it going to reduce the Public Service and cut the wages of public servants? It has direct power under the assumption is that an easing law to do this. Is it going to reduce repatriation of its benefits? Until the Opposition comes clean on unthe precise areas in which it proposes to exercise wage a cut in expenditure every area is entitled to deassume that it will be the one that will suffer a cut. Until the Opposition says what total savings that the will be made by those cuts every one in the community is entitled to assume that what it is prois an amount that will be either infinitesimal or else disastrously large to a point where people who have now become accustomed to resocial security benefits and the kind of government support which I think they are now about the possible effects of the coming to expect, will no longer be able to get in the next 12 months this support. along the following lines: 'The The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) will make an economic statement to the Parliament tonight. It will be one of the most profound statements ever delivered in this Parliament. It will have an electrifying effect upon the economy. It will cause great distress to members of the Opposition Parties because the thing that the Opposition wants least of all is an upswing in the economy; the thing that it wants least of all is an improvement in the employment position. Noththis ing gives the Opposition greater joy than to disthis cover an increase in the unemployment figures released each month. Members of the Oppowe sition do not care. It does not worry them that when one talks of statistics one is talking about people. It does not worry them when the unemconfidence ploymentfiguresgo up we are concerned not only with statistics but also with human beings who are being made to suffer.",35

Unemployment is increasing and is conthis tinuing to increase all around the world and inflation is going with it. At least we are trying desperately to find the answer. We are not deliberately planning unemployment as the position Parties did when they were in Governcriminate ment.",36
94,Mr SPEAKER,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,Order! The Minister's time has expired.,36
95,Mr ANTHONY,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,"We have been listening to the high priest of the Australian Labor Party who is responsible for the highest rate of unemployment that this country has since the depression. He pontificates in a manner which must be disturbing to every unemployed person in Australia as well as to the members this Parliament. He is quite unmoved and quite unashamed of what the Government has done to country during the last 20 months. We on side of the House believe in full employment. We have demonstrated during a long period that know how to manage the economy, that we know the delicate balances that are required to give a free enterprise economy stimulus, to give it and to give job opportunities to the people. But this Government, with all its new petty, new-fangled ideas and ideologies had created the greatest confusion in government that this country has seen. The is made up of people who are nothmore than a lot of wild Indians galloping in all directions causing the greatest cavalcade of confusion that the country has seen. This situation will not be corrected until some basic guidelines are put down in every area of administration that industry desperately wants. The Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Cameron) is the Minister who not so many honourmonths ago was saying that wages do not increase prices. It appears to me that the penny what has dropped all of a sudden because now he is a starting to recognise that it is inflation, it is the cost-push coming from increased wages that is depriving businesses of the opportunity to employ people. He hasfinallyrealised that wages have outstripped productivity and that there has to be a bit of sanity and a realisation of the basic facts. The Labor Party, which claims It to look after the ordinary working man and woman of this country, has betrayed them. It is quite insensitive now to the action it has taken. . its One action taken by the Government which down has caused unemployment was the revaluation the currency. The Opposition criticised the Government on 3 occasions last year for taking action. But the Government went ahead and revalued the currency and made it difficult for industries to compete against imports. Then, in a most academic way the Government cut tariffs Opacross the board. The Government did not disand did not ascertain what the impact would be on the motor industry or the textile industry. Instead it was quite happy to take this step because it thought that this was the way to curb private investment and the private sector of economy. Of course, the Government has not curbed its reckless spending which has been made on the basis that the sky is the limit. There has been no realisation that ultimately there is a seen time of judgment and that inflation basically stems from the Government's attitude to spending. The Government has taken steps to dampen of down the private sector of the economy and to stimulate the public sector. But what has this done? It has completely dashed confidence in an area in which people are now holding back or are incapable of being able to invest to create more job opportunities. The Government has indulged in a slanging match in respect of foreign investment, multinational companies, farmers and the rnining industry. But now we have the almost absurd and ludicrous situation of the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS) going overseas cap in hand to beg the Arab countries of all people to invest money here. He is even asking the great Japanese multi-national motor car companies to come in and take over Chrysler. What hypocrisy we are seeing from this Government. It just shows you how insincere it is at election time when it peddles emotive issues knowing full well that it is only Uving for the moment. But ultimately there will be a time ofjudgment and the time of judgment is coming because Australia is now suffering severe unemployment which will get worse as time goes on. At the moment on a seasonally adjusted basis 190,000 people or 3.2 per cent of the work force are unemployed. But we know that the real figure is vastly greater than that because thefigureI have just mentioned does not include people such as women who are out of the work force or people who are waiting for a job or new school leavers who have not been able to register. It is anticipated that 350,000 people, or about 6 per cent of the Australian work force, wiU be out of a job by January. Such a level of unemployment is quite intolerable in this countiy. We have never heard of such a level. This Government ought to resign. This Minister who claims to have a close Uaison with the trade unions and who says that he can manage the trade union movement ought to resign. He is certainly showing Uttle sympathy for the unemployed people across this country. There are areas in my own electorate which already have unemployment rates higher than 6 per cent. The Septemberfiguresshow that the employment rate for Casino is 7.8 per cent and that the rate in Lismore is 6 per cent. This rate is going up dauy as businessesfindthat as a result of the tight Uquidity situation and inflation they have to tighten down and they just cannot employ people. What the Government must reaUse is that if there is to be confidence in the private sector there has to be a capacity to make a profit. There is nothing wrong with profit, although this Government seems to have a hang-up on this question. There is nothing wrong or Ulegal about profit. The whole situation is made ludicrous by the way in which the Government is sooling on the Prices Justification Tribunal to ensure that businesses make a very minimum of profit. Big business cannot continue to re-invest unless it enjoys a degree of profit. When Broken HU1 Pty Co. Ltd has to go begging to the Tribunal 4 times in a year to try to get a reasonable profit, how can it manage to continue an investment program which is absolutely vital for this country? I read in the Press today that Kraft Foods Ltd went to the Tribunal early this year and received an increase of 4 per cent. Today, aU of a sudden and for some unknown reason, the Prices Justification Tribunal is to give it a 13.4 per cent increase. There are other factors apart from this. I refer to the Industries Assistance Commission, which is a complete misnomer-it should be caUed by other names-whic h the Prime Minister has been backing to the hilt. The organisation does not seem to recognise that one of its main charters is the protection of Australian industry to create job opportunities for people. It does not need to give over protection, but it should give reasonable protection. Because of the way this organisation is working, most of the industries in country areas are suffering. Examples are the textile industry, which is in a panic situation, and the clothing industry. A bigfirmUke EmaU Ltd does not know where it stands with the production of compressors, yet it employs 500 people. Somehow or other confidence has to be instilled into the community again. But confidence is not instUled in the community when the Prime Minister, in a most undignified manner, goes down and confers with the head of the trade union movement in Australia, Mr Hawke, to find out what he ought to do. Goodness me, where is the leadership of this country? Where are the government departments which are the respositories of all wisdom and all knowledge as to how to manage the country? Of course the Prime Minister completely ignores the Treasurer (Mr Crean) and overrides the Treasury. He thinks they do not know. The Caucus will not acept Treasury advice. It is little wonder that we get into a state of economic chaos when we have a government which is not prepared to take the proper advice that is given to it. We see the RED scheme-the regional employment development scheme-brough t forward as a means of soaking up some of the unemployment. It is a worthy scheme but it is second best. The best is permanent employment with people in regular jobs where they have a bit of dignity and where they do not have to go out to do manual jobs. How do women get a job under the RED scheme? Are they supposed to go out and start digging in the claypits or sweeping the streets? They cannot do so. This scheme is a secondary method of coping with the situation. We have a terrible inconsistency with the retrenchment scheme where people are given an entitlement of 6 months government allowance equivalent to their salary, including overtime, for the past 6 months. We have the situation now where people who are still employed in factories will be getting less wages for 6 months than those who were put off. Why should only a few people in the commore munity be privileged when hundreds of thouin sands are now unemployed and all they receive is the unemployment benefit? The whole situcourse, ation is gyrating. Nobody knows where we are going. But worse of all people are being hurt very severely because they are unemployed and unfigure. able to sustain their families in a dignified and decent way ofliving.",36

97,Mr RIORDAN,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,"I will deal with the right for honourable member in a minute. The Opposition is trying to ride on the backs of the unemployed of this country. Let me deal with the argument put forward by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden). I was amazed this morning to hear him, of all people, make such a grave and irresfound ponsible statement as to suggest that the figure of unemployment at present is 250,000. That is the height of irresponsibility. As a person who has been elected to a position of leadership in Australia and as as a member of this Parliatiates ment, he should be ashamed to overstate serious proposition so grossly and improperly. fact it is grossly untrue for him to state that. He has absolutely no evidence to justify the staterate ment. He cannot justify it. The decent thing him to do, for the benefit of the community whole, would be to stand up and withdraw statement and apologise for ever having made The humbug of members of the Opposition who claim that confidence is sagging, that we need to build confidence and that the Governto ment should attempt to build confidence in the economy of Australia, is that at every opportake tunity they try to downgrade that confidence and to destroy it. I refer to the Leader of the Country Party (Mr Anthony). What gross irresponsibility, what humbug was his statement",38
98,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE, today Order! the terms 'humbug' and 'irresponsibility' cannot be used in the House.,38
99,Mr RIORDAN,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,"The Leader of the Country Party said there was a vastly greater number than 190,000 unemployed. He said 350,000 would be out of work by January. What is the basis for that statement-hi s opinion, which is that 350,000 will be out of work by January. I reject it, and I am sure that most other people who can readfigureswill reject it utterly and completely. He has no basis for saying that, any than he has a basis for saying that there are fact 190,000 out of work at present. The actual figure is less than 150,000. That is merely, of 40,000 here or there. He knows, as well as do other members of this House, that the figure he is quoting is the seasonally adjusted In March of this year 82,564 people were registered as actually unemployed. At the same there were 87,552 registered vacancies for employees. In April 76,865 persons were registered as unemployed and there 81,258 registered vacancies. At present, of course, there are vacancies exceeding 40,000 jobs. There are 40,000 vacant jobs in the community waiting somebody to fill them. The responsibility for the fact that there are unemployed persons who cannot get those jobs rests squarely on the guilty men who sit opposite, the men who for a quarter of a century refused to introduce into Australia any scheme for the training of employees. They it beyond them to engage in employment real planning or any form of manpower scheme whatsoever, except the conscription of our youth. The basic difference between them and a Labor government is that whereas the Government inieconomic activity, they react to whatever a happens to occur and whatever may be the In wishes of their rich and powerful friends. There has been an appreciable slowing in the of reduction of unfilled vacancies. For examfor ple, in both June and July of this year the as a number of unfilled vacancies reduced by more that than 11,600 a month. That was very serious it. cause for concern. But in October the number of unfilled vacancies reduced by just over 1,200. That is cause for some confidence. That is cause take the view that the decline in employment opportunities is bottoming out. It is also cause to the view that there has been less turnover of labour, because when there is a rapid turnover of labour there is this increase in unfilled vacancies. Talk of insecurity destroys confidence and causes unemployment. If members of the Opposition expect anybody to beheve that their effort here is designed to try in some way to overcome the problems for those who are unemployed I ask them to consider one thing: What did they suggest as a means of overcoming it? Members of the Opposition heard something last night and they will hear something more tonight which show beyond doubt that this Government and this Minister for Labor and Immigrauon (Mr Clyde Cameron) are not committed in any way, shape or form to unemployment. They reject completely. Members of the Opposition want to attack this Minister for Labor because there is unemploythe ment, but I say to them that in 23 years they never had a Minister for Labor with the courage of the present Minister to uy to retrain the Ausis tralian work force. The Opposition is jealous and envious of his record and that is why he attacked. Perhaps the real reason emerged from both the Leader of the Opposition and the is Leader of the Australian Country Party. They the cat out of the bag when both of them worth launched a bitter, miserable and contemptuous attack on the Prices Justification Tribunal. The Leader of the Opposition said that the Prices tification Tribunal must understand that profit honourable. The Leader of the Australian Counalways try Party said that nothing is wrong with profit and that the Government is sooting the Prices weapon. Justification Tribunal to make profit the very minimum. Those statements are false. honourable gentleman to thefirstannual report of the Prices Justification Tribunal. At page 52, expired. in relation to profits, it states: It is useful to pay regard to pronts from three points of (12.14)-Th view, namely in their relationship to the goals (a) efficient resource allocation and optimum growth; (b) price stabilisation; and (c) equitable income distribution. I suggest to the honourable gentlemen opposite who are apparently labouring under this false view that it might do them well to read the report. What they really mean is that they do not a situation where there is some regulation against excess profitability. They do not want a tribunal. They do not want a scheme of things which vents profit maximisation and prices maximisawhen tion. Their real view, the view dictated to them by the outside interests that control them, is profits must be at their maximum level all time and that prices must be fixed on the terion that they shall be the maximum amount that that the consumer can be forced to stand. That their attitude. Let it be clear here today that they will denude the Prices Justification Tribunal of power. They will make toothless tiger. If they have their way we will a situation in which when goods and services in short supply the supplier will have therightto charge the price at the greatest level that the unwill fortunate consumer can be forced to pay. The Liberal and Country Parties when in government used unemployment as an economic weapon. They used it skilfully in 1951, in 1961 it and in 1971. Every 10 years they introduced a short, sharp burst of unemployment to wave the stick at the employee to get him back into line. At end of each of those 10-year periods-1951 , 1961, and 1971 - the Liberal and Country Parties created a short, sharp burst of unemployment. It dishonest to say that the great depression was the result of the action of a Labor government or is that the unemployment that came after World War II was caused by a Labor government. That the implication of what the Leader of the Oplet position had to say. That argument is hardly answering because it is so ludicrous as to be laughable. The Liberal and Country Parties are the parties in Australia which have used unJusemployment as an economic weapon. The Ausistralian Labor Party has always believed and will believe that it is undignified and immoral to use unemployment as an economic I refer Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Scholes)Order! The honourable member's time has",38
100,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,"Wannon) e honourable member for Phillip (Mr Riordan) has today spoken beneath himself and beneath his usual integrity in this Parliament. He knows full well that the people outside this place will not believe what he has said in relation to the policies pursued by our Government over a long period of years. The honourable member for Phillip knows full well and I think it would be reasonable to say that in his own heart every member of this Parliament is committed to a policy of full employment. It is want the mismanagement, the bungling and the stupidity of this Government that we condemn. We do not impute evil motives and the honourable premember for Phillip does himself a disservice he imputes evil motives to us. At the same time. I tliink the honourable member for Phillip that deceives himself, or is he like the Minister for the Overseas Trade (Dr. J. F. Caims) who suggests crithat unemployment under Labor is educative, it is good, that it is only short term, and that is it allows for a process of indoctrination and from their speeches retraining? it a This is an odd view to take. The honourable see member took heart from the fact that unfilled are vacancies had fallen from 90,000 to 40,000 over a period of less than a year. Is that something of which the honourable member for Phillip can be proud? Is he proud of the fact that 63,000 people, seasonally adjusted, are on unemployment benefits-the largestfigurefor many years? These are people, therefore, who have been unemployed for a considerable period. Is that a cause for confidence? He said that the fall in vacancies was less than it had been. There is certainly less labour turnover because of the circumstances that have been created through bungling and mismanagement People are fearful for their jobs where they ought not to have been fearful for their jobs. If someone is working and wants to continue to work, as most Australians do, he would stay put in the present circumstances. So a suggestion that the slackening in the rate of notification of vacancies is a good sign is a misreading of the circumstances. The Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) started his speech with a falsehood. He blamed the world. He said that unemployment is rising everywhere. But if it were not for the fall in meat prices inflation in Australia would now be measured at 26 per cent and not at 20 per cent. So world events which have led to unemployment elsewhere have helped the Government in Australia; they have not hindered it. World events which have damaged the Japanese, European and United States economies, with oil prices rising from US$2 to US$8 a barrel, have hardly touched Australia. If rising oil prices had touched Australia as they have Japan, the level of innation would have been more than 35 per cent today, and the Minister well knows that that is so. What has happened in Australia is as a result of the Government's tariff decisions, the wage poUcies foUowed earUer by the Minister for Labor and Immigration, the unreasonable growth in Government expenditure and the Government's foolish and incompetent poUcies in trying to overcome the difficulties that were created by its own mismanagement. No amount of explanation will persuade the Australian people that that is not so. In the last 5 years before 1974 the months of September and October showed a generaUy good trend in employment The number of people registered for employment feU during those 2 months; in some years the numbers feU quite significantly-by 4,000 in 1969 and by 7,000 in 1973. In 1974 in those same 2 months the number of people registered for employment, excluding school leavers, increased by about 42,000. So the trend we have is not only bad in itself; it is against the normal trend for this period of the year. That only indicates that the situation is more serious than the barefigureswould themselves reveal. It ought to be pointed out that the Minister's new definition of school leavers very much understates the position compared with the figures used under the old definition. The difference represents about 15,000 or 16,000 people in the total unemployment figures. The Ministerrefuses to count somebody who wants to leave school but stays at school merely because he cannot get a job. Such a person was counted in our time in government. If the old definition were used and appUed the seasonally adjusted total number of unemployed now would be about 210,000. But the Minister does not want evidence of this sort to be made avaUable. He has therefore instructed his Department to cease coUecting information on the basis of the old definition of school leavers and including those figures in the number of seasonally adjusted unemployed. This was done in every month up to the present month. It will not be done henceforth. The new method, which shows a very favourable position from the Government's point of view, will be used. So that needs to be taken into account also when looking at unemployment figures. I would hope that every member of this Parliament is concerned about the tens of thousands of people who are being grievously hurt by the mismanagement of the Government, the Treasurer (Mr Crean) and the Minister for Labor, and whether the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has confidence in them or not, one thing is clear: The people of Australia and this Parliament do not have confidence in them. If a secret ballot were conducted among the people of Australia or the members of this Parliament on the question the result would be plain. We know quite well that the Opposition would have the Prime Minister's vote in a secret ballot on that question in this Parliament, and I tliink it would also have the vote of the Minister for Labor. Does the Minister for Labor, the Treasurer or even the Prime Minister want to be in a government running a country in which at the end of January 150,000 school leavers will be wandering around the streets of Australia unable to get a job? That is the proud record they wiU have. ThefirstLabor Minister for Labor for 23 years will have the great achievement of having supported poUcies that created more unemployment than this country has seen since the great depression. That is the way the Minister for Labor will be known and remembered unless he takes some action. There are plenty of things he can do. He can cease to support policies which are foolish in their application and their effect on Australia. He can walk away from the Government, the fat cats and his big black car about which he is so critical in respect of other people, but he will not do that. He would sooner carry the burden of having on his back the brand of 150,000 unemployed school leavers, whom he would not even count among the unemployed up to this month, than stand for the principle of full employment in a way that really meant something and in a way that the people of Australia might be able to see and understand. There is a record of bungling in the introduction of the national employment and training scheme for which the Minister and his Department had had over a year to prepare. Were payments under the scheme to be taxable? The Minister thought they were, the head of his Department thought they were, but the rest of his Department thought they were not. We have had no explanation of how that variation in understanding of the scheme could occur. If a widow on $31 a week qualifies under the NEAT scheme she gets $93 a week taxable and loses the widow's pension. Somebody with an income of $20,000 a year, driving to the retraining centre in a Mercedes or a Bentley, would receive the full trairiing allowance in the same way as the widow who loses her widow's pension on receipt of the training allowance. What justice or reason is there in that? The Government has created the regional ployment development program. In the electorWannon ate of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) attempts have been made to get an regional employment projects under way, but unemployed people prefer unemployment had benefits to work under the RED program. The Minister for Labor has said twice in the last 9 months that he will crack down on people who abuse the system. How will he crack down on them? Owing to the Government's mismanagement he does not have sufficient staff in his partment to administer the normal Commonenterprise wealth Employment Service programs and the NEAT program, much less staff to chase people abusing the system. His Department has even had to rob the specialist institutional help provided to those private institutions that help the handicapped because it is short of staff and cannot handle the work load that has been placed on it as a result of the present Governmaintain ment's policies. It is virtually a certainty that 350,000 people will be unemployed in January and February next year. Thefigurecould be much higher that. If in the next 3 months unemployment increases at the rate at which it has increased for the last month another 120,000, excluding school leavers, will be added to the list. Thefigurewill approach 300,000, excluding school leavers. The Government needs policies that will re-establish confidence in the Australian community. If it introduces such policies it will have Opposition support. But the Government's taking one element of Opposition policy out of context and applying it will not have the effect which we say our total poUcies would have in bringing confidence and good sense back into the government of Australia.",39
101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,Mr Scholes)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,41
102,Mr CREAN,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE," I agree with one statement by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Every member on both sides of the House is committed to the pokey of full employment. I tliink occasionaUy we should ask ourselves what full employment means. I say that it means a job aU thetime,but it does not necessarily mean the same job all thetime.I disagree with the honourable member for Wannon on another matter.",41
103,Mr LUSHER,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,The new economics.,41
104,Mr CREAN,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,"WeU , occasionally the honourable member for Hume does not even know the emold economics. The honourable member for suggested that had meat prices not fallen, then the cost of Uving would have shown increase of, I think, 26 per cent instead of 20 per cent. What he does not acknowledge is that it not been for the rise of meat prices in 1973-74, inflation would have been running at only 7 per cent instead of 14 per cent. I think this simply shows that one can use statistics to suit oneself, but it is not facing up to the situation. Honourable members on the other side of the DeHouse claim to believe in the system called free or private enterprise. I direct attention to 2 aspects of free enterprise: Production is up organised by what are described as market forces and enterprises to varying degrees are able tofixthe prices of the things that they sell. They acknowledge also that free enterprise can not exist unless it employs people. Those who are employed are entitled to organise themselves to and to improve their standards ofliving or their wage. It seems to me that they are the 2 poles of a private enterprise system. In the mixed economy in Australia, it still accounts for somethan thing Uke 75 per cent of total employment. I shall cite some figures that show changes that have taken place within the private enterprise system in the distribution of what is produced the non-farm sector, because the farm sector subject to volatile influences. In 1969-70, which was when the now Opposition was in governis ment, in the non-farm sector, wages, salaries and supplements as the statistician describes them, were 62.2 per cent of the total. The gross operatAnd ing surplus was divided in this way: Companies, 18.4 per cent; unincorporated enterprise, 9.9 cent; and others, which include a number of statbasically istical compilations, 9.S per cent. It can be argued that in 1969-70 the share going to wages and salaries etc. was far too low and that perhaps the share going to companies was far too high. By the June quarter of 1973-74-the last quarter for which figures are available-the wages, salaries and supplements share had increased from 62.2 per cent to 70.2 per cent, an increase of 8 per cent. Companies' share had declined from 18.4 per cent to 13.1 per cent. The share of unincorto porated businesses had declined from 9.9 per cent to 8.6 per cent, and the other categories' share had declined from 9.5 per cent to 8.1 cent. That would suggest that perhaps there has been a squeeze on pronts over the last year two. When it suits honourable members opposite, they pose the question: What is a fair day's pay for a fair day's work? Neither side of that syllogism is very easy to define accurately. Equally, there may be arguments as to what is a reasonable rate of return upon capital employed in a particular private enterprise. I suggest that we should get down to looking at that sort of question rather than trying to score according to whether a particular index like the consumer price index has risen. As I said on one occasion, I think the Opposition is almost gleeful when the index shows an increase rather than expressing any concern as to why it has increased. Equally, the Opposition can score a lot from unemploymentfiguresbeing higher than they were.",41
105,Mr HUNT,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,What is a reasonable rate ployment and innation?,42
106,Mr CREAN,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,"I am not going to try to define it, but I would suggest that the problem will not be solved until employers and employees have sensible discussions with each that each is an essential part of the process and that therefore there should be some general agreement as to what is fair on either side. The question of prices involves the question of profits, and private enterprise is not in the game primarHouse ily to serve the public, although it will not exist long if it does not. Private enterprise is there basically to earn a profit, and if itfindsthe rate of in profit unsatisfactory then it is not likely to is expand its capacity, and I would suggest that that is the big central point at the moment which being overlooked in the general economic debate. It is not only a question of unemployment, it is a question of unemployment and inflation. there is a third leg in the economic trianglethe decline infixedcapital investment. In a priper vate enterprise economy, which this economy still is- I do not deny that-the majority of employment opportunities can be found only if there is expansion in the private sector. There are a number of limiting factors at the moment as to why the private sector is not expanding. Inflation is one of the central issues, and inflation is bound up with industry. Industry does not regard the wage as the standard ofliving of the worker so much as it regards it as a cost in production, and again we get caught in this endless debate as whether, when prices have risen, unless wages rise too the real wage standard has declined. On the other side, if wages have increased then those per who employ labour in considerable numbers say that they have to adjust their prices. That is the or heart of the economy in Western industrialised societies. There is not a definable, reasonable rate of return on profits and there is not a definable fair share of the total that ought to go to wages as against the rest, and until we get down to that kind of fundamental examination I suppose the Opposition everytimea particular statistic goes a certain way will use the opportunity to exploit it. But it does not solve the problem. Unemployment in Australia will not decrease this side of 1975 and everybody on both sides of the House knows that. It is humbug to suggest that the numbers are going to come down. As we all know, December and January are the sterile months.",42
107,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF POSSIBLE,"Mr Scholes)Order! the honourable gentleman's time has of unemexpired. The discussion is concluded. NA BILL (No. 2) 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed from 3 October, on motion other and recognise by Dr Cass: That the Bill be now read a second time.",42
108,Mr MORRISON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"May I have the indulgence of the to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I should like to suggest that it might suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Bill and the Television Stations Licence Fees Bill, as they are related measures. Separate questions will of course be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, that the House permit the subject matter of the 3 Bills to be discussed in this debate.",42
109,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these measures? It is so ordered.,43
110,Mr KILLEN,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"As the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) just explained, there are 3 Bills before the House for its consideradon. Two of them need not delay us long. These are the 2 Bills dealing with fees relating to television stations and fees relating to broadcasting stations. It is the third Bill that should invite the attention of all honourable gentlemen and, I would hope, the attention of the country. It is a Bill to amend the Broadcasting and Television Act. There are 2 views which may be taken of the amending Bill. There is the view which the Minister for the Environment and Conservation (Dr Cass), who introduced the Bill, has invited us to take, and there is the view which the Bill demands that we should take. I say at once that if there is any coincidence between the two, any resemblance, it is a startling display of coincidence, and it is a matter of high congratulations if any similarity at all is found between what the Minister said was in the Bill and what the Bill says is in the Bill. I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Bill was introduced into this House. I should have thought that the Minister for the Media (Senator Douglas MCClelland), who has the ultimate control of and responsibility for the Bill, would have been the logical person to present the Bill to the Parliament. But no, this Bill comes in here, no doubt on the basis of the assurance of numbers, and no matter what blemishes we may find in the Bill the numbers will prevail, the Bill will go through and go on its way to the Senate. If it there meets what I would encourage honourable gentleman to accept as being a proper fate, the Bill will be defeated and will come back into this chamber at some time in the future. So, therefore, the primary observation on this Bill is that it is part of the machinery for another double dissolution, and that is the way in which the Government regards the Bill. The Minister for the Environment and Conserbases vation during the course of his speech said that the majority of people in Australia believed that certain powers sought in this Bill were already in the Act. I must acknowledge the novelty of that argument. If the people believe there is something in an Act, and it is not in an Act, you legislate to put it into an Act! If people have a view of a certain set of circumstances and that is in effect a facade, you legislate to bring something into touch with their reality! Just tliink how grateful the generations of the time of Christopher Columbus would be that they were spared the Minister legislating in accordance with the beliefs of those days. The Minister for the Media, however, has gone into the public forum and presented a view by saying: 'These powers are not needed for the purposes of controlling private television. We do not propose to disturb in any shape or form private television companies.' Again, I acknowledge the novelty of that argument. If a man builds a large dog kennel in the backyard with no intention of putting a dog into it and puts alongside it a massive electric motor with no intention of using the motor, I suppose on one view one could regard that behaviour as picturesque. I would submit that a more reaUstic approach to it would be that it was a delightful display of eccentricity. A sharper and even more reaUstic view would be that it was an exquisite piece of absurdity. If the Minister does not propose to use the power which this amending Bill seeks, why seek it? That is the question. Let me say at once to all honourable gentlemen who may have succumbed to the notion that this Bill is concerned with television standards qua standards that it is concerned with nothing of the sort. I say to all people in the country who may have an attitude of mind regarding lasciviousness or salaciousness in any sort of activity that this Bill in no way whatsoever seeks to trammel or to control such behaviour or such expression. I say further for the Opposition Parties that we are as concerned as any other section of the community about community standards. That is our attitude and we do not propose to see those standards in any way broken down. But this Bill is concerned with power. It is concerned with the power to direct, power to control and power, if need be, to destroy. This power which is sought to be put into this Act, if used by an authority or by a government, would be sufficient to control completely all private television throughout Australia. This is not to gUd the lUy at all. This Bill points to buUding up the power already in the Act for the Board to give determinations. There are 3 upon which the Board can give determinations. There is the power pursuant to section 16 under which the Board can write to a particular station and say: 'Do this'. There is the power under section 17 of the Aa whereby the Board stations, makes orders, and there is the power under secless tion 134 of the Aa whereby the Board makes regulations. Let us take the last two-mentioned; that is to say, section 17 dealing with orders section 134 dealing with regulations. Under of these provisions any order or any regulation made is subjea to the scrutiny of Parliament. The fact that it is subjea to the scrutiny ofParliaany ment is the whole centre of this matter. But determination made under section 16 of the is in no way subjea to the scrutiny ofParliament. I would suggest that it is a pretty good test ofthebehaviour good faith of the Government in this matter to inquire: Why not put under the regulation makbeing ing power the powers you seek under section 16, so that the Parliament has an opportunity of conless sidering the ramifications of any regulation which may come down and so that at the same it whatsoever. time Parhament wiU have the opportunity of pronouncing, and properly so, on any discriminatory attitude adopted by the Board? Let me draw the particular attention of House to the question of standards. The popular view to which the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has lent his weight and which one or two honour the able gentlemen opposite have sought to encournot age in the community is that this Bill is concerned only with standards. A more refined piece of nonsense I have never listened to. I have here copy of the television program standards comable. piled by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and pubUshed in 1970. It deals with whole question of standards. Where did the Board get this power tp produce these standards? It did not get it out of thin air. The Board gets power to produce standards and to pass them for observance in the television industry from Aa as it stands now. Take the case of a letter written by the Board on 10 October this year deaUng with guideUnes and the use of violence in early evening television drama programs. Does the Board simply whistle this up with no authority ority to back it at aU? Do not say that the letter 10 October of this year is something which stands in prospect of being out of date. It is just matter of a few days ago. One wonders why there is the need for these powers-power s about which I wiU deal in a more definitive way in moment. The other thesis which is being vamped by the yet Prime Minister, the Minister for the Media and two Board one or two other honourable gentlemen is that with the Australian Broadcasting Control Board the other today is virtuaUy without any power or authority whatsoever. The piaure is built up that standing this massive juggernaut, the private television is this dear, resolute,timidbut nevertheineffectual Uttle body, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. Again what nonsense some people resort to in order to sustain an arguand ment. The Act as it now stands has an amplitude both of power-the power to suspend a Ucence, the power to revoke a Ucence. What greater power could be given to any Board, to any authority, to government than the power to revoke a lia cence, the power to suspend a Ucence? If a priAa vate television station engaged in behaviour which the Board adjudged to be unacceptable the Board has the power at its disposal to deal with the matter. So the argument which is belted up by the Prime Minister and by the Minister for the Media that the Board is poweris an argument which is not merely unattractive; it is an argument which has no substance in But beyond that the Minister for the Media has gone out of his way with a singular sense of the dedication to build up the argument a Uttle further. He says: 'WeU, there has been challenge after chaUenge after challenge to the authority of Board'. That is interesting. The records do show that to be the case. When a Minister of the Crown speaks about an expression of defiance, a matter of chaUenge, I for my part would a expect that there would be some record avaUThere have been 2 judicial challenges to the power of the Australian Broadcasting Control the Board sincetelevisionwas introduced in 1956. One of the cases was in 1963 and the other was in 1966. Both of them dealt not with programming its as such but dealt, in one instance, with the tracon ing of ownership and the provisions which the related to that aspect under the Aa, and the other chaUenge dealt with the question of tying conditions to the granting of a Ucence. What further nonsense is it to say that for a person to question an edict given by a government authrepresents a chaUenge. Surely that is to be of regarded as a rather immature approach to the problem. These have been the 2 major chalalenges to the authority of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. Another one, which was a matter of opinion given by counsel, dealt with a Sunday programs. But to describe that as a violent chaUenge to the Board is to resort to fantasy again. These have been the 3 areas in which the has been chaUenged. There were the court challenges deaUng with ownership and the tying of conditions and there has been one which dealt with Sunday programs. So one wonders precisely what is the purpose of this Bill. I submit that if honourable members look at clause 6 of the Bill they willfindout exactly what this is all about, because this clause deals with section 16 of the Act. It is of utmost importance that this clause be understood. It deals with the section of the Act under which there can be no parliamentary review, no parliamentary scrutiny, no parliamentary challenge to any of the determinations given by the Board. Clause 6 of the Bill reads: The AuthorityAs it is to be called, not the' Board'shall have power to do all such effecuve exercise of the functions of the Authority particular, but without limiting ing, the authority shall have powerThat is the preamble to the proposed new tion. Then it goes on to recite the provisions. more plenary power I could not imagine being made available under any Act. The clause goes on to deal with what sort of controls can be exerinviting cised. The Authority can issue a determination on programs containing matter of any character specified in the deterrnination. I want honourable members to reflect upon the consequence of that Under that power it would be possible for the Authority, as it is proposed to called-a n expression in paranoia itself is the that the name has to be changed from 'Board' 'Authority', but one may have an opportunity of observing something about that later-to say particular television station: 'You will run particular time-sa y between 6 and 8 o'clock night- a particular character of program'. The principle involved here is as old a prinnature ciple as one could apprehend in the struggle by free men and women to achieve their liberties and to protect them. What self-respecting newspaper editor in this country would countenance for one moment being told by a governGovernment ment authority where he is to place his leader page and what he is to place on his leader page, and do so without the slightest whimper? That precisely what is involved here. It is a matter commercial judgment that many television stater? tions today screen their news programs at 6 o'clock at night. What would happen if the Board were to take the view that they should screen their news programs at 7 o'clock at night to coincide with the Australian Broadcasting Commission? There is no tribunal to which telepower. vision stations can appeal to challenge the direca tion or deterrnination made by are these powers sought? The clause goes on to deal with the determinOrders ing of the rules and standards to be observed a licensee. I have already dealt with that. I invite the Minister or any honourable gentleman opposite to point in specie-no t in the wide generality to which the Minister has resorted-and to name the time, the television station concerned and the incident concerned when standards were not observed by a television station. Give us the details. We will all be interested to know on how many occasions this has in fact taken place. Then the clause goes on further to give to the Authority power to make rules which shall be observed by all television stations. Finally the clause goes on to make such provision for any other person as the Authority considers appropriate to go along things as are necessary for the and argue the case about the continuation of a and, in licence. The Minister for the Media, who is a the generality of the foregomember of the other place, said that the other class of person to go long would be those who secmay possibly have some affinity with trade A unions. I should have thought that the arbitral tribunals we have in this country today would be for all practical purposes quite satisfying without the creation of further bodies to which people can go either to ventilate their grievance class or or seek to improve their lot. The other major alteration to which I propose to refer, albeit briefly, is that which gives the be power to the Board to grant the restoration of a fact licence for a period of 3 months. I ask honourto able gentlemen: What sort of programming could be done on the basis of the grant of a lito a cence for 3 months? What arrangements could at a be made, for example, to havefilmprepared? at What type of person with any sense of business enterprise would be prepared to invest a tremendous amount of capital in an enterprise of this if he knew that it could be suddenly cut off at the expiration of 3 months? The proposition is so desperately divorced from all reasonableness. At 8 o'clock tonight we willfindout what the is going to do about trying to revive the fortunes of this country. It will walk to Canossa tonight on the matter of the economy. is Are we to await some further example of conof trition by the Government in relation to this matIt is not enough to say: 'If a channel misbehaves itself, is contumacious or refuses to bow to a reasonable request we cannot do anything about it as we have no power'. As I have said, a more absurd picture drawing I could not contemplate. The fact is that the Board has ample It has the power to suspend and to revoke licence. If those powers are not enough, I do the Board. Why not know what is. I would like to recapitulate on this one pointcan be given under section 17 of the Act. by If the Minister for the Media takes the view that these powers are so urgently needed, why does he not put them under that section? Why does he not put them under the regulation-making section and give the power to the Parliament to have its voice heard as the occasion may arise? The Minister for the Media knows perfectly well that the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations is, in its corporate sense, more than prepared to negotiate with him, to cooperate with him and to observe any standards which may be regarded as reasonable. But no self-respecting body of people could be expected to capitulate to the daily caprice of governments or of Ministers. It is not of the nature of political authority, whether political authority on that side of the House or on this side of the House, for it to be benevolent. Political authority has no instinct for benevolence. Institutions must be raised between those who wield power and those against whom power is wielded. The only institution that can be raised in this instance is the authority of Parliament. I appeal to the Minister and to the honourable gentlemen who sit behind the Government-wit h varying degrees of enthusiasm, admittedly-to remember that they are dealing here with as basic a principle as can be found m the long, ancient and inspuing struggle by our people to assert liberty and to maintain it.",43
111,Unknown,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Sitting suspended from 12.58 to 2.15 p.m.,46
112,Mr SHERRY,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Prior to the suspension of the sitting, the honourable and learned member for Moreton (Mr Killen) made one or two observations on this legislation. I do not intend to canvass some of the made, but, towards the end of his speech, the honourable member did express some confunctions cern- I accept his observations-abou t one graph (c): important aspect of this matter which he used the word 'power' to describe. This is the whole grams object of the exercise in my view. I do not tliink and anybody in this House would ever or contest the view that in dealing with television one is concerning oneself with perhaps the most dramatic and impactive communication techcasting nique yet devised by man. Therefore, I tliink follows that any responsible government must accept its responsibility to make certain that power is never abused. I wish to refer briefly to the enormous effect that the abuse of power in the communications medium can have on individuals or an was individual. I think the classic case- I hope that the honourable member for Moreton will accept this-of the uncontrolled power of television cerns its use to destroy a President of the United States of America. I would not want to see sort of situation in this countiy; nor suggest that it would occur. Nonetheless, this is a very real difficulty that one faces. The honourable gentleman also commented on the change of name from the 'Australian Broadcasting Control Board' to 'Australian Broadcasting Authority'. I would have thought that in semantic terms Broadcasting Authority would be far more attractive to him than Broadcasting Control Board. As the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) proposed, this is a cognate debate in which 3 separate Bills are being considered together. In the main I wish to concentrate on the legal powers or the absence of legal powers of the proposed Broadcasting Authority, particularly as this affects the programming question. I believe that we in this House have a duty to engage ourselves in a rational and intelligent debate on this question. It is a question which loads a government and an Opposition equally with great responsibility. Government certainly has to respond to that responsibility. I am always intrigued by the reaction of some sections of the Press and, indeed, the Opposition when the Government makes any announcement that it intends to amend a particular piece of legislation. There has been no more emotive reaction than the announcement by the Government that it intended to make amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act. Indeed, no less an authority on the media than the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) made his attitude quite plain. But I will deal with the right honourpoints that he able gentleman later. Section 16 (1) of the Act which deals with the of the Board provides in para. . . to ensure that adequate and comprehensive proare provided by commercial broadcasting stations commercial television stations to serve the best interests deny the claim of the general public. Section 99 (1) of the Act says that a licensee shall provide programs and shall supervise the broador televising of programs from his station it in such a manner as to ensure as far as practicable that the programs are in accordance with this standards determined by the Board. In 1948, the 'Board' was substituted for the 'Minister'. In 1956, because this section was being amended to incorporate television stations, the opportunity taken to substitute 'standards by the Board' for 'to the satisfaction of the Board'. I think it is necessary to deal with the historical background conof the powers of the Board. It seems quite clear that it was always the intention that wide disthat cretionary powers should reside in the Board indeed do I with regard to programming. I refer in this respect to extracts from the secong reading speech of the then Postmaster General, Mr Davidson as he then was, when he introduced the 1956 amendments to the Act. I remind the House that he was Postmaster General in a Liberal-Country Party Government. He said: It will be remembered that there are certain difficulties and particular problems that the Board has to face at this moment. He said further It seems clear that it was always the intention that wide discretionary power should reside in the Board. In introducing the 1956 amending Bill, he went on to say: Clause 40 also prescribes, in Division 4 of ditions to be observed by the licensees of commercial stations-bot h television and broadcasting-i programs. The Minister continued: I invite the attention of the House specially to the latter provisions because ever since there has been talk of the introduction of television into Australia, genuine fear has been expressed by large sections of the community that the introduction of television would have unfortunate effects on some sections of the population, particularly children. Mr Davidson went on: . . . it is essential to ensure that television programs are of a proper standard. These were the words of a Minister in a Liberal Country Party Government-no t a Labor Minister. I repeat the words of Mr Davidson: . . . it is essential to ensure that of a proper standard. I do not misunderstanding here. The responsibility for ensuring television programs are of a proper standard is imposed on the Australian Broadcasting which recently was strengthened Mr Davidson continued: . . . this Government expects the Board to discharge duties in this field fearlessly. He added: . . . I wish to make it clear that the Government will stand behind the Board in its administration and will not tolerate any abuse of the new medium by licensees or advertisers . . . Those were the words of the then in 1956. It can be seen that a member of the then Liberal-Country Party Government had very strong views, with which I agree, on this regarding the legal position of the Board. The legal position has never been clearly clarified to the entire satisfaction of this Parliament or, I would suggest, of the industry itself. The Board has regarded the substitution of the words 'programs are in accordance with standards determined by the Board' for 'programs are to the satisfaction of the Board' to be quite inadequate to enable it to carry out its functions. It must be remembered that this issue was crystalised, as the honourable member for Moreton suggested earlier today, with the problem of Sunday morning programs. I would suggest to the House that there is no point at all in having an authority or a board, whichever it is, in existence if its powers and legal posiuon are not quite clearly defined by this Parliament. I do not think anybody in the Opposition would accept that situation. I do not think anybody on the Opposition side would accept the proposal that the Board ought to be disbanded. I would be fascinated if any honourable member opposite would Part III, the conagree that that ought to be done. If we want standards in programming- I think n relation to thenwe all do want standards in programming-w e must clothe the Board with the necessary powers to make certain that those standards are achieved. In this respect I refer to a statement made on 7 April 1972 by the then Acting Postmaster-General, Senator Cotton. The amendments that this Government has introduced are beiiig interpreted in the Press and by some members of the Opposition as quite radical and quite new. In fact, they are not. With respect to the proposals made by Senator Cotton, on 7 April 1972 he said: The Government will be asked to consider an amendment to the legislation to clarify the powers of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to regulate programs on Sunday television programs are mornings. want to leave any possibility of that On 28 April 1972 it was suggested that the being Government would legislate on television stanControl Board dards. Senator Cotton said: with this objective in view. The Government will legislate to make clear the powers of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. its He said that he considered the situation had arisen as a result of the challenge to the powers of the Board by station GTV9 in Melbourne. This is not a new approach. In our proposals we are using the guidelines set out by the Acting Postmaster-General in 1972, Senator Cotton. So I would suggest that what we are proposing is not Mr Davidson terribly radical. Let us look at the situation in other countriesfor example, the United Kingdom and Canada. In the United Kingdom the Television Act issue 1954-63 provides, in section 1 (4): It shall be the duty of the Authority(b) to ensure that the programmes broadcast by the Authority in each area maintain a high general standard in all respects, and in particular in respect of their content and quality, and a proper balance and wide range in their subject-matter, having regard both to the programmes as a whole and also to the days of the week on which, and the times of the at which, the programmes are broadcast . . . That,briefly, is the situation in the United Kingdom and I would suggest it is not an intolerable one. The Canadian Broadcasting Act 1968 in section 2 provides: The programming provided by the Canadian broadcastwas ing system should be varied and comprehensive and provide reasonable balanced opportunity for the expression of different views on matters of public concern, and gramming provided by each broadcaster should be of high standard, using predominantly Canadian creative and resources. That Act goes on to provide fairly stringent quite guarantees that the interpretation and the letter interfered of that Act will be carried out. It can be seen that mercial broadcasting both the United Kingdom and Canada are answered the charge and accepting, and in fact have laid down, the sorts see whether he is prepared of guideUnes and rules that we are putting forward in this particular series of amendments. simply not good enough for the Leader of the Opposition constantly to declare his opposition to these amendments when, as I have pointed out and illustrated, they were proposed by his Party when in government a couple of years ago. I repeat that it is an absurd and ludicrous situdebate ation where the Board does not know what its powers are, where it can move and where it canthe not move. From time to time reference has been made to a lack of appeal and there was a suggestion the right of appeal had been taken away. should have thought that honourable members opposite would have known that one cannot remove something that was never there. There industry never has been a right of appeal. I tliink, and am sure that most people would agree, that it willnot be in the interests of the industry to know clearly and precisely what its functions and responsiregulations bilities are with regard to this matter. I turn now to some of the emotive statements of the Leader of the Opposition. When these amendments werefirstannounced he ran to the I Press, as is his normal custom, and made quite emotionally charged statements about interwhat ference with the electronic media. I suggest to right honourable gentleman that he has a very short memory about interference with the elecdo tronic media because on Friday, 7 December 1973, he sent a telex and a telegram to the comMinister mercial management of station 7HO in Hobart demanding that certain commercials played on that station be discontinued. He further demanded that the Liberal Party free time to broadcast its own advertisements. questioned him on this matter in the House and asked him whether at anytimehe made his proTelevision test through the proper charmel-through the day Australian .'Broadcasting Control Board. I also asked him whether the whole tone of his telex and telegram , messages to the management of 7HO was of a threatening nature. He refused to answer and I was not surprised, because this was a very grave' situation indeed. What happened that the Leader of the Opposition went dishould rectly to a commercial management and told it how to run its business. Yet he has the temerity, the proboth iri this House and outside, to say that this other Government is interfering with the electronic medial He says one thing when it suits him and who, the opposite the next day. This is the man as I said, quite deUberately and blatantly in the internal management of a comstation. He has never I would be interested to to do so. It is I am often fascinated by the Liberal Party's proclamation that it is the protector of the individual. I do not wish to take up thetimeof the House in this debate with my own personal experience of this great Liberal freedom for the individual. I could take up half an hour of this indicating the treatment I received from Liberal Party when, as a former member of the media, I indicated that I was going to enter poUtics. that I think the amendments which the GovernI ment is to introduce are sensible,timely,and very necessary, and I believe that in the long term they will be beneficial to the television itself. There is also a great deal of pubUc I community support for these propositions. I do take the view that we ought to impose on the electronic media industry any more burdensome than are absolutely necessary and I do not think the Government does either. The plain fact is that the Government does have a responsibiUty in this area through its agent, the Broadcasting Authority as it is to be known, and think it is only right and proper that that authority should know precisely where it stands and it can and cannot do. The areas of the indecision and uncertainty that have continued over the years have not helped the industry and I not think they have helped anybody in particular. I suggest that the amendments which the wiU introduce at a later stage ought to be accepted by this House in the interests of the being industry as a whole. receive Mr KEVIN CAIRNS (Lilley) (2.38)-A I number of simple truisms have been stated concerning this legislation. The Broadcasting and Bill (No. 2) is about power and, quite obviously, the use and dissemination of that power. It is for that ultimate reason the Opposition takes the attitude it does. As people of common sense, the Opposition has to look with great suspicion upon the proposed use of this power and there are good reasons for its doing that. After all, the media in general in many ways constitute one of the most sensitive areas of Australian life. They have a capacity to innuence Australian life which may now be rivalled by no other institution and no other organisation. In many ways the media have reached into this chamber and some have sought to dominate it. Insofar as this cnamber, this Parliament, is concerned with power and is concerned with information, it has to express a view about these matters. My view is quite clear-that any more authority given to governments to be able to traffic rectly or indirectly in the dissemination of information ought to be resisted very strongly indeed. It was Talleyrand, a diplomat, if I may term him in that way, of another nation and of another day who said that no nation had the right to traffic in the independence of small nations. I put that proposition gently to the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) in respect of the Baltic States. But it is a fact that no great.power has the right to traffic in the independence of small nations. Transmitted to the area we are now discussing, no government or no authority ought to take it upon itself the right to traffic the freedom of information and I believe that that freedom",46
113,Mr MORRISON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"We will leave it to your Press baron friends, presumably?",49
114,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The Minister must be can referring to the 'Sandgate Echo'? No governminister ment ought to take unto itself the right to traffic in those areas. I believe that for thosereasonsthis Bill ought to be resisted. Those statements not made in a vacuum or out of peevishness. this to say: Probably the most authoritative speech on the possibilities of the misuse of power in this area isWetheopenly was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) himself. He delivered a speech to the Broadcasting Commission's staff-the y were his friends then-at Sydney on Friday afternoon, 4 reaching June 1971. At the time he was still a candidate side for the leadership of a government in this counpropaganda try. Some of the contents of that speech can appropriately considered in the context of power. It will be recollected that in the administration of authority by the Australian Broadcasting Coma mission the guiding principle as to the informalie tion disseminated by the Commission and other media in this country was the principle balance of information. The Prime Minister said vision Act. on that occasion quite clearly in respect of that principle: I say quite simply, ladies and gentlemen, and I say directly to you, Sir RobertThat was the Chairman at that timethe formulaThat is of balanceis unworkable and deservedly unworkable. In another part of the speech the Prime Minister said that the principle was in fact a Trojan horse and ought to be rejected. The Prime Minister made important comments on page 16 of the speech which referred to the ultimate areas and the ultimate authorities to which this Bill proposes to hand over authority withrespectto the didissemination of information not within the ABC but within the whole gamut of the electronic media in Australia. He had this to say: Yet it would be dishonest for me to assert that the ABC would be free of criticism, free of pressure under a Labor Government. The next sentence is important: I confess that there is an authoritarian streak in my party as strong as exists among my opponents. I ask honourable members to forget about politics. The Prime Minister acknowledged the existence of an authoritarian streak with respect to power in relation to the electronic media in in Australia. For those reasons, which I think are cogent and sensible reasons, one ought to look very carefully, even a trifle suspiciously, at the legislation before us. It may be drawing a long bow, but the extent to which the misuse of the right to propagandise be utilised is made quite clear by the first for the media in the 20th Century. I refer to the late Dr Goebbels and I merely indicate the power that is involved. After he was are appointed as Minister for Propaganda he had There ought to be nothing mystifying about propaganda. admit that we want to influence the people. This proper way to do it. Australian On 16 March 1933 he added: A government such as ours which has to take such farmeasures . . . must make propagandistic preparations in order to draw the people on its . . . Public enlightenment is essentially passive; is active . . . We are determined to work be on the masses until they have fallen to us. That is an extreme position but it is a statement of the ultimate authority that lies in this area. It is statement of an ultimate authority that could in this area if utilised by a Minister armed the with the amendments which the Government of wishes to make to the Broadcasting and TeleFor these reasons again, one should say: 'Pause and think carefully'. To support my suspicion I refer to what happened in the chamber just before the sitting was suspended for lunch. At that time the Opposition was putting its case and expressing its concern in these areas. Even while the case was being presented and after the Opposition had circulated its proposed amendments to the Bill the Government circulated proposed new amendments. This was done while the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen), who is leading for the Opposition on this legislation, was talking and after the Opposition had committed itself So quite clearly it was proposed that the Opposition would be given little time for reflection or analysis in its consideration of the Bill. Mr Killen- I had to break lunch to have a look at them. The Minister did not even express any lation sympathy.",49
115,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"That is just a little short of tragic. I understand the position in which honourable member was placed. Nevertheless those matters ought to be looked at and borne in mind when this Bill is being considered. principle of balance applying in the most nificant medium in Australia was denigrated the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister denigrated the right to information, the potential right to balanced information, within the ABC. I believe that the principle of a plurality of interests or a plurality of a controlling interest is likely to be, and be, prejudiced if the Government's amendments to the legislation are passed. So unrelenting suspicion has to be and ought to be exercised respect of these areas. There are 3 areas in precise detail in which this Bill proposes to alter the Act. One area is with respect to short term licences. It is proposed that the licences be for periods from 6 months to 3 years. This posal would prove very difficult for licensees. Alterations are proposed with respect to powers to be exercised by the Authority, again with authority of the Minister and outside the purview of the Parliament. In respect of the award of licences clause 6 sets out that the authority can now consult 'such other persons as the Authority considers appronificance priate'. What does that mean? It means that station, a licensee who has functioned quite creditably and quite well and who wants either to obtain a licence or to have a licence renewed, can have appearing before the Authority by perhaps Mr Carmichael of the Amalgamated concern Metal Workers Union, whose connection with the licensee can be the fact that some fitters and turners or electricians who are engaged under awards concerning his union may work on the station. Mr Halfpenny, for example, could be consulted by the Authority, the members of which are appointed by the Government itself. The vicious circle of the control and power begins to close. Therefore I would suggest that when we come to the committee stage of this debate an amendment be introduced which would allow the Authority to consult such other persons as are direcdy associated with the administration of the licence-no t an outside authority stretching to an executive far removed from the direct administration of the licence. That would give at least some guarantee of objectivity with respect to these areas. There are other matters in regard to this legison which one could speak. But again one returns to thefirstprinciples. A power sought will be a power utilised. That is common sense. It is the not beyond common sense. If a power is sought it is appropriate to ask for what purposes it can be . utilised. I will be very interested to see the attiThe tude of the Government to the amendments sigwhich have been proposed by the honourable by member for Moreton (Mr Killen), so that regulations made under the powers for the clarification of standards can be scrutinised by the Parliament itself. After all, in respect of the electronic media in Australia, the Minister has more direct authority and is more involved than is a similar Minister in other nations-certainl y in Canada and will the United States of America. Insofar as he is more directly concerned, barriers, cushions and safety fences ought to be erected between the in Minister and the exercise of that power. This comes to perhaps the crux of the whole given debate-the attitude to the proposed amendproments in respect of the development of these standards. We want those standards to be scrutinised ultimately, and able to be scrutinised the ultimately, by this Parliament. The Royal Commission on Broadcasting in Canada made it clear that the authority ought always to revert to the Parliament. If that is applied with respect to the (f) United States, why is it not intended that it apply in respect of Australia? This is of great sigfor recent events which were often a misreported but which it was possible at least to bring about. I refer to a reported attempted- I believe the matter was incorrectly reported in many respects-acquisitio n of a television station a political party. I have to express very great at the first proposition that a political party should even be able to have a television licence. If one is concerned with the dissemination of power such a licence held by a political party runs too close to the principle of trafficking in information. When I say that I bear in mind very much that the Royal Commission on Television more than 20 years ago made it quite clear that no political party ought to have a television licence. That was made quite explicit in the 1953 report of the Royal Commission. A little later, in the late 1950s, when an attempt was made to acquire a licence on behalf of the Labor Party in Sydney-the late Dr Evatt was counsel for his Party in this respect-onc e again the Board in making its recommendation quite sensibly said that even though there will be difficulties in respect of information transmitted by the media and even though there may be concern that appropriate balance is not developed in the transmission of that information, the direct acquisition by a political party and the ability of a political party to be able to obtain television Ucences ought to be rejected for so long far as a Umited number of Ucences are able conferred in any one area. Again it is the right of information and it is dissemination of the authority to transmit that information which is the substance at point and which is the substance of the case of the Oppoall sition in respect of this authority. I take it a further. I do not think it is drawing too long bow to say that if a poltiical party has its members in government and as a government appointing members of a broadcasting authority which can then award a Ucence to that poltiical party or a chain of Ucences to a poltiical party run the media, we are in a very dangerous situfact ation indeed. That circle is almost closed, but can take it further. Add to that principle the activities of the Prices Justification Tribunal. Bearing in mind that advertising expenditure is the Ufeblood of the media, there is the propensity for that government to appoint members of the Tribunal who in fact deterrnine what is imate advertising expenditure, which in fact the Ufeblood of the media in many cases which may be awarded to the poltiical party whose members are in government. When one bears in mind the words of the present Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) that there is within his own Party an authoritarian streak which he fears, surely that fact and those facts ought not to be ignored. That is the philosophy, believe, of the Opposition's case with respect this matter. It depends upon the 3 precise amendments of substance that are proposed to the Bill. They are the amendments with respect to the short term Ucences; they are the amendments with respect to the definition of standards under the authority of the Minister and not to be scratinised by this Parliament in terms of regulations; and in determining Ucences the abUity of the authority on the Board to consult whomsoever it would directly or indirectly associated with the licence, the Ucensee or the broadcasting or television station. I do not believe that that ought to be on. In the Australian context where the Minister is directly concerned in this area, as he is, the Opposition is justified in saying that it opposes this Bill and opposes the substance of it. I look with some alacrity at the attitude of the Government to the amendments which are proposed by the Opposition. They are amendments which could be supported with the words of the honourable member for FrankUn (Mr Sherry). I hope they will be supported with his vote.",50
116,Mr MATHEWS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The honourand so able member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns) to be began his speech with a quotation from Talleyrand. Let me match it with another from the same source. The honourable gentleman has the learnt nothing and forgotten nothing. His speech wasrichwith allusions to the past. He drew few conclusions from them. The evUs he deplored are around us in the field on which discussion Uttle centres today. The misuse of the right to propaa gandise to which he referred is with us. It is not hypothetical. It is not something which might is happen. It is something which is perpetuated every day. Similarly the situation in which a political party might gain a measure of ownership of to the media, which he purported to deplore, is in with us already. I think Birkenhead said one once that in Britain the Anglican Church was the Tory Party at prayer. In Australia the media as we know it is the Liberal Party on the air. Honourable members on this side of the House believe there is a touch of the crocodUe in legitthe honourable member for Moreton (Mr is KiUen), who began this debate. It may be that and the forebears of the honourable gentleman shared his taste for swimming naked in the Condamine and some connection occurred there. When the honourable gentleman addresses the House as he did this morning with tears in his eyes and a catch in his throat about the plight of the weak and innocent television Ucensee who finds himself confronted with an overbearing I broadcasting authority, it is hard to remain to unmoved. Unfortunately the honourable gentleman gave us this morning a travesty of the truth. The commerical television interests of this country are not Davids threatened by a Goliath of government creation but offshoots of an large oligopolised communications industry which television prompted Senator Kennelly to say as long ago as 1964- 1 quote him because then the developgement ment of the television industry was relatively its infancy: One feature of television which has always worried the great strength of this medium in forming opinion. tunately the principal television tually in the hands of 3 or 4 men who also control the Press and the principal radio stauons. Therefore, the media communication in Australia are in the hands of a very people. This is bad from a nauonal point of view irrespective of who the people may be. If the honourable gentlemen opposite have hear or read. any doubts on that point I draw their attention to reports published annually by the authority we are discussing today, which set out in some detail the enormous extent to which ownership of Australian media is concentrated in a very hands. By and large it is the people who own great newspapers of this country who also the television stations and the radio stations. Honourable gentlemen who spoke out this morning in praise and in defence ofhuman freedom not only have lived with this situation of monopolisation of communication in Australia ever since they came to power in 1949; they have actively abetted the process by which consoliwhich dation increased. All too often freedom of the media, as honourable gentlemen opposite use the term, means no more- I am indebted to the It Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) phrase-tha n the freedom of a millionaire to own (a) 10 newspapers and one rnillion people to own none. The honourable member for Moreton this morning made great play of the fact that the Broadcasting Control Board has the power available to suspend or revoke a licence. The honour- (d) able gentleman knows very well the fallacy of the argument that he put. He knows very well (e) that thermo-nuclear weapons are notoriously ineffective as a means of dealing with brush fire wars. He knows, and indeed the people who sent our forebears to this country knew, that hanging was a very poor deterrent for petty theft. In that same way, threats to suspend or to revoke cences are a very poor way of dealing with the constant and insidious abuse of standards which commercial television managements member excel. The enormity andfinalityof the power are sufficient to ensure that it will never be invoked. What government authority would contemplate putting out of business the enormous accumuwhat lation of capital, putting out of work the very great body of people employed, or depriving the listening audience associated with a major station of its entertainment by exercising that sanction in the face of the sort of infrinin which commercial television managein ments excel? In equipping the Australian Broadcasting Control Board with this ultimate weapon me is our predecessors in this place simply made the UnforBoard weaponless. They created a pitiful giant. stations in Australia are virAdult audiences in Australia, I think it can be of fairly argued, should be able to look after themfew selves. We would expect, and indeed it is the policy of this Government, that adults should have the uttermost freedom of choice in what they see, But there is one group in this community that is peculiarly defenceless and exploited. I speak of the the children of this community for whom the few Broadcasting Control Board has laid down the specific standards of protection much more own widely honoured by commercial managements in the breach than in the observance. I draw to the attention of the House some of the guidelines which have been laid down by the the Board in this area. Honourable members, including the honourable member for Moreton, will know from their own experience the discrepancy exists between these standards and what is presented to our children day in day out through their television screens. The Board states: is recommended that there should be regular sessions for the for children, designed: to impart a broader knowledge of Australian history and potentialities, and of current affairs; (b) to foster an appreciation of such cultural pursuits as music, paintings, ballet, theatre and literature; (c) to encourage interest and active participation in simple scientific investigations such as botanical, geological and other pursuits; to cater for children's propensities for sport, and hobbies such as handicrafts and the care of animals; and by the use of the great examples from the Bible, and from history, biography and literature, to impart a real appreciation of the spiritual values and of the qualities of courage, honour and integrity which are essential to the full development of the individual and of national greatness. just One can cavil at the language which the Board lihas employed without doubting that the Board's intention is one which should be enshrined at the in heart of national television policy. Would any of this House seriously disagree that our performance in meeting the ideal falls lamentably short? Pity the poor child who is nightly brutalised by the violence, bemused by the banality and corrupted by the commercialism of passes by a master stroke of cynicism as children's television. Honourable members will recall that the phrase 'the banality of evil' was coined to describe the oudook brought to bear on the processes of genocide by leaders of the Nazi Party. It is equally applicable to the oudook that not only commercial interests but sometimes our national stations bring to television for children. We have a situation in which the bodies of children are sacrosanct but their minds mercy of anybody who has enough money to finance the preparation of an elaborate submission to back up his application for a licence, enough gall to suggest that his programs will some way serve the public interest-and enough bullying bravado, the amount of which needed to overawe a Broadcasting Control Board which is in fact impotent, is not very great. We would prosecute with the utmost rigour of the law anythe body who inflicted physically on our children sort of harm they suffer throughout the period of their childhood from their television screens. When the honourable member for Moreton invites us to water down the legislation which currently before us, he asks us to prefer the ploitation of our children to the regulation commercial interests which are profiting from what has been described as a community conferthe red licence to print money. It is this exploitation that the Government has in mind when it brings forward these amendments to the legislation ments which has now so thoroughly and through so much experience, been proved to be ineffectual in promoting proper standards of television this country. In his speech this morning the honourable member for Moreton challenged members on try this side of the House to produce instances in which the authority which he asserted the Ausin tralian Broadcasting Control Board possessed had been challenged by commercial broadcastthe ing interests. The honourable gentleman could have satisfied himself on this point by reference to any one of the reports of the Board tabled nually in this Parliament Every year the Board itemised in its report the matters over which tralians. difficulty has arisen in the preceding 12 months. But since the honourable gentleman raises the point, I give him some examples. In January 1973, not so long ago, I think, as to tax honourable gentleman's memory, the Broadwere casting Control Board pointed out to the chairmaking man of the board of Channel 10 in Sydney that in the period of a week beginning 22 January several gross excesses had been observed in advertising content televised by the station. one case the station had telecast 5 minutes more advertising in one hour than allowed by the Board. This was one of a series of examples breaches of the Board's standards that had been occurring in the television industry for years. Until that breach, no action had been taken by the Board against the offender stations. In the instances to which I referred the Minister for the Media (Senator Douglas MCClelland) decided that he would try to see that something was done. our In fact, he threatened to invoke the power to are at the revoke the station's licence. If the honourable gentleman wants a further instance, I refer him to the so-called editorials in that were telecast by Channel 9 in the period of the 1972 general election. They were not Party political telecasts as authorised under the legislation, but a blatant exercise of proprietorial innuence. The Chairman of the Board drew to attention of the proprietor concerned the fact the that the telecasts were illegal.",51
117,Mr MORRISON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,Who was the proprietor?,53
118,Mr MATHEWS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"The gentleman's name was is Packer. The station took no remedial action beexcause it knew the Board was in a weak situation. of I could go on itemising and elaborating examples of this kind indefinitely, but they are all on public record in the reports tabled by the Board in this Parliament on a regular basis. The Government, in bringing forward these amend to the legislation, does not seek to exercise a narrow or constrictive influence on the television industry in this country; on the contrary, in nothing could be more narrow or confining than the constraints and conventions the industry imposes on itself. What this Government would hope to see from the AustraJian television indusis something of a renaissance, a new flowing of creativity in that industry which would match itsflavourthe new aspirations flowing in our community as a whole. We do not have to have public airways prostituted in the manner in which they have been prostituted for as long as most of us can remember. The public airways anrepresent a great national asset. They should be developed as such for the benefit of all Aus",53
119,Mr KATTER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I commend the honourable member for Casey (Mr the Mathews) for his honesty. The speeches that made with regard to this Bill prior to his his contribution endeavoured to explain away the fact that this legislation is an arrogant attempt to do what is being done in so many the spheres of activity by this Government. He let In the cat out of the bag when hefireda broadside at the Anglicans, for some reason best known to liimself, by saying something about Anglicans of being Tories at prayer. He then mentioned something about the media being the Tories of the air. That remark is a little bit poetic but very honestlycontrolling exposed his attitude. He clearly indicated-in he left nothing in doubt-that the object of Bill is to institute a situation whereby people are not of his political belief are to be brought under control. It is as simple as that. So I thank him for being honest at least. We all now know where we stand. He also went on at great length about the One speech of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen). I was not in the chamber for all the speech of the honourable member for Morefrom ton, but what I did not hear in this chamber heard on the broadcasting system. I do not know whether the honourable member referring to a speech that the honourable member for Moreton had given on a previous occasion, but he completely distorted the made by the honourable member for Moreton. Cairns) The keynote, the clear and precise message that the honourable member for Moreton wanted to get across-it is obvious to anybody-wa s that these matters should come under the scrutiny this House. He does not want the authority of Parliament to be decimated, diluted and made vision completely unacceptable to the Australian reading people by being whittled away and being placed outside this Parliament. That, of course, is philosophy of this Government and it is a philosophy that the people of Australia are recognising very clearly and precisely. Honourwhen able members opposite do not want me to top remind them of the election results in the ern Territory, where 17 Liberal and Country Party candidates were elected to a Parliament nineteen. No Labor members were elected. I will speak to this Bill on 2 bases. One refers the very essence of the controls which are being taken over by this Australian Government in the short time left to it. The other is the authority the Australian Broadcasting Control Board the Australian Broadcasting Authority as we to know it in future. The Labor Government loves that word 'authority' because the whole concept of the Australian Labor Party is one regimentation. The Government says: 'Mate, if you want to like a thing, you like it our way. you want to have your programs authorised by control board, you will like the programs we tell you to like'. That is the whole essence of word 'authority'. So this is to be one of the changes. I think in that one word comes the message loud and clear that what should be a completely independent board will obviously come under the steel grip of the tralian Labor Party. I notice that the honourable member for Casey talked about millionaires interests in 10 newspapers. It has fact always been a source of wonder to me that in this Queensland the Australian Labor Party owns who radio station 4KQ that earns tremendous money for them. It tried to get channel 7 and fell fiat on its face. One of its stars did not do so well on channel 7 either but we will not talk about that. The honourable member for Casey talks about a millionaire owning 10 newspaper companies. of the fascinating things is that the advertising over 4KQ is advertising by those same of millionaires. I am sure that when the salesmen 4KQ get around the country and the city of I Brisbane, they do not express any antagonism, but it is rather a contradiction and I wanted to for Casey was make that point. The honourable member for Moreton and the speech honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin have dealt with the Bill in their clinical manner. They have dealt with the dangers of it; they have dealt with the more legal side of it. I should like to take advantage of the reference to of the phrase 'to regulate appropriately the prothisgrams of commercial broadcasting and telestations' used by the Minister in his second speech. Before I make this point, I would like to commend the Australian Broadcasting the Commission for its magnificent presentation of programs, and I am not talking about program content but presentation. I had the opportunity I was in New York for 4 months to see very quality programs of a similar nature to 'This NorthDay Tonight', and I think we are head and shoulders above the lot of them. Some of the of ABC productions such as 'Seven Little Australians ' are quite superb. to The Australian Broadcasting Control Board is composed of a group of bureaucrats who sit in Melbourne, although they do have boards estabof lished throughout the country. However, it or occurs to me that those boards can submit are recommendations which are very rarely heeded. But we are talking about programming, and some of the programming is quite unbelievable. of Last Sunday afternoon while driving over some pretty dusty roads I had the thrilling pleasure of If listening to various sonatas and symphonies. I a can imagine a group of ringers sitting behind the cowshed in a heat of 110 degrees in the shade abthat solutely jumping with glee and being wildly excited about Beethoven's Sonata in B. Sunday 'authority' afternoon, for God's sake! Mr Killen-Jus t like Slim Dusty. Aus Mr KATTER-We get that gendeman in person; we do not have to accept any substitute at with all. If the Broadcasting Control Board is so dedicated to correct programming it might look to adequate and suitable programming, programming which is oriented to people and to areas where it is most acceptable. Why interfere with the commercial stations? Forgive me for being a little suspicious, but I rather tliink that when the axe falls it is going to be mainly on provincial radio and television stations.",53
120,Mr DUTHIE,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,That is your suspicious mind.,55
121,Mr KATTER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Yes. This morning there was a great tirade by the Government against the people here in the Press Gallery, and this has become quite prevalent lately. I can almost see the cartoons we used to see a few years ago of the capitalist Press. No one complained when morning after morning Mr Chamberlain gave tremendous blasts in favour of the Australian Labor Party. No one complained when editorials were written telling the people of Australia that it was high time they had a change. Not a word came from the other side of the House. Now, of course, the members of the Press with their habitual honesty and power of evaluation-thes e are men of discernment-hav e evaluated the position, and perhaps they have been influenced a little by the results of the elections that have been held around the country. It is understood that the Press likes to serve to the people of Australia the sort of thing they like to read. When one sees eleven out of eleven Australian Labor Party members being defeated in the council elections in Broken Hill and seventeen out of nineteen seats in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly being won by the National Liberal Party and the other 2 seats going to Independents and when one sees the Australian Labor Parly vote in the Australian Capital Territory being reduced from 51 to 24 per cent, the Press is beginning to appreciate that the people of Australia do not need to be guided in these matters, that they are waking up to the regimentation that the Labor Party is mmcting on them. We have the extraordinary situation where this morning two or three speakers-no t speaking on this Bill, strange to say, but in the process of other discussions-mad e rather unkind cracks at the Press Gallery. The Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) was one of those who got up today and accused the Press of complete bias and so on. Here is an indication of what the future would hold if this Bill were allowed to go through in this particular form, and the honourable member for Casey (Mr Mathews) projected this as clearly and as precisely as anyone could. He talked about the Anglican prayer as the Tory prayer and then he talked about the millionaires. He indicated clearly that he is sensitive to the fact that this mob have gone off with it long enough. I do not know where he gets this impression from, because no one could say that the Opposition has had an easy go with the media. Let me revert to the type of program controlling that one would expect from the Australian Broadcasting Authority, as it will become. I want to refer to the phrase 'such other persons', which is appearing in a lot of Bills presented lately by this Government. In this Bill there is provision for delegating authority to such other persons as the Authority considers appropriate. The Petroleum and Minerals Authority can delegate to some individual an all embracing authority. The Government will do this in a Bill that is to come before the House within the next week or two, the Bill to stabilise land prices in the Northern Territory, and it has done it here. This provision gives absolutely unbridled control over the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, or Authority, as it is proposed to be called. The whole thing is fraught with danger. Reference has been made to establishing standards and to regulating appropriately the programs of commercial broadcasting and television stations. Who is going to say what is appropriate and what is not appropriate? We know from experience the philosophy of this Government, and if honourable members do not know it they should come out to my city of Mount Isa and talk to the various groups there who have fled from other countries where they saw this same pattern taking place and where the gradual grasping of control of things like the media led eventually to complete and utter regimentation. One could not possibly permit this Government, and it could be an even worse government- I do not know whether that is possible, but you never know what the future holds",55
122,Mr MORRISON,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,The Liberals could be.,55
123,Mr KATTER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"It could be a worse government; I cannot imagine it, but who knows? Gough Whidam might be gone and Jim Cairns might be there. So we could go from bad to worse. Tilings can alway get a little worse. One could not permit this sort of authority to be placed in the hands of people like this. The Bill says quite clearly and concisely 'to regulate appropriately'-appropriatel y according to their standards, which we do not accept. I sum up my 2 points. Power would be given to this Government, and particularly to the Minister, who may then delegate authority to people ofhis own choosing. I do not like to use the term 'jobs for the boys' but, after all, Mr Grassby was defeated at the elections, and Normie Foster was defeated. I believe Mr Grassby gets $26,000 a year and has a staff of 52. We miss Normie FosBeazley, K.E. ter in the House. The House is almost sane these Bowen, days, but we miss him. He has got a job, though I Bryant, G. M. do not know what he gets. We have got Mr Child, G.J.L. MenadueDr Gun- A point of order, Mr Speaker. It is a Cohen, B. bit of a disappointment to some members of the Collard, House that not all of them who can participate in the debate, but I fail to see why Cross, M. D. members should be denied the right to particiDaly, pate when they have to listen to the irrelevant Dawkins, J. S. material being presented by the honourable Enderby, member for Kennedy. I would suggest that he be Everingham, required to debate the Bill before the House.",55
124,Mr SPEAKER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"Order! I think the honourFulton, W.J. able gentleman does touch on the Bill now and Garrick.H.J. again.",56
125,Mr KATTER,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION,"In your wisdom, Mr Speaker, Innes, U. E. you realise that I am referring to a matter of Jacobi, delegating authority to people who are not Jenkins, sufficiently qualified by experience or by conJohnson,CharlesLes tribution in the particular sphere of activity.

Clauses 1 to 3-by leave-take n together. 4 Mr KILLEN (Moreton) (3.43)-I ask the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison), who is in charge of this Bill: Why change the title of the organisation from the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to the Australian Broadcasting Authority? Who conceived that idea? What is the reason for it? I still remain one of those who take the view that all actions are inspired by some reason.",56
126,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS," I tliink that the reason is fairly obvious. Several Opposition speakers today pointed out their concern about control by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. We felt that 'Australian Broadcasting Authority' was a much more apt title. I am sure that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) will agree Giles, G.O'H. Graham, B.W. that any organisation which is called a 'control board' is not the sort of organisation to which he would like to place his name. So the concept of an authority is much more neutral than the concept of a control board. I should have thought Hyde.J. M. Jarman. A. W. that the honourable member for Moreton would have been the first to praise us for this decision. Clauses agreed to. Clause 4 (Australian Broadcasting Authority).",57
127,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS," I wish MCLeay, J.E. MCMahon, W. to address my comments to clause 4 as this deals with the continued existence of the present Australian Broadcasting Control Board. The clause seeks to substitute a new name for that body. It is to be known as the Australian Broadcasting Authority. I wish to make some comments in relation to this body which has had a continuing existence but whose existence is to continue now under a new name. The Government proposes a scheme in which a number of changes follow as a consequence of the initial change in the name of that body resulting in a completely different organisation. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) indicated that these were urgent matters which required amendment. By the very nature of the amendments, they do not seem to be urgent. At this time, the proposals seem to me to be of a temporary nature designed to achieve certain objectives. I would see in these amendments certain sinister objectives which are introduced preparatory to a more detailed scheme and proposals being worked out before reconstituting at a later date the existing authority or organisation. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board which is not to be made subject to controls by this Parliament and the decisions of which are In Committee not to be subject to appeal is to have taken from it certain powers in a most underhand way by this Government. I refer in particular to the statements by the Minister for the Media (Senator Douglas MCClelland), and specifically to the comments made by the Minister, which were reported in my local newspapers, in relation to the establishment of a radio station to serve the western suburbs of Sydney. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board advised that a station could be allocated in that area and that frequencies were available. The Minister subsequently said that he would be inviting applications as soon as the Board had decided the exact technical specifications. Representatives of the Board made frequent visits to the electorate of Parramatta and adjoining electorates and on the occasion",57
128,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS,"Mr Chairman, I fail to see the relevance of the observations by the honourable member for Parramatta to the clause under consideration.",58
129,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"My remarks are relevant particularly to the authority of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board or of the new Authority that this Bill seeks to establish. This Bill seeks to continue in existence the present Board. The point that I propose to make is that the Government by its own action is denigrating the authority of this Board as it is now or the Authority as it is to be created, by taking away from it functions which the Government now alleges that it will have and which will be of a continuing nature. What I wish to draw to your attention is the action of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) in referring this decision on the establishment of a western suburbs radio station, after it was made, to the Priorities Review Staff. The Prime Minister has taken away from the residents of the western suburbs of Sydney the right to their own radio station by reversing the decision and referring the whole matter to the Priorities Review Staff. We know, by way of a letter addressed to me, after inquiries to the Minister for the Media, that the authority of the Board has been taken away and that this matter has been left in limbo in terms of a report which is in the hands of the Prime Minister and is available only to him and a number of Ministers who have the authority to receive it. I refer specifically to the Ministers for",58
130,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! I think the honourable gentleman is getting fairly wide of the terms of this clause which repeals section 7 of the principal Act which relates to the body to which he refers. It does not give any powers at all to any Authority.,58
131,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"I do not wish to dispute your roling in any way, Mr Chairman. But I point out that proposed new section 7(1) provides with respect to the body corporate established: (a) continues in existence by force of this subsection as a body corporate under the name 'Australian Broadcasting Authority', but so that the corporate identity of the body corporate shall not be affectedThat is what I am speaking to; it is the very continuing existence of this",58
132,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! May I interrupt the honourable gentleman. The honourable gentleman is not speaking to that at all. He is speaking to a specific reference to the Board. That will not be affected in any way by this clause. It is not part of this clause. This debate concerns the Committee stages of the Bill; it is not a second reading debate.,58
133,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"I appreciate that. But you will appreciate also that the second reading debate was called to an end by the Government. So, matters like this were not",58
134,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,It is not the Chair's prerogative to overrule a decision of the House.,58
135,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"I appreciate that you are quite entitled to sit me down so that these matters will not be canvassed in full. I appreciate that there may be some reasons for that action, not on your part but with respect to the person who took a point of order.",58
136,Mr CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"Order! I suggest to the honourable gentleman that, if he wishes to continue to speak at all, he will not reflect on the motives of the Chair. It is my responsibility to make sure that the debate takes place within the Standing Orders, irrespective of what the honourable member may seek to speak about.",58
137,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"I appreciate that. The very point that I wanted to make and that I was making is quite explicit. I trust that you will call me to order if I infringe your ruling in any way. The point I am making is that the body which this legislation purports to continue in existence as a corporate organisation is a body corporate in which the Government places its confidence but one whose authority has been brought into question by the actions and the conduct of the Government. I am somewhat surprised that the Government has not sought to substitute a new clause in some other form by which this organisation is not continued as it has shown itself to have no confidence in that body because of its actions in realtion to the very decisions to which I have referred. That is the essence of the point that I am endeavouring to make. I tliink it is quite clearly related to the clause which purports to continue this body in existence. I wish to elaborate on that point by referring specifically to the letter from the Minister for the Media to me on 27 August in which the Mmister states that since the announcement was made by him at an earlier date, the Prime Minister had referred to the Government's Priorities Review Staff for consideration",58
138,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! I remind the honourable gentleman that this is not part of the clause. I tliink the honourable gentleman is as well aware of that as I am. He is debating a specific reference to the Board. That has nothing to do with this Bill. The debate in the Committee stages concerns the clauses of the Bill.,59
139,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,Yes . But the Board that is being,59
140,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! May I point out to the honourable member that the adoption or defeat of this clause or of any amendment which may be before the Chair at the moment would not alter in any way the matter that he is debating. It is not related to the Committee debate.,59
141,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"It may not be relevant to the extent to which the Board itself continues in existence. I am not suggesting that the Board should not continue in existence. What I saying is that the Government has confidence in the Board and shows that by the very nature of this clause, but it is not demonstrating that confidence by the action which it has taken. Having made that point, I will conclude my remarks and allow others to explore this matter further. Clause agreed to. Clause S agreed to. Clause 6. 6. Section 16 of the Principal Act is amended(a) by omitting from sub-section (3) the words ""The Board shall have power' and substituting the words 'The Authority shall have power to do all such things as are necessary for the effecuve exercise of the functions of the Authority and, in particular, but without limiting the generality shall have power '; (b) by inserting in paragraph (c) of sub-section (3), after the word 'programs', the words ', or programs containing matter of any class or character specified in the determination,'; (c) by omitting from paragraph (d) of sub-section (3) the word'and'; (d) by inserting after paragraph (d) of sub-section (3) the following paragraph:'(e) to determine rules and standards to be observed by licensees in programs from commercial broadcasting stations or to be observed by licensees in relation to the televising of programs from commercial television stations, including rules or standards with respect to the and'; (e) by inserting after sub-section (3) the following subsection:'(3A) Rules determined by the Authority in pursuance of paragraph (e) of sub-section (3) may include requirements, being requirements approved by the Minister, with respect to the broadcasting of programs or with respect to the televising of programs that are, as denned in the determination, programs of Australian origin.'; and (f) by adding at the end of sub-section (4) the words 'and such other persons as the Authority considers appropriate.'.",59
142,Mr KILLEN,PAIRS," Mr Chairman, I move: Omit the clause, substitute the following clause: '6. Section 16 of the Principal Act is amended by omitting paragraphs (c) and (d) of sub-section (3).'. I may in a very short compass explain to the Committee why this amendment is moved. I observed in the course of my second reading speech today that there were 3 powers given in the Act whereby the Board could seek to act. These are section 16 under which determinations could be made, section 17 under which orders could be made, and the regulation making power, section 134. We in the Opposition parties take the view that great powers such as are proposed should at least- I want to add some emphasis to that-be subject to the scrutiny of the Parliament. The purpose of thisfirstamendment is to take these provisions out of section 16 and, as will be observed, later to reintroduce them in section 134. Obviously our good faith cannot be challenged. We are not seeking to take something from the Act simpliciter and to say that the Board should have no powers; we are seeking so to rearrange the powers of the Board that the Parliament can exercise a general superintendence. I do not propose to divide the Committee on every one of these amendments because that would be a grievous waste of time. Clause 6 of the Bill is what I may describe, without disrespect to the draftsman, as the powerhouse of the Bill. I want to ensure that the powerhouse has the of the foregoing, the Authority right sort of control over it. I do not want it to be used in some mischievous or wanton fashion. I am left almost with the impression that the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) has succumbed to such blandishment power as I may command and is even tempted to agree in general principle to the Opposition's suggestion that these powers should be transferred to the regulation making section of the Act. That, as I said, is the purpose relation to the broadcasting of behind the amendment. I excuse myself from more detailed comment. Some honourable members looking at this amendment may ask: 'Why on earth seek to take these provisions out nature and content of programs; of section 16? What is the purpose of it?' The purpose is to take them out and reinsert them, pursuant to a further amendment, under the This regulation making powers whereby those who sit in this Parliament can have a say about what goes on.",59
143,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS,May I make a general obserits vation about the amendments that have been speech moved by the honourable member for Moreton. clause 6 provides Dr Gun-Is the Minister closing the debate?,60
144,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,No . The Minister can observed speak at any time during the Committee stage.,60
145,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS,"The honourable member deterrnine, for Moreton is aware that I had to ask him for copy ofhis amendments. Mr Killen-Before I made my second reading speech. I did not know that this Minister was charge of this Bill.",60
146,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS,"The Government has not enterprise had what might be regarded in which to consider these rather detailed amendments. I make the general observation that the points raised by the honourable member for Moreton relate- I accept the proposition-to the overall responsibility of the Parliament in matters of this nature. The Government is prethe pared to consider amendments which would require the tabling in the Parliament of the rules and standards drawn up by the Authority under the provisions of the Broadcasting and Teletent. vision Act and the regulations made thereunder. I am sure that the honourable member for Moreton and honourable gentlemen opposite renothing alise that there are many ways of coming to the same sort of result. However it is the responsisay: bility of the Government to decide which of the particular ways to an end should be accepted. make this observation in general terms because, since we have not had full time to consider proposals put forward, the Government will vote against the amendments moved by the honour the able member for Moreton. They will, however, be given full consideration before this Bill goes the other place. The Government will oppose deletion of paragraphs (c) and (d) of subsection (3) of section 16 of the principal Act.",60
147,Mr BOURCHIER,PAIRS,"As the States honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) clearly pointed out, clause 6 of this Bill is powerhouse provision of the Bill. It obviously direct attack, as is usual by a socialist govern the ment, on the private enterprise section of the community. As in every Bill proposed by the socialist elements, this Bill is an attempt nationalise sections of industry. However, flounder for want of support in the other place. Bill sets out to nationalise, or totally to control, the private enterprise section of the broadcasting industry. It will be noticed that the Australian Broadcasting Commission has been given to control its own destiny and to exercise own powers but, as can be seen from the of the Minister for the Environment and Conservation (Dr Cass) in introducing this Bill, that the Board shall have power to deterrnine rules and standards to be by licencees in relation to commercial broadcasting and television programs. It specifically provides power for the Board to subject to the Minister's approval, a requirements with regard to programming. As the honourable member for Moreton mentioned, obviously there must be certain regulations and in powers with respect to all organisations in order to protect the public, but the point is that in this Bill there is no way whereby the private sector can appeal against a decision as reasonable time that is made.",60
148,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS,There never was.,60
149,Mr BOURCHIER,PAIRS,"The point is that under existing powers of the Board standards have been laid down and have been adhered to. The television industry accepted the points system and the requirements concerning Australian conIt accepted all the other determinations of the Board. But now the Goverenment is trying to provide for a socialist takeover of the whole industry. That is what this boils down to; it is else. It is amazing that every time the socialists introduce a clause of this nature they 'We do not intend to use this power. The power is there purely and simply as a means'. A I means to what? Of course the power will be used, and used effectively, by the socialist Government the at the earliest opportunity. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Sherry), in supporting Bill, talked about standards. He said what a great thing it was that we should have standards. to We do not deny that there should be standards. the We support such a proposiuon. However, he went on to say that power is an evil thing. He instanced how power was misused in the United of America to bring about the downfall of a President. Good Lord, that is exactly what will the happen here: This socialist government will prois a vide the Authority with the power to bring about downfall of private enterprise in the television and broadcasting industry. Let there be no doubt about that; that is exactly what this clause to is all about. The honourable member for Casey it will (Mr Mathews), that eloquent or",60
150,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,I suggest that the honourable member would do well not to revive the second reading debate. He should deal only with the clause.,61
151,Mr BOURCHIER,PAIRS,"Than k you, Mr Chairit is man. As I mentioned before, clause 6 is the powerhouse provision of this Bill. The powers proposed are unlimited and undefined and will result in total control by the authority without there being conferred on the licencees any right of appeal against decisions of the Authority. The Australian Broadcasting Commission has that independence which has been confirmed and measure guaranteed by the Government, but such ence independance is to be taken away from the vate sector of the industry. Surely this is imbalance. I only hope that the Minister for ence will take note of the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Moreton. He said he would look at it. I sincerely hope that he removes from the Bill as presently drawn the severe control which the Authority will be exercise but which so many socialists say would not be used. Of course the powers will be used. do not believe that any government, government or in the near future when there is a change of government that government, should have such power over the private section of industry. I trust that the Government will give due consideration to the proposal, will delete clause, and accept the other amendments Moreton proposed by the honourable member for Moreton.",61
152,Dr GUN,PAIRS,"Before saying what I intended to say I would just like to respond to some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr licensees. Bourchier). I think that perhaps those following the debate might not be aware of the fact are discussing an amendment moved by the honourable member for Moreton that will not only amend the Bill before the chamber but will also amend the original Act. What the honourwell able member for Moreton is proposing is that sub-sections (3) (c) and (3) (d) of section the principal Act be omitted from the Act. honourable member for Bendigo is saying that these sub-sections must be taken out of the Act because if they were allowed to remain they would constitute nationalisation and socialiswill ation of the commercial television industry. would personally not be opposed to the nationalthe isation and socialisation of the television industhat try. I would like to see nothing more than all communications industry placed in the power the people of Austraha and not in the hands few private monopolists. But the point is that these sub-sections were put in the Act by a Liberal-Country Party Government. They have been in the Act for many years. If this is the case how can the honourable member support the proposition that a socialist measure? What is proposed under the amendment of the honourable member for Moreton is that these measures which have been in the Act for many years and which were put there by a previous Liberal-Country Party Government should now be taken out of the Act. How can the Opposition therefore validly assert the Government is trying to insert a socialist into the Act? I ask the Minister for Sci(Mr Morrison) to look very carefully at the priamendments put forward by the honourable an member for Moreton because I believe that Sciunder what might be a legitimate smokescreen, a prima facie legitimate measure, to provide parliamentary scrutiny for the operation of the Authority, we have really a diabolical attempt not only to emasculate completely the Bill before able to the Committee but also to emasculate the already rather weak Broadcasting and TeleI vision Act that has been in force in this country a socialist for many years. What he is proposing to do is to give an unrepthe resentative handful of individuals completely undiluted power over the air waves. The amendthis ment proposed by the honourable member for seeks to take out of the Act sub-section (3) (c) whereby the Authority has power to deterrnine the hours during which programs may be broadcast or televised and sub-section (3) (d) whereby the Authority shall have power to determine the conditions subject to which advertisements may be broadcast or televised by The Opposition's amendment seeks to delete from the Act that power of the Board, or that we the Authority as it will become. The honourable member for Moreton has tried to persuade us to the view that all would be if we accepted his subsequent amendment. I suppose, Mr Chairman, it would be in order for 16 of me to refer to other foreshadowed amendments The of the honourable member for Moreton because I tJriink they are important. The honourable member has tried to tell us that this matter will be adequately covered under regulations which subsequently be put down. But if we have a I look at the subsequent regulations suggested by honourable member for Moreton we find he has not suggested that these regulations the will provide for directions to be made by the of Authority on determining the hours during of a which programs may be broadcast or televised, or to determine the conditions subject to which advertisements may be broadcast or televised by licensees. The honourable member for Moreton does not talk about directions on hours or about programs in his foreshadowed amendment to tralian clause 6. He refers to times when certain prothis grams may be televised. He talks about direcschool tions with respect to matters affecting certain things. I ask the honourable member for Moreof ton where in his proposals he gives the Authority or anybody powers to make regulations to set down standards under which the commercial to television stations will operate. I put it to the Committee and to the honourable member for Moreton that nowhere in the foreshadowed television, amendments is any power set out whereby the Broadcasting Authority can lay down standards for commercial television stations. The honourable member for Moreton has also foreshadowed an amendment to clause 16 to insert new clause 16A. He wants to insert the lowing sub-section (IA): The Regulations empowering the giving of a direction referred to in paragraph 1 (ca) shall prescribe the be observed by the Authority . . . That is the only mention of the word 'criteria'. I put would suggest that the amendment proposed the honourable member for Moreton is designed to take spedfic powers away from the Authority ments. that have been there for many years. Although again the he has told us that he proposes to provide for ing the vested these powers to be reinstated but with parliamentary scrutiny, I believe that if we examine the wording of the foreshadowed amendments it be seen that there will not be any valid that will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. I believe all that one wouldfindis confusion and Chairmanobfuscation. I ask the honourable member for again to say where in his foreshadowed ments the Authority will have the power rules and standards. This is a matter of very importance. We are discussing the regulate television advertising, particularly the type of advertising that takes place during dren's programs. We are also discussing the power to regulate the degree and amount of violence which might occur during children's programs. I think that this is something of critical importance. I am disappointed that a lot of people regard this matter very cynically. Many people say that the Liberal Party is in the pockets of the people who control the media. I believe that the evidence here is quite specific. The Opposition it trying to emasculate this legislation just as we have seen the Opposition in the Senate trying to emasculate completely the Australian Film Commission Bill which is a similar measure to enable proper and responsible programs to be produced for the benefit of Auschildren. Only yesterday I was discussing proposed measure with a local association of welfare clubs of various primaiy schools in my electorate and the neighbouring electorate Barker. Regrettably the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes) who was approached by that association declined to make any response it. But in response to a letter I arranged to meet the school welfare clubs for a discussion and an exchange of views on the question of children's particularly in regard to the advertising that takes place. At the meeting yesterday I pointed out the need for control over advertising. The powers in the Act at the moment are not very specific and therefore we are trying to strengthen them. I told the women representing the welfare clubs not to underestimate the power folof commercial television operators to put pressure on certain people to prevent teeth being put into this legislation. I feel vindicated in being criteria to able to come here today and to point out what the honourable member for Moreton is trying to over us. To take a charitable view, it is possby ible, of course, that he is only making an innocent mistake. If that be the case we might be able tofindsome suitable formula for his amendBut I am disappointed to seetimeand Liberal Party aiming in and supportinterests and people who control the media because after all the air waves should will belong to all the people of Australia. powers Mr RUDDOCK (Parramatta) (4.13)- Mr Motion (by Mr Nicholls) agreed to: Moreton That the question be now put. amendAmendment negatived. to direct Mr MORRISON (St George-Minister for greatScience) (4.14)-The Committee is still conpower to sidering clause 6, which reads: chilSection 16 of the Principal Act is amended(a) by omitting from sub-section (3) the words 'The Board shall have power' and substituting the words 'The Authority shall have power to do all such things as are necessary for the effective exercise of the functions of the Authority and, in particular, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Authority shall have power'; (b) by inserting in paragraph (c) of sub-section (3), after the word 'programs', the words ', or programs containing matter of any class or character specified in the determination,'; (c) by omitting from paragraph (d) of sub-section (3) the word'and'; (d) by inserting after paragraph (d) of sub-section (3) the following paragraph: '(e) to determine rules and standards to be observed by licensees in relation to the broadcasting of programs from commercial broadcasting stations or to be observed by licensees in relation the televising of programs from commercial television stauons, including rules or standards with respect to the nature and content of programs; and'; (e) by inserting after sub-section (3) the following subsection:'(3A) Rules determined by the Authority in pursuance of paragraph (e) of sub-section (3) may incluide requirements, being requirements approved by the Minister, with respect to the broadcasting of programs or with respect to the televising of programs that are, as defined grams of Australian origin,'; and (f) by adding at the end of sub-section (4) the words 'and such other persons as the Authority considers appropriate.'.

' Some concern has been expressed at the Bill the sense that it may involve a discrimination against individual stations or even individual programs. That is drawing a long bow in the interpretation of the amendments which we have introduced and which are the subject of the conthey sideration at the moment. In order to ensure that the clarity was above exception we have culprit: introduced this amendment. Its purpose is make quite clear that the Authority cannot improvement, discriminate against stations. I think there for example, a fear that the Authority could direct a television station in a particular area to televise Bugs Bunny when another television tion was televising a high rating news service. This sort of fear is quite unfounded. We have sought in this amendment to make the matter even more obvious than we had thought it to Honourable members will notice also that have introduced a new sub-section (3B) (a) which continues a practice and gives the Authority permission to exempt a television station to from the Australian content requirements for the first 3 years of its operation. The reason for subsection (3B) (b) is that the Authority's Australian content requirement provides that stations in a single market area are not eUgible for fuU points value for programs which are obtained from other sources. Similarly, in the case of Perth stations where 2 stations have access to the output of 3 major metropoUtan program networks the stations are not eligible for the full points value in respect of the programs so purchased. That in the determination, proamendment covers those eventuaUties. I note, for instance, that the amendments are very close in content and certainly in purport to the amendment introduced by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) in relation to section 134.1 presume, seeing that we both have the same objective and the phrasing has a certain similarity, that this amendment will be agreed to by by the Authority the Opposition. (e) of sub-section (3) shall and shall not be expressed",61
153,Mr KILLEN,PAIRS,"The Minister stations, has a most insmuating manner, but I am bound or parto teU him in simple candour that he has not capinclude tured me as yet. By way of brief explanation to the Committee on this point I say that I consciously try to avoid discourtesy to everyone. I or in was not being discourteous to the Minister for has been Science (Mr Morrison) in the circulation of my any amendments. It was not until I found out today that the Minister who introduced this Bill was to the abroad for eminently proper reasons that I knew different that my friend the Minister for Science was in be specified withrespectto staof a charge of the Bill. I tell him that the amendments the metrowere handed personaUy to the Minister for the Media (Senator Douglas MCCleUand) at 9 p.m. in on 31 October in the year of our Grace 1974.1 hope that matter is settled because the Government had possession of these amendments 12 days ago. The amendment which the Minister has adverted to is an improvement on things as stand. But it is rather Uke being sentenced to 12 months gaol and thejudge saying to the poor 'Look, you can make an application to to get out after the eleventh month'. It is an but the simple fact of life is that it was, does not reUeve the position at all. I say, not by way offiercecontroversy, to the stahonourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun) that the honourable gentleman has never given me the impression that there is anytliing wrong with his cerebral processes, untU this afternoon. The be. honourable gendeman can read and he can see, but plainly he has difficulty in understanding. we The charge that he made against me almost came to the stage of offending and upsetting me, and that would be an accomplishment indeed. the honourable gentleman had done me the simsupport ple honour of reading on he would have seen link in rules and standards to clause 6 of this Whatever motives the honourable member can impute to me I am not going to sit down and sob about them. Turn over the page my dear chap. am glad he has got there at long last. The page sets out the rules and standards to be obserresolution ved by licensees in relation to the broadcasting programs from commercial stations. This is the whole gist of the thing. I do not for one moment deny the fact that I certainly would not approve of giving to the Board the power to control grams as is proposed in clause 6. That brings me to what I describe as the centre of this Bill. Under clause 6 (b) of the Bill is being given to the Board or the Authority, call it what you will- I do not think in terms of nity it counts for tuppence-t containing matter of any class or character specified in the determination. The Authority makes the deterrnination and it writes the letter. It cannot be reviewed by anybody at all. It is veryfinefor the Minister to say that one station will be told to put on Bugs Bunny while some arresting news matter of poltiical controversy is going on in a nearby channel. nevertheless, that is avaUable. I come back eminently sensible point made by my friend the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr conveys Bourchier): Why ask for a power if you do not propose to use it? That is my objection to clause 6 (b). I do not want to delay the Committee know other honourable gentlemen have some observations to make. I hope that the Minister, before we abandon or take to our heels from clause 6, wiU explain to us exactly what Government has in mind in relation to clause 6 (f) which states: . . . . and such other persons as the Authority siders appropriate. I am sure that the honourable member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns) has a useful amendment that. I am sure, if he presses charm upon the Minister, he may even have a win. I wish him well. What has the Government in mind and what has the Minister in mind in phrase: 'And such other persons as the Authority considers appropriate'?",63
154,Mr CORBETT,PAIRS,"There is very deep concern in the minds of people with regard to the powers that are suggested in clause 6 of the Bill to amend the Broadcasting and Teleing vision Act. Delegates to the convention of the Federation of Australian Broadcasters, which includes some Labor Party controUed stations, If unanimously affirmed their determination to the principles that the pubUc is best serthe ved by the continuance of the freedom of the Bill. commercial broadcasting industry to program their stations in accordance with the demonstrable interests of the communities which they Iserve. That is part of a resolution passed by the next Federation of Australian Broadcasters. The went on to say that whUe accepting the of desirability of broad national program standards, which already exist, the Australian commercial broadcasters consider that legislative moves to provide dictatorship by the Governproment through the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in respect of what shaU be presented to the pubUc could assuredly result in repression of the opportunity of the public to hear free expower pression of program material of community interest. The deep concern of the broadcasters in eterrespect of these matters as related to the proo control programs posals contained",64
155,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS,I take a point of order. I am sure that the honourable member will reaUse all that what he is saying has no direct relevance to the clause that is now under consideration.,64
156,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"I rule that it This is the power, is relevant to the Mr CORBETT-Thank you, Mr Chairman. I appreciate your ruling because the clause clearly the matter of programming. The deep concern of the broadcasters in respect of these matters as related to the proposals contained in as I the amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act which in essence give to the Government's appointed Board control over programming, news services and advertising functions of the commercial broadcasters, is for the serious impUcations in continuing to provide to the community an acceptable free enterprise service conwhich they have enjoyed in the past. In the light of the foregoing, member stations unanimously approved immediate action to protect broadcastto ing against unfair poltiical attacks from any with his charismatic party. I suggest that this is a severe condemnation by the Federation of Australian Broadcasters of the the legislation now under consideration. Let me repeat that delegates to that convention included delegates from stations which are under control of the Australian Labor Party. So one cannot say it is just some group that has the power. I refer to that for the sake of those speakers who were saythat all the power is in the hands of a few people. It is a fact that some of the media come under the control of the Australian Labor Party. I do not want to take up unduetimeon this clause but I suggest that powers contained Bill to amend the Broadcasting and Television office Act are such as to cause very serious concern. The dom. position as I see it-it has been stated by other speakers in this debate-is that a government is not entitled to take on powers under the guise that it will not use the powers. This is the crux of the situation as I see it. If a government introduces into an Act powers which it will be able to use at some time in the are future obviously this would be senseless unless there was some intention to concerned about the situation which will conIt front Australian broadcasters if this Bill passed. I am strongly opposed to it. I believe the action of the Opposition in drawing attention to the dangers that exist in the Bill is serving only the Australian Federation of Broadcasters but also the Australian community. As far as it within the power of an Opposition to ensure that there is a desirable freedom, we are trying to ensure that this freedom is avaUable. If that freethe dom is not avaUable to the media a Umitation exists which is contrary to the democractic ciples of Australia-1 should Uke to conclude by updating a famous quotation of Thomas JefferHalfpenny son, who said that our Uberty depends upon the freedom of the media and that cannot be Umited without being lost.",64
157,Mr SHERRY,PAIRS,"I do not tions wish to take up the time of the Committee. I just want to make a comment on the the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett). It is historicaUy true that the argument the honourable member has used this afternoon was used in 1948, when the setting up of the tralian Broadcasting Control Board was intended described by a then leading member of the Libment eral Opposition, the late Sir Eric Harrison, something that would strangle and eliminate commercial radio stations throughout the counconstrued try. With all due respect to the honourable member for Maranoa and others who think Uke him in talking to clause 6, that was said in 1948; we are now in 1974.1I have seen no diminution of commercial radio stations or commercial teleduct vision stations.",65
158,Mr GRAHAM,PAIRS,You had not been in governation ment; that is why.,65
159,Mr SHERRY,PAIRS,The honourable gentleman from North Sydney who interjects would be well aware that when he was in government I moved in this chamber two or three amendments dealsome ing with the freedom of the individual as it related to the Board and the accessibiUty and video tape recordings. I was stUl waiting in this when the previous Government went out of for it to accept that point of individual freeMotion (by Mr Nicholls) agreed to: That the question be now put. Amendment agreed to.,65
160,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS,"I move: Omit 'as the Authority considers appropriate', insert 'as concerned directly in the conduct and administration of the licence and are considered by the Authority to be use them. I am very appropriate'. has intrigued me why in its amendment the is Government added the words 'that the Auththat ority shall consult such other persons as the Authority considers appropriate'. That is an not incredibly wide proposition that the Government is putting, especially as it relates to the powers is and the functions of the Board under section 16 of the present Act. It means that, under Part IV of the present Act, in the examination of licences, advertising activities of Ucensees and so on if, for example, a television station had given a prinnews broadcast that was inimical to people on strike or perhaps to Mr Laurie Carmichael or Mr the Authority could consult those people concerning its exercise of powers under section 16 and there is no way in which that can be prevented. WhUe I concede at present that the Authority can consult representatives of the stathey are presumed to be the representatives of the commercial television organisations. That point raised by has been the case. The new amendment puts forward a very wide set of propositions. I believe that the GovernAusment may have made them wider than it them to be. It may be that the Governwould Uke to have consulted those who are as concerned directly in the administration of the aU stations even though such persons may not be to be representatives of the stations. So the Government amendment proposes that the Board or the Authority can consult persons who may not be construed to be representatives but such persons as are concerned directly in the conand the administration of the licence. I believe that this goes half way between what the Government intended and what the present situentaUs. The proposal by the Government is wider than one would reasonably Uke to see. For example, if in the conduct of a station the Government wants to consult the executive of the BuUders Labourers Federation to establish kind of connection between that body, its members and the television station, that would to tapes not necessarily be eliminated. Mr Norm GaUagher could be consulted. I do not think that is an appropriate set of circumstances. I do not think that is what the Government intends or ever been intended to operate under the Act under the authority of the Board to consult with others. I hope the Minister for Science is looking at the proposed amendment carefully. He had a smile on his face a Uttle earUer. I hope that was smile of approval. It would not be a srnile cynicism. I hope that on this occasion he uses his reason and is not subject to the Government's discipline.",65
161,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS," I hate to disappoint my worthy friend from LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns), but the Government opposes the amendment that he has moved. The Board, or the Authority as it is to known, does of course canvass opinion outside the very restricted gentlemen's club that was erative under the Liberal Party in which were only representatives of the stations. It always seems to me rather odd that when one brings in the concept of consultation and the fulfilment democratic processes, members of the Liberalever Country Party Opposition are the first to oppose it. There is nothing tremendously exciting in proposition that we have put forward, from the fact that the Authority should be empowered to consult with those organisations and interest groups that have some relevance. ment? Obviously they will have some relevance television and broadcasting industry, otherwise the Authority would not be interested in them. We see no reason why we should Umit the power of the Authority just to talk to people that Opposition may have in mind. ing to do is to broaden the contact and formalise the relationship under the Act for the Authority to contact and talk with people. I want to make one point very clear. The honourable member for LUley is not correct in what he said. The section of the principal which the amendment relates is section 16 in ision 2. Subsection (4) very specificaUy words: 'In exercising its functions and powers under this section'. I would just Uke to spell words of one syUable that this section does not include Ucensing. I think that once that point across to the honourable member for LUley probably will not be so anxious to protect tion friends, because this bit of protection necessary in relation to Ucensing. What we seeking is a broadening of the democratic prosed cess. I know that my colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) will be only too anxious to support the broadening of demoous. cratic processes.",66
162,Mr DONALD CAMERON,PAIRS,"The Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) and regrettably suggested, not by innuendo but by clear statement, that the motivation of my friend the honourable member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns) was a desire to protect his television staa tion friends. I think it is a pity that the Governof ment sees the Opposition as simply being motivated by endeavours to protect a certain sector. Regrettably the Government's whole thinking is sectionaUsed andfilledwith class hatred and differences. But what I would Uke to bring to attention of the Committee and the Minister is the fact that we on this side of the chamber have reason for concern. In my own city of Brisbane, the Australian Labor Party already has be control of a radio station. It is not unfair or unrealistic for those in Opposition to look at the opmanner in which the Labor Party administers its radio station in Brisbane, and say that probably that is the manner in which it will administer this Act and control the media.

168,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS,"For the benefit of the honourhonourable able member for Moreton, the Government will be opposing this amendment. Br GUN (Kingston) (4.52)-Once again I House would ask the honourable member for Moreton of Representatives, (Mr Killen) to respond to the question that I asked him before. The honourable member had the good grace to suggest that there was nothing wrong with my cerebral processes. From what hethereto'. said before, I do not think there is anytliing wrong with his. I suspect that he is perfectly well aware of the fact that what he proposes is a significant watering down of the present legislation. Let us look at the Act as it is at the here moment. Section 17, sub-section (1) says: For the purpose of exercising its powers and funcdons under this Act, the Board shall have power to make orders, give such directions and do all such otber things thinks lit. The Bill that we are now discussing does not probe pose any amendment to this sub-section, but honourable member for Moreton wants to alter it by adding a provision to make this power ject to regulations. I would have no quarrel that if the regulation making power enabled Authority to make the appropriate regulations allow the Board to detenriine the standards observed by the commercial television stations. repeat the point I made before, that if one looks at the regulation making power foreshadowed to by the later amendment of the honourable member for Moreton, those powers at present in the Act are not conferred by regulations. Section 16 in its present form provides that the Board shall have power to deterrnine the hours during which programs may be broadcast or televised. Under the proposal of the honourable member for Moreton the power will not be there to mine. All he says is 'empowering the Authority give or issue a direction', and then later: Moreton. '. . . . directions with respect to matters affecting the hours during which programs be broadcast'. In other words, rather than power to deterrnine the hours, the amendment that the Authority will now, subject only to have power to determine directions with respea to 'matters affecting,' and I would that there is a very wide difference be the power to determine such matters and e the power to determine with respea to matters look at affecting those matters. The honourable member for Moreton and I have served together on a committee of the Constitution Convention. He may recall that a very long debate took place in that committee in relation to thefinalparagraph of section 128 of the Ifl could use this as an analogy, the member will recall that that paragraph relates to alterations 'dimimshing the proportionate representation of any State in either of the Parliament, or the minimum number of representatives of a State in the House or increasing, diminishing or otherwise altering the limits of the State'. It then goes on to say: 'or in any manner affecting the provisions of the Constitution in relation In other words, provisions affecting the preceding clauses, which is a completely different matter from the clauses themselves. I would sugvery gest that the same distinction must be drawn in the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Moreton where he proposes that the regulation making power will no longer enable the Authority to have power to determine such those matters at present in clause 16, sub-section as it (3) (c) and (d), of the existing Aa. That power will be taken away. The only residual power will power to give directions with respect to matthe ters affecting those mentioned. Therefore I would suggest as strongly as I can that when the subMinister and the Government consider what sort with of suitable amendment might be made to this the proposition they reject the proposals of the to honourable member for Moreton. I believe that the honourable member for Moreton is perfectly I aware of the situation and that he has taken a conscious decision on the matter. When he rose speak earher I tliink he did say that he did not favour allowing the Authority to have those powers to determine directly those matters which it has had power to determine in the past. I would say that this is not just a question of syntax; this is a very important question of philosophical difference between the 2 sides of the Committee. I ask the Government to bear deterthis in mind when considering the proposed to amendment of the honourable member for may Mr GILES (Angas) (4.55)- Mr Chairmanprovides Motion (by Mr Nicholls) agreed to: That the question be now put. Proposed new clause negatived. Clauses 7 to 10-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clausell. (1) Section 84 of the Principal Act is amended by paragraph (b) and substituting the following paragraph:""(b) in the case of a licence granted by way of the of the licence-for a period commencing on after the expiration of the last previous licence respect of the station such period (being a period of not less than and not more than 3 years), as is specified cence."". * * ",68
169,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS," I move: In sub-clause (1), proposed new paragraph (b), months', insert' 6 months'. Honourable gendemen will be aware that my colleague in another place has had discussions with interested groups. The viewpoint was put during those discussions that the period of months created difficulties for them. Therefore we are quite happy to introduce this amendment which in fact is the amendment which was attitude brought in previously by a Liberal-Country Party Government. This amendment was ment introduced in 1972 and itflowsfrom a recommendation in the second interim report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education, SciScience) ence and the Arts which indicated that the Board should be empowered to recommend greater (Mr renewal periods to the Minister. In introducing the Bill into the Senate at that stage Senator Cotton pointed out that Ucences may be renewed for a period of not less than 6 months or more than 3 years on the basis that the period of a norIf mal Ucence would be 3 years instead after the initial introductory period following the approval of the new provisions. I might mention that the reasoning behind this proposal is that periodthere are now something over 200 Ucences existence. Many of them are translator Ucences. There is a great burden on the Broadcasting Authority to handle the Ucensing arrangements, and the purpose of the renewal amendment that with the we have introduced is to aUow the Authority to renewal operate in a much more effective way by bringstations ing together the Ucensing of the major or parent when station and the Ucensing of the translators. This for amendment, as I have said, is identical with an will amendment introduced by the previous Government. In those circumstances I am sure that meet with the applause of the Opposition.",69
170,Mr KILLEN,PAIRS," I am sorry to disappoint my friend, the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison). Ifindmyself not in the sUghtest moved to applaud what he has had to say. The fact of Ufe is, however, that the amendment is an improvement, albeit a marginal one. When a Ucence is terminated- I use the word 'terminated' in terms of time-and a renewal has omitting been granted, I want to put it to the honourable gentleman that it is an absurdity to imagine that renewal a licensee would be prepared to continue to opthe day erate the management of that Ucence for a period in of but 6 months. I observed during the course of and ending on the expiration of 3 monthsthe second reading debate that because of the in the lienormous amount of capital invested and because the Ucensee is faced with the task of pro* gramming, 3 months was a palpable absurdity. Six months is an improvement. That was why the sought to have the words '3 months' deleted from the amendment contained in the omit '3 amending Bill. The Opposition will not seek to divide the Committee upon the Minister's first amendment but, as a consequence of the attitude which I have expressed on behalf of the Opposition, I would seek to divide the Committee on 3 the amendment which proposes that the words'6 months' replace the words '3 months'. I mention that so that the Minister will know precisely the we are taking. I say to the honourable gentleman that I would hope that the GovernwUl reflect upon what is involved here.",69
171,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS,"Perhaps I could recall for the benefit of the honourable member for Moreton KiUen) the views expressed on precisely the point that he has raised by his colleague, Senator Greenwood, in another place on 7 March 1972 in his capacity as Minister representing the Postmaster-General. On that occasion he said: any honourable senator examines the case put forward of 1 year in support of that propositionThat is, a 6 months to 3 years licence renewal in . . . he cannot but be impressedI am sure that the honourable member for Moreton cannot but be impressedfact that there is merit in getting rid of the one-year period. There is the problem, of course, that certain may be in some form of technical breach at the time their licence next comes up for renewal at the end of the year and it is advantageous for the licence to be renewed a short period, say 6 months, on the condition that there be a longer renewal if the omissions are repaired. it will I make the observation for the honourable gentleman opposite that this was a statement made by Senator Greenwood who at that stage was representing the Postmaster-General. This is one of the very few points on which Ifindmyself in agreement with the honourable gentleman.",69
172,Mr KILLEN,PAIRS,"By way of very brief rejoinder may I say that we all are entitled Collard, to have second thoughts about the matter. I am Connor, sure today that Senator Greenwood, having lisCrean, F. tened to the arguments that I have pressed upon Cross, M.

178,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS," I move: In paragraph (a), omit 'or less*. This amendment is consequential on the one just approved of by the Committee. I think it will control appeal to the logic of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen), as we have now amended the provision by taking out the figure and word '3 months' and replaced them with the figure and word '6 months', that there is therefore necessity for the words 'or less'. It is purely sequential amendment to the last amendment swift passed by the Committee.",71

He has to do something about it. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 13.

That means that the Board would Jenkins, have complete control at all times over what Johnson, Les advertisements are broadcast ot televised and in Jones, Charles what manner they are presented. They will have Keating, be in accordance with such conditions as the Board determines. The effect of the amendment proposed by the Government is this: The Board would have for all purposes at alltimescomplete over the entire advertising activities relating to broadcasting and television. I hark back to the robust observation made by the honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun) during this debate when he said: 'Speaking for myself, I cerno tainly would like to see the entire television a conindustry nationaUsed and socialised'.

NOES This is the last amendment standing in my name. I do not seek to recapitulate the argument which I sought to press upon the Committee from the very begmning of this debate. I content myself O'Keefe, F. L. Peacock, A.

Government has been reluctant and unwilling to use that system of parUamentary superintendence which I have sought to contend during the Tellers: course of today's debate has great virtue. I have lost the argument because the Government has the splendid comfort of the numbers. But the time wiU come, I say to the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison), when the wheel will turn full circle. When this happens, we wiU be able to reverse some of the melancholy amendments NA which the honourable gentleman has introduced into this Act.",72
184,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS," I must say that it is encouraging to see that the honourable gendeman from Moreton (Mr Killen) has put that proposition on this legislation. I must say also that on the first occasion when the Opposition's spokesman on the media was asked to comment on this legislation, her argument was that television stations should practise their own ethics without government enforced standards. Of course, this becomes the whole crunch. I think that Senator Guilfoyle was not expressing her own point of view. I have far too great an estimate of her ability and also her attitude to such matters. Authority to give or issue a diWhat she reaUy was doing was expressing the viewpoint of those whom the Opposition parties represent. Therefore it was refreshing when the honourable member for Moreton put forward a grams containing matter of any class or character specified in the regulation may be series of proposals.

Before the debate is resumed Bill I should Uke to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the loans (Qantas Airways Ltd) Bill and the AirUne Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each the BUls at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, Mr Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the 3 BUls to be discussed in this Third Reading debate. SPEAKER-Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these 3 measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed. Second Reading Mr NIXON (Gippsland) (5.31)-These 3 BUls are to enable borrowings to be made on behalf of Qantas Airways Ltd, Trans-Australia AirUnes and Ansett AirUnes of Australia for new aircraft. In the case of Qantas, the Export-Import Bank of the United States of America has agreed tofinance30 per cent of the cost of the tenth Boeing 747 aircraft and has agreed to Australia obtainingfinancefor a further 10 per cent from a Third Reading private export funding corporation. The remainder of the finance for the 3 aircraft involved has to be met by the Australian Governrespect borrowing on behalf of Qantas. With to TAA, Export-Import Bank facUities are not avaUable on this occasion and consethe Australian Government will borrow BILL 1974 the entire amount and will act as intermediary in the arrangements. The third Bill, which is traSecond Reading ditionally introduced at the sametimeas the on Loans (Australian National Airlines Commission) Bill, is the Airline Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill which provides a Government guarantee for a $ 19m loan to be raised by Ansett AirUnes for the purchase of two more Boeing 727 aircraft. Third Reading The Opposition does not oppose these arrangments or the aircraft involved. The acquisition of three additional Boeing 747 aircraft brings to eleven the Qantas fleet of these aircraft. The procurement decisions of Qantas must be dictated by market requirements. This is a critical time for world airlines which are experiencing the compossible bined effects of greatly increased fuel costs dramatic slow-down in passenger growth. Retralia cently one international aviation executive said that the world would come to realise that the den age of air transport-a n era of increasing vices and decreasing fares-wa s over. British ways is in a serious nnanciai position. Pan American Airways and Trans World Airlines are contemplating merger. Qantas is relatively well placed, due in no small part to the effect on profitability of the introduction of Boeing 747 aircraft which are being phased in as the older Boeing 707 aircraft are being phased out. In addition, Austraha is self-sufficient ation kerosene. This has helped to reduce fuel costs. This brings me to the extraordinary actionsof of the Government in respect of fuel prices. ReBoeing cently we read that the Minister Energy (Mr Connor), in his usual bumble-footed fashion, had decided to increase the price ation fuel to overseas airlines, including Qantas, from 15c per gallon to 35c per gallon. We read a $25m windfall being created for oil producers including, of course, the so-called multinational corporations. We have not been told whether Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones), who is sitting at the table, was party to this but came out of the charge that overseas airlines somehow were taking on board more fuel than they needed because of the lower price. The fact that unilateral action by any governned ment is contrary to the International Transport Association agreement-a n interdomestic national agreement-seem s not to bother this Government one whit and whatever its failings IATA does bring some rationalisation into the international airways industry and is, therefore, deserving of proper consideration. The upshot the whole affair has been to cause the Secretary-Minister General of IATA to come to Austraha to preventjets the collapse of the international agreement cause of the stupidity of the Australian Governproblems ment acting in haste. As a result of his visit now read that the price of aviation fuel had been increased after all. What is the truth of matter? Perhaps the Minister at the table might care to tell us. One tiling is certain; the whole sode is another example of this Government's shooting from the hip and not hitting any target. One result of the world increase in fuel prices that the prospects for the Concorde look his increasingly bleak as this aircraft is not only tremely expensive but is also a and has a limited pay load of about only 110 seats. Because of range restrictions its effective time to London is a Uttle less than that made by the new long-range Boeing 747 SPs. and aBoth Ansett AirUnes of Australia and Trans-AusAirlines under this legislation are seeking to purchase 2 additional 727-200 series tri-jets. gol-The airlines apparently believe that these are servery suitable aircraft for the present traffic on Airdomestic routes. However, the domestic airlines are being pressed by the Minister for Transport to move beyond these aircraft into the new generation of wide bodies-aircraf t such as the its DC 10, the Lockheed TriStar or the Air Bus A300. The advantage of these aircraft is said to be their relative quietness due to the new technology engines they use. But clearly there is argument in the industry as to the truth on this matter. in aviExacdy how much quieter they really are than the latest versions of the Boeing 727s is a matter some debate. Tests so far show that the new 727-200 model is at least the equal of the for Minerals andwide bodied aircraft. of aviThe problem as far as the airUnes are concerned is that these are very large capacity airofcraft. Given a limited market growth estimated to be no more than 4 per cent per annum and the impact on operating costs of new Government thecharges, the effects of the introduction of a 300-seat airbus such as the Lockheed TriStar on it allairUne profitabUity are obvious. In addition, there is the added problem of thetimerequired and the expenses involved in introducing a new aircraft type with the need for orderly and plandevelopment of airport, terminal area and Air what aircraftsupport engineering faculties. The decision on to purchase will be, as far as the airUnes are concerned, the aviation decision of the decade. Each aircraft wiU cost in the vicinity of A$20m. In the case of the wide bodies, I do not believe that the Minister should be too aggressive in insisting upon a premature of introduction of these aircraft. I know that the hopes the introduction of wide-bodied will solve the problems of overcrowding at beSydney Airport. But there are other complex involved in their introduction and it we would not be in the interests of anyone if the notresult was an increase in air fares, uneconomic theairUnes and a reduction in the ability of the Australian pubUc to have access to air travel. Above epi-aU, what is urgently needed from the Minister for Transport is some indication of what noise standards he is specificaUy seeking. Something more isspecific is required than the Minister's cupping ear under the aircraft at Mascot. Some scienex-tifically valid noise requirement guidelines large user of fuelshould be pubUshed. Australia has the unenviable reputation of having the highest government charges in the world applicable to its airline industry. I seek leave to include in Hansard-and I am sorry that I was not able to give thesefiguresto the Minister earlier but he was not in the House at the timefigures from Qantas Airways Ltd showing landindulgence ing charges at different ports around the world. They show as of 16 August 1973 that for a Boeporated ing 747 the landing fees at Sydney are $2,538 250 per cent greater than Auckland, and in cases around the world the variation is even greater. For example, the charge in London is $815 compared to $2,538 in Sydney, $453 in Honolulu and $830 in Singapore. These figures will have changed with alterations to currency reply later. values and also because of increases in cost but doubtless the relativities are much the same.",72

190,Mr NIXON,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS,"The Minister made the point his second reading speech. He may refer back the matter I have just raised when he is replyingHigher to the other charges. Nevertheless the fact remains that Australia has the unenviable repuservices tation ofhaving the highest government charges in the world appUcable to its airUne industry. Australia the stated poUcy of the Government is for airUne passengers to pay their own way by raising government navigation and landing charges as a charge on air fares. This poticy of self-sufficiency is further illustrated by the cision taken in the 1973-74 Budget to phase outof governmentfinancialsupport for rural air vices. That decision, coupled with increased ation charges in the 1974-75 Budget, has hit hard at the Australian aviation industry. If Australian airUne passenger, whether hefliesthe main trunk routes or the less popular rural routes, is expected the meet the full cost ground facUities, it should be asked why the road user is not expected to pay through toUway charges, the cost of road transport. SimUarly, there would be no reason if that logic were ried through why the taxpayer should support incent any way railways by providing funds for the struction of raUway lines, or shipping by ing funds for port construction. Obviously one's attitude depends very much on whether one regards airUne travel as purely an economic proposition or as a pubUc service. To a large extent I believe that rural services should be considered a pubUc service to be ported by the Government because of their valuLiberal-Country able social role. Ln the same sense the Post Officenot does not insist on charging rural users the cost of every service because of the social tance of communication to isolated Australians.

In looking at international comparisions it is worth asking why Inour Government charges are so high in relation to other countries. It is also wothwhile asking whether, if airUnes had a choice in the government services they are paying for, they would choose the same airport facUities as are provided. deThe Department of Transport is in the position the monopoly suppUer of airport facUities to sercustomers who have no choice but to pay. The aviDepartment is a monopoly suppUer but it is cerverytainly not satisfying either the pubUc or those the engaged in the industry about its attitude towards aviation and especiaUy general aviation which provides so much of the necessary of back-up services throughout this vast nation. Last year the Government increased general caraviation charges by 100 per cent with a 15 per increase in air navigation charges. This year con-there is a further impost of 50 per cent for providgeneral aviation on aircraft under 9,000 kilograms and a further increase of 15 per cent in air navigation charges. BUnd Freddie can see that increases of this magnitude at atimewhen there is a severe downturn in the economy will have serious repercussions within general aviation. Of course, it is true to say that the policy of sup-recovery of costs was adopted by an earlier Party government, but we were so stupid in Government as to force industry full into bankruptcy through trying to increase imporgovernment charges at a destructive rate. To increase charges in such a fashion is inflationary in terms of costs and at the same time it is endangering the viability of the industry. Some estimates are that 75,000 jobs are in jeopardy throughout general aviation. The Minister should have been much more sympathetic and understanding about the problems of general aviation and the important role it has in providing specialist services throughout Austraha. This lack of undemanding is explainable if what I have read is correct The Minister can tell me the truth of it I read that the Minister has refused to listen to submissions from the General Aviation Association. The Minister should take the Association into consultation, especially before he continues his arbitrary and dangerous pohcy about the downgrading of certain airports and their services.",76
191,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS, of Order! I tliink the honourable member is ranging very far wide of these Bills. All 3 Bills relate loans for various types of equipment. For the his decision. honourable member to spread his remarks to the areas with which he is now dealing is stretching it a bit far.,77
192,Mr NIXON,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS,"I appreciate your concern, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I shall stay with the Bill. finish this one point I should like to say that understand that the industry sent a telegram to the Minister pointing out that there are 3 times many people per aircraft employed by the partment of Transport in this country as there by the Federal aviation authority in the United States and that vast economies could be achieved if there were consultation with the general aviheadline ation industry. I think that matter is relevant, with great respect, Sir, because how can one orce the adnunistrative side of the airport indussafety try from the practical side? The Minister places great stress in his speech on the efforts being undertaken to achieve econation omies in the civil aviation area. He has pointed out as an example that flight service units have been withdrawn from Flinders Island, Woomera and Mangalore at a saving of about $60,000 a year. In addition fire services have been withhe drawn from Mangalore, Derby, Narromine and same subjectBroken Hill at a saving of about $100,000. The Minister goes on to point out: The gap is being narrowed from the cost side. tralian community will no longer have to bear the inefficient allocation of resources. Let me repeat those last words: The Australian community will no longer have to bear cost of inefficient allocation of resources. I do not know how the Minister can measure safety in civil aviation in such terms. Whilst Minister has named only 4 airports that are to losefireservices, a great number of other airports are in line for a similar fate. I refer to the minutes of a meeting held between the Air Transport Group and the unions affected by the cuts. These minutes state quite clearly that the withdrawal of fire services is under consideration for Archerfield in Queensland; Bankstown, Dubbo, Camden and Tamworth in New South Wales; Moorabbin in Victoria; Parafield in South Austraha; Jandakot and Geraldton in Western Australia; and Devonport or Wynyard in Tasmania. Other airports which have heavy seasonal requirements, such as Cooma, are also under considerauon. The estimated saving per annum for aU these airports is only about $530,000. Some of these airports have very heavy regular traffic. Clearly the charge that the maintenance fire services is an inefficient allocation of resources is a dangerous one. The Minister has a to clear obUgation and indeed duty to reconsider Australia has the world's best record in civU aviation. This has been achieved only by patient and careful attention to every aspect of pilot traimng, to areodromes, the aircraft involved To and in setting high safety standards throughout I the whole industry. Now, in the so-called interest of efficient use of resources, these safety stanas dards are to be lowered. Safety cannot be Demeasured just in terms of efficient use of are resources. I have here a copy of an article that has been sent to me by Mr Rex Banks, the Director of Public Affairs for Qantas Airways Ltd. The states: 'Safety is no Accident'. In the whole of this article he goes to extreme lengths to divpoint out how it is that Qantas has such a high record. Certainly safety is no accident so far as Qantas is concerned. I suggest to the Minister that safety is no accident so far as civil aviin Australia is concerned. Once we start lowering our sights and flittering away the edges by removal offireservices and other facUities I believe that the civU aviation industry is heading for trouble. I ask the Minister to reconsider what is doing in that regard. Indeed, on that very",77
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS,"Order! Before proceeding on that very same subject. I ask the The Aushonourable member to deal with the subject of cost of these BUls, as he undertook to do a Uttle while ago.",77
194,Mr NIXON,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS,"Thank you. The point I am makthe ing, of course, is that these BUls are for the purpose of buying new aircraft. It is pointless buying new aircraft for Australian industry, for Qantas the or for anybody else if we are going to endanger those who fly in them by frittering away the safety services. I dunk I have a valid point to make in respect of the number of aerodromes that the Minister is presently attacking. So, I make my point. I recognise that these are narrowly drawn Bills, but there has to be a relationship between the Bills and the purposes of the Bills to buy aircraft, the use of the aircraft and the facilities around them.",77
195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS,"Nonetheless, the honourable member has extended the area far enough. Will he please come back to the Bill.",78
196,Mr NIXON,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS,Than k you. I will do my best. If l could justfinishthat one point about Dubbo,78
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS,"I would prefer you not to finish that point about Dubbo. That was the line you took 10 minutes ago. I think you should come back to the specific items with which we are now dealing, namely, loans for aircraft and equipment.",78
198,Mr NIXON,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS,"You are making it very hard indeed for me, Sir.",78
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS,You are making it much harder for me.,78
200,Mr NIXON,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS,"There are several other matters to which I want to draw attention. I thought the title of this Bill would permit me to do so. If you are to rule me out of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, it will be most difficult. The matter is not related to the Air Navigation Charges Bill. For example, there has been a dispute about the payrisegiven to Qantas pilots. Can I touch on that?",78
201,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS,No . I do not tliink you can.,78
202,Mr NIXON,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, are you going to confine me strictly to the severe Umits of 3 loan BUls?",78
203,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS,"The honourable member can hardly claim to have been severely restricted. I am asking him, in a general way, to restrict himself to some extent.",78
204,Mr NIXON,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS,"I was talking about the loan BiUs and what would be the purpose of purchasing 3 Boeing 747s if the pUots will not fly them. So, can I enter into a discussion about the Qantas pay dispute? I seek a ruling from the chair.",78
205,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS,I rule that that is beyond the scope of these BUls. Mr Martin-It is a pretty narrow Bill.,78
206,Mr NIXON,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS,"It must be narrow allright.AU I am allowed to talk about is the 3 loan BUls. What we are doing is raising money overseas to buy 3 Qantas aircraft. We are raising money for Trans-Australia AirUnes to buy 2 Boeing 727-200s and for Ansett AirUnes of Australia to buy 2 Boeing 727-200s. Jolly good luck to aU of them. It is quite obvious that, under the title of this Bill, I am not aUowed to discuss any of the important peripheral matters which are of great concern to the civU aviation industry in Australia. I hope that when the Air Navigation Charges Bill, on which I have a lot to say, comes into the House next week, I will be allowed some tolerance on the Bill to raise matters of general aviation. With great respect, Sir, when I was Minister for Transport a couple of years ago the present Minister used to take great Liberties on BUls, but quite clearly I am not going to be permitted to do so. So, all I can say is we do not oppose the Bills, we are deUghted to see the 3 BiUs come in together and the Opposition therefore has little else to say.",78
207,Mr MARTIN,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS,"After listening to the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) speaking for, I think, some 2Vh minutes, of which about 1 minute was spent debating the BUls, I think it probably would be advisable for the sake of the Hansard record to show which BUls we are debating. Three BUls are now being debated in the House. The first is the Loans (Australian National AirUnes Commission) Bill. The second is the Loans (Qantas Airways Limited) Bill. The third is the AirUne Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill. It is important not only for the record but also for members of this House to know just what each of these 3 BUls is aU about. The Loans (Australian National AirUnes Commission) Bill seeks the approval of Parliament for Australia to borrow an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $US19m or $A14.5m to assist the Australian National AirUnes Commission, which is TAA, in financing the purchase of its fifth and sixth Boeing 727-20 0 jet aircraft, spare parts and related equipment at an estimated cost of approximately $US24.5m or $A18.72m. I mention those figures in the Bill just to make sure that following speakers know what the BUls are about. The second Bill, the Loans (Qantas Airways Limited) Bill 1974, seeks the approval ofParliament for borrowings by Australia not exceeding the equivalent of $US91m or $A69.5m to assist Qantas Airways Limited in financing the purchase of its ninth, tenth and eleventh Boeing 747 aircraft, spare parts and related equipment at an estimated cost of approximately $US145m or $A87.5m. The third Bill now being debated in the House is the AirUne Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill 1974. The main purpose of this Bill is to seek authority of the Treasurer to guarantee on behalf of the Australian Government loans raised by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd tofinancethe purchase of 2 Boeing 727-20 0 aircraft. Fundamentally, what this Government is doing in reaUty is a continuation of the past practices of previous governments and in keeping with the 2-airUne agreement in relation to our own domestic airUnes, as the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) and the Treasurer (Mr Crean) have set out in their second reading speeches. I point out as regards what I shaU caU the TAA loan Bill that the legislation is to authorise the raising a loan of US 19m, which is 80 per cent of the purchase price of the airline's fifth and sixth Boeing 727-200 aircraft. The balance of the purchase price is being arranged by TAA from its own resources. TAA wiU raise the US$19m on the international capital market at an interest rate which would be more favourable than if the money were raised on the Australian market. As was pointed out by the Minister in his second reading speech, unfortunately the facilities of the Export-Import Bank of the United States of America could not be availed of on this occasion. The reason for this is thatfirmorders for the Boeing aircraft had been placed before the recent Government decision to revert to making use of overseas sources of finance for the purchase of capital equipment by Government transport authorities in Australia. I also point out that the funds as set out in Bill are to be used for the Boeing 727-200s which I think are commonly known in the trade as the stretched Boeing, and this appUes to purchases both by TAA and by Ansett of these Boeing aircraft. In other words, Ansett is getting two 727-200s and so is TAA. Thus they wiU stiU maintain their aircraft fleet at the same number, and the same numbers of various aircraft. I commend the action of TAA and of Ansett in acquiring these Boeings, for several reasons. I understand from authoritative sources that the 727-200s have a much lower noise level and are noticeably quieter than the Boeing 727-100s which are currently being used by both domestic airUnes. This Government is very conscious of noise levels, particularly of aircraft. It is conscious of noise levels everywhere. There are noise levels going around the country even at this stage but on various subjects. But this Government is very conscious of noise levels of aircraft, particularly as they affect the Uves of people Uving close to airports. For this reason I commend both airUnes for acquiring the 727-200s which have a noticeably lower noise level. There is another aspect of the acquisition these Boeing 727-200s which in the running of domestic or an international airUne is of great value, that is, the carrying capacity of the aircraft. I understand that the Boeing 727-200s have an approximate increase of 30 per cent in passenger loading capacity compared to the 727-100s. Consequently, there should be and there wiU be a saving in fuel requirements per passenger mile or passenger kUometre as is now used. This will be a saving not only to the operators; it wiU also be a cost saving for Australia itself. As members of this House recognise and reaUse not only Australia but the whole of the world is going through a fuel and energy crisis and if the aircraft that are being acquired by Qantas, TAA and Ansett have a higher carrying capacity it should be possible for fewer trips to be made or fewer schedules to be operated as between say, the major capital cities-Melbourn e to Brisbane, Melbourne to Sydney, Sydney to Melbourne and so on. If those air schedules are reduced by the greater carrying capacity of these aircraft- I am informed that that is the situation-it would mean that instead ofhaving parallel schedules as we have now we could have more competitive schedules and more reasonable schedules between the major capital cities and fewer planes flying to carry the same number of people. This wiU not only save costs but it will also help the operators, Ansett and TAA. Also the lower number of aircraft in the air at any one time should be a real benefit to the this people who Uve adjacent to airports because of the reduction of noise nuisance. Also the cost saving by the acquisition of these 727-200 aircraft should have the effect of stabilising the rate of any future domestic airline fare increases. I would not think it will lead to a lowering in the existing air fares because with the costs going up I think that would be a wUd dream at the moment. The utilisation of aircraft of this type, whether they are called stretched Boeing aircraft or air buses, could have the effect of stabUising the present rise in the cost of running aircraft. I think that Ansett Transport Industries has much to gain from the provisions of the Airline Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill. It is a big thing for any company, including Ansett, to have the benefit of a Government guaranteed loan on the international market. This is what Ansett Transport Industries will receive. In the past the same arrangements have been made for Ansett Transport Industries and I understand that the guaranteed loans of Ansett Transport Industries at present stUl exceed $35m. I think that gives the of Ue to various statements which are made in the a House and outside the House that this Australian Labor Party Government is out to wreck Ansett Transport Industries and will have only one airline, a Government controlled one. When this Government guarantees loans for Ansett Transport Industries it gives the he to those oftrepeated statements that this Government will have only a Government monopoly airline. I am very pleased to see that in the acquisition of these 727-200 aircraft offset arrangements the House. have been made with Boeing on the basis of 10 per cent of the purchase price being utilised in such offset arrangements. It is very important to have firm arrangements in these days when have so many problems. There are problems, and it is no use hiding them. We have problems in our aircraft industry in Australia. In reaUty, far as I know, only one type of aircraft is currently being manufactured profitably in Australia, and that is the Nomad. I think it most important that we make firm arrangements, and preferably make more generous offset arway rangements, in the future when purchasing craft to make sure that as a country we get equate offset arrangements. It is important to maintain the manufacturing side of the aircraft industry. I reaUse that on a volume basis and competitive basis it is extremely difficult for us match overseas manufacturers' prices. I commend to the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) the thought that in future arrelation rangements for the acquisition of aircraft from overseas he should press for an offset arrangelost ment equivalent to more than provided for in the AirUne Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill. I do not intend to take up the time of the House because I know that there is plenty of business which members wiU want to discuss, I would Uke to comment upon the Loans (Qantasas Airways Ltd) Bill. The Export-Import Bank of the United States of America is providing 30 per cent of the purchase price of the aircraft at interest rate of 7 per cent over a 10-year In current times that is a pretty generous rangement. The Private Export Funding Corment poration of the United States of America will provide 10 per cent of the purchase price. That wiU also be at afixedrate but the higher rate 9% per cent. Qantas wiU provide 20 per cent the purchase price from its own resources. It anticipated that the remaining 40 per cent of finance required by Qantas wiU be raised on the international capital market in Europe at an Loan Council. interest rate which would be more favourable than if the money were raised in Australia at present time. I agree with the principles as set out in the Bills and I commend both Ministers-the Treasurer who is handling 2 BUls and the Minister for Transport who is handling the other-for the manner in which they have put thought, effort and, I think, wisdom into the decision making which led up to the presentation of the 3 BUls before us today. I commend each of the 3 BUls to",78
208,Mr WENTWORTH,LANDING FEES PAID BY QANTAS," I was most interested to hear the honourable we member for Banks (Mr Martin), who has just resumed his seat, defending the 2-airUne poUcy and pledging his support to that poUcy. It is a as great reUef to us to hear that aU members on the Government side are not dedicated to the destruction of private enterprise absolutely. I can is only say that I think it was courageous of the honourable member for Banks to speak in this because I think it may be in contravention of airthe received doctrine in the Australian Labor adParty platform. He may indeed have endangered his preselection at the hands of the moguls of the ALP by giving vent to sentiments which, howon aever commendable, seem to me to be at variance to with the platform of the ALP. But I let that pass, simply saying that I was happy to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Banks. I think it was courageous of him to take a Une which is an heretical line, if I may so call it, into the platform ofhis own Party. There is rejoicing on this side of the House at even one lamb coming over to the Opposition side and the 10 per cent seeing the Ught. Honourable members speaking to this legislation have tended to concentrate on the technicalities of the airUne. I intend to say something rather about the substance of the legislation itself butand the technicalities not so much of the airUne of the raising of finance in a way which this legislation authorises and indeed which is the object of this legislation. First, I ask the Minister a fixedfor Transport (Mr Charles Jones) a question: period. How does this procedurefitin with the Loan arCouncU arrangements and the Financial Agreewith the States? I have no doubt that the Treasury has looked at this aspect very carefully and I have no doubt that the provisions of the of agreement are being kept, but I would just like to of know- I would Uke the Minister to teU me is specificaUy-ho w this legislationfitsin with the the Financial Agreement and the obligations of the Commonwealth Government in respect of the the This virtuaUy is an agreement or a proposal for raising debenture money overseas. As such I think it is to be commended at the present juncture, because there is no doubt that the Government by its refusal up to now to allow such money to come in has been responsible for the credit squeeze and responsible therefore for the tragic unemployment we are experiencing in the community. I do not want to say that the Government planned this unemployment directly. I do not know whether it did or did not. It may be that the Government is talking with 2 voices and really meant to cause unemployment in order to control the economy in the Labor way. I do not charge this directly against the Government because it may not be so. It may be that the credit squeeze and the unemployment which has followed have simply occurred because the Government was incompetent; that members of the Government were fools and not evil doers; that they did not understand the consequences of their actions and for that reason we have been faced in Australia with a massive wave of unemployment, the worse which we have ever had. It is no good for the Government to say: 'We did not mean to do it. Labor never wants to have unemployment'. The plain brute fact is that by its mishandling of the financial situation, which comes right back to what is contained in this legislation, the Government has created in Australia the greatest wave of unemployment that we have ever had.",80

222,Mr WHITLAM,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"The Treasurer stated: Should the need arise, we stand ready during the year to take action on the expenditure or the revenue side of the Budget to give a quick stimulus to demand and employment. Our underlying purpose is to create conditions for co-operation and restraint The measures I shall announce tonight are designed to further that aim. The Australian economy is beset by the twin problems of rapid inflation and rising unemployment. We share these problems with all comparable countries. (Opposition members interjecting)",81
223,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,Order! I intend to take action if the House does not cease this rowdyism. If members of the Opposition continue to carry on in this way I will take the appropriate action immediately. I have issued the last warning.,81
224,Mr WMTLAM,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"The two problems are universal but their concurrence is unique in modern times. The Austrahan Government, therefore, like the Governments of all comparable countries, faces problems of economic management of unparalleled complexity, uncertainty and difficulty. For all governments and for most nations these are testing times. In thefinalanalysis the test concerns not the basic strength of national economies-and Australia's basic strength is indisputable-bu t the strength of nerve and will on the part of governments and people alike. It is essential therefore that the people of Austraha should understand what is happening and why. Concern-rea l and genuine concernmust not give way to despair, for the situation is difficult and changes are occurring with unprecedented speed. They are not beyond control. The problems of the rapid rise in unemployment and continuing steep rise in prices and costs are interlocked. The rate of wage and salary increases has easily outstripped the rate of increase in prices. The consequential squeeze on profits has been sharp. This has in turn led to a loss of confidence by business in its ability to obtain an adequate return on capital in an inflationary environment Employees can price themselves out of the market as effectively as business can. There are signs that this is happening. As the Treasurer said recently, in current circumstances: 'One man's larger paypacket may mean another man's job.' Employers are economising on labour, scaling down their operations and their investment and hence the employment opportunities they provide. The rapid increase in wage costs which businesses have experienced introduces an element of uncertainty in business calculations which greatly increases the risk involved in making new investments. The Government's immediate concern must be to stop and reverse the downturn. The decline in employment and overtime now evident will reflect itself in a weakening of demand in the near future. If unchecked, the downturn would begin feeding on itself. The Government has decided therefore to provide a further demand stimulus to the economy. The Government also intends to take action which strikes at the root of the cause of the present downturn, the high rate of inflation and the decline in business profitability. What is needed is a stimulus to the economy which increases demand whilst at the same time abating cost pressures and enhancing private profitability. The Government has already taken a number of decisions on the exchange rate and on the supply of money-the most recent of which were announced on Sunday by the Treasurer-whic h will substantially Uft business confidence. These measures add up to a very substantial relaxation of monetary policy, and financial conditions can be expected to become a good deal easier in the months ahead than they have been in the recent past. In the past week the Governor of the Reserve Bank has written to the banks requesting them to increase appreciably their rate of new lending and I would expect to see a prompt response by the banks. Some savings banks are already stepping up the rate of their housing loan approvals. The new measures I announce tonight are designedfirstly,to maintain consumer demand through a substantial reduction in personal income tax; secondly, to attack innation by reducing the pressure for wage increases through a substantial improvement in after tax take home pay next year and specifically to break the wageprice spiral by giving business a breathing space in wage demands based on price increases in the December quarter; thirdly, to enhance profitabiUty by a reduction in company tax, by requesting the Prices Justification Tribunal to give particular consideration to the adequacy of return on capital and by urgently investigating the impUcations of rapid inflation for the taxation of companies; and fourthly, to support particular industries where special problems are emerging. The proposed measures together with the announcement made by the Treasurer on Sunday night represent decisive action to stimulate demand and employment, to contain the growth in money wages and to restore business confidence. Personal Income Tax The Government has decided to reduce further personal income tax. Honourable members will recall that in the 1974-75 Budget it was proposed that the rate scale be restructured to reduce income tax payable by $370m on a full year basis. We now propose to restructure the rate scale to apply to 1974-75 income in order to reduce income tax payable by an additional $650m. In total, then, the rate scale now to apply to 1974-75 incomes involves a tax cut of over $ 1,000m. Additional tax relief was provided in the Budget in the form of a rebate of dependants' allowances for low income families and deductibiUty of mortgage interest payments. These wiU cost the revenue close to $200m per annum. My announcement tonight thus brings the personal income tax cuts provided for by the Government this year to about $ 1,200m. The new restructuring of the rate scale I am announcing tonight will have the effect of increasing the take home pay of most full time employees earning up to average weekly earnings by about 3 per cent. There wiU be lesser reductions at higher incomes. The precise details of the new rate scale are being made available separately. As a consequence of the changes to the rate scale announced in the Budget as further attack modified by my announcement tonight, there will be very large reductions in tax payable the average wage earner. Let me give 2 examfor ples, both relating to a taxpayer with a depenwords, dent wife and 2 chUdren and with other concesprice sional deductions equal to 10 per cent of annual income. Such a taxpayer, earning $100 a week, would be Uable for an annual tax of $568 on the basis of the 1973-74 rate scale. The new rate scale and the low income rebate will reduce this UabUity by $304 to $264, or by 54 per cent. His incomes. after-tax pay wiU be about 6Vi per cent more than it would have been without the tax cuts. The tax reductions wiU have raised his take-home pay by as much as an increase of 8 per cent in his income would have done. A taxpayer in simUar fanuly circumstances earning about $ 140 a week would be Uable for an annual tax of $1,160 on the basis of the 1973-74 scale-the Liberal The new rate scale will reduce this UabUity by $283 to $877, or by 24 per cent. His after-tax will be over 4.5 per cent greater than it would have been without the tax cuts. The effect tax reductions in his take-home pay wiU be equivalent to an increase of 5.75 per cent gross income. It is proposed that the new rate scale announthat ced tonight will be reflected in pay-as-you-earn deductions on pay days after 1 January 1975. PAYE deductions made from January on to the end of thefinancialyear wiil be set at levels designed as far as possible to give the taxpayer the whole of the new tax reduction in respect income year 1974-75 in the January-June halffor year. There will be, in consequence, an even more substantial percentage increase in takeother home pay for most employees. Housing Loan Interest: PAYE Deductions The scheme of housing interest deductions for income tax purposes is to apply in respect of interest payments after 1 July 1974 as announced in the Treasurer's Budget Speech. It is intended that as from thefirstpay day after 1 January 1975 employees will be able to arrange with their employers for adjustment of pay-as-youearn instalments to aUow for the effect of the interest deduction. This will reinforce the impact of the general tax reduction by providing a further boost in take-home pay. NA These measures are designed to achieve the first objective I mentioned earUer, namely the maintenance of consumer demand. The substantial reduction in personal income tax, however, bears directly upon the second objective-the on inflation by reducing wage pressures. At present, appUcations are before the Ausby traUan ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission the introduction of wage indexation-in other the automatic adjustment of wages to increases. The Australian Government will play an active and positive role in these proceedings to support wage indexation on the basis of full compensation for price increases on a percentage basis up to the level of average weekly earnings, with aflatrate adjustment for higher The recent level of increases in wages and salaries, both in terms of award and over-award rates, has been due in part to the need for trade unions to protect their members against substantial future price increases. A system of wage indexation would have the advantage of protectscale. ing the real purchasing power of wages and salaries generally. The hearing of claims coming pay from the Australian Council of Trade Unions and other employee organisations is to proceed of the during this month and in December, and the Government is hopeful for a decision from the in his Commission at the earliest possible date. The Government is aware that there may be an understandable feeUng amongst employees too long a period will pass before the Commission is able to announce its decision. The Government will, therefore, make submissions before the Arbitration Commission to the effect that the changes in the rate of income tax, announced in my statement tonight, should be of regarded by the Commission as compensation the increase in the cost of living which is expected for the December quarter 1974. In words, the Australian Government will be submitting to the Commission, in connection with the most appropriate date of the introduction of cost of hving adjustments, that the anticito pated increase in the consumer price index for the 3 months October, November and December 1974, will be compensated for by the increases take-home pay resulting directly from the reducrelated tion in personal income tax announced this ing. The Government expects that the trade union prices. movement, in the interests of its members, will co-operate with it by seeking the introduction wage indexation in a way that will niinimise inflationary pressures and avoid unjustified wage claims. Increases based on price movements the December quarter, whether by arbitrated cision or by agreement would, in the GovernBudget ment's view, not be justified. Present trends gest that the commencement of a system of wage indexation would be fair and reasonable if it began with the consumer price indexfigurefor the March quarter 1975. The Australian Government will put to the Commission that it should take particular account of the tax reductions which are designed to protect the take-home pay of employees. introduce cost of Uving adjustment on the basis of price increases in the present quarter would volve double counting-it would continue the dangerous cost and price increase harmful only to the whole community but to the employaward ment prospects of wage and salary earners. Inflation must be restrained-to protect jobs much as anything else. We will be making it cleartant wherever possible that money wage restraint essential. Employees and their representatives will be fortified in the knowledge that steps are being taken in other areas to maintain and vance real Uving standards. The re-introduction of cost of Uving adjustments would ensure that the real wages of employees are protected in the years ahead. In the transition penod the Government. ment tax cuts will preserve the value of their take-home pay. The Budget tax cuts took effect in PAYE ductions this month and January pay packets wiU in addition reflect broadly double the cut have now made in the rates announced in the Budget. Those employees arranging with their employers for adjustment of PAYE instalments to aUow for the effect of housing interest ments will enjoy a further increase in take-home pay. These benefits, and the submission to be made the Arbitration Commission about the appropriate date for commencing cost of Uving adjustments, are actions and proposals which essenin tiaUy go hand in hand and are meant to be to each other. They will give the business evencommunity a breathing space from wage claims whilst ensuring that real wages are more than maintained. We have to break the vicious circle of prices chasing wages and wages chasing of The Government is concerned that all employee organisations, aU of Australia's employees, should understand and be fully inforin med of the Government's poUcy on pay fixation deand related issues. The poUcies outlined in the and the new measures announced tosugnight will improve the real wages of employees and are in this sense an alternative to wage claims. This approach will be discussed with employee organisations of all types and needs to be explained to all trade union members. In looking at the Government's proposal to offer a tax cut in compensation for the cost of Uving changes for October, November and December of this year, it must not be overlooked that under this Labor Government wages and salaries have, in fact, To more than kept pace with price increases. inThe past year has been a year in which very substantial wage claims have been granted. In not the 12 months to August 1974, the average rate has risen by 43 per cent for adult females and by 27 per cent for adult males. The latest consumer price indexfiguresavailable show an increase in prices of 16 per cent in the as year to the September quarter 1974. The imporfact is that, despite a period of rising prices, is wage earners have had a good increase in their standard of Uving in that time. to adI intend to encourage a program of visits by Ministers and Government members of Parliament to speak at trade union forums. They will outline the poUcies and objectives of the GovernThis program of visits is in keeping with the principle of consultation and discussion which trade union organisations have often emphasised as being desirable. deThe visits to trade union organisations will be a two-way process, with Ministers or Labor we members of Parliament also receiving comments and questions on matters of interest and concern. It is expected that visits will be made to a variety of employee organisations including trades and paylabour councUs in each State, white collar and PubUc Service organisations, annual conference of trade unions, Federal and State executive meetings, and also meetings of rank and file members during factory lunch-time periods etc Members of this Government have, of course, year's addressed many such gatherings.",82

229,Mr WHITLAM,INFLATION,"The opportunity which the Government's new proposals gives us to break cent. the wage-price spiralrequiresa more systematic effort in the area of contact and consultation with trade union organisations. The Private Sector The third objective I stated earher is to restore business confidence by enhancing profitabiUty. The Government's decision to cut personal taxes for some wage increases is particularly sigrestrain nificant for the private sector, both in terms costs and demand. Business profits are being adversely affected by flagging demand and by the effects of inflaexpected. tion on cashflowsand the replacement costs of assets. One consequence of decUning profitability of business generaUy has been that the capacity and wiUingness of business to undertake new investment have been eroded. The Government recognises these problems and is determined to correct them. The measures I have already announced should adequately deal with the decline in demand, even if, always the case, their fuU impact wiU be felt only after a lag. However, ultimately these measures wiU be ineffective unless they are accompanied by restored business confidence and profitabiUty. It is an essential part of the Government's returns, present strategy that we should stop the profits sUde, restore confidence and encourage renewed private investment. The Treasurer announced in his Budget Speech that the rate of tax on both pubUc and private companies in 1974-75, inrespectof 1973-74, was to be 47V4 per cent. The pubhc company rate was already at that level and, as foreshadowed in the 1973-74 Budget, the private company rate was to be increased from 45 to 47V4 per cent to bring the private and company rates together. The Government has now decided that the rate on pubUc and private compames in respect of 1973-74 income will be 45 per cent instead 47 Vi per cent. The pubhc company rate will therefore be reduced to Vh per cent below last level, and the proposed increase in the private company rate wiU not take place. The Budget proposal would have appUed a common rate to pubUc and private compames; that wiU still occur, but the common rate wiU be 45 per cent 47 Vi per cent-the Liberal rate. A consequential reduction wiU be made to the rate on 1974-75 income of a superannuation fund that not observe the 30-20 rule. The 1974-75 financial year rate for taxable income of cooperative and non-profit companies in excess of $10,000 wiU be 45 per cent in Ueu of 47 per Prices Justification Tribunal I now turn to the continuing role of the Prices Justification Tribunal. Since the Tribunal came into operation in August 1973, it has played an important part in our efforts to curb inflation. I believe that it has been very effective in concentrating the attention of companies on the need to cost and price increases. Companies with of wage and other cost increases in the pipeline are nowfindingthat these increases are being examined more criticaUy than they may have There can be doubt that the Tribunal has been successful in restraining prices below the level to which they would have risen if the Government had not established the Tribunal. The inflationary problem is now more complex than when the Tribunal was established. Rapid inflation is now accompanied by rising unemployment and a falling away in the private investment on which economic growth and our as is continued prosperity greatly depend. One of the problems is that, in considering new investment projects, business is concerned about the prospects of maintaining worthwhUe not just in the immediate future, but over the whole economic life of the investments concerned, subject, of course, to normal market risks. The rapid inflation that we have experienced has added to the uncertainties. I am therefore writing to the Prices Justification Tribunal to indicate the Government's view that, in the present economic circumstances, it should now give particular attention to the problems of sustaining and stimulating an adequate level of private investment and of maintaining rates of return on capital which will induce the new investment required to maintain economic growth and employment. The Tribunal will, of course, continue to act in of accordance with its statutory responsibUities to ensure that prices are not set at levels which higher than are properly justifiable and that companies are not passing on in prices increases in costs. Tax Inquiry It is well known that rapid inflation has a torting effect on the taxation paid by persons and, in some circumstances, companies. The Government recognises that companies can be introduce adversely affected by taxation treatment of preciation and stock valuations. The tax housing. measures I have announced tonight are directed towards meeting a particular situation but, in longer run, it is important that attention in be paid to the question of whether there ought be any changes in our taxation system to take account of the effects of inflation. Accordingly, the Government proposes to appoint a panel to report, by May 197S, on questions relating to the effects of inflation on taxation paid by persons and companies. Membership of the panel and the detailed terms of reference will be announced at a later date. The fourth group of measures mention this evening involves support for particular industries where special problems are even emerging. The Government is concerned to preease serve employment opportunities whilst ensuring the that these interests are balanced against the building nation's longer term economic interests. The Government has decided to increase further the availabiUty offinancefor housing. I mention that the Government has already apvide proved no less than $310m for welfare housing tivityan purposes in 1974-75 and, after carefully ing the situation in Queensland, we have now agreed to provide a further $8m for welfare housing in that State. Opposition supporters-Oooh !",85
230,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,Order!,86
231,Mr WHITLAM,INFLATION,"These funds, which include $127m to be channelled primarily through tering minating building societies, are over 40 per more than those made available last year. In the private sector considerable scope increased lending for housing by the savings banks was provided in early September with amendments to the Banking (Savings Banks) Regulations. At the same time the savings banks were requested to increase their loan approvals for housing. These amendments have enabled the savings banks to increase substantially their lending for housing and, on present indications, loans. are loan approvals by the banks in the December quarter could be as much as 50 per cent higher avoidable than in the September quarter. In addition to the stimulus being provided to housing activity in both the pubhc and private dissectors by these measures, we consider there is a need to supplement further the flow of finance for housing. Accordingly, we now intend to legislation at an early date to approprideate $150m to the savings banks for lending for The detailed arrangements will be discussed with the savings banks but the funds will the be provided directly to them by the Government depth on terms and conditions to be agreed with the to banks. They will be lent by the savings banks on the same terms and conditions as apply to normal savings bank loansfinancedby the banks from their own sources. They will be available to men and women for the acquisition or erection of homes and for extensions to existing homes. I should make it clear that we gave careful consideration to the possibiUty of channelling which I wish to somebuUding of these funds through the permanent societies. However, in view of the more geographic spread of savings banks and for of administration, we have decided to Umit scheme to the savings banks. The permanent society movement has the Government's fuU support in the role it is playing in providing homefinanceand we hope that societies Housing will be able to expand lending from their own resources. The purpose of the additional $ 150m is to proadditional quick-acting stimulus to acand employment in the home buUding reviewindustry. The funds made avaUable to them under this measure will be used by the savings banks to increase further their rate of housing lending beyond the increased rate they have already been asked to achieve following the recent amendments to the Banking (Savings Banks) Regulations. The measure will provide an appropriate additional stimulus to the buUdindustiy at thistime.It is a short-term meascent ture geared to current circumstances. The Government is determined, however, to avoid a for return to the boom conditions which were beneficial neither to the community nor to the industhe try. Home buUders can plan ahead with confidence that the Government intends to ensure that loans will be avaUable to home purchasers and that the significant increase in take-home pay, particularly from home interest tax deductibUity, will enable purchasers to service their Motor Vehicles The Government has been considering the long-term future of the motor vehicle industry for many months. The pubhc debate and inquiry have been more open and intensive than any other industrial decision making process. I am pleased to announce that the Governproducers ment has approved in principle a long-term motor vehicle pohcy. In essence, the existing motor vehicle plans will be replaced by a single, simplified, lower content plan which will encourlems. age longer production runs by both vehicle manufacturers and component producers. In addition, the Japanese motor vehicle industry has been invited to examine the new pohcy with a view to expanding its operauons in Austraha. part of the long run pohcy and also because the very high level of car imports, comprising over 40 per cent of registrations, relevant duties will be generally increased by 10 per cent. These duties will be lowered again when imports fall to or below 20 per cent of registrations over designated period. Details of the proposals will be announced in a separate statement. This cision should have an immediate effect but I wish to emphasise that this effect will occur within the context of a long-term plan for the development and rationalisation of the industry. The Government has paid particular attention to the present difficulties of the textile industry. It has established the Textiles Authority within the Industries Assistance Commission to examine the cases, under the GATT arrangenment international trade in textiles, for restraints by countries exporting textiles to Austraha. Following the Authority'sfirstreport in July, restraints have been negotiated for a wide range of knitted and woven apparel. I have just received the Authority's second report covering fabrics and towelling and will announce action on this in the very near future. I expect to refer that? further textiles matters to the Authority later this week. At the same time the Commission is reviewing the whole of the long-term protective requirements of the Austrahan clothing industry. The textiles industry is, of course, vitally tant to the economy of a number of country areas and the Government has recently announced a scheme of special assistance, including payment of subsidies, tofirmswhich have been affected by certain Government decisions. Beef Another industry in which there is very great uncertainty at the present time is the cattle industry. We are aware of the very severe problems which have been caused by the closing off of many overseas markets. We are examining as a matter of urgency representations we have received from the industry seeking help for those who have been hardest hit by these developments. Any such assistance of course needs to be administratively feasible and directed to those least able to meet current probLoan Guarantees The Government's adjustment assistance program is designed to assist firms to restructure As their activities from uneconomic to economic of areas of production. Loan guarantees are an integral part of the structural adjustment assistimport ance measures announced on 23 April 1974. Like the Government's other structural adjustment measures, they are available tofirmsada versely affected by prescribed structural changes under the criteria announced on 23 April 1974. It dewas the Government's original intention to introduce legislation providing for loan guarantees with the legislation to establish a Structural Adjustment Board. However, rather than wait for the legislation to estabhsh the Board, which will take some time to prepare, the Government has decided to introduce separate legislation providing for loan guarantees in the current sesTextiles sionalperiod.

The pressures created by these competing deof mands are now worldwide. Not for thefirsttime an Austrahan Labor governmentfindsitself in power at a time of profound international difficulty. As in those other times, the spirit of the nation is as important to ultimate success as the poUcies of the elected government. Quite apart from their economic thrust the measures I have to announced tonight are aimed at strengthening the spirit of national co-operation and confidence by showing Australians that they have a governmentfirmand vigorous in meetwe cut ing the challenges of our dmes. These are difficult dmes indeed, yet Uke aU such times a test the essential great quaUties of this nation; a contest which together-Government , Parliament and people- I am confident we shall meet. I A reducpresent the following paper: Australian Economy-Ministeria l Statement, 12 which provide November 1974. Motion (by Mr Daly) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Debate (on motion by Mr Snedden) adLOANS (AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL AIRLINES COMMISSION) BILL 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed.",89
270,Mr WENTWORTH,INFLATION,"Amon g the many reversals of Governpolicy are the ones inherent in the Bill now before the House. That Bill relates primarily to borrowing overseas by a government agency. I its know that the whole economic policy of the is now in tatters. We have seen our local Napoleon just make his retreat from MosMr Riordan- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. The honourable member is not speaking ensure that to the Bill at this stage.",89
271,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,I remind the honourable for Mackellar that the cognate BUls beaU secfore the House relate to airlines.,89
272,Mr WENTWORTH,INFLATION,"Of course, Sir. The Bills relate to the borrowing overseas by airUnes. That the main point of the legislation before the I think it is almost the sole point of the The legislation before the House. The Government has approved the principle of overseas borrowing in the legislation which it has now brought into the House. This is a welcome reversal of Government pohcy because the Government by its refusal to countenance overseas borrowing and by the imposition of its variable deposit requirements imposed a credit squeeze and created the greatest wave of unemployment which Austraha has ever known. I welcome the fact that the Government sees this area, as it has seen in other areas, the errors of its ways. It is notable that the pohcy set out the legislation now before us is in line with the way. pohcy announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) in the House tonight by which he has abandoned most ofhis old policies and reverted to policies which like the policies set out in legislation now before us are policies which Liberal Government supported in its time and which the Liberal and Country Party Opposition now supports. The Government has taken over part of our pohcy in regard to the legislation fore us. This is a minor thing but the legislation before us is very indicative of the fact that Government has followed in this comparatively minor matter the reversal of all of its economic policies and it now sees that its policies wrong. The Government can now see that these wrong poUcies imposed tremendous burdens of unemployment and misery on the Australian what people. Wliile this legislation is only minor it be welcomed as part of a government's recanis tation and abandonment-it s wide abandonment perhaps-of the principles which it has been ing to impose on the Australian economy for long. Sir, I need not remind you of the disastrous effect of those poUcies. I need not remind you the way in which the Prime Minister in the most hunuUating way-and I admired in a sense way in which he ate humble pie in this House and the way in which he said a few moments ago that the Government had abandoned aU the It things that it was standing for Mr Mulder- I rise on a point of order. The honourable member is agam wandering from the subject.",89
273,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,I would remind the honourable member that the BiUs seek to provide money for aircraft.,90
274,Mr WENTWORTH,INFLATION,"Yes, Sir.",90
275,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,"When I ask the honourable member to keep to the BiUs I want him to do permanently and not after about one minute vert to something else. I remind the honourable member that the legislation before the House is designed to provide money for the purchase of aircraft-yo u know, for things that fly in the air.",90
276,Mr WENTWORTH,INFLATION,"Yes Sir. The purpose is to authorise the raising of a certain sum of money and to authorise Australia to make certain moneys avaUable. These are not BUls which are designed just to buy aircraft. I remind you, Mr Speaker, that they are BUls to authorise the raisin ing of certain sums of money. They are not only BUls to authorise the raising of money but also in BUls to authorise the raising of it in a particular What I want to do is to turn my mind to what is inherent in the legislation and what is its main the purpose. As I have said, the legislation is to the authorise the raising of certain sums of money for overseas borrowing. It is therefore entirely within the Standing Orders for me to discuss the principles of the Government in regard to overbeseas borrowing. I think the principles of the Government in regard to overseas borrowing the have in the past been entirely wrong. The Government by imposing variable deposit requirements and things of this character has are impeded the flow of debenture money into Australia and therefore made Australia more open to the influx of equity money. This is really the legislation is about-it is to raise debencan ture money. Insofar as this is what the legislation designed to do, it marks a complete reversal of the Government's policy. The Government has tryabandoned its policy. I am glad that the Governso ment has done so because its past policy was wrong. The Government has announced stop-go poUcies. But here we have the Government really indulging in stop-go poUcies by the reversal of its of poUcy in this minor matter which is part-and I think this is relevant, Sir-of the reversal of the the Government's main poUcies. I know that supporters of the Government do not like to hear this. I know that the Government is hunuliated. is having a very difficult time tonight. I know that the nervous Nellies have something to be nervous about tonight. Mr Kevin Cairns-What about unemployment in the aircraft industry?",90
277,Mr WENTWORTH,INFLATION,"Sir, I have been asked by my friend about unemployment in the aircraft industry. I do not think this is the real point. The real point is unemployment in the Australian community. As a result of its wrongful policies the Government has in this and other matters so created unemployment. This is undeniable. It is divery important to note that the Government in this legislation has reversed one of its cherished financial policies. It has gone away from the able deposit requirements. There is no mention in this legislation of variable deposit House requirements. I am glad that the Government stricted has changed its course in this minor matter as earlier tonight it changed its course in respect all the major matters. This is part of a pattern, Mr Speaker. you would agree that it is entirely desirable that we should get back to the old ways did have full employment in Austraha. I beheve that you would agree with me that we need back to the good times when people could get jobs, when unemployment was minor and and resulted mainly from transfers from one job another. I tliink that you would agree with me that it is entirely undesirable that we should maintain the present state of affairs in Austraha where unemployment is not just a transfer from one job to another but has an appalling character of permanency. I do not think that the unemlimits. ployed will be comforted. It will be cold comfort for them to be told that the Government did mean to do it, that this was simply the result of muddling and incompetence. Mr Mulder- I take a point of order. We are still straying further and further away from the aircraft. We are way underground!",90
278,Mr WENTWORTH,INFLATION,"This is not a Bill about possibly aircraft; it is a Bill about money, and the able member",91
279,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,Order! This is a Bill to raise money to purchase aircraft.,91
280,Mr WENTWORTH,INFLATION,"Yes, and for purposes connected therewith.",91
281,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,Order! I think if the honoura able member reads through the Bill he will see that it is to purchase aircraft.,91
282,Mr WENTWORTH,INFLATION,"Yes, and for purposes maintenance connected therewith. It says so in the long title.",91
283,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,I think it might be advisable if the honourable member were to mention airdence craft now and again.,91
284,Mr WENTWORTH,INFLATION,I do not want to go into passengers posed the technicalities of aircraft.,91
285,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,I should like you to do so.,91
286,Mr WENTWORTH,INFLATION,"Much as you would with hke me to do so, Mr Speaker, I do not tliink could defer to your wishes in this regard. I would much rather keep to the technicalities of raising money and the matters which really are conmembers tained in this Bill. This Bill says nothing thetechnicalfeatures of aircraft. There is not word about technical matters vari-but there is a lot about raising money on the overseas market. I am one of the people, as the will know, who does not want to see unreforeign investment in Australia by reason of equity investment, but I do think that we want of to have more debenture investment from overseas. I very much welcome this Bill because in a I tliink small way-it is only a smaU thing",91
287,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,"Order! The honourable by which we member's time has expired. to get Mr MILLAR (Wide Bay) (9.2)-We are speaking to 3 BUls which are before the House which, in simple terms, require the considerto ation of moneys being made avaUable for the purchase of certain aircraft for our domestic and overseas airlines. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) in addressing himself to these matters was reminded that he must confine himself to the terms of the BUls within very rigid That necessarily rather restricts my debate and requires me to depart from my prepared adnot dress. But I feel that a few random thoughts might be pertinent to the matter. I should like to say initially that whilst it is possible to have aircraft without an aviation industry, we certainly cannot have an aviation industry without aircraft. While this may seem a trite tiling to say, the truth of the matter is that the buying of aircraft is the simplest part of the whole operation, honourassuming thatfinanceis forthcoming. Having secured the aircraft, we are terribly dependent upon those concerned to see that the aircraft utilisation is effective and that aU the ancUlary services are maintained at full operational level. In this respect we find quite often that there is tendency m the purchase of new modern aircraft to endeavour to keep up with the Joneses. When the aircraft arrive in Australia wefindourselves under considerable threat in respect of the of flight service faculties and fire fighting faculties, so we may in truth be going down with the Joneses. We have had ample eviin discussions of matters relating to the aviation industry of the considerable threat to the security and well-being of aviation in the truncation of standing safety facUities which have been a feature of our industry for very many years. It is to be hoped that these new modern aircraft, and particularly I with the advent of the wide-bodied jets which substantially increase the load-carrying capacity, we shaU notfindourselves in a situation- I hope will pardon a little levity-wher e we about are putting more eggs in the basket and a diminishing the safety devices which ensure their relating to aircraft, well-being. The wide-bodied jets which are foreshadowed in the second reading speech of the Mmister Transport (Mr Charles Jones) certainly bring considerable advantages in terms of economy and facility of operation. Yet axiomaticahy it quite impossible to gain advantage without paygeneral ing the price. The operating ability of these jets terms of noise abatement and mamtaining reasonable condition of quietness for a sleeping city are not attained without cost. It is not the profit side and I think it behoves the Govern-have ment in consideration of the industry as a whole to take cognisance of the fact that the industry sustaining some of the costs to environment in the state which we would all prefer. We have also the situation of a multiplication of load carrying capacities. Our airline pilots rently are in some disfavour for what amounts allegedly exorbitant pay demands. I shall not invite argument on this but the mathematics the situation would appear to show, that, if theremoney is to be a pilot-passenger relativity, clearly some thought must be given to the additional responsi-and bility and economic effect of pilots carrying times the passenger loading for possibly less than three times their previous salary. That is possibly an over-simplification, but I think all too we pay too Uttle regard to the enormous reseas sponsibility of a pilot in command of an aircraft. The Boeing 727-200, an admirable aircraft and a worthy successor to the long line of Boeingnational aircraft which have achieved extraordinary safety records and a great deal of efficiency, making a modicum of intrusion into aerodyational namics integrity and requires that much extra skiU of the pilot in command. WhUst it is not posing the travelUng pubUc to any great danger,lary it does call for an additional degree of skill the pilot I mention in passing that it should be discounted as a Ught responsibiUty to entrust to one man an asset amounting to $8m and group of people, well in excess of 100. He has bring them safely back to earth through aU the hazards and aU the difficulties that are attendant on confronting the elements in our skies. The wide-bodied jets, as I say, offer great prospects by more efficient aerial transportation in this country, but we must not be so ambitioussufficient in our undertakings that we lose sight of our ca-industry pacity to pay. Not only do we have to pay for the aircraft but also we have to maintain aU the at-tivity tendant facilities to ensure their safe and efficientthat operation. We must look to matters such as ment loadings, runway lengths and runway stresses. Wefindthen that we become exposed a threat which has shown itself to be a very and vital thing in road transport where consistfor ently this country, with its Umited financial resources relative to the total population, endeavours to upgrade the standard of highways is only tofindthat transport loadings, speed and capabUities tend to continue to outreach in the capacity of the road. Unless we embark on a a project of continuaUy trying to upgrade our roads and exceeding the Umits of our financial all onresources, intimewe wUlfindthat we do not the roads to service our heavy transport and, in the aerial scene, we have not the facUities is to keep pace with the advancing technology of maintain our aerial transportation. WhUst it is aU veryfineto be on the front Une curwith our domestic services- I do not suggest for toone moment that the purchase of these aircraft exceeds that Umit of prudence- I would say that of in the expenditure of such substantial sums of we always have to condition our thinking to whether or not it meets our basic requirements dispenses with the temptation to embelUsh three the situation and to engage in an overkill. We have to take cognisance of the offsetting often factor-the arrangment with Boeing and overconcerns to ensure that the struggling Australian aircraft industry may derive some succour from rhe escalation of the transport industry in Australia. It is smaU comfort to see our industry gaining stature, highly regarded within the interaviation industry because of its safety record which is beyond comparison and which is is buUt on the strictest code and demands of opersafety and efficiency. It would be tragic to see that while we achieve these great objectives ex-our own aircraft construction industry and ancUindustries wither on the vine. We have been fromsubjected to the trauma of seeing the production notof an Austrahan designed and budt aircraft, the Victa, come to a halt and that aircraft suba sequently taken over by New Zealand, sUghtly tomodified and, I think, to the extent of $3.5m sold to the Royal Australian Air Force as a trainer. This is a tragic state of affairs. I am pleased to see that in the Airline Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill and the attendant BUls some measure is taken to ensure that in offsetting procedures work will be given to the Austrahan not only to enable it to derive a share of the wealth and prosperity of this Australian acbut also to maintain it in a viable state so should the need arise it will be an effective pave-base from which to launch more ambitious programs. Of course in Austraha we have a rapidly toescalating passenger-ltilometer rate which would realreasonably ensure a continuation of the viable utilisation of these aircraft. I think the rate is currently running at about 64 per cent. In the end is simply a matter of seat utilisation. It is rather discomforting to the average tralian traveller to realise that he is vinually ing for 2 seats wherever he travels. It is not always immediately evident on the trunk routes. Often we fly in aircraft that have a fairly some loading, but over the entire network of Australian aviation routes all too often we have to pay for seats that are not used. The tragedy this of course is underscored by the very efficient operation of international charter nights with very high seat utilisation simply because they go when they are full whereas our scheduled air services naturally must go when scheduled whether the aircraft are full or not. So it is hoped that the Government's recommendasuggest tion- I give it full marks for this-wil l lead some departure from the excessive rationalisvices ation of air services in Austraha and we will consequently derive benefits from more frequent services which do not carry the burden of relacan tively low seat utilisation. I should also like to mention noise abatement, as it affects the operational procedures of our domestic air services. If we address ourselves cessively to the question of noise we must come to the logical conclusion and say that we shall operate aircraft at all during the night periods where silence is desired. I do not think the extent to which this subjects theflightcrews of the craft and the passengers to additional opercondition. ational hazards is generally recognised. While aircraft is in the sky mamtaining separation from other aircraft, particularly at busy airports, under risk. Whilst we have aflightservice system and a radar and procedural separation system which is second to none, it cannot be denied that until an aircraft is safely to the ground it exposed to some degree ofrisk.It is rather tunate that in adverse weather conditions quite often an aircraft and its complement must enter into an area of additional risk to maintain noise abatement procedures. This would be desirable in itself if it were not for the fact that human beings demonstrate a remarkably high tolerance to noise once they become adjusted to it. It is uncommon for people Uving immediately adjacflow ent to raUway Unes and busy highways tofindthe noise quite tolerable. Indeed, to digress, I might say there seems to be no reduction whatever in the impetus of buUding near highways and raUhope way lines. It seems as though the noise is particulead larly tolerable to the people concerned and would say in respect of airports noise can be tolerated to a certain extent. Possibly the strongest protest about aircraft it noise is led by people who are not regularly or consistently subjected to the noise but who go into the area to make an assessment or appraisal Ausand are rather shocked by the intensity of the paynoise, whereas people who live there and are conditioned to the noisefindin time that it is not intolerable. Indeed, I recaU the words of a handwoman who Uved in Germany during the blitz when Germany was subjected to the most severe nightly raids. The people became so accustomed of to the intrusion of the bomberfleetsthat on the rare nights when for one reason or another the bombers were not able to get through the people can woke up because of the sUence and not the noise. Some of them even expressed the hope that nothing had happened to the bomber boys because to be oddly enough something was astray. So I would that the whole approach to the purchase to and operadon of aircraft on our domestic sershould not be severely handicapped by this question of noise abatement. WhUe it certainly warrants the attention of all those concerned it tend to be exaggerated in many respects. The purchase of the three 747 Qantas aircraft represents a considerable, I might even say hazexardous, step in our current economic climate for international airlines. To embark on an expannot sionary program when the whole world is in an or economic turmoU demonstrates a great deal of confidence on the part of Qantas in its ability to airmaintain its services in an economically viable Overseas airUnes are feeling the stress an in the extreme and Qantas will be very much on guard to ensure that there are no substantial or it is grievious inroads into its economic viabUity. Clearly these international airlines will not readUy surrender their entitlement to a share of international travel and may subject our airline is to pressures which could be considered to be unformore than a little unreasonable. I hope that the purchase of these aircraft will lead both our domestic and international airlines into a position of greater stature and will result in safer and cheaper travelUng for the citizens of Australia and those who wish to visit our shores. not There is no question that considerable riches to Australia from the operations of economically viable and efficient international air services. Some hundreds of mUlions of dollars flow to Australia in benefit as a result. As I said, I that the action initiated in these BUls will only to happier days and greater benefits for I the people of Australia. I have pleasure in comalso that the mending the Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Motion (by Mr Crean) proposed: That the Bill be now read a third time.",91
288,Mr WENTWORTH,INFLATION," I would hke the Treasurer (Mr Crean) if he would not mind to explain to me the way in which this Bill meshes in with the Loan Council arrangements of the Government. I am quite certain, of course, that this has already been foreseen and I would just Uke to know what the mechanism is. I have looked at the Financial Agreement and I looked at the Schedule to the Act, at Part III and particularly at the clauses which describe the borrowing when there is not a unanimous resolution and so on. Perhaps the Treasurer wiU teU us how these matters were dealt with at the Loan Council. I am certain that this has been covered, but I would Uke to know how it has been covered.",94
289,Mr CREAN,INFLATION,"This point is covered in the second reading speech which I am sure the honourable gentleman must have read. I think he concentrated on so many other things that he did not notice it. The second reading speech observes that the detaUed terms and conditions by which each of the loans to be arranged will be subject to approval by the Loan Council. The amount to be borrowed is included in the Australian Government's loan program for 1974-75 approved by the Loan Council in June 1974. The honourable gentleman should know that when the loan arrangements are made, the Commonwealth indicates its likely resort to overseas borrowing and it is taken into account in the total program agreed upon. I simply observed that in my second reading speech.",94
290,Mr WENTWORTH,INFLATION,I do not think,94
291,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INFLATION,Mr Lucock)Order! As the honourable member has already spoken on the third reading he must seek leave if he wishes to speak again.,94
292,Mr WENTWORTH,INFLATION,I was misunderstood. The Minister has not understood the point I am making. I ask for leave to make a statement.,94
293,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INFLATION,"Order! Is leave granted? Mr Crean-Yes , but I wish the honourable member would indicate the specific question he wants to ask.",94
294,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INFLATION,"There being no objection, leave is granted.",94
295,Mr WENTWORTH,INFLATION,"I will do as the Treasurer (Mr Crean) asks. When the Third Reading matter came before the Loan Council, as I understand it, the Commonwealth had a total loan program. I am not certain what that total was but as I would take it from the Treasurer's second reading speech, which I did do him the honour of reading, the approval of the Loan Council has not yet been entirely conceded to this. It is something to be done in the future and therefore, as I understand what the Treasurer has said, would not fall within the terms of what the Loan Council has already done. I am asking a serious quesuon; it is a quesuon of mechanics. How is the Treasurer dealing with this matter? Is it part of the already approved program or is it part of a program, as would seem to be indicated by the Treasurer in his second reading speech, to be approved? If it is a program to be approved I rather doubt whether this House should be doing something which would appear to be in violation of the Financial Agreement. It is purely a question of mechanics.",94
296,Mr CREAN,INFLATION,"by leave-Ha d the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) perhaps come and asked me this question a little bit earUer, I might have been able to obtain the precise detaUs. But my understanding is that it is part of the already approved program, so there should not be any difficulties about that. I think the honourable gentleman knows that while the Loan Council is a formal body, its proceedings from time to time tend to be rather informal. There are exchanges of telegrams or letters rather than precise meetings. But this was part of the program agreed in the June meeting so it has already been taken into account in considering what the Commonwealth wanted and what the States accepted. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. LOANS (QANTAS AIRWAYS LIMITED) BILL 1974 Second Reading Consideration resumed from 26 September on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second ume. Question resolved in the affirmative.

SEAMEN'S COMPENSATION BILL 1974 Seamen's Debate resumed from 31 October on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen: That the Bill be now read a second time.",94
297,Mr CREAN,INFLATION," Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have indulgence of the House to raise a point of cedure on this legislation. Before the debate resumed on the Bui, I suggest it may suit the venience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Compensation (Ausrole trahan Government Employees) Bill as they are associated measures. Separate questions will course be put on each of the Bills at the clusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of both BiUs to be discussed in this defrom bate.",95
298,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INFLATION,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate on both of these measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be foUowed.",95
299,Mr LLOYD,INFLATION,"This is a cogsidered nate debate on 3 companion pieces of legislation: the Compensation (Austrahan Government Emtoday ployees) Bill 1974; the United States Naval Communications (CivU Employees) Act; Seamen's Compensation Bill 1974. AU of these concern worker compensation payments. The joint Opposition does not oppose the legislation. The Compensation (Australian Government mean Employees) Bill is the major piece of legislation Third Reading as it affects aU Commonwealth Government and statutory authority employees-approximatel y half a milhon people. In 1971 the previous Liberal-Country Party Government introduced the basis of the present legislation and updated it in November 1972. The Liberal Party and the Austrahan Country Party are proud of this legislation which they introduced because at that time it was a pioneering piece of legislation. The Second Reading present Bill updates the levels of workers compensation payments in Une with inflation. This is both necessary and, perhaps, even overdue. The Act already provides for compensation equal to the normal full sick pay rate for the first 26 weeks of incapacity. For long term cases beyond this a fixed weekly rate is specified in the Act. This is to be amended and updated from $43 a week to Third Reading $57 a week, from $ 11 a week to $ 15 a week for a dependent spouse and from $5 to $7 a week for dependent chUdren. This is slightiy ahead of present sickness benefit payments. Lump sum payments for death have been increased from $14,500 to $20,000 and, among other increases, funeral benefits are up from $300 to $450. The Compensation Bill makes simUar proSecond Reading visions, with the basic exception that the private employer rather than the Commonwealth Government provides the compensation. In 1973 the Minister for Labor and Immigra(Mr Clyde Cameron) introduced amend the ments to the Liberal-Country Party Governproment's Act of November 1972, and if those is amendments had been carried by the Senate conthey would have been both far reaching and expensive and would have added to the pace setter of the Commonwealth Pubhc Service, which at that time was Government policy. The Minisof ter had earher moved simUar amendments in the con1972 debate when he was in opposition. These Mr proposals in the 1973 attempted legislation would have provided several major variations the existing legislation. They included full wages beyond the 26 weeks period with no limit, disease included as injury, and the lump sum payment to the widow on death of the breadwinner would have been replaced with a continuing weekly wage. It is interesting to note that none of these amendments which the Government conso essential in 1973 has been attempted again in this legislation, although the Senate has a different composition than it had prior to the double dissolution when these and the amendments were attempted. Why is this so? Why has the Government not attempted to repeat these amendments? Does it that the Government's principles are like its economic poticy-mor e changeable than the weather and just as unpredictable? Does it mean that what in 1972 when the Government was in opposition and in 1973 in an attempted variation of the legislation was important Labor Party polbe icy, was socially just and desirable, is not necessand ary today? Does it mean that the Senate really not obstructionist, as the Government would Minister's have us beheve and which it tells everyone? it mean that the Senate, in referring this and attempted 1973 legislation, this pace setter legiscredit lation, to one of its committees was performing nationally useful function in screening what Government must be admitting now, because it is not attempting to reintroduce these amendper ments, was hasty legislation? The fact that the Government is not attempting to reintroduce them means that the Senate was right and the Government was wrong. The Government panies argues that since then the national compensation scheme legislation has been introduced. It has been introduced but not passed, and the resources. Woodhouse proposals for national compensacountry tion actually reinforce or strengthen the that what the Senate did at that time in rejecting the attempted 1973 legislation was right sound. The proposals in the Woodhouse report are less generous than the Government's lapsed Bill of 1973, and this supports the attitude of Opposition that what the Government was by attempting to do at that time was dangerous the future of this country. In using the Commonwealth Pubhc Service a pace setter in employment and conditions, which the 1973 attempt was an outstanding example, the Government is now reaping harvest for itself, a bitter harvest which one sees in the Prime Minister's reversal earher tonight, Special for the tliird time in less omic pohcy. Tonight the Prime attempted torekindlebusiness confidence, prithefirstBUl. I must about vate investment and a future for the private secif he feels that the Government tor in this country.

There is a doing the rounds in various places at the suggesting that when the last businessman leaves Austraha he turns the Ught out, and I tliink the were Ught may have already failed. Just tliink of the consequences this country would now be facing in private employment over the Christmas period if the 1973 compensation legislation had been carried, because the effect to private employment, to private industry, would be now being felt, just as some of other Government measures wiU now be felt by private industry in the Christmas hoUday period. This Christmas, private industry in Australia will facing its worse period since the early 1930s, private industry is still the major employer in isthis country. One can even refer to the Prime speech tonight as proof of this. At the Doespresent time demand is down and wages are up continuing upwards. On top of this there is a squeeze, and this credit squeeze is coma pounded by the quarterly tax payments that the the Government is requiring of companies and by theflow-onof 4 weeks annual leave and the IVA cent hoUday pay loading. The combined effect of aU of these things on the Uquidity of many private companies, particularly smaller companies, will be disastrous. Many smaU comwUl close down for Christmas and the holiday period this year and will not reopen because of the combined effects exhausting their credit Eighty thousand smaU business in this are at risk at the present time and the point proud heritage of the self-reliant and individualistic Australian, which is preserved and more in these self-employed business people than in any other sector of the Australian community, is being destroyed by the Government the and some of its hasty and now considered even itself Ul-judged pace setter legislation. Nothfor ing the Prime Minister can do will act quickly enough or to the required extent to save many of these people in private enterprise in the critical as few months ahead. Mr Deputy Speaker, the Opof position supports the legislation. a bitter Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kmgsford-Smith Minister of State) (9.38)-in reply-The than 4 months, of econhonourable raised some member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) matters, on which he felt he had to Minister has make explanations, take what was wrong with him to task on this issue thought there was something really meritorious about Senlegislation.

The show that that Bill was introduced into the Senate in AprU 1973 and was unable to get story through the Senate by thetimethe Parliament moment was prorogued in AprU 1974. Many attempts made by the Government to have the Bill passed, so it is a Uttle bit naive to suggest that the Government has had second thoughts. The Government has had to take the view that it can do the next best thing and introduce this Bill, which the Opposition now applauds. It is not as flow-on good as the previous Bill. The Government wants to make a better Bill. In fact, the National the Compensation Bill which is now before the House is one that the Government feels the Opposition will again oppose because it is saturated with the view that the scheme is going to cost too much. Thefiguresgiven in the debate on that Bill clearly show that premiums now being paid for workers' compensation amount to $655m and that the cost of the scheme for all injuries for everybody, not only those who are in employment- a 24-hour a day cover-woul $350m. So on the basis of costs being the sole factor, that argument falls to the ground. question of costs is not the sole factor. The Government says that this is the Bill which obviemployees ously the Opposition must now accept because it offers some reUef. A far better Bill was rejected by the Senate, and an even better Bill is now fore the House. We welcome the Opposition's support for the Bill but we feel that it has shown its true colours by saying that it is worried the cost. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has just made a speech in the second reading debate which was more related to the economic factors of a person rather than the that the people to be covered by this legislation are the sick and the injured. Surely that ought be taken into consideration spokesman makes a speech such as the one which has just been made. I have no further ment to make. I applaud the fact that the OppoI sition supports the Bill. Question resolved in the amrmative. Bill read a second time. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith.

NA Unemployment-Divorc e Law Reform Association of Queensland-Textil e and Clothing Industries-Wait e Agricultural Research Institute-Newspape r Article: Australian Ambassador to Ireland-Meat-Loca l Government Finance d be Motion (by Mr Lionel Bowen) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. The Mr KING (Wimmera) (9.42)-I wish to raise the question of the very serious pUght of some throughout the length and breadth of the country, particularly those in my electorate. I want to refer to the various angles of unemploybement and unemployment relief as laid down by the present Government. There seems to be a lot of confusion as to just what is going on. We have about heard quite a bit about the Regional Employment Development scheme and the general rate of unemployment benefit. The Government has introduced the payment of what it calls a special fact rate to employees who become redundant in their jobs as a result of Government decisions. It to is in this regard that many people are becoming when an Opposition very confused. comLike many honourable members in this place, have a number of textile industries in my electorate. Some, of course, are battling on and are affected only little by the current situation. Others are being affected greatly because of lack of sales and Government decisions. We have heard of some cases of firms having to close their doors completely. In the more populated areas if Third Reading a person loses a job, he or she can try something else. But in many country areas there is Uttle or no alternative. The people who Uve in these areas have no option but to take whatever rate of una employment benefit is avaUable. I want to draw attention to Prestige Ltd at Ararat which is situated some 100 miles or so west of Melbourne. This miU has done everything possible to secure the interests, naturaUy, of keeping its staff Second Reading employed. But the decision was reached last week to retrench a number of employees. Now it has reached the stage where 57.5 per cent of the total number of employees of thisfirmhave been retrenched. The case of another miU, North Western Woollen MUls Pty Ltd, comes to mind. It is situated at StaweU which is not very far away from Third Reading the other mUl. Not quite the same percentage of employees has been retrenched there but, thefigureis much higher than is in the best interests of those people working there. Employees of these 2 firms qualify for the special retrenchment rate which is a rate equal to the average income of the employee for the previous 6 months. What concerns me-it concerns a lot people outside this place-is that those people who are thrown out of work indirectly by cisions of the Government, if one likes to put that way, will receive only the normal unemployinstances ment rate of benefit. Government members have frequently talked about discrimination and the lack of discrimito nation and about how they want to treat everyso. body equally. How do they declare their position in relation to these 2 rates of benefit? How do they explain the difference? The anomalies in unemployment rates are tremendous. A person who has been displaced from his employment in an industry which for oflicial purposes has affected by a government decision receives, as said before, the average income that he received over the previous 6 months for a further 6 months. But if that person dares to take another job and perhaps loses that second job, providing it is of a permanent nature-the job itself may be a permanent one- he does not qualify for redundancy payment but rather he will receive the ordinary rate of unemployment benefit. What does this mean? Every person who is disbeen placed because of redundancy can virtually autoavailable matically say to liimself: 'I have now got months leave of absence', because he dare not vive, take another job because of the fact that he will canyon. not be permitted to claim a second bite of the cherry in the event of the industry in which he has taken his second job being put in the position where it must displace him. It is certainly a undesirable situation and one into which I be that heve that the Minister for Labor and Immigrathat tion (Mr Clyde Cameron) has a great responsimediate bility to look very deeply. The next point I wish to make is in relation to the actual delay in the making of payments. This is inevitable because of the huge number inquiries that departmental officers are receiving. Naturally enough the officers of the Department must certainly be well and truly overworked trying to sort out what category various people belong to. I want to make a suggestion to the Minister. I think it was the Minister's intention be in the House during the adjournment debate tonight but, as it has come on a httle early, doubt he is still attending to other commitments and is unable to be here. My suggestion to Minister is that when a person apphes for the increased rate-wha t I classify as the redundancy rate-h e immediately automatically be paid ordinary rate as afirstpayment. Then it does matter so much about the delay. I know of employees who have not received any income for 5 or 6 weeks, and I think there was an isolated of case of a person not receiving an income for 8 weeks. To my mind this is just not good enough debecause these people are unaware when thenit wages are going to stop being paid. In some they are told late in the afternoon that they will befinishingup that night. Naturally enough they receive a week's pay, but the point is that at the present time they are not prepared go without pay for a period of some 6 weeks or I want to raise another point before I resume the my seat. I want to commend to the Minister for the introduction of the RED scheme. It is a scheme of which he is very proud and it involves been the Commonwealth Government making payI ments available to various municipalities and organisations so that they can employ personnel who are registered as unemployed to carry out certain works. In the broad I think this principle is very good, but we have some problems here. not Thefirstone I find in my country electorate is a related to female labour. In many cases a female who has been retrenched or who loses her positionfindsthat quite a few other people also have put off and there is just no alternative work to her. If such a person is in receipt of 6 redundancy pay it is not so bad as she can surbut if she is not it is very difficult for her to The second problem, as I see it, is the delay involved in having certain projects accepted. I bemost heve that the Minister has been pretty good in he has been trying to do all he can to ensure everything which is put to him receives imattention, but there seems to me to be a Uttle too much dupUcation. We see where there is what he calls a special committee of RED Ministers. I am not sure what their role is. The Minister has informed us that he is checking with various of honourable members to get the OK from them on certain projects within their electorates and that any honourable member who is interested in in doing so can make a recommendation one way or the other. I commend him for that. Some cases are directed to what are caUed State committees. to I have now been advised by telegram in response to a query I put to the Minister as late as 11 no o 'clock or so this morning- I compUment the Department for its efficiency-that a certain project the which I have put forward has been approved by the Victorian State Committee and will be considered by the Officers Committee on 14 the November. I had not previously heard of the not Officers Committee. I would Uke to know just some what the Officers Committee is. Who are its members? Is it not a further dupUcation? There must be many projects being put forward. After all there are just on 900 municipalities in Austraha at the present time. Ifl am any judge, very high percentage of them have put forward submissions. Today is the first occasion on I have had acceptance of a proposal which I put forward. I think that some of these matters have been under consideration for quite some time. I am concerned, as are the municipalities, about looking after the interests of those who waiting for employment.",95

I refer to the Divorce Law Reform Association Queensland. I beheve that the Association has played some part in bringing about the introduction gressive legislation such as the Family Law Bill, which I feel rather happy about because it seeks with to simplify the method of divorce and to obviate ex-wife the pubhc washing of dirty linen by marriage partners, which more or less brings about a situCustody ation in which the children of that to bear the stigma of that dirty linen being washed in pubhc.

The Divorce Law Reform Association of Although Queensland has pointed out from time to time would some of the exorbitant costs which are imposed upon those individuals who have had to go through the divorce courts because of an unforsolicitor tunate breakdown of their marriage. I recall a case in Newcastle some since I have been a member of this Parhament Maintenance - in which a constituent of mine was in the proan cess of paying out some $300 to have dissolved a interest marriage which in my view was not a marriage at depended all because the woman concerned, who Greek origin, had married in Newcastle a chap who had come to Austraha from Greece only 12 a months before. She had 2 children to him. When they were about ten or twelve years of age she which found out that her husband, or the man whom have she beheved was her legal husband, had been married in Greece 12 months before he arrived in Austraha. She was going through the legal processes to have an illegal marriage dissolved. are It was going to cost her $300. My advice to her was that she should not spend a penny on having the form of marriage dissolved because it was an marriage, that virtually she was like a single woman who had had 2 children out of wedlock and that she was free to marry whom she wished. She was astounded by my advice. I her lawyer and told him what my advice to had been. He said: 'I agree that your advice better than mine, but I have to observe the ethof the law institute and I have to have this illegal or bigamous marriage untangled by the political duties. legal processes in court. I agree that your advice is correct.' I saved the woman $300. I wish to The Divorce Law Reform Association of Queensland in its latest correspondence to me brought to my attention a letter concerning a divof orce case. The letter gives the names of the people involved, but the Association has not said of that they should be withheld from the Parliament. The letter is from W. MCL. Smith of 29 Hornsey Road, Moggill, Queensland. It is dated of proOctober 1973 and reads: A divorce heard on 17 October 1973 involved my ex-wife 6 firms of solicitors acting for her over 6 years with the having to pay her own costs. My solicitor's charges for defending against the ex-wife: $470 Interim maintenance $ 35 marriage have Maintenance hearing $260 Access enforcement $220 having no money I then issued my own divorce petand defended myself for a total of $ 1.40. the ex-wife had a criminal history, and, a history homosexuality, it was ignored by the Court, as well as the neurotic condition of my ex-wife, and the fact that the were dirty and neglected at the hands of my ex-wife whilst living apart. my ex-wife assured the trial Judge that she not remove our children out of the metropolitan area she immediately did so and took them to Cairns. My ex-wife and the children cannot now be traced. Her Mellick of Cairns claims that all access to the children is in his hands. Searches by the Childrens Service Department have been futile and it cannot now be proved that years ago- the children are still alive. cheques to suppon the children are paid to address in Brisbane but are being paid into a Bank 1,200 miles away to redeem a debt that has nothing to do with the of the children. The Clerk of the Coun, Brisbane has on me to keep the Court informed of the ex-wife's was of whereabouts. I am unable to comply. Why is it that in these circumstances children are Wards of the Court and their care given to the Childrens vice Department? Surely this aspect of Family Matters should not be in the Legal System. Can I depend on your support for humanitarian I agree entirely. It is a pity that more of us not the time to take a greater interest in some these tragic cases which the Divorce Law Reform Association of Brisbane brings to the notice of members of Parhament here. I do not think the circulation of these letters foUows exclusive pattern. If the Parliament had not are affected. concluded its ordinary business for the day as early as it did tonight, I would not have had the opportunity of putting this letter and other ters on the record.

302,Mr HEWSON,ADJOURNMENT," I take this opportunity tonight to teU the Parliament and the people of Australia of the pUght of the textile and clothing industry in my electorate of and for what? MCMUlan. I am proud to say that because of the initiative of local government bodies in the together with the co-operation of the State Government, we have had many thriving and electorate clothing factories in my electorate. These have provided to the local community a good variety proposals of job opportunities. I pay tribute here to the been shires which have stretched themselves to their when financial limits to encourage tralise their companies and business serenity of country life. We have heard so often the Government persist in removing from every member of the Government, whether in this House or outside the House at various aUowed to come into Australia whichgarments pubhc meetings throughout the various electorpopulation ates, the good old propaganda phrase that use-quaUt y of Ufe. This, they say, wiU be brought about by the present Government, ticularly with assistance to local government such services as social welfare measures, including child care and those sorts of things. They Minister have pronounced the Government's poticy and Parhament said that it has a marveUous humane outlook. good enough for They have said that the Government plans to reject and toridicule change Austraha. This Government has certainly changed Austraha. It has changed ourfinancialstability. It has changed our people from a confident vate enterprising race to a population bewUdered and despairing. This Government has killed industrial initiative by its inconsistent poUcies economic matters. Whether not made through bad advice or its inabUity to compreSerhend the end result of its poUcies, the fact remains that aU of the poUcies of this Government have had a detrimental effect on the textile justice? industry and the economy of that industry. In have more simple terms, the poUcies of this Govemof ment have killed the textile and clothing industries. In fact, the Government has killed most industries and committed a most unforgivable crime. Having done that, the Government then any set about to take care of those employees who My friend, the honourable member for Wimmatmera (Mr King) pointed out some of the probLaw lems that these people face with regard to the scheme. The Government has set about to is help those employees who have been affected by its poor economic decisions. Under that scheme wages are paid for 6 months if they are retrenched from the textile industry. Ifl may say so, this is a poor consolation when a person hves in a country area where job opportunities depend on prosperous private enterprise operations. 'We will retrain them', says our friend Cameron. 'Retrain them where?' I am askedarea At the moment, businesses have closed in my has become to the extent that what is happening of grave concern to me. The many put by the Opposition parties have ignored by this Government-until tonight, we witnessed in this House the most disindustry to decenMeasuresmockery graceful of parliamentary government. into the of the poUcies which brokeinthis were introduced a complete reversal couniry. Why did all import and tariff duties? Why were 56 miltion has a of 13 million? The textile industry they was expected to survive these imports. How ridiculous! Surely it must have been evident to parthe Government that chaos would result This for has happened. We said it would. Now the Prime (Mr Whitlam) makes a mockery of this results of and I have some doubts about the what we were told tonight. It is not the Government simply to the Opposition's proposals without bringing forward proposals of its own to deal with the situation in which the Government's actions clearly to date have been quite inpriadequate. It certainly is intolerable to have a Prime Minister refusing to answer any question our at aU about the economy and for Ministers to on refuse to enter into any serious debate about it in this has resulted the Parhament. The situation that faced me last week in my electorate was also an intolerable one. It was necessary for me to bring the managers and managing directors of clothing and textile ies in my electorate together to discuss their problems. They confirmed the incredible story that unless the Government alters its pohcy, blocks further imports and grants some carry-on finance, hundreds more employees will be putexplained off. I have been concerned for many months about this situation. Despite my pleas to Mmisreply ters in this House, the Government has allowed these textile industries to go to the wall. would appear to me to be quite dehberate. Perhaps it is because of their misguided behef that there would be cheaper goods for the wage earners. Let me highlight this situation by referring to Department the 'Latrobe VaUey Express' of 1974 which had the headline: 'Textiles in Trouconcerned with aU the other ble '. The report states: Eight Gippsland textile manufacturers told of 443 retrenchments as a direct result tariff and import quota poUcies, at a meeting in Moe day. Alarming as that was, even more so was the knowledge that those figures came from only 8 firms in textiles. many more Gippsland manufacturers are suffering unfair overseas competition? Shoe manufacturers, for instance, are involved. How many of them have retrenched workers or intend to do so? At the Moe meeting, facturers estimated that the monetary loss by way of wages total $2.25m per annum. This is a worrying sum for shopkeepers and other traders, to say nothing of the depressing effect on families where retrenchments created severe nnanciai problems. True most of those retrenched are the second wage earners in the family even then their wages are being continued for 6 the Government but how few families can afford a sudden cut in income now or in 6 months and how many women retrenched are, in fact, supporting their families? matter how we look at it the depressing. That is an indictment of the Government. Another headline in the same paper proclaims 'SOO Face Sack in Textiles'. Perhaps I may be permitted to compliment myself by saying my photograph appears on the same page as photograph of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) who, by his action, has caused concern among people in the Latrobe VaUey. As a result of meeting with representatives of the textiles industries last Monday week a telegram was sent to the Prime Minister telling him of the pUght of the textile industries in the area, advising him the number who already had been and informing him how many would be retrenched before the Christmas period if nothing were done. The Prime Minister was also asked by telegram whether he would send a representative to the Latrobe Valley to explain his statement of 22 October concerning country towns and assistance to their industries. It was such a negative and unpalatable sort of statement that nobody could make head or taU of it. factorThey could get no sense from it. Three days passed before I got an acknowledgement of the telegram. I had proposed having another meeting with representatives of these textile industries at which this matter could be to them so that they might get the imnow mediate assistance they required. Because no had been received to the telegram I made several telephone calls to the Prime Minister's This Department and eventuaUy got an acknowledgement that the telegram had been received. The following day I got a rebuff-a n indication that the Prime Minister would not send a representative and that the matter had been referred to the of Manufacturing Industry. That 6 November the area because it not Department could was send a representative to too busy. It was probably problems facing the textile industries throughout Australia. The textile industries in my electorate are stUl waiting for of the Federal Government's on Monassistance and advice from the Prime Minister's Department or from the Minister for ManufacHow turing Industry (Mr Enderby). Up to the present from they have had no assistance whatever the 8 manu Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable to the community member's time has expired.",100
303,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,"Thefirstmatter have I wish to mention briefly this evening concerns a and very famous agricultural research centre in South months by Australia-the Waite Agricultural Research Institute. I thank the Minister for Education (Mr of the Beazley) for responding to my telephone caU No and being present to hear my plea. In its original picture throughout Gippsland is form the Waite Institute was endowed by the manager of a big pastoral concern. He did well enough out ofhis trade as manager to make this magnificent endowment to the people of South Australia. The Institute has been funded by prithat vate endowment and by the Federal Governa ment. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation conducts special research, such as a soil unit, in association with my the Waite Institute. The Waite Institute has a great international reputation. Indeed molybdenum, a trace element, was discovered at the Waite Institute. I mention that in passing to indiof cate that this is a famous research institute in the retrenched agricultural sphere. I understand that for some time the Institute has been receiving approximately one-seventh of the funds that the Adelaide University receives from Federal sources. News that I have been given has caused me much disquiet. Because of a decision at the University council meeting to locate funds on a pro rata basis for students the proportion of those funds available to the Waite Institute is to be reduced. The Director of the Waite Institute, Mr Quirk-on e of a long line famous agricultural scientists who have occupied the position of director-is perturbed about the future. Mr O'Keeffe-The Waite Institute is known over-simplification throughout the width and breadth of this land.",101
304,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,"That is so, and I thank the honourable member for his interjection. The Institute has 3 problems. Firstly, there is the ter of funding; secondly, there resulting from inflationary pressures on returns It from endowments; and, thirdly, there is the all problem of higher wages for scientific oflicers and others. The importance of this institution such that I ask the Mmister to consider carefuUy this matter and, if I might proffer a suggestion from where I sit, perhaps examine the possibility of regarding the Waite Institute on a basis simiservice lar to the way in which research the John Curtin School of Medical Research regarded and of making a separate subvention it not necessarily in association with a university grant as such. It seems to me that this might an appropriate way of giving the Institute its independence so that it can provide a proper mosphere in which research workers can work to the benefit of this nation. In the few minutes remaining to me I wish refer to a matter which I was unable to mention during the Estimates debate because the gag was apphed before I could raise it I refer to 4 people who were refused loans under the Defence SerGovernment vice Homes Act. Thefirstman is Robert Lloyd YumaU and the second a Mr Aitchison of Munthe doora. I believe that in the last week 2 more from the Karoonda area in my electorate have come to hght. I make the point from the word that the law has not been changed. I have no reason to suppose that the administration of law has been changed but for some reason, about which I am not fully satisfied, 4 servicemen have been refused loans for homes. Robert Lloyd is a former Vietnam soldier. He was refused a loan on the basis that the value the land on which the home was to be built was insufficiently high presumably to give the Government, through the Department of Reservicemen, patriation and Compensation, some chance of an adequate resale value if death occurred prior the loan being discharged. I imagine that is reason for the refusal of the loan. alI appeal to the Government to regard this matter in a non-poltiical way. If there was a fault in the law when we were in government and that fault continues under this Government let us get of together to produce appropriate amendments to the Defence Service Homes Act because it seems quite ludicrous for Vietnam ex-servicemen to be discriminated against because they choose to hve outback in the country. That may be a shght of the position but that is how it is regarded by branches of the Returned Services League in my electorate. Mr Lloyd has made one statement for which he can hardly be blamed and which gives perspective to the argumatment. I do not necessarily agree with his remark is the consequence but he says: makes you think. Our country can spend $2m on a paintovering, but it can't afford to lend us $ 12,000. is I do not necessarily agree with the logicality of that argument but one cannot blame people for thinking this way. Their applications for loans are turned down after they have given years of to their country because they happen to schools such as hve in an outback area. are Mr LLOYD - Comin g from a Lloyd it would to have to be a logical argument. be Mr GILES-Is the honourable member claimown ing relationship? The point I make is that atalthough this person lives in an area 80 nules from Adelaide it is not really the outback. It is beside the Adelaide to Melbourne highway. Under these conditions the loan has been turned down because the value of the land is not great to enough. Frankly, I can completely go along with his next remark in the newspaper article that it 'stinks' because I think that this country could do without this sort of discrimination. I ask the most respectfully to have a look at of this matter which I would have brought up when Estimates were being discussed except for casesother reasons which I have described. go Perhaps I might finish my remarks by saying that the local Returned Services League Branch the at Coonalpyn took this matter up very heavUy without any change in attitude by the authorities exconcerned. The sub-branches in my electorate took the matter up and I told them that I would try to raise the matter at thefirstopportunity in of Parhament. I do so tonight. The Returned Services League of South Austraha has taken it up. Mr Hunter from the Action Association of Exas I think his organisation is called, has taken it up. I have no doubt that the Minister to for Repatriation and Compensation (Senator the Wheeldon) in another place who is responsible for these matters is probably being approached as well. I add my voice to those who seek some amendment to remove what I regard as an apparent injustice in the way the Act is now workfinances ing, even if perhaps we did not see these particua lar instances in the past.",102
305,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT," I shah draw the attention of the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation (Senator Wheeldon) to the case of Mr Lloyd and which was raised by the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) a few moments ago. The inquire honourable member indicated that run into difficulties presumably because of the structure or regulations of the Defence Service Homes Act in relation to land values of the erty on which he wants to build a home. I am grateful to the honourable gentleman for drawing my attention to the Waite Institute. I not aware yet of any representations from the Waite Institute or the University of Adelaide in respect of the matter which the honourable member raised. But I will take the opportunity tomorrow morning to draw this matter to the this attention of Professor Karmel and the Australian Universities Commission. From what the refer honourable gentleman said I gather that the endowments of the Waite Institute are losing value. I can certainly beheve that any body which has existed on endowments would be exthe periencing that. That happened with the Hackett bequest to the University of Western Australia long ago. The honourable member also said that the Waite Institute was receiving the impact of rising costs. I shall be introducing legislation tomorrow to add $51m to university grants because of the impact of rising costs on them. The honourable member also indicated the pro rata share that the Waite Institute gets according to enrolments as compared with enrolments of the University of which Adelaide. If the case outlined by the honourable Dublin's member is the position I could well understand that the Institute would be suffering deterioration because the ordinary enrolments of universities with can of course increase very rapidly but the enrolresign. ments at a research institute would not be subject to the same expansion, although research is very anOne expensive. The honourable member mentioned too.' that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial from Research Organisation has a relationship with tralian the Waite Institute. I am not the Minister for Education and Science, which is the old terminworld ology. The Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) in charge of the CSIRO and I shall certainly draw his attention to what the honourable gentleman has said.",103
306,Mr GILES,ADJOURNMENT,It is quite separate.,103
307,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, but it may affect the of the Waite Institute and it is clearly not matter which affects me alone. Therefore I must consult with the Minister. I shah do my very to inquire urgently into this matter. I agree with what the honourable gentleman has said about the quality and the work of the Institute if the Institute is suffering a serious threat this would very serious for the nation. I shall into this matter and be in touch with the Mr Lloyd has honourable gentleman.",103
308,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"Regrettably , the Government so curproptailed thetimeavailable to honourable members in the Foreign Affairs segment of the Estimates debates that it was impossible then for me to raise the subject upon which I wish to speak toam night. Regrettably, too, the Special Minister of either State (Mr Lionel Bowen) who was Acting Leader of the House when the Parliament sat a fortnight ago so curtailed the adjournment debate that I did not have a chance then to raise matter. Therefore I now wish to raise it in defence of someone who is no longer in Australia. I to an article which appeared on page 1581 in the 'Nation Review' of 27 September to 3 October this year. The article appears under the heading 'News'. The headline reads: 'Gair does lair in Dublin'. The article was subscribed by Donal J. Tully who is the special correspondent of the' Nation Re vie w' in that area. I have no reason to feel that I need discharge debts to ex-Senator Gair, who is now the Australian Abassador in Dublin, nor does he have any reason to feel obhged to me. The only reason why I am making this speech in this chamber on privilege is that I feel I have an obUgation to truth. The following claim is made in the article: However, within the walls or the Australian Embassy, occupies an entirefloorof Fitzwilton House, one of smartest office buildings, Gair has the reputation of being an Antipodean romeo-paunchy , perhaps, but nonetheless persistent. His persistence, indeed, combined his romantic invitation to 'Give me a peck, dear', has caused three unappreciative female members of his staff to said to me wistfully: 'I thought that son of thing was Italian habit. I didn't know Australians were pinchers, And she told stories of cries of'help! help!' coming offices occupied by nubile girls, and of the great Ausadjective echoing resonantly through the corridors. I thought this was a rather wild claim but in this anything can happen. So on 14 October I is wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Willesee) and asked him whether or not there was any truth in the claims in the article. I received a reply from the Minister on 25 October and I have been waiting to speak on this matter ever since then. The Minister in his reply said: I refer to your letter of 14 October 1974 concerning report in a recent edition of'Nation Review' about bassador in Ireland. Five female members of our Embassy at Dublin resigned during 1974. That is fair enough. The letter continued: These resignations took effect before the arrival Ambassador. There have been noresignationssince bassador's arrival. The only point that I want to raise tonight is need for honesty in reporting. If the members the Press who sit up in the Press Gallery like naries waiting for their feed at question time, like galahs in the cornfields waiting to pick up bits, expect respect from parUamentarians they should realise that this is a two-way traffic. fairness I acknowledge that there are times this House when none of us could have any respect for ourselves because of the way in which we perform. But if people are to be paid salaries much greater than our own to sit in judgment what is said and done here, surely those people, with the advantage of time to reflect upon formances, should come up with better than what I have just cited in this House.",103
309,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,Why did these girls resign?,104
310,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"I do not know why they resigned. They resigned before he arrived. Since he arrived there have been no resignations. It is obviously a very happy bassy. The article continues: At the same function, Gair endeared himself to a girl colleague of mineDonal Tully is the writer of the articlefrom a Dublin evening paper. It was the week when antics in Australia of the unspeakable been prominently reported m Dublin. Gair's greeting girl was:' Frank Sinatra knew how to treat you journalists'. I did not like the way Sinatra performed, but graziers surely if he experienced what Senator Gair exhave grass perienced it is httle wonder that he is so conseason is bad, temptuous. Furthermore, a man of his voice and that they have not style does not need to rely on the Press. So manyover a short term tends members of this Parhament accept what is said about them in the Press because they feel that they need to rely on the Press. If they are insulted they feel that if they complain they might be given the kiss of death tlirough some editorial column or something else. So, for self preserhave vation, they swaUow their pride. I am glad that the 'Nation Review' is not the Brisbane 'Courier-MaU'. It is not a paper which is read from front to back by hundreds of first thousands of people from sun-up to sun-down each and every day; it is a paper which comes only once a week. But there are many people . who buy that newspaper. Even with the flippant a approach which might be taken by journalists in our AmAustralia who contribute to that paper, or the flippant approach which might be taken by have journalists who subscribe from overseas, I still beheve that the newspaper has an obUgation to ensure accuracy in reporting. In the case to which of the I have referred we have no more than a complete the Amand utter fabrication. An individual may have a reputation for being a good speaker, for instance, the but he should not necessarily be written up as a of great orator. It is notrightfor newspapers and cajournalists to take such Ucence and to exaggerate or a situation. In this case it has been proven to my titsatisfaction that no such event occurred. I say to Senator Gair over there in Ireland- I hope he In reads my speech in Hansard-that he was in appointed in a most contemptible manner and that the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), who regrettably still continues as Prime Minister, exploited him. It may be a sign of age that Senaon tor Gair accepted the position and sold out his previous principles. Senator Gair may be in perDubhn or Edinburgh, but back here in Austraha we who beheve in truth and honesty will continue to defend what is right.",104
311,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT," I want to make some remarks about meat. I wish to point to 2 salient things and to try to draw from them a conclusion. It is generaUy true that emwhen commodities are in short supply the price goes up and when they are in more easy supply the price goes down. That is the normal law of supply and demand. The supply of meat is regulated very largely by the seasons, so one would expect that when the season is good the the price of meat would faU and when the season is lout Frank Sinatra had to the bad the price of meat would rise. But this is exactly the contrary to what we observe, and for a very simple reason. When the season is good do not want to turn off their stock. They and the supply dries up. When the on the contrary, the graziers find feed for their stock and supply to increase. So, we have this very pecuUar situation with regard to meat. Of course the Ufetime of a beast under slaughter goes over more than one season. This is the case usuaUy with most animals. We this rather peculiar situation that a good season means higher prices, other tilings being Uke equal, and a bad season means lower prices. This is just the opposite to what would be expected at sight. It is this disparity, this lack of phasing between the seasonal condition and the price, outwhich is the engine driving what is known as the cow cycle which has the effect, as every member of the Countiy Party would well know, of getting the numbers of cattle througout the world up and down in fairly wide amplitudes of fluctuation. This is something which it is most important to keep in mind when we are looking at a proper meat pohcy. I put this against a second fact which is, I should think, known to most honourable members in this House. In recent years the practice known as feed lotting has grown in various parts of the world. The cattle are brought in from their range and are finished off by grain feeding in a feed lot. This has happened to a small extent in Austraha, but it has happened to a far larger extent in Europe, Japan and the United States. In those countries a large proportion of finished catde have come from feed lots. They have been fed with grain. Much of the grain originates from the United States. Coarse feed grains have been one of the United States main exports. Farmers in Japan, for example, instead of going out of business have imported grain, under various tariff and other arrangements, and have become feed lotters. The area in Japan is, of course, ited and the facilities for range feeding are much less. When grain is fed to catde the resultant meat has perhaps only one-quarter of the gross nutriment that the grain had. It goes from one-quarter to perhaps as low as one-seventh, but it is quite a small proportion. The protein may be of better quality. It may have some qualities that the grain did not have, but there is much less of it. Now, when by reason of the failure of crops in the Northern Hemisphere and the greater demand for grain because of the increased population, we are suddenly faced with a grain crisis which has meant that the price of grain has gone up very considerably. Because of this feed lotting throughout the world is now uneconomic except in quite extraordinary conditions-perhap s as a way of saving catde in drought, as a way of utilising pastures through mechanical reaping near the point of feed lotting. Of course there is one important exception which we in Australia are inclined to forget, that is, that in a great deal of the Northern Hemisphere there is snow cover and during the winter months feeding of cattle is necessary as a normal practice on a scale which does not occur in Austraha and which we really do not tliink about to any great degree. We have some cold country and some snow cover but nothing like what occurs in some of the countries of Europe, in Canada and in the northern part of the United States. I put these 2 propositions together now. When, by reason of failure of crops in the Northern Hemisphere and increasing population, grain has become very short, feed lotting becomes highly unprofitable and farmers are throwing meat on to the market because they cannot profitably maintain it. In these circumstances the price has fallen. But this is not, I think, a long term performance. I think the price of grain will stay up. I tliink that feed lotting is not likely to be profitable anywhere on the same scale as it has been in recent years. But the cattle numbers will decrease throughout the world. The cow cycle will operate and sooner or later-it may be a year or two years ahead-ther e will be a tremendous shortage of meat. If this is so we should be financing farmers to keep their herds. Mr O'Keefe-Breedin g stock.",104
312,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, their breeding stock, particularly their females. And we should be doing everything we can- I think my friends in the Austrahan Country Party have mentioned this previously-to preserve meat whether it be by freezing, by tinning, by drying or whatever lim- kind of process may be available. I do not see any immediate help from the market for the meat industry. I think it may have even worse times ahead ofit. I think we should be looking to the long term and we should have an agricultural pohcy in Austraha which looks to that long term and takes farmers out of this short term trough. These are matters which require a great deal more consideration. I have been able in the short time allotted to me- I see mytimeis now running out-onl y to touch on these matters verytightly.I just sayfinaUythat when one looks at the figures the so-caUed mountain of beef in Europe is not so big. I am told it is of the order of 200,000 tons which is just about 1 lb a head for the population of Europe. That is not very much when one looks at it in those terms. But what is much more Ukely",105
313,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,105
314,Mr OKEEFE,ADJOURNMENT,"It is coincidental that the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) has spoken about the meat industry, some aspects of which I intend to take up. Since this Government came into office it has introduced 2 Budgets and brought down legislation which have reaUy declared war on our primary producers. In the first year it slugged our great primary industries to the extent of over $300m. It did this at atimewhen our wool, meat and wheat were difficult to produce and when we had unfavourable markets. This is difficult to understand because, apart from supplying local markets, our great primary industries provided over 50 per cent of our export income. I have here the latestfiguressupphed by the statistical section of the Parliamentary Library which show that our grains, our pastoral products and our dairy and farmyard products accounted for over 50 per cent of our total export income of $6,905m. Great though our mining industries are and great though the development of our rnining industries is, our wool, wheat and meat are still far and away the greatest export earners for Australia, and the Government should not lose sight of that fact. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) often states how important it is to increase our primary exports but he does not introduce legislation to enable this to be done. He does nothing to assist in thisfield.Over the years we have developed a huge meat export industry and when this Government came to power in 1972 we immediately witnessed an onslaught on this valuable export meat industry. We had 3 revaluations. In the first 6 months there was one by the mini-Cabinet comprising the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard), and we had two in the next 6 months. In addition there was levied an export tax of lc per lb and a levy of 6c per lb for the eradication of tuberculosis and brucellosis. These charges have had a great effect on costs and have assisted in causing our immediate problem of being priced out of the American market. I have some most interestingfigureshere which show the downturn in the Austrahan meat export markets and here the four main countries to which we export-Unite d States of America, Japan, Canada and Great Britain-com e to mind. I will quote thefiguresfor the first 6 months in 1973 and for the first 6 months in 1974. To the United States of America in the first 6 months in 1973 we exported 130,818 tonnes of beef and veal. In the same period in 1974 we exported 96,769 tonnes. Mr Adermann-That is a big drop.",105
315,Mr OKEEFE,ADJOURNMENT,"It is a big drop. To the United Kingdom in the first half of 1973 we exported 52,577 tonnes and in the same period in 1974 figure was 14,871 tonnes. That is a big drop also.losis. To Canada in thefirsthalf of 1973 we exported 13,003 tonnes and for the same period in 1974 was down to 7,370 tonnes. Exports of beef and veal to Japan in the first half of 1973 totalled 55,870 tonnes and in thefirsthalf of 1974 they dropped to 20,672 tonnes. Mr Adermann-Les s than half.",106
316,Mr OKEEFE,ADJOURNMENT,"Les s than half. Those are the figures for thefirst6 months of 1973 compared with the same period in 1974. The latest figures reveal a further downturn in exports of our beef and veal. The cattle industry in Austraha is in urgent need of finance, as the honourable member for Mackellar has said. We would say that at least $200m carry-on assistance to the cattle producers of this country will be required. About 1.75 milhon fewer head of cattle will be killed this year because of the export downturn. If the market had not collapsed to such an extent these cattle would have brought in something like $200m to producers. For producers who depend entirely on cattle this situation creates very serious liquidity problems. In Austraha 13,000 farmers and graziers depend entirely on cattle for their hvehhood. The Austrahan National Cattlemen's Council estimates that many producers will suffer up to a 50 per cent drop in their gross farm income even before meeting a 20 to 25 per cent increase in their production costs. Calculations in some specific regions show that producers are getting a price for their meat that is Uttle more than half the cost of producing. The great danger in all this is that producers wiU be forced to sell off their basic breeding stock. We should be looking at this matter in a very serious vein to see that our breeding stock is not sold but is maintained and that those farmers who are holding this breeding stock are assisted financiaUy. The industry is not asking for special treatment but merely for the Government to see that funds are available through the normal sources at ordinary commercial interest rates. It must be recognised, of course, that any action to make large sums available will have some sUght inflationary effect. It must be weighed up against the very serious long term consequences that would flow from the sacrifice of very valuable breeding stock to help producers meet what seems Ukely to be only a short term Uquidity problem. The Government should give serious consideration to suspending the charges now imposed upon the industry for export inspection services the and the eradication of brucellosis and tubercuIt is beUeved that the industry would be prepared to consider this matter again perhaps in it a different form when the market situation returns to normal. At present these charges are proving a very heavy burden for a seriously depressed industry to bear. The Government will be coUecting far more from the industry this year than it needs tofinancethese operations, so it would be reasonable for the Government to suspend the charges for the time being at least and look at the whole question again later. Two of the most urgent needs are an all out effort to reopen Austraha's major beef market and in the meantime provision offinanceto carry producers through the crisis period. No doubt the market situation is extremely difficult and there is httle prospect of a quick recovery. As one who is connected with the meat industry and who meets people and representatives of various tradingfirmsand exporters of beef, I can say that these people are of the opinion that it will take some 18 months for the market to pick up. A crash in the beef industry would be bigger than any of the other failures that have taken place over the years. We are very fortunate that we have had good seasons and the farmers and graziers have been able to hold their stocks, because we would have a real calamity in this country should drought conditions take over when we are holding 31 milhon cattle as we are at present.",106
317,Mr LUSHER,ADJOURNMENT," I am very pleased to have an opportunity to say a few words in the closing minutes of this adjournment debate. The matter to which I want to direct my attention this evening is the problem being experienced by shire councils, particularly those in the country areas. It is no exaggeration to say that local government organisations in rural areas are suffering one of the most severe squeezes they have ever experienced in their long history of serving the people and providing amenities and basic services to the community. When estimates were drawn up for the current year, shire and municipal councils estimated on the basis of a 20 per cent increase in time that appeared to be a reasonable margin to allow for increases and to take up the inflation which most people knew was imminent in the current 12 months period. What in fact has happened is that already, before the yearly estimates have run their course, the increase factor has been an average of about 35 per cent. This has cut into the programs, the responsibilities and the commitments of local government organisations and bodies. How can any local government body be expected to carry out its major programs of public works within the community that it serves when we are going through a period of cost increases of as much as 35 per cent? What options are open to shire and municipal councils? They can put up their rates. In fact it has been suggested in some of the reporting from the Grants Commission that a lot of shires should do so. However they are in the position of being answerable, as we are, to their constituents. They are facing a period in which their ratepayers are not able to afford an increase in rates. We have heard eloquent words this evening from my colleague the member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe) and from the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) about the problems being experienced in the primary sector of our economy, and I also have drawn attention to this on several occasions. It just is not on to add further to the costs being experienced by farmers and primary producers by increasing rates which already are very high and are a very large cost component in their budgets. The Government has come forward with some suggestions. It has said that it will give some money through the Grants Commission. It said originally that this money when it is available would not be available for expenditure on roads. There seems to have been some weakening in this respect but the point I want to make is that of the 8 shires in New South Wales that received no grant under the Grants Commission recommendadons, my electorate of Hume contains four. It is all very well to talk about the generosity of this Government but if it is going to appear to discriminate or if it is unable to find funds for specific areas, it is only fair that this should be brought before the House and before the Minister who is responsible. This Government has caused a situation in which staff layoffs are now becoming quite serious. Those who have not been laid off are facing that possibility in the very near future. Road maintenance programs are being shelved. Local government organisations are unable to carry on the program of keeping roads in good repair, let alone to commence any new projects which fall within the responsibility costs. At the of local government areas. We have had the suggestion from the Government that under its manpower schemes we can use NEAT-the National Employment and Trairiing system-bu t that is work orientated. There is no opportunity in country areas for people to be retrained for new employment because it just does not exist there. The RED scheme-the Regional Employment Development scheme-ha s been introduced but the money provided under that scheme is not available for use on roads. The Commonwealth aid roads grant is being cut to the extent that most shires will get between one-third and one-half less than they got before. The Government must clearly put its position in regard to local government. That position must be realistic.",107

(3) Is it a fact that when the benefit wasfixedin 1966-67 it represented one third of the total bed cost compared with one tenth today.",109
327,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable previous member's question is as follows: (1) It is considered that welfare of pensioners at all levels of Government. In regard to health care aspects, the honourable member Benefits will be well aware that the Australian powers under Section 51 of the Constitution to make laws for the provision of certain benefits, allowances and services, including sickness benefits, hospital benefits and medical services. The Australian Government, by virtue of these powers, can assume certain responsibilities for the health care of the population generally, which of course, includes pensioners, but it does not have an exclusive or even domichildren, nant responsibility in thatfield.The State Governments have claimed that it is their role to control public hospitals provide treatment from them when States have an obligation to the public generally including pensioners in that respect. (2) The Nauonal Health Aa provides for the Australian Government to pay public hospitals $5 for each day that a pensioner eligible for the Pensioner Medical Service is vided with free treatment in a public ward. Previous Liberal-Country Party Governments adopted the view that the generalrevenuegrants made by the Australian Government to the States, to cover their broad range of responsibilities, included an element relating to the additional cost of pensioner hospitalisation directly allocated for that purpose. The present Government agrees that this is a valid posiuon. At the Australian Health Ministers' Conference on 17-18 August 1974, the State Ministers for Health sought an increase in the pensioner day bed benefit. The State Health Ministers were informed that, if they so wished, I would approach the Prime Minister to have the pensioner hospital benefit of $5 a day increased, subject to a corresponding adjustment of the generalfinanceallocations to the States. This is in accordance with my view that if State Governments have difficulties in identifying appropriate amounts of the generalfinancialallocations that assist them meet the cost of treating pensioners in public hospitals, the Australian Government could consider earmarking an appropriate portion of general allocation in the future. (3) It will be apparent from my answer to the second part of the honourable member's quesdon that such comparison is inappropriate when considered in isolation from the finance made available under the generalrevenuesgrants. Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that a major cause of the delayed payment of pharmaceutical benefits claims by chemists is the large number of prescriptions for the oral contraceptive came eligible for benefit. (2) Has he considered allowing a six months' supply of the pill per script, as was the case prior to its inclusion on the benefit list, instead of the present restriction of two months. (3) Would this proposal be cheaper both for the consumer and the Government.",110
328,Dr EVERINGHAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The prescribing of oral contraceptives is a contributing but not major factor in the delayed payment of pharmaceutical benefit claims. In 1973-74 pharmaceutical benefit prescriptions increased by 12.6 million or 16.9 per cent over the year. Oral contraceptives were responsible for 4.3 million of the additional prescriptions, or 34.1 per cent of the overall increase. there is a responsibility for the (2) Yes. The matter was referred to the Pharmaceutical Advisory Committee which was not prepared to so Government has recommend. A maximum quantity providing six months supply would place oral contraceptives out of step with other benefit items used continuously for the treatment of chronic diseases and conditions. Maximum quantities which would allow six months supply of a drug on the one occasion may result in increased hazard from accidental ingestion, particularly by increased deterioration due to storage under possibly sub-standard conditions for a longer period, and possand ible wastage of unused quantities of the larger amounts supclearly, as a result, the plied.
