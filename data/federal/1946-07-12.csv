1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. J. S. .Rosevear) took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. COAL-MINING INDUSTRY. SHOBTAOB . ojv SUPPLIES : EFFBOT ON FOOD-PRODUCING INDUSTRIES - SUBand Shipping.' SIDIES. "" ;",11
2,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"It is clear that tinned plate is in.short supply in Australia, and it"" would appear that the missionsent abroad by the Government has not succeeded in gaining additional supplies for this - country. The Australian - Glass Manufacturing Company in Victoria is working at one-third of its capacity, and it is unlikely that it can continue to operate at that rate of production unless it receives additional supplies of coal. - The effect of this will be. to reduce further .the supplies of bottles and jars that are available in-' this country. I have been informed that three mills in Victoria which have been producing board and paper have had to close down. I put it to' the Prime Minister that the combination of these circumstances is likely to lead",11
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable .gentleman is beginning to debate the matter. What is his question?,11
4,Mr HOLT,Unknown,Will this combination of circumstances lead to a complete collapse of Australia's food-producing industries? What action is proposed for an improvement of supplies of coal?,11
5,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"It is true that production of coal at present is not sufficient to supply all the needs of industry. It was pointed out during a recent debate that the demands on existing coal supplies have risen by leaps and bounds, and that the present requirements of industry throughout the Commonwealth are almost 50 per cent, in excess of those of pre-war years. Existing supplies being' insufficient to meet requirements,' all .that can' be done is to ensure that they shall be distributed equitably. This is done through the CommonwealthCoal Comand. committees in each State. The Commonwealth Government is .tak- ing all. possible steps, in conjunction with the Government of New South Wales,- in which State' the main coal deposits are situated, to ensure that new coal-mines and open-out workings will begin production'as rapidly as possible. Any further action which the honourable member may be able to suggest, as a means .of increasing supplies of coal, will be received by me and examined by the Minister for Supply Mr ABBOTT.""- The Melbourne ' Herald last night reported that payments to stimulate coal production we're under- ^ stood to have cost the Commonwealth Government about £640,000. in i943 44? 7 If that is true, will the Prime Minister inform' the House whether that amount represents subsidies? If not, what, was ' the nature of the payments ?",11
6,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I think that figure correctly represents subsidies,' but I shall have a statement prepared setting out the position and the way in which the money was expended. THE WAR. AUSTRALIAN MEDAX.",11
7,Mr MCLEOD,Unknown,"Will the acting Minister for Defence inform the House whether Cabinet has decided to institute an Australian War Medal for all members of the Defence Forces of the Commonwealth who. participated in the war of 1939-45, including members of the mercantile marine, civil air pilots, members of the' Australian Comforts Fund and the Australian Red Cross, and embracing civilian men and women w]ao were attached to, or accredited to, the Defence Forces?",11
8,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"The answer is in the affirmative.. Arrangements are now being made to have such a medal issued. .Although difficulties - have arisen in the manufacture of the medal, I hope that it will be available at an early date! RE-ESTABLISHMENT. HOUSING: ACQUISITION OF SITES-LAN D SETTLEMENT 'OF EX-SEBVIOEMEN : BANK CREDIT.",12
9,Mr TURNBULL,Unknown,"Will the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction state whether it is a fact, as reported in the Melbourne Argus last week, that the Government'is considering the compulsory acquisition of all vacant blocks of land in suburban, areas in the capital cities for disposal to ex-service men and women who are prepared to undertake home construction? If so, is the Minister in a position to supply details of the proposal?",12
10,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"I have not read the report to which the honourable memher has referred. No action is contemplated' hy the Commonwealth Government along the lines indicated, but certain action may now be in hand by the Government of Victoria.",12
11,Mr LANGTRY,Unknown,"I understand that approximately £400,000,000 of bank credit was made available for war purposes at the interest rate of 1 per cent, [f so, will the Prime Minister consider obtaining, from the same source and at the same rate :of interest, all money required for land settlement of ex-servicemen and home building? If Commonwealth Bank credit was available to help in winning the war, why should it not be forthcoming for the rehabilitation of ex-service men and women?",12
12,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"It . is true that a considerable, sum - of money was made available in the form of bank credit for the purpose'of carrying on the war, but only because that was the last financial^ resource available for the heavy expendi-' ture associated with the war. If the pro-. posal which, has been suggested to the honourable member by certain bodies were adopted, and bank credit were made available without limitation, the result finally would be a complete depreciation of the currency and the utter nnancial collapse of the country. Admittedly in certain circumstances, which I do not propose to discuss now, it is eminently desirable to make a considerable. amount of bank credit available, but this is not the time to do that. As a result of the large sums of money that have accumulated in this and other countries, the community has been given an excess of purchasing power. This is tending towards general inflation, from which-the world, in part or in whole, is now suffering. It is true that some bank credit should be made available in any circumstances, but a responsible government has to give thought to the effects of the issue of such credit beyond the absolute requirements of the community. If it weremade available for homes for ex-service men and women, others would have just as great a claim to similar assistance, with the result that credit would be issued without limit and complete inflation would ensue. BRITISH STATESMEN. . . INVITATIONS TO VISIT AUSTRALIA. Mr MENZIESi-Recently , I spoke to the Prime Minister about the'possibility of a visit to Australia hy Mr Churchill at some convenient time, and of the desire of certain sporting bodies which had intimated to me their desire to' he associated with aninvitation to him. Has the Prime Minister anything further to say on the subject?",12
13,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), like other honourable members before him, spoke to me about an invitation to Mr and Mrs. Churchill to visit Australia. I have already told the House that'an invitation was issued to Mr Churchill when Mr. Curtin was Prime Minister, and that it still stood. At that time Mr Churchill' was not able to accept. Through the Leader of the Opposition, certain sporting bodies in Victoria intimated that it was desirable that Mr Churchill should visit Australia. I have sent a letter to Mr Churchill renewing the invitation previously extended by. the Australian Government, and suggesting that he might.' come at a time convenient to himself. That was the form in which the original invitation was couched. As honourable members know, an invitation has also heen extended Mr Attlee to visit Australia. He has accepted, but owing to the Peace ConLabour ference, he will not be able to come the date first proposed. However, he stated that the visit, is not to be cancelthere led, but only deferred. I think he arrive in Australia before the end of year. In the letter which I sent to Churchill renewing the invitation to and Mrs Churchill, I mentioned that certain sporting bodies, of which the Leader of the Opposition has spoken, would be glad to have him here, and I suggested that a suitable time would early in 1947. EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN ",12
14,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"Can the Minister Labour and National Service say whether it is a fact that the National Security (Female Minimum Rates) Regulations expire in December of this year? Seeing that 40 per cent, of the employees hospitals and laboratories' will then be faced with a reduction of wages varying from 6s. 6d. to 16s. a week, will the Minister say what action is contemplated to ""correct existing anomolies in the lation, and also to ensure that some constituency. tribunal will confirm the present rates so that peace and harmony may prevail in the new year?",13
15,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"The regulation mentioned by the honourable memtion ber is in the same position as Perhaps all other regulations which have kept stable the incomes of over 1,000,000 people during the war. Whatever was done about the regulation governing females' minimum rates would necessarily have, be done in - regard to all similar regurefers, lations. The only safe way I can suggest to ensure the continued stability of the incomes of more than 1,000,000 people for them to vote ""yes"" at the forthcerned, coming referendum. If they should fail to do so-bu t I do not think.that they will, because the people are too wise that-the Government will do the best it can to prevent chaos from ensuing. EMPLOYMENT. CLAMI S OF THE LABOU .K PARTY.",13
16,Mr HUTCHINSON,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister seen an advertisement which to appeared in most of the daily papers, inserted by authority of the Australian party, containing a photograph on of himself in most complacent mood, and has smoking a pipe ? Underneath the picture are words to the effect that the will Labour Government has solved the the problem of full employment. I now ask Mr the Prime Minister whether he is aware him that glassworks are not operating to their full capacity, that paper mills have been closed down, thereby throwing numbers of people out of work, and that thousands of other workers are either out be of work or are threatened with unemployment because of a shortage of coal. If so, does he not regard the advertisement as a distortion of the truth, and think that it should be withdrawn? Will for he also say how much longer Commonwealth offices are to be used for receiving moneys for party funds, and when he intends to .call "" Marco - Polo "" home to this country to answer a few questions rein garding external affairs?",13
17,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. J. S. Eosevear). - I remind the honourable member that it is not in order to refer to an honourable member of this House as Marco Polo, or reguby any name other than his office or",13
18,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I again want to make it clear that if questions are addressed to me in the form of the. latter portion of the honourable member's questhere will be no answer to them. I have not been guiltless of indulging in propaganda occasionally, but I am here to give what information I can in reply to serious questions couched in proper language. I did see the advertiseto ment to which the honourable member and I thought that the photograph of myself which it contained did not add to the attractiveness of the newspaper. is So far as general unemployment is conthe position is that it is impossible to obtain sufficient workers to carry out all the tasks that require to be done. for It is regrettable that, because of inability to obtain larger supplies of coal, due, in part, to the greatly increased consumption of coal, as the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction has pointed out, some workers are not able to produce as much as they otherwise would. Everything possible has been done by the Government to meet the situation, but the fact remains that sufficient labour is not available to meet the demands of the community. AUSTRALIAN LABOUR PARTY. INFLUENCE OF COMMUNISTS.",13
19,Mr BRYSON,Unknown,"Has the Minister for Information been advised of a report in the Melbourne Argus that a split over communism has threatened in the ranks of the Labour party in Victoria, and that, as a consequence, the Prime Minister will fly to Melbourne this afternoon? If so, can he confirm or deny the accuracy of the report?",14
20,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I should have liked the Prime Minister to answer the honourable member's question, because the right honourable gentleman knows why he proposes to fly to Melbourne this afternoon. I do not know who told the representative of the Melbourne Argus of the intended visit of the Prime Minister to that city. I heard of it yesterday, and I have an appointment with the right honourable gentleman in. Melbourne this evening. The matters that we propose to discuss, and the other matters to which the Prime Minister will give attention, will, I am sure, have nothing to do with any alleged split in the Labour party in Victoria over communism. For many years I have been a member of the central executive of the Labour party in that State. It consists of leaders of the Labour movement in Victoria, in both the industrial and political spheres, and is a very able body. It has perfect control of the Labour movement in the State. No split is threatened and none is likely. This canard, which apparently originated in the office of the Melbourne Argus, is what one would expect to emanate from Fascist head-quarters in that State. The office of that newspaper is popularly known as Fascist headquarters, and one has only to look at the madman controlling it, Mr. Errol Knox, and some of those who work for him, such as Mr Rasmussen, who used to be an Argus scribe in Canberra tobelieve that anything could emanate from the Argus office about any subject. Honourable members and the people generally should take no notice of what appears in that newspaper. DUTCH SHIPS.",14
21,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"Now that the industrial trouble in Queensland seems to have ended with the rout of the Communists there, will the Prime Minister use his best efforts with the Communists on the waterfront to bring to an end the shameful incident of the Dutch ships, so that Australian trade with a friendly ally may be resumed and men may not be kept out of employment in Australia?",14
22,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,The Government has at all times used its best efforts to settle any disputes that arise on the waterfront. ARMED FORCES. ' DISCHARGES OF ILLEGAL ABSENTEES.,14

36,Mr FRASER,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister seen a statementmade by the Leader of the Opposition at a political meeting at Queanbeyan last night that the present NOES. rate of expenditure under the heading of war was crazy and incredible? In view of this very serious statement affecting the country's finances, I ask is it not a fact that a large part of this expenditure is required to honour the promises made to members of the services during the war?",15
37,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,I have not ha.d an . opportunity to read the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition at the meeting to which the honourable member refers.,15
38,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,My speech evidently made a big impression.,15
39,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"In reply to the latter portion of the honourable member's question, I shall ask leave later to make a statement with regard to financial matters, and an opportunity will be given to honourable members to debate that statement. I then hope to be able to deal with the charge of extravagance in the use of public funds. As the honourable member.has .said a great proportion of the increased expenditure estimated for this year is due to the fact that the Government must honour the promises that have been made to .ex-service personnel. ARMED FORCES. NA FORCES - FRICTION BETWEEN TRALIAN Asn Dirroii FORCES ATMOROTAI. ,",15
40,Mr CONELAN,STRENGTH OF AUSTRALIAN MILITARY,"Will the Minister for the Army state the total strength of the Australian Military Forces, the number and disposition of troops serving outside Australia, and the-number serving-on the mainland? On a previous occasion I asked a question regarding alleged friction between Australian and Dutch troops at Morotai. Has the Minister any information on the matter ?",16
41,Mr ABBOTT,STRENGTH OF AUSTRALIAN MILITARY,"On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, I have a question on the notice paper, Question 26, which covers the same matter.""",16

43,Mr ABBOTT,STRENGTH OF AUSTRALIAN MILITARY,Wel l it covers most of,16
44,Mr SPEAKER,STRENGTH OF AUSTRALIAN MILITARY,"Hon. J. S. Eosevear). - I do not think it covers one-quarter the question asked by the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Conelan). The question placed on. the notice paper by the honourable memher for Newthat England (Mr Abbott) refers to the be number of men in the Army now in camp in Australia,' and I think that that is about as much of the honourable gentleshipping man's question as is covered by the question asked by the honourable member for Griffith.",16
45,Mr FORDE,STRENGTH OF AUSTRALIAN MILITARY,"The total strength of the Australian Military Forces on the 11th July, 1946, was approximately 99,000, of whom 86,000 were on the mainland of Australia and 13,000 outside Australia. Of those outside Australia, 10,026 were in Japan, 2,000 in New Guinea, 550 in Morotai and I think about330 in Macassar. The honourable gentleman referred to the alleged friction between Australian and Dutch troops in Morotai. I have made careful inquiries, and I am advised that no tension or friction exists between the Dutch and Australian forces there and that complete co-operation between the two forces is maintained. I assurethe honourable gentleman that' everything possible is being done by the Government to bring troops from Morotai and other places back to Australia as soon as possible, consistent with looking after equipment and loading it onto landing craft transports. Troops are in training AUSto relieve the Australian troops in Japan so as to ensure that our promise shall be carried out to return troops from Japan - shortly after they have completed one year's service there. NA SERVICES. TRANSPORT OF HOUSING MATERIALS.",16
46,Dame ENID LYONS,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"I have frequently stressed the fact ""that Tasmania is entirely dependent on shipping for the transport to that State of heavy materials. Many houses in Tasmania at present are standing, and have stood for months, without roofs. .Cargoes of building materials arrive at infrequent intervals, and it often happens that a consignment of roofing iron is received it. without the necessary ridge coping or spouting. That means, of course, that of no improvement can be affected in Tasmania's housing position. Will the Minister representing the Minister for - Supply and Shipping give an assurance the attention of that department will drawn to the fact that, in the allocation of cargo space for building materials, it is necessary. to have due regard for the of complementary items by the same ship to ensure the greatest possible speed in carrying out the housing programme ?",16
47,Mr DEDMAN,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"I shall confer with my colleague, the Minister for Supply and Shipping, and ascertain whether the . matter to which the honourable member has referred can be rectified. NEW GUINEA AND PAPUA. RETURN OF FORMER RESIDENTS: REQUIREMENT OF BON D.",16
48,Mr CHAMBERS,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"Can the Minister for External Territories say whether former residents of Papua and New Guinea who have been issued with permits to re-enter those territories to take up residence, are required to lodge a £30 bond, in addition to the cost of theii fares, with the shipping companies and air-line operators before they can secure passages ?",16
49,Mr WARD,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"Recently , my attention was drawn to the fact that transport companies were asking former residents of New Guinea and Papua, to lodge a bond of £30 before issuing tickets to them The department immediately took action to remove this obstacle, because it was considered that old residents of these areas should not be required to provide a bond. The practice now is that when a person applies for a permit to enter those territories, the permit is endorsed by the department in such a way that the transport authorities will, know whether a'bond is to be asked for or not. In respect of former residents a bond is not required. SUGAR,",17
50,Mr BERNARD CORSER,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"In March last, representations were made to the Prime Minister, on. behalf of the Australian sugar industry, for a subsidy on £667,000 worth of jute goods imported up to the 30th June, 1945. The request was rejected, but consideration of a later claim in respect of importations after the 30th June, 1945, was indicated. As representations have now been made for a subsidy on jute imported during the laterperiod, I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government will, give the request sympathetic consideration in view of the fact that other industries, including the wheat and wool industries, receive a subsidy, and also that the present sugar crop has been depleted severely by flood, cyclone, frost and drought.",17
51,Mr CHIFLEY,TASMANIAN SHIPPING,"It is true .that representations have been made at various times regarding the payment of n subsidy on jute lised in the sugar' industry. The matter was considered by myself and the late Minister for Trade and Customs, Senator Keane, and also by Cabinet. The Tariff Board had made an inquiry into the sugar industry, and had reported that, generally, the industry was in a satisfactory condition. Some time ago, Mr Muir also made representations to me on behalf of .'the sugar-growers, and I then promised that I would ask the Minister for Trade and Customs to make a further examination of the subject with me. I propose to do that, but I am not able to make any other promise at the moment. T88] THE PARLIAMENT. - QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: CAT.I. FROM THE CHAIR. Mr SPEAKER. (Hon. J. S. Eosevear). - I am continually hearing very audible interjections and complaints which appear to reflect upon the impartiality of the Chair in giving the call to honourable members. Therefore, I inform honourable members, although I believe that all of them are aware of it, that the first 35 minutes of the period allotted to questions without notice is recorded and re-broadcast. That, I suppose, is important to them. On Wednesday, I kept a complete list of the names of those honourable members who asked questions during that period, and of other honourable members who asked questions after its expiration. Yesterday, as honourable members rose, I reversed the order of' that call. Therefore, those .honourable gentlemen whose questions were not re-broadcast on Wednesday had an opportunity to ask questions which would have been rebroadcast on Thursday. This morning, I . have been endeavouring to call those remaining honourable members who undoubtedly would like to ask questions in the first 35 minutes. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) has not been treated any worse than has any other honourable member, and I shall not show favouritism to .any one in the call. FINANCI AL STATEMENT.",17
52,Mr CHIFLEY,TASMANIAN SHIPPING," by leave It would"" not be practicable to prepare and bring down a budget with detailed estimates and papers before the end of August. The Government therefore does not intend to bring down a budget for 1946-47 to this Parliament. It does, however, intend to bring down immediately two important financial proposals. One of these will provide for a reduction of taxation to apply as from the 1st July this year and the other for a liberalization of the eligibility for invalid and old-age and widow's pensions. The main purpose of this statement is to give particulars of these proposals, to inform the House of the nnancial results for last year, and to give Some indication of the financial outlook for the current year. When I presented the budget last September less than a month had passed since the end of the war with Japan. Fighting had ceased, but the whole task of reconstruction lay ahead. was evident that though we might push forward in this task with all possible speed, the process would take time. an economic sense, the burden of would continue and be diminished only gradually,' and this had to be recognized in our nnancial plans. DEMOBILIZATION. The Government acted on the view that early demobilization of the forces was the key to the major problemof transition. The sooner the great body of men and w ° m e n and related activities were returned to peace occupations, the sooner would war costs fall and civil production increase to meet the pent-up demand for goods and services which constituted the danger of inflation. General demobilization began on the 1st October last year and - I may fairly claim that it has proceeded with-unexampled success. Originally it was planned that by the 30th June of this year 400,000 men and women would have been discharged from the services. actual fact this target was exceeded by 50,000, so that during the nine months some 450,000 men and women were made available for civil employment. It is probably true to say that nowhere amongst the Allied countries have these results been bettered. The effect is seen in employment figures. At the 30th, June, 1945, there were 2,650,000 men and women in civil occupations in Australia. At the 30th June this year, despite the fact that a large number of women and over-age men have withdrawn from the employment field, the number in civil occupations is estimated to have been 3,030,000. In other words, nearly 400,000 more people are on civil production now than there were a year ago. This figure, of course, takes no account of those discharged servicemen who are still on leave before taking up employment. Perhaps the most gratifying feature of this great change-over process has been Mr Chifley. the rapidity and ease with which people discharged from war. occupations have been absorbed into civil employment. ' During the past year over 500,000 men It and women have been released from defence and other government occupations. Yet at no stage has there been In any significant number of unemployed, war and the amount paid in unemployment allowances and servicemen's reinstatement allowances has been negligible. BUDGET RESULTS, "" 1945-46. The speeding up of demobilization last ye'ar was reflected in the approximate budget results which are. now available. War expenditure in Australia was £340,000,000, compared with the budget engaged in the services estimate of £298,000,000. For this a group of items arising out of the return and disbandment of troops, the movement of ships and aircra'f t, and the dismantling and storage of war equipment was principally responsible. Deferred pay alone was £18,000,000 above the budget estimate. The settlement on demobilization of leave and other accumulated credits in pay books also brought active pay above the estimate by £4,000,000. Ship movements and aircraft maintenance cost an additional £5,000,000. Reciprocal lendIn lease and subsidies - to primary producers also exceeded the estimates by £6,000,000 .and £7,000,000 respectively. On the other hand, due to the delay in the presentation of accounts by the United Kingdom authorities, overseas war ex-, penditure reached only £38,000,000, com- . pared with the budget estimate of £62/000,000. Accordingly, actual total war expenditure of £378,000,000 showed a net excess over the budget estimate of only £18,000,000. In the previous year total - war expenditure was £460,000,000. The reduction on the previous year-'s war expenditure is less than some have expected. I have, however, already referred to certain major terminal charges which were met in the financial year 1945-46. For deferred pay alone we met a liability of £72,000,000 which had accrued during the war. Other terminal costs are spread over numerous items of expenditure and cannot be isolated at this stage. However, the main items of direct service expenditure show large reductions over the previous year. For example, Army expenditure on arms, armament and ammunition fell from £2S,000,000 in 1944-45 to £13,000,000 in 1945-46. Expenditure oh Army camp expenses and rations fell from £26,000,000 to £17,000,000, and expenditure on aircraft equipment and stores from £46,000,000 to £24,000,000. Reciprocal lend-lease fell from £89,000,000 to £26,000,000. Against this, certain indirect costs of the war showed an unavoidable increase. Debt charges rose from £34,000,000 in 1944-45 to £42,000,000 last year, primary production .and price.'stabilization subsidies from £25,000,000 to £33,000^000, and re-establishment expenses from £1,000,000 to £5,000,000. In addition, a new item of £6,000,000 for contributions to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration appeared. For the information of honourable members a comparison of 1945-46 with 1944-45 under the main heads ofcwar expenditure is set out in Table No. 1. Non-war expenditure equalled the estimates at £132,000,000, bringing the total expenditure for 1945-46 to £510,000,000. Excluding taxation collections of £34,000,000 reimbursed to the States, taxation yielded £319,000,000, and other revenue £38,000,000, a total of £357,000,000. The actual gap between war expenditure and available revenue was therefore £153,000,000, compared with the budget estimate of £152,000,000. I would emphasize particularly that this was financed wholly from the proceeds of borrowings from the public. This means that in the past two financial years the Government has met the whole of its war expenditure without recourse to treasury bills, or any other form of central bank credit. Details of actual receipts and expenditure for 1945-46 compared with the budget estimates are set out in Tables 2, 3 and 4. The figures are of course preliminary only and subject to adjustment. - Conversions and 'Redemptions. In July last year the Government exercised its option of redeeming in London £94,312,000 of Commonwealth and State securities which carried interest at 5 per cent, per annum; £60,000,000 worth of stock was converted into a 3£ per cent. loan to mature in 19'65'-69, and £34,312,000 was repatriated to Australia, 3^ per cent, securities of an equivalent amount being issued to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. A further option which accrued in December, 1945, .in respect of stock amounting to £14,05o-,000 was also taken up. This stock carried' interest at 5 per cent, per annum, and it was converted into a 3 per cent, - loan, to mature in 1958-60, at the issue price of £98. Since the Labour Government took office in 1941 Australia's governmental loan indebtedness in London has been re.duced by £57,000,000 sterling, or £72,000,000 Australian currency. This has been accomplished by the transfer to Australia of debt amounting to £49,000,000 sterling and the redemption of £8,000,000 sterling from the National Debt Sinking Fund. This reduction of our overseas indebtedness, coupled with conversions of loans to lower rates of interest, has resulted in a reduction of our annual interest liability in London by £4,500,000 sterling, or £5,600,000 Australian currency. FINANCIAL OUTLOOK FOE 1946-47. Although detailed estimates for 194647 have not yet been completed, so that any estimates now given must be regarded as provisional, it is desirable to give some broad indication of the financial outlook for the year. The field which calls for the closest review is war expenditure, which last year totalled £378,000,000. This group item was used during the was years to cover all expenditures attributable to the war, and the same classification was used last year because the Pacific war was still being fought when the estimates were prepared and a continuance of active war expenditure for a considerable time after V-J day was inescapable. Even during the war years, however, the group item included costs which, whilst arising out of the war, were not direct war costs in the sense that arms and equipment and active service pay were. Debt charges, price stabilization subsidies and re-establishment are examples of these indirect war costs, and since the war ended they have bulked much more largely in the total expenditure. In 1945-46 they accounted for £182,000.000 as follows :Deferred pay Debt charges .. 42 Subsidies to primary producers 20 Price stabilization subsidies Re-establishment and pensions ... 14 Shipping and merchant ship construction .. .. Unrra .. Miscellaneous This represented 48 per cent, of the budget war expenditure of £378,000,000. In the previous year the same items represented only 19 per cent. Accordingly, when the budget is framed it will be necessary to re-arrange the groupings more in accord with peacetypical time conditions. Meanwhile, from the more detailed analysis of last year's war expenditure set out in Table I . , some ideacan oe years yet. gained of the items in which major reductions can be expected in the current year. Of these items, expenditure on. the three service departments and reciprocal lendlease is the chief. Last year the total was £333.000,000. This year I hope that it can be reduced by something in the neighbourhood of 50 per cent. It should be clearly understood what will be comprised in the gross expenditure of the service departments for this year. Much of it will still represent be some increase. terminal costs of the war. Deferred pay on account of members of the war-time forces who will be demobilized this year will be approximately £15,000,000. The occupation force in Japan' and certain forces in the islands have still to be maintained. We have also to provide about £8,000,000 under the lend-lease settle-, nient, which. I will describe later, about £20,000,000 for past liabilities to the United Kingdom. There will also be a small amount for reciprocal lendhe lease. These items are in the strictestestablishment sense a carry-over from our fighting effort. Concurrently with the winding up war-time demobilization, we have to carry forward the organization of our peacewhat time defences, which will proceed on basis that recognizes the greater shara Sfr. Chifley. of responsibility accepted by Australia for security in the Pacific zone. Thus service expenditure this year will be a £m. blend of war-time and peace-time costs, 72 and the latter element must continue beyond this year into the future. .. 13 Similarly there will be expenditure, though on a considerably reduced scale, 7 on such activities, as munitions, supply .. 6 and shipping and aircraft production, 8 ' which had their origin in the war bui which have a bearing on future defence 182 and in part also upon our peace-time development. Next there is a wide and varied group of items which can be described as transitional because they are necessarily incurred in the changeover from war to peace. Re-establishment, training, soldiers' settlement and war gratuities are of these. Last year these items cost £5,000,000. This year they will cost perhaps £25,000,000, ' and they must remain at a relatively high level for some Our contribution to Unrra, which last year cost £6,000,000 and this year will cost £12,000,000, comes within the group. Subsidies for price stabilization and, in many cases, subsidies for primary producers, arose out of war and yet are even more necessary in the transition period. Last year expenditure on subsidies was £33,000,000, including £20,000,000 for primary producers. There will certainly be no saving this year and there may yet Finally, there are certain residual war u03ts which must continue indefinitely War pensions and some branches of repatriation are examples. The cost of these last year was £9,000,000, This year there ""must be a substantial increase. Interest and sinking fund on war loans are in the same category. This year they will and amount to £50,000,000, as compared with due £42,000,000 last year. Within the limits of its obligations io nation for security and for the reof former servicemen and women, the Government will curtail war, defence and associated expenditure to an of absolute minimum. It is impossible at this stage to give any firm estimate of the total for these items will be in a 1946-47. Nevertheless, whilst those carry over costs to which I have referred will partly offset reduction in service expenditures, I nope that an overall reduction approaching £150,000,000 can be accomplished on the net expenditure of £378,000,000 last year. Non-war expenditure last year was £132,000,000. There will be a substantial increase this year. Actual payments from the National Welfare Fund will increase hy about £21,000,000, ' of which £16,000,000 will be provided from the budget. Payments to the States will increase by £6,000,000, and the Department of Civil Aviation, the Post Office and other essential services will require more funds. A total increase of at least £45,000,000 can be expected. The main conclusions, to be drawn from this review are that, whilst a large reduction in service, costs can be effected this year, there are still heavy expenditures to be met for terminal items, such as deferred pay and maintenance of occupation forces; large recurring items such' as war pensions and interest and sinking fund, heavy subsidies for price control, and very large increases in normal services, including welfare payments and civil aviation. As to revenue, a firm estimate can ' not be given in a preliminary survey of this kind. The higher level of civil employment, more production, and probably a greater volume of imports, will be reflected in revenue, particularly indirect taxation. In the light, however, of the analysis given above, total expenditure must still exceed revenue by a considerable margin. This margin will be very, much less than last year, but it will still make a substantial call upon finance from public loans. It must also be expected that more loan moneys will, have to he raised during 1.946-47 to finance the Loan Council programmes. Although public works activi ties will be limited by the supply of materials and appropriate types of labour, it is to be expected that the State governments and their subsidiary bodies will, endeavour to push forward with theii deferred plans for development and the provision of many kinds of public facilities. At the Loan Council meeting next month a loan works programme for the Commonwealth and the States will he considered, and the overall figure will be well above the level of recent years. Housing, of course, will have a very high priority, and i i is expected that not less than £20,000,000 will have to be provided on this account. Mr BERNARD' CORSER - I rise to a question of privilege. Some time ago I asked the Prime Minister whether he would make a printed copy of this statement available to each honourable member. We are entitled to that, because it is not always easy to hear the right honourable gentleman.",17

This analysis demonstrates clearly the limitations which face the Government in considering taxation reductions. Nevertheless, we have done a lot in a short time, to cut down the financial burden of the war and its aftermath, and to push forward that reconversion of our economy which will bring higher .production and more buoyant revenues. The Government is anxious to provide all possible stimulus to this reconversion which appropriate tax reductions can give; . therefore, as I have already indicated, the Governinent proposes to make a second substantial cut in direct taxation by reducing the income tax, including the social services contribution, at a cost of £17,500,000. Including the reductions made last financial year, this brings the total tax remissions np to £37,000,000 for income tax and £4,000,000 for sales tax, a total of £41,000,000. Relief will be given through a graduated reduction of rate3. The new scale of rates will have the effect of lifting the income level at which persons with dependants, will become liable to pay income tax. Tables showing the amounts of income tax and social services contribution that will be payable by various 'classes of taxpayers in different income groups, and comparing these amounts with amounts payable under existing and peak wartime scales, are being circulated. Thenew combined rates of income tax and social services contribution represent an overall reduction of 22 per cent, from the peak war-time rates first enacted in 1943. On that basis the reductions range from more than 47 per cent, on the lowest incomes to something under 20 .per cent, on incomes exceeding £1,500. The new rates of income tax will apply for the full year commencing the 1st July, 1946. However, because of the necessity to print and circulate new scales of tax instalments, it may be about the beginning of September before adjustments can be made in the pay-asyou-earn deductions from salaries and wages. The social services contribution will be levied according to a separate scale. The basic rate will commence at 3d. in the £1, and will increase .progressively by ^d. for each £1 of income in excess of £100 until a maximum of 18d. in the £1 is reached. The basic rate will apply in the case of a person who is not entitled to any income tax concessions for dependants, life 'assurance, &c. In these cases the maximum rate of lSd. in the £1 will apply to incomes of £220 and over, instead of £170 and over as at present. The basic rate will be varied in order to preserve the concessions allowed to contributors, for dependants, life assurance and superannuation payments, &c. The rates now proposed for social services contribution will greatly facilitate the work of assessment of the contribution payable. It is therefore proposed to make the rate retrospective to the 1st January, 1946, which is the date on which the contribution was first imposed. NATIONA L ""WELFARE PROPOSALS. It is also proposed that in respect of old-age .pensions, including service pensions and invalid and widows' pensions, the permissible income shall be lifted from 12s. 6d. a week to £1 a week and the limit of property allowed from £400 to £650. At the same time certain other liberalizations of the law in regard to property will be made. The full effect of these proposals is explained in the statement which is being distributed. It is probable that some 50,000 old-age, invalid, and widow pensioners not at present receiving the full pension will receive an increase. In addition, ahout 95,000 new pensioners will be brought into the field-10,000 of these as a result Mr Chifley. of .raising the income test and 85,000 through raising the property limit. The total cost of the proposals will be about £4,500,000 a year. The Government has decided that the question of any further liberalization of the means ti?st shall be examined from year to year in the light of the financial .position existing at the time. Legis-. lation to give effect to the present proposals will be introduced in the current session. SETTLEMENT FOR LEND-LEASE AND RECIPROCAL LEND-LEASE. On the. 7th June, 1946, the Commonwealth Government and the Government of the United States of America signed an agreement under the terms of which final settlement was reached with respect to lend-lease to Australia, reciprocal lend-lease by Australia to the United States, and financial claims between the two countries arising out of the war. This agreement brought to conclusion many months of negotiations between Australian and United States representatives - in Washington, and the final settlement not only represents a most advantageous arrangement for Australia, but also manifests a generous attitude on the part of the United States negotiators to Australia. The settlement undoubtedly reflects the same degree of close relationship and the spirit which existed between the United States and Australia during the war period. Under the terms of the agreement, the United States Government releases the Commonwealth Government from any liability with respect to materials and services provided under lend-lease and consumed prior to V-J day. ' Similarly the Commonwealth Government releases the United States Government from any liability tyith respect to materials and services provided by Australia under reciprocal lend-lease and consumed prior to V-J day. The agreement also provides that Australia acquires from the United States unconsumed - lend-lease goods and materials, both civilian and military, on hand at V-J day, certain materials and services on order through lend-lease channels but undelivered at V-J day, and certain surplus war property of the United States armed forces. On the other hand the United States acquires from Australia all reciprocal lend-lease materials in the hands of the United States forces on V-J day and materials and services furnished by Australia to the channels but undelivered at V-J day, and the 31st December, 1945. Both Governments reserve a right to recapture lend-lease or reciprocal lend-lease articles held by the armed forces of the other Government, but it is clearly understood that this right will not be generally exercised. In addition, except forcertain financial claims which are specified in the agreement or in respect of which the liability of either Government had already been acknowledged, all financial claims between the Governments of Australia and the United States arising out of'the war are waived. Australia has agreed to pay for the post-war value of certain machine tools and other items of capital equipment received under lend-lease and for certain lend-lease non-combat aircraft and spares remaining in Australia. In consideration of this lend-lease capital equipment and of the Australian purchases of certain United States Army and Navy surpluses, to which I have already referred, Australia will make a total and final payment of $27,000,000, or approximately £8,400,000, of which $20,000,000 is payable in United States dollars. The balance of $7,000,000 is payable in Australian currency and under the terms of the agreement $5,000,000 out of this $7,000,000 has been earmarked for the development of cultural relationships in a manner mutually agreeable to the two Governments. The remaining $2,000,000 has been earmarked for the purchase by the United States of real property and improvements required by the United States Government for its functions in Australia. Following conclusion of the agreement, the Government instructed all Commonwealth departments to take immediate - steps to declare to the Commonwealth Disposals Commission any goods which are surplus to the Commonwealth's requirements. The sale of these surpluses to private purchasers will be arranged by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. Lend-lease and reciprocal lend lease : represent the largest external financial transaction in the history of the Commonwealth. The total value of lend-lease received by Australia was about $1,500,000,000, whilst reciprocal lendlease from Australia to the United States was approximately £285,000,000. In view of the very considerable amounts involved and the extremely complex nature of lend-lease and reciprocal lendlease operations,. it is a source of considerable satisfaction to the Commonwealth Government that the final settlement should be based upon the generous and acceptable agreement that has been reached with the United States .Government. Copies of ""the settlement'agreement are being circulated to honourable members for their information. PRODUCTION A ND PRICE CONTROL. Greater all-round production of essential goods must be the central aim of economic policy now and for a long time to come. The war years have left their toll in shortages, some of which will take years to remedy. We cannot get back in a day all those standards of living and enjoyment which the war compelled us to forego. Yet we can win them back and much more with them if we will make an effort, and the way is now wide open for U8 to make that effort. Most of our resources are free once again for civil production, and full employment of these, steadily maintained, can work wonders in output. Then, as output and real incomes rise, taxation can be reduced still further. It has been our policy to remove all forms of control which, tend to hinder genuine business dealings and the production of essentials. But we remain inflexibly opposed to those false inducements which inflated - prices and excessive profits would give. Control of prices in Australia has been a triumph of war-time administration. The fact that over the whole war period retail prices rose not more than 24 per cent, and that during the years when the strain on our economy was greatest they did not rise at all, is a record with which not more than two or three other countries can offer anything to compare. But we shall not gain the full value of this achievement unless it can be carried on into the peace years when the balance production and demand can be trusted look after price levels. At present - chasiug .power still greatly exceeds the supply of goods and services, and must 'Continue to do so until local production yind the flow of imports catch up with consumers' needs.

The Governpurment's 'price stabilization plan will no doubt require to be modified from time to time in accordance with the re-adjustiiient of basic cost, and supply factors in the transition from war to peace.

At present, the rate of contribution in cases where the maximum rate of ls. 6d. in the £1 does not apply, .is ascertained hy reference to the amount of income tax the taxpayer would pay,, after deducting all rebates, if income tax were levied on his taxable income at 87^ per cent, of war-time rates of tax. In the notional income tax assessment, all rebates are allowed. The rebates so allowed include the special rebate of 2s. MENZIES) on each £1 of interest derived from certain government and semi-government' loans included in the taxable income of the taxpayer. Now that the rate of contribution is to be calculated without reference to the amount of income tax payable, it is necesfor an sary to make special provision in the Social Services Contribution Assessment Act so as to preserve to persons in the lower income groups the benefit of the special rebate of 2s. in the £1 on interest on such securities. The effect of the proposed amendment will be that where a does not obtain the full benefit of the rebate in his income tax assessment, the whole, or relevant part, of the rebate willy as the case requires, be allowable from the social services contribution of a. otherwise payable by him.

INVALID AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS BILL 1946 Motion (by Mr Holloway) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a bill act to amend the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act 1908-1945. Bill presented, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",26
56,Mr HOLLOWAY,CONTRIBUTION ASSESSMENT,"Melbourne P o r Minister for 'Labour and National 12s. 6d. a week. Service) [11.53] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. It is with considerable pleasure that move the second reading of this bill, which provides a substantial measure relaxation of the means test in relation to invalid and old-age pensions payments. I am sure that the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) and my other Cabinet colleagues would permit me to say that this bill is the first step in a long-range plan designed to eliminate' completely the means test from our social service legislation. The chief features of the bill are, first, the raising from 12s. 6d. to. £1 a week of the amount of income also own their own home, without -.any. which an invalid or old-age pensioner may - have without his pension being affected; in respect of a blind pensioner affected. the permissible income will be increased from £5 to £5 7s. 6d. a week; secondly, the raising of the property bar £400 to £650; thirdly, the elimination of certain items of property from conto sideration in the assessment of a pension, and, lastly, though by no means the the removal of an objectionable feature of the present law, namely, the disqualibeing fication for pension benefit of an adult invalid, whose parents are deemed to adequately maintain him. About a year ago the Government decided to eliminate this and several other anomalies hy the introduction of a consolidated measure dealing with social services, but circumstances hare made its introduction impossible. When old-age pensions were introduced in June, 1909, the permissible income was 10s. a week; and the maximum rate of pension was also 10s. a week. Although there have since been many increases of the maximum pension, there has been only one increase of the permissible income. That was made in .1923, the increase being from 10s. to 12s. 6d. a for an week. The maximum pension at that time was 17s. 6d. a week; it is now 32s. 6d. a week. It is anomalous that, whilst the maximum pension has advanced during the past 37 years from 10s. to 32s. 6d. a week, the - permissible t s - income has risen only from 10s. to The effect of the increase of permissible income provided' for in I the bill will be that in future income in excess of £1 a week, instead of 12s. 6d. of as at present, will be deducted from the pension of 32s. 6d. a week. The amount of income which will preclude payment of any portion of a pension to an unmarried or widowed person will thus become £2 12s. 6d. a week, instead-of £2 5s. In respect of married persons, it will become £5 5s. a week instead of £4 10s. A married couple, both pensioners, will be able to receive income of £2 a week between them, in addition to a maximum pension of 32s. 6d. ,a ,week each, a total of £5 5s. a week. T-he$ may ; limit in value, and other property under £120 without their pensions being The benefit of the increase of from 7 s. 6d. a week in the limit of permissible income will also be extended blind persons. The blind are already in a favoured position in this respect, the least amount of income which a blind person may have without reduction of pension £5 a week. This will be raised to £5 7s. 6d. a week. The effect will be that income in excess of £5 7s. 6d. a week, instead of £5, will be deducted from the pension of 32s. 6d. a week. The amount of income which will disqualify a blind person from receiving a pension will thus become £7, instead of £6 12s. 6d. a week. Where both husband and wife are blind they will be able to have between them an income of £5 7s. 6d. a week, and leach may receive the full pension of £1' 12s. 6d. a week, a total of £8 12s. in lieu of the present amount of £8 5s. a week. Where they have income in excess of £5 7s. 6d. a week, half the amount of excess income will be deducted from each pension. In 1909, ownership of property to the value of £310 disqualified a claimant for & pension. The progressive scale of ^deductions was the the same as at present, namely, £1 per annum for every complete £10 in excess of £50. These deductions then eliminated, the pension of £26* per annum at £310. There has been only one increase of the property limit. It - was made in 1923, the increase' being Jrom £310 to the. present figure of £400. At that time the maximum pension was "" 17s. 6d. a week. The retention of the . £400 limit, while the pension has - advanced from £45 10s. to £84 10s. per. - annum, has resulted in the arbitrary pro- vision that, whereas a person with pro perty, other than a home valued at £400 may receive a pension of £49 10s. per annum, a person with property, other than a home, valued at £401 or more, cannot receive any pension at all. That anomaly will be rectified by the measure before the House. The effect of the higher property limit provided for in the bill will be that unmarried or widowed persons with property, apart from a home, valued at between £401 and £650, who now receive no pension, will be eligible for a pension ranging from a nominal sum up to £49 10s. per annum. Pension up to the same amount will be payable to married claimants who between them possess property, apart from a home, between £801 and £1,300 in value. It is proposed to retain the present scale of progressive deductions from pension-£1 per annum for every complete £10 above £50-for property up to £400, but £2 per annum will he deducted for every complete £10 of property between £401 and £650, thus eliminating the penfion of £84 10s. per annum at £650: Mr Holloway. As honourable members areaware, home in which a pensioner resides does under the present law, the value of a not affect the rate of pension, no matter what its value may be. This exemption has operated since 1912. The bill provides for additional classes of property 6d. to be disregarded.. These concessions relate to surrender values of life assurance policies up to a limit of £200, the capital value of any life, interest or annuity, the value of any contingent interest and the present value, up to £500, of any reversionary interest. Legacies or shares in estates of deceased persons will also be disregarded until they are actually received by the pensioner. To my mind it has always been anomalous and somewhat unfair to hold against a pensioner as property the amount which he could obtain by surrendering a small life policy. These policies are usually kept alive by the exercise of the utmost thrift on the part of those pensioners who hold them. A pensioner cannot obtain the surrender value without substantial loss of premiums paid, and it is scarcely just to reduce the pension on account of the policy - 1 and thus perhaps force him to suffer that loss - Where the policy is a fairly substantial one, carrying a surrender value of more than £200, only the excess over £200 will be taken into account, and against this excess may be offset the property exemption of £50. The present treatment of the capital value of a life interest or an annuity as property is . also a definite anomaly, as the life tennant or annuitant cannot at the same time enjoy his interest or annuity, which is taken into account in the income means test, and derive any benefit from the capital which, nevertheless, is taken into account in the property means, test. The treatment of a contingent interest as property is also anomalous. An example of this is the case in which the pensioner will receive a benefit if he survives another person; if he does not survive neither he nor his estate can benefit from the inlerest. The hill will remove these anomalies. A reversionary interest is a more tangible asset. Usually the pensioner is to come into possession of an estate or property upon the death of a life tenant. If the pensioner pre-deceases the life tenant, the estate or property in due course goes to the pensioner's estate. Nevertheless, a good deal of hardship is caused by treating such interests as property of the pensioner. The type of reversionary interest held by a pensioner is usually not sufficiently attractive to enable him to dispose of it to advantage, and, consequently, the treatment-of such an interest as property in his hands only deprives him of pension benefit whilst leaving him withoiit present advantage from his reversionary interest. It is, therefore, proposed to disregard £500 of the present value of any reversionary interest. For such an interest to have a present value in excess of £500, the estate or property would need to be fairly substantial, and the period before it is likely to be received by the pensioner relatively short. In such a case only the excess of the present - value over £500 will be treated as property of the pensioner, and against this excess may also he offset the previously mentioned exemption of £50. A legacy or a share in a deceased estate is, of course, property for the purposes of the Act, but it frequently happens that there is considerable delay in realization and distribution of the estate. The legacy or share in the estate vests in the pensioner and forms part of his assets from the date of the testator's death but, in practice, the department takes the bequest into account from the date of grant of probate or letters of administration. However, where the realization and distribution are delayed, hardship is caused by treating the bequest as property of the pensioner before he actually receives anything in respect of it from the estate. It is proposed to remove this cause of hardship by providing that the amount of the pensioner's share or interest shall not to be treated as property until it has actually been received by him. There is adequate power in the act to deal suitably with any case which may possibly arise where a pensioner may seek to take undue advantage of this provision by being party to delay in distribution of the estate. All the concessions contained in the hill in regard to income and property will apply not only to old-age .and - invalid pensions but also to allowances paid to the wives of invalid pensioners. The maximum rate of allowance to the wife of an invalid pensioner is 15s. a week, and the assessment is affected by income and jiroperty in exactly the same way as an invalid or old-age pension payable to a married person. Consequently, recipients of such allowances at reduced rates on account of income, or on account of any of the items of property which are to be disregarded, will receive increases as a result of the liberalizations provided in the bill. The additional allowance of 5s. a week paid to the wife of an invalid pensioner in respect of one child under sixteen years of age is not subject to reduction on account of the income or property of' the parents. I come now to what is known as the .adequate maintenance provision of the act. This provision has operated since the inception of invalid pensions in 1910. It specifically disqualifies a claimant, irrespective of age, if his .parents adequately maintain him. Whilst there is justification for this where the claimant is under 21 years of age, the application of this principle to claimants over that age is indefensible. Approximately 400 claims for invalid pensions are rejected annually under this provision, about two-thirds being those made hy invalids over 21 years of age. In some cases the claimant is between 40 and 50 years of age. There is even an instance of an invalid, 55 years of age, who was refused a pension because he was fully maintained by this widowed mother who derived an income of £370 per annum from a farm - In another case, an invalid 46 years of age was disqualified because he was kept by his father, a widower, whose income as an orchardist was £294 per annum. I doubt if it was ever intended by the Parliament that invalid pensions should be refused in cases such as these, but, while the provision remains as at present, it must be applied to all cases on the facts,, irrespective of the age of the claimant. The depressing effect on an adult invalid of the realization that he must remain indefinitely a financial burden on his parents can well be imagined. Added to the deprivation of most of the normal enjoyments of life, this-is a heavy penalty for the invalid to carry through life. The payment of a pension to an invalid at the age of 21 years will create a desirable sense of independence and give the invalid an added interest in life, which will not only serve somewhat to mitigate his affliction, but will also strengthen his position as a unit in society. It is estimated that the concessions vided for in the bill will enable increased payments to be ""made to some 42,000 old age and invalid pensioners, including wives of invalid pensioners, who are now receiving reduced payments. There will be no need for pensioners to make application for the increase. The Department of Social Services will make the necessary reassessments within a very short time after the date on which the bill becomes law, and the increased rates will operate from the first pension pay-day after that date. The concessions will also bring approximately 88,000 additional persons into the old-age and invalid pensions field. The total additional cost in respect of age and invalid pensions is estimated not to exceed £4,250,000, raising the annual cost from £29,000,000 to £33,250,000. The liberalized conditions in regard to' income and property will also be applied to widows' pensions and to service pensions payable to ex-servicemen in respect of age and invalidity. Separate bills amending the Widows' Pensions Act and the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act will be introduced for this purpose and opportunity will then be taken to explain the effect of the liberalizations in relation to such pensioners. I am confident that the bill will have general support from honourable members. Debate - (on motion by Mr MENZIES) adjourned. . WIDOWS' PENSIONS BILL 1946. . in Motion (by Mr HOLLOW AT) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a bill for an act to amend the Widows' Pensions Act 1942-1945. Bill presented, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",27
57,Mr HOLLOWAY,CONTRIBUTION ASSESSMENT,"Melbourne P o r t Minister for Labour and National Service) [12.12] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The chief features of the bill are similar to those contained in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill, namely, an increase from 12s. 6d. to £1 in the weekly amount of income which a widow pensioner' may have without her pension being affected, the raising of the property pro- bar in the case of a widow over 50 years of age, without dependent children, from £400 to £650, and the elimination of certain items of property from consideration in the assessment of a pension. The Widows' Pensions Act provides for the payment of a maximum pension of £1 17s. 6d. a week to a widow of any age who is maintaining one or more children under the age of sixteen years, known as a class "" A "" widow, and for the payment of a' maximum pension of £1 7s. a week to a widow, over 50 years of age, without dependent children, known as a class "" B "" widow. It also provides for the payment of an allowance of old- £1 12s. 6d. a week, for a period not exceeding six months after the husband's death, in the case of a widow under 50 about years of age who has no dependent child. The last-mentioned class of widow, known as class "" O "", if in necessitous circumstances, is not subject to any specificincome arid property limitations. The present permissible income for both class "" A "" and class "" B "" widows is 12s. 6d. a week.' The effect of the increase provided for in""the bill.will be that, in future, any income received by a class "" A "" or class "" B "" widow in excess of £1 a week, instead of 12s. 6d., will be deducted from the pension. The amount of income which will preclude payment of any pension will become £2 17s. 6d. a week in the case of a class "" A "" widow, instead of the present amount of £2 10s., and £2 7s. a week the case of a class "" B "" widow, instead of the present amount of £1 19s. 6d. The bill removes an anomaly in the case of a class "" A "" widow. At present there is includedas income in the assessment of her pension 5 per cent, of the net value of her assets, apart from a home, or the actual income, whichever iss - the greater. Thus, even in respect of money in the bank on which only 2 per cent, interest is received, 5 per cent, is included in the computation of income. In future, only the actual net income received by the widow from her money or property will he taken into account. Under the present law the l i m it of property for a class "" A "" widow is £1,000, apart from her home, and there adjourned. is no scale of progressive deductions from pension, on account of property."" The present limit of property for class "" B "" widows is the same as for invalid and old age pensioners, £400 apart from a home, and the scale of progressive deductions from pension is also the same, £1 per annum for every complete £10 of property above £50. The bill provides for the present l i m it of £400 to £650, as proposed for invalid and old-age pensioners. The present scale of deductions will remain the same for property up to £400, but the deductions for property between £401 and £650 will be £ l for every complete £7, thus eliminating the pension of £70 4s. per annum, £1 7s. a week, at £650. As honourable members are aware, under £201. the present law the value of the widow's home, furniture and personal effects is does disregarded in the assessment of pension. The bill provides for additional classes of property to be disregarded. These are the same as provided for in the Invalid taxable.02 and Old-age Pensions Bill , namely,.the surrender value of life assurance policies, up to a limi t of £200, the capital value of any life interest or annuity, the value of any' contingent interest and the present for value, up .to £500, of any reversionary interest. Legacies or shares in the estates of deceased persons will also be disregarded until they are actually received by the widow. - It is estimated that the concessions provided for in the bill will enable in creased pensions to be paid to some 8,000 widow pensioners who are now receiving reduced pensions. The Departevery ment of Social Services will make the £3,000 necessary re-assessments promptly withfor out application by the pensioners conformly cerned, and the increased rates w i l operate from the first pension pay-day after the date on which the bill becomes rate law The concessions will also bring approximately 7,000 additional widows income into the pension field. The total additional cost is estimated at £250,000 per annum, raising the annual cost from £3,500,000 to £3,750,000. Debate (on motion by Mr MENZIES) INCOMETAXBILL 1946.

That, until the commencement of the Act for the levying and payment of income tax for the financial year beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and forty-seven, the foregoing provisions of this Resolution also apply for all financial veins subsequent to that which commenced on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and forty-six. 5. That provisional tax be imposed, anil be payable in accordance with' the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-194(1, in respect of the income of the year of income ending on the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and forty-seven-. It is again my pleasing duty to introduce an income tax resolution which proposes a reduction in the rates of income tax for individuals. As I have already indicated to honourable members in the Financial Statement which I have just read, the Government proposes that the rates of income tax and social services contribution for the present financial year 1946-47 be reduced so as to grant relief to the amount of approximately £17,500,000. The revenue involved' in the proposed income tax reduction, apart from the reduction in social services contribution, is estimated at £14.000.000 per annum. Compared with existing rates, ihe combined new rates of income tax and social services contribution will represent reductions rang1 ing from 39 per cent, on the lowest incomes to 7 per cent, on an income of t'5,000. or an overall reduction of approximately VI per cent. The proposed reductions are additional 10 rhe I24r per . cent, reduction made by the Government last year at a cost to revenue of approximately £20,000.000 per annum. The new combined rates of income tax and social services contribution will represent an overall reduction of about 22 per cent, when compared with wartime rates of income tax. That will represent more than 47 per cent, on the lowest, incomes, tapering off to something under 20 per cent, on incomes of £1,500 and over. The ininiTiiuin taxable income for income tax purposes will remain ,at £201, lint taxpayers in all grades of income will - benefit from the proposed reduction. Under the new scale of rates, the average rate of tax payable on a taxable income of £201 is a fraction of a penny. The rate increases progressively until a maximum of 10s. 3.32d. is reached at £5,000. Where the taxable income exceeds £5,000, the rate will be 10s. 3.32d. in the £1 on the first £5,000 and 14s. 6d. on every £1 in excess of £5,000. The maximum rate of 14s. 6d. will be additional to ls. 6d. in the £1 social services i-cmtribution for which income taxpayer? will also be liable. Property rates are slightly in excess of personal exertion rates in the lower' brackets of income, and the excess gradually increases until on a property income of £1,000, the combined rates of income tax and social services contribution exceed the combined rates on personal exertion income by approximately 25 per cent. However, the difference in the rates then gradually diminishes until the rate on that part of the taxable income in excess of £5,000 is the same for both personal exertion and property income. Tables showing the amounts of income tax and social services contributionthat will be payable by various classes of taxpayers in different income groups, and tables comparing these amounts with amounts payable under the existing scale and under the war-time scale, are being circulated to honourable members. I would draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that the new rates will have the effect of raising the limits of income which may be derived by persons with dependants before in curring any liability for income tax. These persons, however, will be liable for social services contribution. Compared with existing limits, the amounts which will be free of income tax under the new scale will be as follows:Person with dr> pendent wife Person with dependent wife and 1 child Person with dependent wife and 2 children.. Person with dependent wife and 3 children.. Person with dependent wife and 4 children.. The other provisions of the resolution correspond to those included in the annual income tax rating.measure. The new rates will apply for the full year commencing the 1st July, 1946. However, owing to the necessity of having to print and circulate the new scales of tax deductions, it may be about the beginning of September before the necessary adjustments can be made in the amounts of tax deductions from salaries and wages.

The Contribution Eating Act, in effect, provides that where the maximum rate does not apply, the amount of contribution payable by a contributor shall equal the amount of income tax he would pay, after deducting all rebates, if income tax were imposed on his taxable income at 87£ per cent, of war-time rates. A new and simplified scale of social services contribution has now heen devised. The new scale is incorporated in paragraph 1 of the resolution. This scale will enable the rate of contribution to be - ascertained without making alternative calculations under the Income Tax Assessment Act and Income Tax Rating Schedules as formerly. ""It will greatly facilitate the work of the Taxation Department in the assessment of the amount of contribution payable by contributors. At the same time, it will reduce the amount of contribution payable by contributors in the lowest ranges of income without greatly, affecting the total revenue to be derived from the social services contribution. The reduction in some individual eases will amount to 39 per cent. The new. schedule of rates will prescribe a separate graduated basic rate commencing at 3d. in the £1 and increasing by one-eighth of a penny for every £3 of income in excess of £100. The basic rate will apply in respect of a person who has no dependants and who would not be entitled .to any income tax concessions for life - assurance, medical expenses, etc. The present maximum rate of ls. 6d. in the £1 will be retained. In the case of a person not.entitled to concessions for dependants, etc., the maximum basic rate will be reached at an income - of £220 instead of at an income of £170 as at present. The basic rate, however, will be varied in order to preserve the concessions at present allowed to contributors for dependants, life assurance, superannuation, medical expenses, etc. The rate as varied is called the concessional, rate. In no rase shall the concessional rate exceed Is. 6d. in the £1. Provision is also made to preserve the principle of averaging in the case . of primary producers coming within the averaging provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. It is proposed that the new scale of rates shall operate as from the 1st January, 1946, i.e., the date from which the uncial services contribution was first imposed. The estimated annual reduction of. revenue which will result from the introduction of the new rates of social services contribution will amount to £2,400,000 Mr Ohifley. and the additional cost of applying the now formula as from 1st January, 1946, will be £1,200,000.

L'ebate resumed from the 11th July (vide page 2411), on motion by Mr. SCULLYThat the bill be now read a second time.",34
60,Mr LEMMON,WHEAT INDUSTRY,"Forrest) [2.15] As one who has been associated with wheat-growing for the past 24 years, and who for eighteen years has been entirely dependent for his livelihood upon wheat production and fat Jamb-raising, I support the bill. I congratulate the Minister (Mr Scully) upon-the introduction of the measure and also upon the high degree of unanimity that he has been able to achieve amongst wheat-growers organizations throughout the Commonwealth in regard to this proposal. I am pleased to support the bill also because it contains basic principles that I advocated as far back as 1932, in a small wheat-growing centre in Western Australia named Nyabing. I , and other wheat-growers, realized then that if the wheat industry was to he .made stable, an - Australia-wide wheat pool and"" a guaranteed minimum price for wheat were essential. These principles have long heen advocated by. wheat-grower3 throughout the Commonwealth. In fact the birth of the Country party 30 years ago resulted from the demands by wheat-growers for some form of organized marketing for the wheat industry. They were dissatisfied with the treatment that they had been receiving from the Nationalist party-no w the Liberal party-whic h then, as today, represented John Darling and Sons, Bunge (Australia) Proprietary Limited, Louis Dreyfus and Company . Limited, and others who live by speculating in wheat on world markets. The farmers elected certain representatives to the Parliament of Victoria-the State in which the first organization of wheat growers was formed-and when these men entered the Parliament they found their natural allies were, as is the case ' today, members of the Labour party. Labour members held out the hand of friendship because they too realized that the wheat merchants were of no benefit to the community, standing between the farmer and the consumer and levying - tribute out of all proportion to the services rendered to either. The result was that , the Premier of the day-a n anti-Labour Premier-sense d the danger that the projected compulsory wheat pool would become a reality, and advised the Governor to dissolve the Parliament. In an endeavour to destroy the Country party, he then went to the country and branded the representatives of the farmers as syndicalists, or something worse than socialists. However the Victorian wheat-farmers remained steadfast, and returned Country party members on the principle of a compulsory wheat pool. ""What happened? The then anti-Labour Premier extended to the Country party members an invitation like that of the spider to the Jiy- "" Come into my parlour ""- and the men who had been returned to the Parliament as farmers' representatives sold out their* principles for portfolios and participated in ' a composite ministry. This state of affairs has continued ever since. The whole history of the Country party is closely associated with the sad story of the wheat-farmer. I support this proposal because of the uncertainties that exist within the wheat industry. Wheat-growers have to contend with all kinds of natural hazards, including fire, drought, flood, hail and plant diseases; but as a practical grower I say that one can cope with most of these to some degree at least. One can insure his crop against fire and flood, and offset the devastation of drought by adopting scientific methods of crop rotation, fodder storage. and fallow. One can also deal with the problems of plant diseases; but so. far. he has been unable to cope with the violent fluctuations of prices which can be, and are, affected not only by international finance but also by the internal economy and the political actions of exporting and importing countries. That has spelt tragedy and ruin to the wheat industry. So much so, that although the industry had enjoyed reasonable prices for many years after the last war, immediately the crash came in the early 1930's £t large percentage of wheat-growers throughout the Commonwealth were thrown into a state. of financial chaos. As proof of that assertion I draw attention to the fact that on the 19th March, 1940, the then Premier of Victoria, Mr Dunstan, said that there were 2,000 abandoned and deserted wheat-farms in Victoria, and that conditions in New South Wales and South Australia were equally as bad. In 1939, Mr H . L. Simpson, president of the Country party of Victoria, stated that no less than 80 per cent, of wheat-growers in that State were bankrupt. On the 1st August, 1940, the Melbourne Herald published a report that the Farmers' Debt Adjustment Board considered that 75 per cent, of Victoria's 13,000 wheat-growers were facing a financial crisis and that only from 5 per cent, to 7 per cent, were financially sound. In 1939, the Minister for Lands in Western Australia, Mr F. M. Troy, stated that in that year alone, 710 farms had reverted to one bank, namely, the Agricultural Bank of Western Australia and that abandoned properties throughout the State totalled 2,791, the farmers concerned being ordinary bank clients, soldier settlers and group settlers. These were the conditions of uncertainty existing at that time. Forced sales had become the order of the day. Many farmers were caused to commit illegal acts such ""as selling wheat which was under lien, to endeavour to get a few pounds to carry on. I well remember that one unfortunate woman who sold about twenty hags of wheat for no other purpose than to rr.ise sufficient money to burv her husband-sh e had been told by the undertaker that she had to pay before the burial would be carried out-wa s brought before the court. Honourable members opposite express great concern for ex-servicemen, particularly in relation to land settlement schemes; but I recall that the late Frank Evans, a returned soldier of the last war and a man with a large family, was thrown into gaol because he was unable to meet his commitments. He died"" in gaol, and so that his spirit might live, the wheat-growers of Western Australia subscribed to a fund to provide a memorial to this man, who, in war, had fought for his country and who, in peace, had endeavoured to protect his family. Had this scheme been offered to the wheat-groAvers at any time during the last sixteen years, it would have been eagerly grasped as the salvation of the. industry. To-day, however, a section of the community- a very small sectionhesitate to accept it. This hesitancy is due to three reasons. The first is caused partly by the actions of the merchants who do not desire the introduction of the orderly marketing of wheat in Australia. The second is brought about partly by the temporary increase of world prices, and a certain optimism which has been created by merchants and some politicians who desire again to .put the wheat industry up for auction. As in the past, those politicians submit alternative proposals for no other purpose than to cause confusion among the wheat growers. They hope that while the farmers disagree among themselves, they will be able to save the situation for the merchants by preventing the implementation of the bill. In other words, the opponents of the scheme seek to divide the wheat-growers in order that. t!.3y may rule and exploit them. Tint desire has existed for a considerable time. In support of his contentions last night, the Leader of the Opposition saidIn those circumstances, a poll should be taken among growers before the legislation, comes into operation. That is just another ruse to' delay the introduction of this scheme. Therefore, all. wheat-growers and others who have the interests of the industry at heart must support the bill, and not be misled by. the political manoeuvres of its opponents. When honourable members oppoMr Lemmon. site were in office, they had opportunities to assist the industry but they showed no real desire to aid it.' In their endeavour to outbid the present proposals, they are making extravagant promises which, if given effect, would crash with the first decline of world prices and again throw the industry into chaos. During the 1939-40 season when wheat-growers were poverty stricken and in despair, a deputation waited - on their elected representatives in Canberra and requested an increase of 3d. a bushel. At that time, the guaranteed price was 2s. 6d. a bushel. According to a member of the deputation, the honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen), who claims to be a champion of the wheat-growers and who knew that the industry was in dire need of assistance, stated that he "" refused to embarrass the Government"" by consenting to refer the request to Cabiret. The fact that the wheat growers were embarrassed, and their families were compelled to live on an income of £1 a week left him unmoved. All that concerned the honourable member was a desire not to embarrass the Government The honourable gentleman was afraid of losing his portfolio. When a former Minister forCommerce, Mr. Archie Cameron, visited Western Australia' some years ago, he assured wheat growers that, on his return to Canberra, he would leave no stone unturned in order to guarantee the industry a price of 10s. a bag or 3s. 4d. a bushel. What happened? After the honourable gentleman returned to Canberra he ceased to be a Minister. I say in favour of the honourable member that when he makes a promise., he usually tries to honour it. If the walls of the Cabinet room could repeat the conversation that took place between the honourable member and his colleagues upon his return from Western Australia, the real traitors to the wheat industry would he revealed. Last night the Leader of the Opposition said that there was a fairly well established practice in Australia that before schemes of this kind were put into operation, the wishes of the growers should be ascertained. People who heard the right honourable gentleman's speech might be excused for believing that no consideration whatever had been given to the wheat-growers. The truth was that full consideration was given to them, and they discussed this matter in conference with the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. shall explain briefly what took place at that conference and the ultimate conclusions. ""When the conference met on the 12th December last, the Government submitted a plan the basis of which was a guaranteed floor price of 4s. 8d. a bushel f.o.b. When the export price of wheat exceeded that figure, 50 per cent, of the amount of the increase was to be paid to the grower, and the remaining 50 per cent, to the growers' fund. The home consumption price was to remain at os. 2d. a bushel f.o.b. ports. The Australian Wheat Growers Federation discussed the plan for a day, and then submitted to the Government a counter proposal, namely, a guaranteed price of 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. ports, and when the price of export wheat exceeded that figure, 50 per cent, of the increase was to be paid to the grower and 50 per cent, to the growers' fund. The Government and the wheat-growers regard the Australian Wheat Growers Federation as the recognized authority in the wheat industry. The conference adjourned, and the Minister'agreed to submit the proposals for further consideration. The difference between the Government's plan and the federation's plan represented 6^d. a bushel in the minimum guaranteed price; it was estimated that the difference between a fixed payment f.o.r ports and the same payment f.o.b. ports would be approximately f d , a bushel. After considering the proposals, the Government agreed to the federation's request provided that, when the export price exceeded 5s. 2d. a bushel, 60 per cent, of the excess would go to the fund and the remainder would go direct to the growers. This also was not acceptable .to the growers, and, after further representations had been made on their behalf, the Government agreed to a distribution of any excess on a 50-50 basis, thus acceding in full to the requests made by the. federation at its December conference at Sydney. When skating round the subject, last night, the Leader of the Opposition said that he could find no legal reason why the 1945-46 harvest should be included in the scheme. The reason is that an agreement to do so was made by the Government with the federation. To prove my statement, I I draw attention to the following extract from the minutes of the conference:Mr Nock moved, Mr Robertson seconded: "" That the 1045-4C crop be eliminated from the plan and the plan to commence from 1940-47."" After considerable debate, Mr Diver moved and Mr Maycock seconded""That the question be p it "" . That motion was defeated.",36
61,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT INDUSTRY,"No ""gag""I",39
62,Mr LEMMON,WHEAT INDUSTRY,"Strangel y enough, the motion was submitted by one of two men who supply the honourable member with, most of the information which he uses to attack the Government. ' As the honourable member remarked, the "" gag "" was not applied, showing that the subject was fully debated. The matter was then adjourned until all other questions had been considered. This indicates that it must have been fully debated. The minutes of the conference continue as follows:After reconsideration, Mr Maycock .moved, and Mr Marshman seconded"" That subject to the Government accepting (°) (as below) we raise no objection to (a) "" (quoted hereunder). (c) ""'The guaranteed floor price to be 5s. 2d. f.o.r. with participation in the additional return where the crop concerned realized more than 5s. 2d."" (o) "" The guaranteed price should apply for five years and should be reviewed within that time with the intention of giving a further guaranteed period. The idea would be t;o have always a guarantee for a reasonable time limit. To review it regularly and make adjustments for the period and the price at each review. The initia l period would cover the present crop (1945-40) and the following four crops to 1949-50."" That proves that agreement was reached between the Government and the federation. The Government agreed to the federation's requests, and the federation agreed to the inclusion of the 1945-46* crop in the scheme. We will not be misled by technical or legal arguments raised by honourable members opposite. The Leader of the Opposition would not be ."" game"" to persuade any growers to take the matter to the High Court because he knows that, if he did so, he would call down upon his head ihe wrath of a large majority of the growers. It has been said that the growers are in debt and should continue to receive the high prices that they received last season so that they will be able to discharge their debts. I say that high prices for wheat have been the main cause of growers getting into debt. Whenever the price of wheat has increased, the prices of all other commodities have increased simultaneously. However, whenever the price of wheat has fallen, there has always been a lapse of about two years before the prices of other commodities have fallen in proportion. The primary producers have always been caught in that way. Instead of postponing the scheme for another year, we should endeavour to bring it into operation now we have the - opportunity to do-so, and so build up some reserve as a protection against the time when world prices will fall. The people who are opposing the scheme refer to what happened after World War I. .and say: "" See how prices maintained stability for so many years"". absolutely misleading to compare the conditions which existed after World'War I. with present conditions. I refer to my own experience to show the fallacy of such a comparison. When I first started wheat production eighteen years agosome years after the end of World War I. - I took a long time, with a team of horses, to plant 250 acres of wheat. I had to work at top pressure if I wanted to plant an extra 40 acres. The position today is vastly different. About a month ngo I had my first holiday since I became a member of this Parliament, three years ago.. I went to my farm and, unfortunately, one of my employees became il) while I was there. I took his place, and intwelve days I planted 500 acres of wheat. That shows clearly the vast improvement, that has been effected in methods of wheat production. Another point to be considered is that the high prices prevailing throughout the world today will stimulate production in all wheat exporting countries, even in unproductive areas, and also in countries usually considered to be wheat importers. My views are supported hy the following statement recently made by the Canadian Minister for Agriculture, and I point out that Sfr. Lemmon.. there are no keener judges of the wheat industry than the Canadian .people:It would be contrary to the interests ui Canada and of Canada's wheat-growers to take advantage of the necessity. of former alii.?* by charging higher prices for wheat, thereby encouraging an economic expansion of wheat acreage in both' importing and exporting countries, including Canada. That, Dominion recognizes the danger of high prices. The Leader of the Opposition said that he would be a pessimist who' considered that, the price of wheal would drop within the next five years. That is contrary to my experience, am! that of many world experts, in 1937. One expert, representingBroomhall and Company, saidThe wheat export carry-over has nowdropped below a certain figure. We must enjoy stability of price for two or three years, and then we may look for a gradual decline of the world's market values. That was the view of a recognized leading wheat authority in the world, not of the Leader of the Opposition. What happened? Within six months, not four or five years, the price had again crashed. It is As a wheat-grower, I want the industry to he protected against a recurrence of such an experience. How can we know what is to be the policy of importing countries? It will be remembered that before the last war it was said that Italy was paying 12s. a bushel, Germany 10s. a bushel, France. 15s. a bushel and Britain l is . a bushel for wheat. The Australian wheat-growers were receiving approximately -3s. a bushel. Why? Because those countries were endeavouring to become economically self-sufficient in respect of wheat, and were financing their wheat operations out of their internal currency, whereas Australia had to compete on whatever market was open to it. All of these problems have to be faced. As one who has experienced the poverty of the wheat industry and has been dependent on it, for his living for eighteen years, I shall not be misled by the promises of those who will again endeavour to auction the industry with a view to obtaining political support from it. Having listened to the Leader of the Opposition, the wheat-grower can have very little faith in any promise he may make. We have been informed, I admit by the press, that the Australian Country party and the Liberal party have arranged to have a joint, policy in relation to this matter. Yet we did not hear the slightest exposition of policy by the Leader of the Opposition. We should like to hear a joint declaration of policy, if there is one. The Leader of the Opposition said he was convinced that there must be a reasonable minimum price for a reasonable amount of wheat. I warn the grower to guard against proposals for the production of a reasonable amount of wheat. That was the basis of the ..\tenzies-Page scheme, first propoundeda marketable crop of 140,000,000 bushels. Tn the first year, the deliveries exceeded hy 14,000,000 bushels the amount guaranteed; consequently, in effect, the guaranonly tee was worth practically nothing. The honourable member for Indi advocated his policy at a recent conference. I describe it as his policy, because 1 do not know whether the party to which he belongs yet has a definite policy in relation to wheat. His leader' (Mr. Fadden) has stated that the price of wheat should be 5s. 9d. a bushel, whereas he has said that it should be 5s. 2d. a bushel. I say in fairness to him that he advocated the payment of 5s. 2d. a bushel at railway sidings. When a member of the conference asked him whether that was for an unlimited quantity of wheat which could be grown, he realized his responsibility and said, "" No treasury will give you an open cheque"". The Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Australian Country party, and the honourable member for Indi have publically advocated three different policies. Should there ever be a joint declaration, I advise my fellow wheat-growers to discount by one-half any promise that may be made. I well remember the large sign-boards in every wheat district throughout Australia, depicting a cheque drawn on the Commonwealth .Bank of Australia, made payable to "" Mr Wheatgrower"" for an amount of £20,000,000, and signed "" Lyons and Page "". When' the parties led by those two gentlemen were returned to office, the £20,000,000 was reduced, first to £12,000,000 and then to £10,000.000. I was pleased to hear the Leader of the Opposition suggest the appointment of a b.oard to endeavour to ascertain the cost of production; but T was more pleased by the statement of' the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, that he intended to submit to the Government the proposal that a board should be appointed to ascertain the cost of production. I hope that the recommendations of this body will receive treatment different from that accorded to the report of the Royal Commission on the Bread, Flour and Wheat Industries. As a "" fob-off"" before an election, the then Government said, "" We will appoint a royal commission"".. An expenditure of £50,000 was incurred with a view to 7 determining the cost of producing wheat. That object having been achieved, the subsequent action was the publication of a number of books on the subject. The report of the royal commission stated that it had made only what it regarded as "" a rough estimate"" of the cost of production. That was the only result achieved by an expenditure of £50,000. There is too much humbug talked about the cost of production. The fact is that costs vary from day to day, from farm to farm, and from year to year. Mr Mo.Ew.Ejsr - Does the honourable member believe that it is impossible to determine the cost of production?",39
63,Mr LEMMON,WHEAT INDUSTRY,I believe that it is not possible to arrive at a proper cost of production basis.,41
64,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT INDUSTRY,Then on what basis should a guaranteed price be fixed?,41
65,Mr LEMMON,WHEAT INDUSTRY,"-If the honourable member will wait I shall tell him. I suggest to the Minister that he should ask the proposed board to find a formula similar to that by which the basic wage is fixed from time to time. It should take into consideration the five main factors in the cost* of production-wages , interest, machinery, superphosphate and fuelincluding petrol, oil, grease, &c, and according to the price index of. those items so the basic price of wheat should be determined. I have been fighting for the stabilization of the wheat industry since 1932. At that time, prices were"" at their lowest ebb, and poverty stalked the wheat lands. Now, in 1946, we happen to be on the crest of the wave of high prices. Conditions in 3932 were dangerous because they involved poverty for the wheat growers; conditions now are equally dangerous because, if we are not careful, they, will result in inflated values for wheat lands and stimulate production in importing countries. I am particularly pleased that the bill provides for the continuation of the compulsory pooling system for the marketing of-wheat."" This is the system which had to be introduced to help Australia through World War I . and World War II . On both those occasions the speculators and wheat merchants failed the growers and the country, and the pooling system had to be introduced. If that system was good enough to see the industry and the. nation through two wars it is good enough to keep in time of peace.",41
66,Mr SMITH,WHEAT INDUSTRY,"Wakefield) [3.0] - I support the bill, and I ajgree with the Minister (Mr Scully) that the wheat industry, over the'years, has been a troubled one. I also agree that, a few years ago, prices for wheat were so low that growers could not obtain a reasonable return for their labour. I am pleased that it was not necessary for the growers to bring pressure upon the Government to introduce this stabilization measure. It was introduced willingly and expeditiously by the Government, whose attitude in this respectwas in marked contrast with that of previous governments. The representatives of the wheat-growers have practically beaten a track to Parliament in the course of their unsuccessful attempts to induce previous governments to sponsor legislation which would ensure them justice. In fact, the growers had practically to threaten to use artillery in order to get even the smallest consideration from anti-Labour governments. I am pleased that the stabilization plan is to remain in force for five years, and that provision is to be made to extend it for^ a further period if desired. The bill was introduced by the Government at the request of the wheat-growers, expressed through the Australian Wheat Growers Federation. Similar requests have been made repeatedly in the past, and there can be no doubt that the growers wish their industry, to be released from the clutches of - the wheat merchants and speculators who have always controlled it, except for brief periods during the two wars. The growers have a deep-seated fear of returning to the haphazard methods Ift^ich obtained under the open-market system. The wheat speculators bought when prices were low, as they usually are at the beginning of the harvest, and sold later in the year when prices rose temporarily. The speculators were known as. men who farmed the farmers. For years their political tactics were to divide the farmers by suggesting to them that under organized marketing they would lose their freedom. It is only necessary to compare the fine homes' and luxurious business premises of the wheat merchants in the capital cities with the living conditions of the farmers in order to see who has bad the better of the deal under the system of open marketing. Through their organizations, the farmers learned that the freedom with which the merchants were concerned was not the freedom of the farmers, but freedom for themselves to gamble in the people's food. The farmers are now organized, and have for some years been anxious for the institution of a system of orderly marketing on a Commonwealth-wide basis. This bill gives effect to their wishes, and the industry is to be stabilized for a period of five years. In this way the Government is giving to the growers that to which they are justly entitled. The Government, by this arrangement, is seeking to put a floor into the wheat market. Ministers know that it is easier to arrest the fall of wheat - prices than to wait until they have fallen, and then try to raise them again. The plan, as I have said, operates for five years, and not for one year. The minimum guarantee is 5s. 2d. a bushel, f.o.r. ports, for every bushel of wheat which the grower markets. In this respect there is a marked contrast between - what the present 'Government has done and what has been done by previous ministries. It will be remembered that, in the war-time plan introduced by the last Government, provision was made for its guaranteed minimum price to apply only to 140,000,000 bushels of marketable wheat. Of the 1941-42 crop, the wheat marketed exceeded that figure by 13,000,000 bushels, and growers, on delivery of their wheat, did not receive one penny in the form of an advance. This happening, I understand, gave rise to the idea that the party led by the - Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) should call itself a ""Liberal party"". It is a striking commentary on the hypocrisy of those who sponsored and supported that action that they are now critical of what, by comparison, might be called the liberal provisions of this measure. It ' is also striking that members of the Opposition, who were responsible for confining the representation of wheat-growers on the first Australian Wheat Board to two members, should now question the undoubted goodwill which the present Government has shown to the wheat industry. Its goodwill is proved by the fact that seven out of nine of the members of the Australian Wheat Board are the elected representatives of growers, and that the chairman, in addition, is a wheat-grower, one of the foundation members of the wheat-growers' organization, and the first president of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation. The present Government was responsible, shortly after it came to office, for suspending from operation those clauses of the war-time wheat stabilization scheme which provided_ that growers should contribute to an equalization fund 50 per cent, of the price by which export returns exceeded 3s. lOd. a bushel f.o.b. In that action the Government made it possible for wheat-growers to obtain added returns from the Nos. 6, 7 and 8 wheat pools, from which the returns to growers exceeded 3s. lOd. a bushel f.o.b. These are not the things, of course, which we expect to learn from honourable members on the Opposition benches. They are the things which indicate where the real friends of the wheat-grower in this House are located. The real test. of sincerity, so far as the attitude of the Opposition on this measure is concerned, lies in what it did when it had power in this Parliament, and not in what it proposes should be done now that it has been relegated to the cold shades of Opposition. In the Australian Country party corner, we. have a body of men who are now considerably fewer in numbers, it true, than they were in the last and preapparently vious parliaments. These men were elected to Parliament because they attacked the members of the renamed United Australia party whom they charged with having neglected the best interests of the wheat-growers and other sections of primary producers. Their parliamentary mission, they claimed, was to assure the emancipation of wheat growers and others who were being crushed by food speculators represented by the predecessors of the present Liberal party. In the twenty years in which the Australian Country party has had representation in this Parliament, it has been associated with composite ministries most of the time. After twenty years, it would be compelled, by the known facts, to admit that wheat growers and others were in a worse position financially .than they were when Australian Country party members first darkened the doors of the Commonwealth and State parliaments. Wheat-growers in particular know that only too well, and they are not being misled by the fictitious promises and election concoctions of Australian Country party representatives in this House. When the Government first sponsored this plan, at the request of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, it named the price of 4s. 8d. a bushel f.o.b. The Wheat Growers Federation met in December last, and asked for 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. ports, equal to 5s. 2^d. a bushel f.o.b., or 6^d. a bushel more than the price the Government had named. The Government immediately agreed to this, but suggested that the contribution to the stabilization fund should be 60 per cent, of the excess price over 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. ports for export wheat. The federation did not agree to the 60 per cent, proposal, and asked the Government to provide for the payment of 50 per cent, to growers and 50 per cent, to the stabilization fund. The Government, after consideration, agreed to this proposal. The federation has asked for an increase of the price of wheat for local consumption fixed in 1938 by joint action of the States and the Commonwealth. Action to alter that agreement, of course, can be taken only by amending is existing legislation. The federation considers that 5s. 2d. a bushel for wheat consumed locally is below production costs. It apparently recognized, however, that production costs have yet"" to be determined, and that there are no tabulated data or price index to support the claim.",42
67,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT INDUSTRY,The honourable member for .Forrest said that they could not be obtained.,44
68,Mr SMITH,WHEAT INDUSTRY,"He made a good speech in support of the primary producers, and I am afraid that the Opposition will not be able to present so good a case. His statements were irrefutable, and the farmers will not be misled by any sweet nothings which the Opposition may promise. At a recent conference, the federation asked the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture that a commission of inquiry to investigate costs should be . appointed by the Government. The Minister promised that the request would be the subject of a recommendation that he would make to the Government. In the House this week, he also promised, in reply to a question, that he would recommend that the .Australian Wheat Growers Federation should have direct representation on such a. cornmission, if one were appointed. It is obvious from the facts which I have mentioned that the Government has met over 90 per cent, of the requests which growers' representatives have made. The provision of a atabilization plan for. the wheat industry is not a matter which should interest wheat-growers alone. It is indeed a matter of great national importance, in that primary industries are Australia's key industries, and'that a rise or fall of the price of primary products has a definite affect upon our economic structure. There is, undoubtedly, a close relationship between price levels for-primary products and the volume of employment or unemployment which exists throughout the community: When prices for primary products fall, the effects arefirst felt by the. farmer, and after him by country business people and country workers. The effects are next felt in our secondary industries. The loss of the farmers' purchasing power results in lessening his demands for secondary goods, and so unemployment follows in considerable volume in capital cities. It is, therefore, as I have stated,, a matter of national urgency that we should prevent, a return to unpayable pre-war prices 'ior wheat and other primary products. This measure aims to stabilize the wheat industry and the principles embodied in it are of vital concern to every section of the community. In the past, prices for farm products, including wheat, have been so low that farmers have been compelled to rely on unpaid family labour or causalitinerant labour, for which they were compelled to pay lower wages than they wished. I remember quite well the old bygone days when we frequently met on the road the old - sundowner, renowned in song and story, who carried his swag from one town to another between harvests. We must never witness that spectacle again. The wheat-farmer must be placed on a basis which will enable him to pay reasonable wages to his employees. Since the price of wheat has been stabilized it has been possible to apply an award fixing the wages and conditions of harvest workers, and from my own knowledge, wheat-growers invariably paid award rates with pleasure. Their claim on the community generally and on this Parliament is that they should he assured a minimum reward commensurate with their services to the community. They have to take their chance with the elements over which they have no control. That, surely, is a sufficient hazard. They are entitled to' a return which will enable them to meet their liabilities and at the same time enjoy a reasonable standard of comfort. These statements may not be regarded as original. It is true that they have been uttered previously; and it is also true that they have been uttered by members of the Australian Country party, and at times, by members of the Liberal party; but there is some virtue, however, in their utterance from this side of the House in that immediately this Government assumed office it commenced a programme for the rehabilitation of the wheat industry in the form of increased minimum guarantees. There is no doubt that the days in which a Commonwealth government could offer insult to the wheat-growers of Australia by giving tbem a first advance of 2s. 6d. a bushel at sidings have ended. It is clear that if the votes of wheat-growers count for anything, future governments which attempt to reduce the price of wheat below 4s. a bushel at country sidings will not remain long in office. It is-also clear, that in the measure now before us the Government is wisely laying down a structure for peace-time marketing of Australia's wheat. Apart from spasmodic action during the two world wars, when wheat merchants were unable to finance the industry, and government assistance had to be provided, wheat growers in - the past have been totally unable to make any advance towards obtaining an organized marketing scheme for their product. Now, for the first time in history, apart from those emergency war periods, wheat-growers may hope for organized marketing which will ensure their future prosperity. The Government has not only sponsored the plan; it.has also done everything possible to secure the willing and wholehearted cooperation of the States in its implementation. A great deal of preliminary work has been necessary in order to carry the plan to its present stage, and if the measure is wrecked, as some members opposite appear to hope, all that preliminary work will be lost and will have to be recommenced later. Those who attack the measure therefore place themselves in the position of gambling with the future of a great industry and with the financial stability of every individual engaged in it. I trust that their efforts will not be successful. If this plan to Stabilize the wheat industry is not placed upon the statute-book it will at least not be because of lack of support on the part of members of the Australian Labour party. Not only do honourable members on this side of the.House fully support the bill, but they are also assured of the support of the representatives of Labour in the State parliaments. Mr. C. T. Chapman, president of the South Australian Wheat Growers Association, a practical farmer and a firm supporter of the Government's stabilization scheme, in.an article in the South Australian Whealgrower of the 22nd June gave cogent facts and figures to justify his support of the Government's proposal. I shall not quote the whole of his. statement but I draw the attention of honourable members particularly to this passageI say . deliberately as .a genuine wheat grower who has kept proper books over the last 24 years, and costed for a number of those years, that this plan,- even as proposed, is a much better proposition than those of the past years and it definitely gives some measure of security to the industry. Mr Chapman continuedGet yo'ur legislation enacted while the oppor- . tunity exists. History proves that once measures like this are rejected it is many years before ever the opportunity present? itself again -"" The wheat-growers of Australia can and will build real security as the result of this stabilization plan which, according to Mr Chapman's calculations, would have saved his firm more than £14,000 had it been in operation during the period 1922-23 to 1942-43. Knowing the conditions under which so many wheat-growers lost their farms I advise them not to be misled by the carping criticism of those who are not so much opposed to the bill as they are anxious to get Labour out of office at all .costs. I listened with a great deal of interest' to the speech on this subject delivered by the Leader of the Opposition last night. The right honourable gentleman freely interlarded his remarks with the usual platitudes, but offered not one constructive suggestion whereby the lot of the wheat-growers could be improved. As usual, he merely played with words. It was obvious that he was anxious that this plan should be postponed. The theme of his speech from beginning to end was procrastination. I learned in my youth that procrastination is the thief of time. If the wheat-growers and primary producers do not take time by the' forelock and support the Government's scheme embodied in this measure they will seriously retard the industry.' I support the measure. Debate (on motion by Mr MCEwBtr) adjourned. ATOMIC ENERGY ('CONTROL OE MATERIALS) BILL 1946. Bill presented by Mr Dedman, and read a first time. SECOND READING :",44
69,Mr DEDMAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY,"Corio-Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [3.26] - by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. Whether we in this House like it or. not we have been thrust into the atomic age. Our first experience of applied atomic science does not suggest that it will neceshas sarily be a comfortable age, though the scientists assure us that their discoveries and achievements will serve constructive as well as destructive ends. We approached the atomic age by way of a great deal of unspectacular experiment and thought, in the field of pure science. Practically the only hints which honourable members had prior to 1945 came in the fictional prophecies of H . G. Wells and an occasional popular science article in the press. For, as the tempo of atomic experiments and of international unrest advanced step for step during the 1930's an intense secrecy began to envelop the practical results which scientists were deriving from their labours. With the outbreak of war this condition of secrecy became much more complete as between the belligerent groups, but the final allied achievement of the atomic bomb was directly attributable to a magnificent instance of scientific cooperation between Britain, Canada and America more immediately, though Australian scientists had a hand in the work and - Australian raw materials were amongst those upon which experimental work was performed. With the bursting of atomic bombs on Japan a stage of wild popular speculation, recently stimulated by the much publicized Bikini tests, has followed, though for the time being secrecy continues to be the rule regarding the processes of harnessing the new power. At the same time, however-and this is the central point before the House today - ther e is a general realization that the problem of control of atomic developments and raw materials is one of immediate and inescapable urgency. It is indicative of the gravity of the problem, and of its world-wide character, that the attempt at control has occurred simultaneously at the national and international levels. Usually, in the past, men have sought first the local and national solutions to their problems, while neglecting their impact on international affairs. For that reason the establishment of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission simultaneously with the presentation of atomic energy control legislation to the Parliaments of Britain, America, Australia and other countries emphasizes the vital urgency and importance the issue assumed in all minds. . It is, I think, a matter for justifiable pride on the part of this Parliament that Australia has one of the places on the Atomic Energy Commission and that it should have fallen to an honourable member of this House, the Minister for External Affairs. (Dr Evatt), to lead the commission at the very outset of its work. His is .the task of guiding the commission and its committees in their first steps in attempting to evolve the practical scheme of international control which the Commonwealth Government favours and for which the peoples of the world devoutly hope. It is, at the same time, a matter for most favourable notice that the expert consultants of the American Secretary of State, under the leadership of David Lilienthal, of the Tennessee Valley Authority, have produced an enlightened and far-sighted report on the relation between national and international controls in this field. I commend the Lilienthal report to honourable members. I have stressed that there is general realization that the problem of control must be tackled immediately and internationally. It appears to be equally agreed in all responsible quarters that, within each country, there should be public control of the basic raw materials and their treatment. That is, there must be governmental control of the holdings, development, manufacture, export or import of these substances. For any system of control of atomic energy must be based on knowledge of where these metals are, what is being done with them, and upon the certainty that their use is in public hands responsive to public direction-and policy. It may be that, in time, there will be more or less full international control in this*field, hut in meantime considerations of defence at least dictate active governmental control. The South Australian Government Parliament, appreciating that the printhe cipal known Australian sources of radioAustralian active substances are within that State, have already taken legislative steps to ensure their control by the .State. For that prompt action they are to be comadvisers. mended. This Parliament has, however, responsibility to the 'whole Australian people for its defence and security.. That the national development of atomic energy is inextricably bound up with defence no longer requires to be labosSome iously demonstrated to anyone. The Commonwealth is also charged with the conduct of Australia's external relations and control of atomic energy has now become the very stuff of international relations generally. The Commonwealth Parliament would, therefore, be recreant to its trust if it did not assume a genera] control or supervision over all Australian sources and development of this new power. How complete that supervision or control will require to he must be energy. determined from time to time and according to circumstances. The present hill is an enabling measure which sets up the framework of control. The provisions of this bill are simple Bill. and general. Uranium and other similar substances throughout the Commonof wealth Territories, known or subsequently discovered, become the property of Commonwealth. The Minister is emAustralia powered to prohibit holding or dealing in these substances anywhere in the monwealth except by licence; all holdings must be turned over upon demand in return for agreed or determined compenhope sation.' All past and future discoveries of these substances anywhere in the monwealth must be notified within one month. Persons may be interrogated on the subject and Commonwealth officials may enter on land or property to search or test. The Minister may have an ada visory committee of ""five to assist him administering the act. A regulationatomic making power under the act and"" penalties for breaches of the terms of the act are provided. The bill has heen drawn with due the regard to the relevant clauses of the parallel British measure. In all matters related to atomic energy we are maintaining the closest contact with the British and Government and their experts. During war Professor Oliphant, the brilliant leaderin this field in Great Britain, visited Australia and discussed certain aspects of atomic energy development with the Commonwealth's scientific In London recently, the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) discussed the subject with British Ministers, with Professor 'Oliphant' and others. Professor Oliphant consented to - witness the Bikini tests as an official Australian observer. honourable members, comparing this measure with British and American legislation, may feel that this bill is less far-reaching. That is, in some respects, true. It is due primarily to the relative backwardness of Australian work in this field to date-w e have had other preoccupations in the war years at least. The bill is draw, however, in fairly general terms and it is the Government's belief that it affords the necessary broad basis for rapid expansion of our work on atomic It has been my responsibility in this short sessional period to introduce two bills-the measure now before the House and the Australian National University There is something strangely significant) in their coincidence in point time. This billj on the one hand, represents a broad attempt to ensure the public control and development in of potent forces which overshadow our whole future for good or ill . ComThe Australian National University, on the other hand, is to include a physical sciences research school which we to see turning developments in the use of atomic energy to men's service Comrather than their annihilation. It is to have a medical research school where further knowledge of radio-active substances may help ourscientists to make new medical advances. There is to be social sciences research school fitted, we in hope, to meet the human challenge which energy presents. Finally, the Australian National University is to have a research school of Pacific studies which will, we hope, point the way to improved international relations in this part of the world where today the atomic bomb is tested in peace but where we hope it will never again be used in war. In commending the bill House. I express the hope that we and the world-may use wisely, humanely and constructively the new power for whoso local control we are providing.

70,Mr FADDEN,WHEAT INDUSTRY,"Darling Downs.Leader of the Australian Country party) [3.38] - The senseless restrictions and prohibitions imposed, by the Division of Import Procurement with regard to import . licences is seriously jeopardizing primary production. Numbers of complaints have reached me regarding the overhearing and unpractical interference of this division with essential imports ranging from hand separators to ballbearings. For instance, a large number of ball-bearings is used in the manufacture of harvesting machines. There has heen an acute shortage of these bearings during the war. Last season production of agricultural machinery was maintained only by procuring quantities of these bearings by air from Britain, although the freight for this means of transport was extremely high. In an effort to avoid similar troubles this year, Australian manufacturers British suppliers to make early shipments against old standing orders for the bearings which are required for this season's programme. However, British manufacturers were overloaded with work and indicated that there w as one .type of bearing which they could not provide. Adequate quantities of this particular type were available from the Swedish S.K.F. company from stock, and accordingly it was approached and it agreed to supply the bearings. Applito the cation was made in Decemberlast to the Division of Impor t Procurement for an import licence in respect of these bearings. Throe months later, on . the 26th March this year, the licence was refused on the ground that these .bearings could be manufactured in Great Britain. At that very' time, bearing manufacturers in B r it a in were trying to obtain quantities of the same kind of bearings from Swedish sources, because of the acute shortage in Great Britain. Latest advices are that British manufacturers cannot commence shipment for at NA least another fourteen weeks'-whic h POSITIONI N QUEENS- means that delivery cannot be given here until towards the end of the year. The result of this nine months' delay .has been the tying up of agricultural machinery for lack of one essential bearing, procurable in ' Sweden, and unavailable in Britain, for which the Division of Import Procurement continues to refuse an import licence. It may be argued that the policy is one of solicitude for British manufacturers. But here is another case which shows the incorrectness of such an assumption. Certain agricultural implements supplied to farmers by Australian manufacturers contain .a box of tools, among which is a 1-lb. hammer. These hammers had been imported from B r it a in for many years. Further supplies were ordered early in 1945, but the application for a licence was refused by the Division of Impor t Procurements. Meanwhile the hammers were sent from Britain, and arrived here six months after the end of the war. Thereupon they were confiscated as prohibited imports, and the farmers had to go without them. Roller chain is another essential item needed for the manufacture of agricultural implements. Australian firms were approached informed early in January this year that British manufacturers would be entirely unable to fulfil Australian requirements for this season, and consequently urgent inquiries were made throughout the United States of America. The result : was that deliveries of portion of the Australian requirements were promised for delivery by June. Application for an import licence was made early in May. It was not until seven weeks afterwards that rhe Australian applicants were informed by the Division of Import Procurement rhat chain for "" new manufacture"" and chain for "" replacement parts"" had to lie segregated. The'licence for new manufacture had to be applied for in Melbourne, but that for replacements would he dealt with by the Sydney office of the division. The licences were issued on rhe 25th June-nearl y two months after rhe date of the application. Meanwhile the need was so urgent that the chain was loaded on shipboard and the manufacturers undertook the risk and possible financial loss of having the chain confiscated here if the'licence happened to !><-> refused', as in the case of the hammers mentioned previously. There was extreme urgency in this case, every day was vital if machines were to be ready for the harvesting season. My main interest in bringing this matter forward is on behalf of the primary producers of this country. Every effort should, be made to keep them supplied with the necessary machines and implements for the maintenance of production. The Government's policy is - imposing great difficulty on the manufacturers of these implements. In fact, it seems-that the ordinary import policy of this country has been superseded by the haphazard, dilatory and often illogical action of the Division of Import Procurement. It is useless for the Government to give lip-service to the farmers about its desire to increase production, and to send tractor-investigating missions overseas, headed by the Director1944-45 General of Agriculture, while at the same rime the bottlenecks in the Division of Import Procurement exercise an everdistricts increasing internal stranglehold on AusStates tralian nroduction.",48
71,Mr TURNBULL,PRICE OF,"Wimmera) [3.45] 1 bring to the notice of honourable members an anomaly in the distribution of drought relief to cereal growers. I have made representations in regard to this matter on previous occasions, but I do not seem to be able to get very far with it . I shall trace briefly what ba3 [89] happened up to date. The first information that came to me was that wheat growers who had not sown wheat in 1944 were not eligible for drought relief following the failure of their 1945-46 crops. That ruling deprives many hundreds of wheat-farmers who are justly entitled to relief of the right to receive any relief payment. Just because a farmer did not sow wheat in 1944 it does not mean that he is not a genuine wheat-grower. Amongstthe growers who have been rendered ineligible for drought relief by this restriction are farmers of 20 or 30 years' standing, who, in 1944, because of the drought and t i e poor condition of their horses, did not plant wheat, but took their stock south in an effort to save them. Unfortunately, despite this action, most of the stock died; and now,' because they did, not sow wheat in 1944, and although they have suffered further loss due to drought in 1945, these men' cannot obtain relief. In an endeavour to rectify this anomaly I communicated with the Premier of Victoria, the Honourable John Cain. In reply, that gentleman stated that the Commonwealth had insisted that it would provide 50 per cent, of the money for the drought relief scheme only if payments were restricted to growers who had suffered a loss in ' the 1944-45 season as well as in the following year. It appeared then that the Commonwealth was to blame for the restriction, and so I asked the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr . Scully) what was the attitude of the Commonwealth Government to this matter. The Minister repliedDrought relief this season is provided for cerealgrowers who were affected by the drought and who had another crop failure affecting the present 1945-40 crop, because the drought did not break in their in time to sow the 1945-46 crop. This was the basis of the case put up by the for assistance, and it is not practicable to extend the scope of the scheme which was approved. Some one is "" passing the buck "", because in his letter to mo Mr Cain saidIt was made clear at the officers conference that if the Commonwealth Government decided to meet half the costs of the scheme it would only be on condition that the proposed relief payments would be restricted to those farmers who had suffered losses from the drought of 1!U4 ami who were again seriously affected the drought conditions prevailing in certain districts. Did the State Government or the Commonwealth Government impose this restriction? The Victorian authorities Maine the Commonwealth Government, and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has thrown the blame back on. the State. No one will accept the responsibility, and in the meantime wheat growers who have suffered serious loss are receiving no relief. Fallowing time is at hand, and, after years of drought, wheat-growers who have suffered grievous financial loss require assistance to carry on this great industry which can provide the food so urgently required throughout the world. If the Commonwealth Government expresses its willingness to extend the benefits of the scheme to the farmers I have mentioned, the onus will then be directly on the Government of Victoria. I have received many letters protesting against this anomaly. One comes from a woman whose husband has been a wheat-grower for 20 or 30 years. She herself owns a small block of land. In 1944 her husband planted wheat on his own property, and the crop was a failure. In 1945 he decided to sow some wheat on his wife's property. That crop too failed, but because wheat had not been sown on that property in 1944. the farmer is debarred from participating in drought relief. That is entirely wrong, and it is . time this Governinent stated some definite policy in regard to this matter. I am sure that an adjustment of this anomaly will be made, but I urge that speedy action be taken. Too. long have these men waited for relief. When they applied for it they found on the application form a statement that, farmers who had not sown wheat in 1944 were ineligible for relief. And here is the important point: If a farmer, planted only 30 acres of wheat in 1944. he is eligible for drought relief payments in respect of 600 acres or more for the 1945-46 crop; but, if he did not sow any wheat at all in 1944, but endeavoured to save his stock by moving them to moiv suitable area3,. losing perhaps three-quarters of them, and suffering far more loss than the farmer who planted only a paltry amount of wheat in 1944, he is Ur. Twnibull. by ineligible for relief although he had sown a large area in 1945. This is a great injustice to many hard-working wheat farmers, and as the representative in this chamber of the electorate of Wimmera in which many of these men live and work, and arc making a valuable contribution to the stable economy of this, country, I protest emphatically against the existing state of affairs and ask the Governmeni to make its policy known, at the earlic-t opportunity 1 t'Oino now to another matter that 1I have ventilated in this chamber on one or two .occasions. I refer to the payment of a subsistence allowance of 3s. a day to former prisoners of war in Japanese, hands. These men did much to prevent, the Japanese from reaching Australia - and were captured through no fault of their own. During the debate on the Overseas Telecommunications Bill earlier this week, one speaker said that had it not been for the telecommunications service provided by Amalgamated Wireles -(Australasia) Limited just prior to the Coral Sea battle, the Japanese might have succeeded in invading Australia. That, is only part of the story. Had it not been for the magnificent campaign of the 8th Division against the Japanese on the Malayan Peninsula, .all the telecommunication services in the world would not have kept the Japanese from Australian soil. So why does the Government not recognize the men who saved this country? I have already raised this matter on two occasions, and I know that my contentions have the support of many honourable members opposite. Some of them have said to me, "" We believe that those troops should be paid the sustenance allowance"", and that view is held widely throughout Australia. I speak on behalf of 12,000 or 15,000 members of the Australian Imperial Force who, as every Australian knows, suffered more severe hardships during World War II . than did any other Australians. I refer to the matter again now because I have just received a reply from the Minister for the Army (Mr Forde) to my representations on behalf of those men. The right honourable gentleman has always given most courteous replies to my questions, and I appreciate the assistance that he has rendered to me in many ways since I became a member of this Parliament. However, on this occasion, his reply not meet with my approval. I askedSeeing that officers of the Australian Force who were prisoners of war in Japanese hands have been paid their full field for the whole of the term of their imprisonofficers ment, and that, in normal circumstances, a - member of the Australian Imperial Force, when not being fed by the Army, is subsistence allowance of 3s. per day, will Minister for the Army favourably consider proposal that other ranks, who were prisoners of the Japanese, should be paid a subsistence allowance of Z*. a day for the term imprisonment, bearing in mind that the was not called upon, during that time,-to and clothe them ? The Minister for the A r m y r e p l i e d In reply tn the honourable member it is desired to state that the pay account of ber of the Australian Military Forces who held in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp credited with the pay and pay allowances per- - that taining to his rank for the period of his captivity. Officers detained as prisoners war by the Japanese did not receive day subsistence allowance but their pay accounts were credited with 3s. per day field allowance which is a normal pay allowance 'made to al! officers serving outside Australia. diet. No debits were made to the pay account such members for the period of their captivity rations or commanded to work. other than for payments made by way of allotmen, ment from such pay in accordance with the member's directions. The treatment thus accorded to prisoners of war in relation to their pay accounts was not illiberal and it is not proposed to credit the member's pay account wit h subsistence allowance as suggested by the honourable member.' I desire to analyse that reply. First, there is no doubt that the system of payment to officers of the Australian Imperial Force, who were prisoners of war, was certainly not illiberal. In fact, it was most liberal. ""What is the purpose of the officers'field,allowance ? Officers have certain social obligations that other' ranks do not have, and this allowance enables them to meet those calls. In the officers' mess, the field allowance enables them to purchase little extra luxuries to which officers perhaps are entitled. Sometimes, the whole of the field allowance is credited to the mess, and the officer does not draw it. When the field allowance is credited to the mess, the money is used to supplement the food which, under normal conditions, is supplied by the Army. When officers were - in prisoner of war camps, they did not have any social commitments, or the little extra luxuries which the field allowance is specifically does designed to cover. Therefore, why should . they he paid the field allowance when Imperial other ranks are denied subsistence allowance? Certainly, it is their normal allowallowance ance under normal conditions; but when were prisoners of war, they were not living under normal army conditions. paid aIf the Government does not propose to the honour its obligations to the other ranks a the field allowance should not be paid to officers. I always believed that the policy of their of the Labour movement in Australia Army was to fight for the ""under dog"". Tofeed day, the policy of the Government is definitely giving officers preference over the other ranks. I assure honourable members, as one who was a prisoner of war a memin the hands of the Japanese--the honorwas able member for the Northern Territory was (Mr Blain) will support this statement the' men who got the "" rawest"" of deal in the prisoner of war camps in 3s. per Malaya, Japan, Siam and Burma were those of the other ranks. They had to do all the work, and al times were on a light At. Changi Camp at least, the of officers were never placed on light diet The of the ranks had to do the work, and, therefore, they should receive some definite payment for it. [Extension of time granted]. While our troops were prisoners of war in the hands of the Japanese, they had to sell their personal belongings and, with the proceeds, buy food in order that they might live. I have already stated in this House that it is erroneous to believe that when the Australians were taken prisoner at Singapore', - the Japanese seized all their belongings. The men were allowed to keep all their belongings, such as watches and rings, which they valued. They were marched to Selerang Camp, and after they began to suffer from starvation, they were forced to sell those belongings. If they had not sold some personal belongings and boon able to buy coco-nuts and other food, a much larger percentage would have died. Some of the watches which the men sold were valued at £20. To-day, I read in a Sydney newspaper that the price of watches, which, before the war, cost £7 10s., is now £35. Some possessed watches worth £20 or £30. '- To-day, in order to replace those watches, they will he obliged to pay about five times the pre-war price; When those men joined the Australian Imperial Force, Australia urgently required their services. They undertook to obey the orders of their - commander and the Government undertook to pay - them a certain amount of money a day and to feed and clothe them. That was the true position. Through no fault of their own they became prisoners - of war. They obeyed the order to surrender. In Singapore, we received orders to ""hold fire"", and we surrendered at the order of a higher command. In that way, we became prisoners - of the - Japanese. From that time until our release, we were not fed or clothed by the Army. Therefore, I contend that the Army should now reimburse the exprisoners who had to make definite financial sacrifices in order to feed and clothe themselves. If they had been on leave in Australia where even war-time conditions were congenial, and lived forfive,or six days or longer in Sydney or Melbourne, the Army would have paid them a subsistence allowance of 3s. a day ""because while they wei-e on leave the army was not maintaining them. But because our troops were prisoners in Malaya, where' they had to sell their personal belongings in order to get a bit - of food, and, more than anything else, because the war is over and they are not wanted again the Army is disregarding rlicm altogether. Rudyard Kipling wrote of this attitude to the soldier in peace-timeIt's Tommy this an' Tommy that, an -'-Chuck him out, the brute! ' But it's ' Saviour of 'is country' when the guns begin to shoot. Now the Minister states that the treatment of prisoners of war has not been "" illiberal"". Can the right honourable gentleman tell me of anything that prisoners of war received that soldiers who served in Australia ih rough out the war have not received? Prisoners of war have received the same payment as any ordinary soldier who was stationed at Royal Park, Melbourne, for instance, for the whole period of his .service. However, the home-front soldiers received subsistence allowance at the rate of 3s. a day for periods when the Mr Turnbull. Army was not feeding them. That is something that prisoners of war did not receive. In view of the injustice that is being done to 15,000 loyal Australians, this Government must accede to my request.",49
72,Mr BLAIN,PRICE OF,"Northern Territory) [4.5] - I refer to the need for the stabilization of an industry other than the wheat industry, regarding which there was an interesting debate this afternoon. .The industry which I have in mind is located in a very remote part of the Northern Territory. It is the mica mining industry, which is carried on. east of Alice Springs. That is the only part of Australia where mica is produced. The future of the industry is very doubtful. The Australian Trade Commissioner's report on the mica industry in India shows clearly that there is considerable likelihood, of an increase of prices for mica produced in that country. This, of course, will have an effect on the cost of imported mica, in Australia. In my view, it would be a great pity if the Government allowed the Australian industry to go into the discard as the result of the cessation of the system of price control, which has been exorcised . under the National Security Regulations with beneficial results to the miners. I use the word "" beneficial"" guardedly, because miners have told me that, although the industry was stabilized during the war, they believe that traders, not producers, benefited mainly from the high prices paid for super mica- I could describe the product as "" super-super mica "", because 1 it is of very high quality. Some of the miners felt so keenly about this exploitation that for a time they hid much of their production until their high' sense of duty obliged them to deliver it. They were incensed because dealers operating on.the market were reaping the fruits of their labour in the inhospitable territory where mica is found. The Commonwealth Government has absolute constitutional power to do whatever it wishes in its own. territories. Neither the restrictions affecting price fixation nor the difficulties encountered under section 92 of the Constitution arise in respect of its power to regulate mica production in the Northern Territory. Therefore, it could exercise some form of price control and distribution of mica from Alice Springs. At present, mica is trimmed and graded in Melbourne. Strong, arguments can be advanced in favour of doing this work at Alice Springs, which is closer to the point of production. The mica-miners would then have an opportunity to supervise the handling of their product. As a result of the present lack of supervision, many of them do not entrust their winnings to the Melbourne depot for trimming and classification. They believe that people who are interested in the grading of the mica, purchase it after it has passed through the Commonwealth pool. If the work were done at Alice Springs, the miners would be able to see how their product was being classified and make sure that they received the proper price for it. I ask the Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson) to confer with the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Senator Ashley) on this subject. The handling of waste products also should be considered. If the work of trimming and classification were done at Alice Springs, much of the mica which is now abandoned at the mines might be used for the production of paints, varnishes, linoleums and so forth after grading and initial treatment in a grinding works. The insulation properties of mica make it possible for inferior grades to. be ground into powder for use as insulation material in various trades. .I ask the Minister to consider extending into peace-time some form, of control .which will 'guarantee to the miners a. payable return for their product. The Government has complete power to prevent the importation of mica from overseas. Apart from India, the only supplies of any importance come from Brazil. The world demand for mica, as the result of the destruction 'of large quantities of electrical equipment in many countries, is likely to be very high. Therefore, Australia should aim at the establishment of an export trade. The cost of mica used in the manufacture of electrical and other equipment is so small in proportion to the total-cost of production of an article that it could easily bear a special local price without seriously impairing the competitive ability of secondary industries. Only by guaranteeing prices over a period of years can the continuation of mica-mining on a reasonably large scale in Central Australia be made possible. As the present price control arrangements are due to expire at the end of this year, early consideration should be given to this matter so that miners will know what the future holds in store for - them. Many dealers are anxiously awaiting the day when price control will end. They will then be able to purchase inferior mica from abroad and cut prices, especially on medium grades which are most in demand and which are in greatest supply. The whole matter is of such vital importance to the future of the Northern Territory that I urge the Minister to have a thorough investigation made and to arrive at a decision before the present control scheme ends. Another important mineral produced in Central Australia is wolfram. A bill was introduced this afternoon relating to the control of materials which may be used for the production of atomic energy. It is no secret that Central Australia possesses materials from which catalyst agents may be produced. One definition of a catalyst is, ""a substance that disturbs everything else but.does not disturb itself"".",52
73,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRICE OF, Order ! I hope that the honourable - member is not anticipating debate on a bill introduced this afternoon.,53
74,Mr BLAIN,PRICE OF,"I am merely pointing out that the present Government is a ""catalyst government"" which disturbs everybody else in Australia without dis-. turbing itself. In dealing with wolfram production, I am relying on correspondence which has been handed, to me by the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron). Scheelite tungsten produced at.King Island is marketed in the United States of America at $24 a unit, less <r>S import duty, which represents a net return of approximately £4 16s. a unit. Wolfram tungsten is marketed in the United Kingdom. The wolfram miners have been disturbed about the future prospects of their industry, although the postion now is brighter than it was a. few weeks ago and it seems that, the market will remain firm. These miners have a right to rehabilitation after the way in which the mines were ruthlessly taken away from them during the war when the cost of production was £2 18s. a unit.. The Government put Chinese workers into, the mines and immediately, pushed the cost up to £5 10s. a unit. So the miners were deprived of the right to rehabilitate their mines. As pioneers and' individualists they were producing mica at 58s. a unit. When the Government assumed control, that figure was raised to .110s. a unit, and a loss of nearly £250,000 was incurred - in the production of only £37,000 worth of wolfram. I believe that the report of the Auditor-General has been printed and is available today; consequently, I shall learn before long exactly what loss was sustained. The result does not redound to the credit of the Government, which appeal's to consider that these minerals can he produced in bulk. The production of mica and wolfram is the occupation of miners on' a purely individualist basis - Therefore, I ask the Government to treat these men as individualists and to provide them, at the earliest moment, with the necessary rehabilitation facilities; because we need these minerals, and there is an opportunity to produce them in the Northern Territory. I received today further correspondence from Tennant Creek. I thought that I had exposed the whole position with sufficient vigour last week, and had been as factual as I always am on such subjects, because my information is obtained from the secretary of the Miners and Leaseholders Association at Tennant Creek; but that gentleman .has felt, impelled to write to me again, for the simple reason that the Minister for the Interior has not seen fit to reply to my vigorous attack in respect of the rehabilitation of Tennant Creek, and the Treasury has declined to rehabilitate the miners there because it had not been declared a war area, despite the fact that the batteries were taken from the wolfram fields, the miners lost their tools of trade, and the buildings were torn down by the Army authorities. Of course Tennant Creek was in a war area, even though it was not so declared, whilst Darwin was declared. Mr Main. Troops passed through it numbering hundreds of thousands, and the whole area was looted. Yet the Govern-' ment blandly refuses to rehabilitate 'the miners, who can get absolutely no compensation. 'That is a disgrace to the Governinent. If the Minister believes that there are Communists at Tennant Creek and Alice Springs, he is mistaken. Certainly there is a Communist cell in Darwin; but the majority of the "" wharfies "" there are good unionists, and only a small section of them are Communists. It will avail the Minister nothing to run away .from the men at Tennant Creek and Alice Springs, and to throw in my tooth the declaration that there"" is a Communist cell which he will not, meet.",53
75,Mr JOHNSON,PRICE OF,That is not true. When did I say that? - Mr BLAIN - That is the inference to be drawn from the refusal of the Minister to meet the men of Tennant Creek and Alice Springs.,54
76,Mr JOHNSON,PRICE OF,-That is not true.,54
77,Mr BLAIN,PRICE OF,"The Minister has stated in this House that he is not going to be led into that trap. The ex-Administrator of the Northern Territory has said that the whole of that area is ""Red "". ' It is not.",54
78,Mr JOHNSON,PRICE OF,I did not make any mention of Communists.,54
79,Mr BLAIN,PRICE OF,"This is the letter that I have received from Mr Rowe, secretary of the Miners and Leaseholders Association at Tennant CreekAt a general .meeting of the above association held on 7th July, 1046, I was instructed to ask the Mines Department to have the leases on the Tennant Crock goldfield surveyed. Prospectors arc put to great trouble trying to locate protected gold lease applications, and on account of the leases not being surveyed it is almost impossible to prove location in a court of law. The department has held survey fees for years in many cases, and we think that as the survey fees have all been paid it is time we received value for our money. That is is subject with which I am particularly familiar, having been a mining surveyor years ago in the extensive mining areas of Cloncurry and Mount Isa, and having surveyed the Granites and parts of Central Australia in 1932. It is incumbent on a licensed surveyor to produce two copies of his surveys. One copy is sent to the Lead office of the Mines Department in Brisbane, and the other copy is retained by the Mining Warden at Cloncurry, Charters Towers, or wherever he may be. There is in Queensland a complete map of the area surveyed. I understand that that is the case also in Western Australia. I visited Western Australia at my own expense and re-organized the whole of the mining department of the Northern Territory, on the basis of the system in operation iii that State, but. miners have told me that my good work has been undone. I. urge the Minister to have, the surveys completed. There are mines producing on; which gives a return of 5 oz. of gold to the ton. and there will be bloodshed at Tennant Creek if men start ""jumping"" one another.?' claims.

80,Mr HOWE,PRICE OF," I am instructed by the above association in a>k your help in getting war-time exemptions (in gold-miningleases at Tennant Creek cancelled. We have lwen in communication with the Minister for the Interior, and Director nf Mines on this matter. These exemptions are retarding development work on the field,, there, are 73 leases under exemption, about five are held by men now in the services, the rest are held by people who are not and were not in the services, and who it seems do not intend to work the leases until the 'exemption expires - The Minister has informed us that the exemption must stand until peace i* signed and six months after:' and that it set-nis, that special legislation is required to alter this. As this legislation is in the form of an ordinance we think that legislation should lie put through at once as there will always he a six months after. As His Majesty will legally be at war until peace is signed with Japan as well as his other enemies, you can see that it is possible for these exemptions to last for years. The association would also ask you to try and ascertain the position of Tennant Creek leaseholders and others in regard to - wartime compensation, nearly all of our leases - were denuded of machinery, buildings, and tools by the army authorities and the Mines Department. The replacing of any of these things is very expensive, and my association think that the leaseholders and. others arc entitled to compensation for their losses. So do I . The letter continuesWe do not have to apologize for asking your assistance' in these matters, as we know that you w i ll be only too pleased to help us. ; Adjournment. 2485 This is the second occasion on which I have had to bring this matter before the House. I ask the Minister to do something for thatarea. A special Minister, or an assistant Minister, should be delegated to direct the administration of the Northern Territory, because obviously the Minister for the Interior is too fully occupied with other matters to be bothered with it.",55
81,Mr MCEWEN,PRICE OF,"Indi) [4.23] - I rise, not to state a case, but merely to endeavour to elicit some information upon a matter with respect to which I have not yet succeeded in learning the facts. A couple of weeks ago, I directed the attention of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) to the report that a meeting had been held in Melbourne, attended, so I had been told, by the Deputy Controller of Meat, a representative of the Deputy Prices Commissioner, ihe honourable member,for Ballarat  certain bacon-curers, exporters, and wholesalers. I stated that, as a result of the discussions at the meeting, the deci?iou was taken that the value of pigs at auction should be reduced, and to that end, it had been reported, an inspector had been appointed and had been instructed to attend country auction sales. I asked whether the. Minister would elicit the facts and inform the House of them. My reference was to a report of a recent incident. On Thursday of last week, the Minister said in the House that such a state of affairshad substantially existed a year ago, but my information is that the incident to which I refer took place merely a few weeks ago. I now speak with a view to my remarks being eventually referred to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, so that he may inform the House later whether such an incident occurred again in Melbourne a few weeks ago, and whether there was a meeting of which no producers of pigs were informed, or at which no representatives of the industry had an opportunity to attend, but as a result of which a decision was taken to reduce the price pf their product at auction. I also wish to know whether,, as a result of that meeting and that decision, a Mr Wilson,- or anybody else, was appointed to attend country auction sales, and by whatever method he chose to adopt, prevent the price of pigs at auction from rising beyond a certain level. The whole point of my query at this stage is to ascertain whether, in the administration of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, a man who was himself a regular pig-buyer, or was associated with a firm which was a buyer of pigs, was appointed to attend country auction sales with authority to prevent the price from going beyond a certain level. I ask. for a plain answer to that question, because an important point of public administration is involved. My second query is as to whether such a gentleman did attend pig sales, and did, by virtue of his authority, control the price at which pigs were sold at the sales which he attended. Do the books of the auctioneering firms reveal that' subsequently he or his firm was recorded as a buyer of pigs at those sales?",55
82,Mr FRANCIS,PRICE OF,"Moreton) [4.28] - I support the able and eloquent plea of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Turii'bull) for the provision of a sustenance allowance of 3s. a day for those unfortunate members of the Eighth Division and others who served in various theatres in World War II . and were made prisoners of war. I have made representations to that effect to the Minister and in the House on previous occasions. T have also raised the question of granting leave to troops now in Australia similar to that enjoyed during the war. I have stressed the need for this leave and for field allowances. I was disappointed at the reply of the Minister for the Army (Mr Forde) and T urge him to reconsider the matter. I hope that as a result of a. review these requests may be granted. I have risen mainly to draw attention to the extraordinary difficulties of people engaged in primary and secondary industries in Queensland because of the neglect of that State for many years. The position has been intensified by five months of industrial trouble of the worse kind in the history of the State. In consequence of this turmoil, many commodities which Queensland has to obtain from the southern States are now unprocurable, such as fencing wire, wire netting, barbed wire, galvanized iron, galvanized pipes and spouting, and galvanized iron for troughs and tanks. Galvanized piping required for housing, and for agricultural purposes such as for irrigation plants and Avindmills, is unprocurable in that State. The situation has been difficult for a long while, but the recent industrial tiouble has made it very much worse. All honourable members know that the housing position is calamitous. Building operations are held up because goods made of galvanized iron are unprocurable. As a result of a question which I addressed t'o the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lazzarini) two days ago, I was informed that the numbers of war service homes applied for in certain localities in Queensland are as follow:-Ipswich , 16; Toowoomba, 39; Gympie, 3; Bockhampton, 32; Warwick, 3; Maryborough, 19; ami Bundaberg, 22. Of the 525 applications for these homes in Brisbane, only fifteen are now being erected, but in the other Queensland towns which I have mentioned not one has' been built. Since 1941-42, no. fewer than 14,952 war-service homes have been applied for. In 194.1-42 only seven of them were built; in 1942-43 six, and, in 1944-45, eight. In the financial year just concluded, 98 homes h'ad been built up to the 31st May. The position is acute in Queensland, because of the inability to obtain the necessary building materials, including nails. I ask the Minister at the table (Mr Forde), as a Queenslander, to appreciate the many difficulties that the people of that State have .experienced in recent years. Those difficulties have been accentuated by the recent industrial turmoil. Will he ask the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Senator Ashley) and the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) to take all possible steps to ensure that all orders for essential materials for Queensland shall be executed and delivered with the utmost expedition. Let us forget the past and have special arrangements and supervision provided to make certain that the commodities required urgently by those engaged in primary and secondary production and in house construction shall be provided with the utmost dispatch. If the ordinary routine procedure is followed it will be impossible to overtake the lag. Finallr, Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to'protf t against the way in which the call has been exercised this afternoon. I rose to get the call immediately adjournment motion was proposed. Although you have every right to call any honourable member you wish, the available accepted practice is that members of opposing parties shall receive the cal. alternately, but the call has been given in such a way that I did not get it ""at the time when I had every right to expect it.",56
83,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRICE OF, The practice is for the Chair to call honourable members in the order in which they rise. It is true that honourable member for Moreton . (Mr. Francis) has sat in t;he chamber since I he motion for the adjournment of the 'House was made but the Chair called honourable members in the order in which so long. they rose. It was not intended to delay the honourable member unduly.,57

(Mr. Forde) will be able to help me in conBlain) nexion with the case of a lieutenant appealed against, the pension allotted him for a disability. According to the medical evidence, his disability is such that his condition will become worse worse until ultimately he will not be able to walk at all. In spite of this, he was granted only a 20 per cent, pension. wishes ine to make it clear that he has no complaint against the tribunal so as the courtesy with which he was received is concerned. That was everything that government. could be desired. He was given a rail warrant, and was paid 12s. a day while attending the tribunal. However, he has asked that the records concerning his should be available to him so that he support his claim before the tribunal. was not allowed legal aid at the hearing. He could call any one else he liked, but he could not have professional assistance. Neither was he allowed access to the files, which were available to members of tribunal. The doctors questioned him about the records which were in their possession. The chairman also asked questions, and his answers were noted. Then he was allowed to state his reasons for appealing. He was told nothing more, and after he went home, the decision the tribunal was communicated to him, namely, that his application was refused. the He says that he would be permitted to appeal again, but what use would that be. He asks that the records be made to him so that he might get the the advice of a civil doctor on his case.",57
85,Mr FORDE,PRICE OF,Does he want copies of all medical certificates pertaining to his case?,57
86,Mr ADERMANN,PRICE OF,"Yes . I shall supply the Minister with the man's name, number and other particulars. He is now a business that requires him to remain on his feet all' day and this is likely to aggravate his disability and to the bring nearer the day when, according to medical opinion, he will not be able to walk at all. If his pension were increased he would be able to employ an assistant, and thus not have to remain on his feet . Mr JOHNSON (Kalgoorlie-Minister for the Interior) [4.40] - Perhaps I shall be permitted to offer the honourable member for the Northern' Territory (Mr. a word of advice in connection with who the matters pertaining to the Northern to Territory about which he spoke. I suggest that better results would be obtained if he were to come to my office and disand cuss with me the problems of his .constituents. I have advised him that ! am available at all times to hear representaHe tions regarding industry in the Northern Territory. Not only am I available, but far I am anxious to render such assistance as they deserve from this or any other The honourable member mentioned the mica industry. I have already discussed the difficulties of this industry with my colleague the Minister case for Supply and Shipping (Senator may Ashley), and we have prepared a recomHe mendation on the subject which will be submitted to Cabinet. There are many difficulties associated with the production, grading and export of mica, but the industry is worthy of help. In particular, the the men who have gone out to develop the industry deserve consideration. Afterwards, the honourable member rambled on about the use of gold-mining machinery at Tennant Creek for the mining of wolfram. At that time, gold was regarded by the Government as non-essential, and of the machinery was used for the production of wolfram because that metal was required in the manufacture of equipment used in the defence of Australia. I remind the honourable member that I represent the electorate of Kalgoorlie, in which 70 per cent, of the gold mined in Australia is produced. During the war, mining machinery was torn out of practically every mine in the Kalgoorlie electorate, and I was one of the first to go through the electorate appealing to those in the industry to take out the machinery, and also to release the miners, because I realized that the need of the country stood before that of the mining industry. Much of that machinery has not yet been paid for. I can assure the people of the Northern Territory that I am at all times willing to give sympathetic consideration to their problems. Prior to the war, the Northern Territory had a white population of approximately 5,000 people. The present plan of development envisages a . population of 15,000 people. During the war no less than £15,000,000 was expended in' that area on defence projects. I appeal to the honourable member to give the Government his whole-hearted, support in attempts to convert the results of a great part of that war expenditure into peaceful pursuits. I assure him that every reasonable proposition he brings before the Government will receive the most careful consideration.",57
87,Mr FORDE,PRICE OF,"(.Capricornia-Minister for the Army [4.46] - m reply- I assure honourable members who have spoken during the debate on the motion for the adjournment that their representations will be considered by the appropriate Ministers. The Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson) has already replied to the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Blain). The Leader of the Australian Gountry party (Mr Fadden) referred to import restrictions. .This matter has very wide implications, and, accordingly, I am unable offhand to give him a reply. ButT. shall discuss the subject with the t . Minister for Trade and Customs- (Senator J. M . Fraser) and furnish a reply later. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull) again advocated the payment of subsistence .allowance to ex-prisoners of war. This also is a matter which has very wide implications, and must be considered by the Cabinet as a whole. . A subsistence allowance of 3s. a day is paid to all soldiers in Australia who are living, not in military camps but in their own homes, or who are paying for board and lodging. The pay accounts of those members of the - Australian Military Forces who were held in - Japanese prisoner-qf-war camps, were for the period of their captivity credited with the pay and allowances pertaining to their rank. Officers who had been prisoners of war did not receive a subsistence allowance of 3s. a day, but their pay accounts were credited with a field allowance of 3s. a day, which is the normal payment made to all officers serving outside Australia, &",58
88,Mr TURNBULL,PRICE OF,I am satisfied with the position of officers. I am concerned about the plight of other ranks.,58
89,Mr FORDE,PRICE OF,"The honourable member's request, if acceded to, would involve the payment of a subsistence allowance to all soldiers who served outside Australia. Some complaints are now being made that prisoners of war are receiving more generous treatment than those who served with their units throughout the war.",58
90,Mr TURNBULL,PRICE OF,"Such a payment would not apply to all soldiers who served outside-Australia, because most of them' were fed and clothed by the Army.",58
91,Mr FORDE,PRICE OF,"That is true, but many of them, because of transport difficulties, particularly when their units were in action, suffered hardships and at times had to go short of food. Requests have been made for the granting of increased allowances to all men who served outside Australia, whether they were prisoners of war or remained with their units and fought in the jungles of New Guinea. I shall consider the matter in the light of the representations made b.y the honourable member, but I make no promises. Having due regard to the claims of soldiers. I am' unable to say. more than that his representations will receive most sympathetic consideration. When the honourable member's question was referred to the Chief Finance' Officer in the Department of the Army, he quoted the law, and explained that no provision exists under which such payments could be made. In addition, be pointed out that the payment of the field allowance of 3s. a day to officers is commonly made to all officers who served in the Army, whether outside or inside Australia. I note the point made by the honourable member that, although prisoners of war were living in camps conducted by the Japanese, they were not properly fed and they were obliged to sell ""their personal possessions and, with the proceeds, purchase food. I agree that the prisoners were not only subjected to great hardships, but also suffered substantial losses by having to part with valuables of various kinds. I assure the honourable member that I have the greatest sympathy for those who were unfortunate enough (o be captured by the enemy. Mr TrjHNBurx - The field allowance, as I pointed out, is paid to officers so that they may be able to meet certain social obligations resulting from their rank. Those social obligations were unknown in prisoner-of-war camps, and, accordingly, in their case the'so-called ""field allowance'""'' is nothing more than a subsistence allowance under a different name. Mr - FORDE - No , it was not a subsistence allowance, but what is called a field allowance, to which all officers are entitled under Army regulations. Does ihe honourable member say that the officers should not have been paid the allowance, or that it should be withdrawn from them ? Mr TuRi\m;r.L.--No . I claim that it is unfair to pay the allowance to officers and withhold it from other ranks.",58
92,Mr FORDE,PRICE OF,"Unde r the regulations, other ranks were not entitled to the payment of a field allowance, and, accordingly, it was not granted to them. As officers were entitled to the field allowance, ' it was considered fair and reasonable, in all circumstances, that the payment of the allowance should be continued while they were prisoners of war. The honourable gentleman apparently desires that an extra payment of 3s. a day should be made to all other ranks who were in captivity, irrespective of where they were incarcerated. Mr TuiiNBin.T, - What is the right honourable gentleman's conception of the field allowance?",59
93,Mr FORDE,PRICE OF,"The honourable member's interpretation of the field allowance is substantially correct. It was designed to cover additional expenses incurred by an officer by virtue of his rank and responsibility. Grave injustice would be done if that allowance were taken from the officers, and, accordingly, the Government has no intention of interfering with that payment. I assure the honourable gentleman that his suggestion with regard to what should be paid to other ranks will be taken into consideration. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) dealt with the problem of housing. He 3oes not help his case when he tries to lay the blame for the shortage of houses at the door of the Commonwealth Government. Every one with common sense knows that in every country, which engaged in an all-in war effort, all building materials and manpower were diverted to defence works during the war,, and, consequently, the building of houses, picture theatres, hotels, and other structures had to be postponed. During the war the very security^ of the people of this country was at stake. We lived under imminent threat of invasion. Consequently, the shortago of houses existed at the outbreak of war, which was in the vicinity of 100,000 houses, together with a recurring demand for new houses at the rate of 40,000 a year, was increased at the conclusion of hostilities to. a shortage of 400,000 houses. All building materials and man-power were used for defence purposes. When hostilities concluded only very limited supplies were on hand to meet the demand for housing. This has been the cause of the delay in implementing a national housing scheme. The honourable member speaks as if Queensland were the only State which was suffering in this respect. As a Minister who visits all States regularly, I found that all building materials were in short supply in Western Australia, and that the shortage of shipping was also keenly felt in that State. The Japanese submarine menace was so great on the Queensland coast that a large number of vessels was sunk, with ""the result that it is impossible today to meet all the demands for coastal shipping. The Government cannot make good that shortage merely by waving a magic wand. However, the Government has laid down a comprehensive shipbuilding programme which will involve the expenditure of £8,000,000 within the next five years. The Minister for Supply and Shipping (Senator Ashley) appealed to the British Ministry of Shipping for aid, and the latter has promised to make twelve victory ships available to Australia. Some of these vessels will be used in the Australian coastal trade.",59
94,Mr FRANCIS,PRICE OF,"Spee d it up now! Ma-. FORDE - It is all very well for the honourable member to sit back and criticize other people when he himself shoulders no responsibility in the matter. Members of the Government are just as keen-as anybody else in the community to meet the demands for all essential materials now in short supply at the earliest possible date. Does the honourable member believe for one moment that I , as the representative of an electorate in central Queensland, which feels this shortage of shipping very keenly, have not urged the Minister for Supply and Shipping to make additional available? In consequence of my representations, some additional ships have been made available on the Queensland coast, but if all ships in Australian waters were diverted to the Queensland coast the needs of ""Western Australia and South"" Australia would not be fairly considered. That would not be fair and equitable treatment of those States. The Government must handle this problem as it effects the Commonwealth as a. whole. I admit that there is a shortage of galvanized iron, nails, and other building materials; but until we obtain additional ships it is impossible to move - the material from Newcastle to all ports. I am in daily consultation with the Minister for Supply and Shipping and with, the Director-General of Shipping this matter. Under the housing agreement arrived at between the Commonwealth and the States, it is proposed to expend £30,000,000 in the construction of 30,000 houses in the first year, increasing this rate of construction to 60,000 houses annually. However, this problem cannot be solved over-night, as the honourable member would lead one to believe. He has laid the blame at the door of the Commonwealth for the shortage of building materials, but the Commonwealth has not the power to enter upon a great national housing scheme. Owing to the limitations imposed upon it under the Constitution it can only act in co-operation with the States. For that reason the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) discussed this problem in eon-, ferences with the Premiers in 1944 and 1945. and as the result of those consultations an agreement was arrived at whereby the Commonwealth will provide the necessary finance and will bear two-thirds of the losses incurred by the State governments in the housing schemes' which, are now being carried out with the greatest possible speed. I deplore the .industrial trouble which occurred in Newcastle and other centres last Christmas and the recent industrial trouble in Queensland. Those disputes slowed up the supply 6f, necessarymaterials. The Government stands for conciliation and arbitration for the ships settlement of industrial disputes. _ It is opposed to direct action. I assure the honourable member that everything possible is being done by the Government to expedite the construction of houses and also to make good the present shipping shortage on the Australian coast. 1 remind him that not one ship was constructed in Queensland when governments which he supported were in office, whereas since this Government has been in power, thirteen vessels have been built at the yards of Evans Deakin and Company Limited in South Brisbane. A bold ship-building programme is being carried out ' throughout Australia, and the present shortages should soon be overcome. Almost daily, I am in consultation with the Minister for Supply and Shipping on this matter. on Some of the twelve victory ships which the British Ministry of Shipping has promised to make available will trade on the Queensland coast. Whilst the honourable member merely talks about the problem for party political purposes, the Government is acting to solve it. Question resolved in the affirmative. PAPERS.

95,Mr MAKIN,PRICE OF,"On the 5th July, the right honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Fadden) asked a question concerning the personnel of the Aluminium Commission. The technical officers so far appointed by the Australian Aluminium Production Commission in pursiiance of its powers _ under the act are as follows:C. W. Morris, B.E., technical superintendent .. l i. A. Dunt, B.Sc, chief chemist K. Kin g (Dip. Assaying Met. and Chem.), chemist A. N . Waterworth (Dip. Assaying Met. and Chem.), chemist .. A. K. Bull, B.Sc. (Met.), chemist 436 P. J. Dwyer, B.Sc. (Research Hon.), chemist C. M . Willington, (krad. M.E. Adelaide School of Mines), mining engineer .. 1,000 Mr Morris, a competent mining engineer and metallurgist, was appointed by the Director-General of Munitions as manager of one of the Commonwealth non-ferrous fabrication plants. He was sent abroad to obtain the technical information necessary to the establishment of an industry of the kind. This was a task of particular difficulty and he accomplished it in a manner which fully .justified his selection for the mission. Mr. Dunt is a permanent officer of the Commonwealth Service who has been associated for some time with the investigation into aluminium production develop- ment and has the requisite scientific training for such duties. The mining engineer and four chemists were selected from applicants who replied to advertisements pre- in metropolitan newspapers and technical journals.",61
96,Mr CHIFLEY,PRICE OF,"On the 10th July, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Bowden) directed a question to me regarding representations from the Premier of Victoria requesting that Victoria should be represented on the Australian Aluminium Production Commission. I have informed the Premier that, whilst his viewpoint on the matter is appreciated, there is a difficulty in that the present arrangement is a partnership between the Governments of the Commonwealth and of Tasmania, and that there would have to be amendments of acts of both Parliaments. Before these could be secured, it would be necessary probably to present convincing reasons to the respective Parliaments, and it is doubtful at the moment whether the investigations proceeding are sufficiently advanced to warrant any conclusions. Mr Cain was further advised that I was prepared to submit to my Government a proposal that the State of Victoria should Per annum. be admitted to a partnership in the £ aluminium production project, subject, 2,000 to the consent of the State of Tasmania 850 being first obtained. I suasrested to him, however, that it was a matter upon which, 472 in the first instance, he might confer with 436 the Premier of Tasmania. 418 ARMED FORCES : DEMOBILIZATION ; A usTRALIAN PRISONERS OF WAB ; SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCES; DISCHARGES OF . ILLEGAL ABSENTEES.",61
97,Mr FORDE,PRICE OF,"On the 4th July, the honourable member for Reid (Mr. Morgan) said that a number of young men with four or five years' service in the armed forces were desirous of returning to civil life in essential industries and asked if I could indicate the prospects of their early discharge. I am now able to inform him that discharges to the 6th July totalled 293,987. Where return to essential industry is required, such applications arc considered by the Commonwealth. Employment Service in conjunction with the Co-ordinato.r of Demobilization and Dispersal. All applications recommended by these authorities are referred to the Army, which, provided that the man is not regarded as a "" key "" man in his employment, arranges his immediate discharge.",61
98,Mr FORDE,PRICE OF,"On the -4th July, honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Turnbull) asked the following question :As officers of the Australian Imperial Force who were prisoners of war in Japanese hands have been paid their full field allowance for the whole of the term of their imprisonment, and as, in normal circumstances, a' member of the Australian Imperial Force, when not being fed by the Army, is paid a subsistence allowance of 3s. a day, does the - Minister for the Army favour the proposal that other ranks, who were prisoners of the Japanese, should be paid a subsistence allowance of 3s. a day for the term of their imprisonment, bearing in mind that the Army was not called upon, during that time, to feed and clothe them? The pay account of a member of the Australian Military Forces who was held in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp was credited with the pay and pay allowances pertaining to his rank for the period of hiscaptivity. Officers detained, as prisoners of war by the Japanese did not receive 3s - a day subsistence allowance but their pay accounts were credited with 3s. a day field allowance, which is a normal pay allowance made to all officers serving outside Australia. No debits were made to the pay account of such members for the period of their captivity other than for payments made by way of allotment from such pay in accordance with the member's directions. The treatment thus accorded to prisoners of war in relation to their pay accounts was not illiberal and it is not proposed to credit the member's pay account with subsistence allowance as suggested by the honourable member. Mr TTJBNBUXI, asked the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction,' upon notice I. How many, service personnel were released between August and December, 1945? 2. Of that number, how many were for the purpose of assisting in home building? 3. How many technical men, building artisans, and others with special skill required for industries making building materials, were provided by the Government for housing purposes from the releases made?",62
99,Mr DEDMAN,PRICE OF,"The answers to honourable member's questions follows:1. 197,844. . 2 and 3. From October, 1943, onwards, recommendations were made to the services by the Man-power Directorate for the discharge on occupational grounds of 19,600 men for the the building industry and 10,242 for the timber industry. The numbers of men whose discharge was approved were 14,489 for the building industry aud 5,960 for the timber industry. Included in the recommendations made for the release of men for the building industry were upwards of 2,000 men for building materials in short supply and the - majority of these have been discharged. It is not possible to indicate precisely how. many of the 14,4S!) men approved for discharge to the building industry were actually discharged between August and December, 1945.",62
100,Mr FORDE,PRICE OF,"On the 1.0th July, the honourable member for. Moreton (Mr. Francis) asked me whether I had read an article in Smith's Weekly indicating that, although I had stated that discharge certificates issued to deserters would be endorsed to show that they were being discharged for "" disciplinary reasons "", this was not being done and deserters were still being issued with clean discbarges if they applied for them. I advised the honourable member that E had not. seen the allegations but that I had been assured b.y the Chief of the General Staff. Lieutenant-General Sturdec, that all certificates of discharge were endorsed to'indicate that the deserter was being discharged because of illegal absenteeism. I have since, read the article and note that it states that, ""on unim«peachable authority Smith's Weekly learns that no new instruction has yet been, issued to countermand the original general routine order, which said, that all soldiers illegally absent prior to the 31st December, 1945, would be discharged forthwith"". As a result of inquiries which I have made of the Acting Adjutant-General, Brigadier War.dell, I find that definite instructions were issued that, in order to obtain their discharge certificates, members must apply in person, and that the discharge certificate when issued would' be clearly endorsed in block letters with the words,' ""Discharged in absentia for misconduct because of illegal absence"". This in the struction has been fully observed throughare as out the Commonwealth. The ActingAdjutant-General despatched a signal to all commands yesterday a f t e r n o o n , and the following replies have now been received:L. In Queensland sixteen members have applied for their discharge and discharges were issued with the endorsement "" Discharged in Absentia for Misconduct because of Illegal Absence "". 2. In New South Wales one certificate only has been issued similarly endorsed. 3. In Victoria five certificates have been issued similarly endorsed. 4. In South Australia, Western Australia - and Tasmania no certificates have been issued. It will thus be seen that in no case has a discharge certificate been issued to a person who was discharged in absentia, because of ill e g a l absence, with o u t the endorsement as already indicated .

108,Mr CHIFLEY,PRICE OF,"The answers to honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The only funds coming within this cateweregory were those approved for the Allied Intelligence Bureau and the Far Eastern Liaison Office. Both were established' by the Commander-in-Chief. South-West Pacific Area, and were under. his own control, until the Far Eastern Liaison Oflice was transferred, at General MACArthur's request, to the control of the Australian authorities, the functions being primarily associated with special intelligence in the operational areas, for which the Commander, of the Allied Land Forces was responsible. The funds of these organizations were provided by contributions by the Australian, United States of America and Netherlands Governments. In view of their highly secret nature and association with operational plans, the approved rules of procedure provided that the expenditure of the Commonwealth's contributions should not be subject to detail audit by the Auditor-General. Provision was made, however, for the furnishing of annual financial statements showing the expenditure under broad headings, which were certified to by the directors of the Allied Intelligence Bureau and the Fur Eastern Liaison Office.

109,Mr FORDE,PRICE OF,"On the 4th July the Inspecting honourable member for Adelaide (Mr. Chambers) asked a question regarding shortage of tobacco, and I promised to make an early statement on the I have-conferred with the Minister for in Trade and Customs on the matter, and now inform the honourable member that .inquiries have recently been made in New South Wales and Victoria, the two main manufacturing States in regard to both, tobacco and cigarette papers, with a view to ascertaining the reasons for the present shortages of these products. The inquiries disclosed that reasonable supplies of tobacco leaf and paper for the manufacture of cigarette papers are available and that the present shortages are due in both cases to a decline of production due to a shortage of female labour in Sydney and Melbourne. In an effort to overcome this difficulty, the two largest tobacco manufacturers are taking steps to establish tobacco factories at Forbes - (New South Wales) and Healesville and Shepparton .(Victoria) in order to tap new sources of supply of female, labour. Similarly, the only New South Wales manufacturer of cigarette papers has commenced production at a new factory at Rutherford and, provided labour is available, full production will be reached next month. The firm concerned states that production at Rutherford will go a fair way towards relieving the present shortage. On the 27th June, the.Minister for Trade and Customs approved of the issue of import licences for reasonable quantities ofcigarette papers, subject to production of evidence that the papers are available for reasonably early shipment. A temporary prohibition has also been placed on exports of cigarette papers. These measures, together with the commencement of manufacture at Rutherford, should eventually improve the position regarding supplies of cigarette papers. AMBULANCES FOB COUNTRY DISTRICTS.",65
110,Mr CHIFLEY,PRICE OF,"On the 4th July, the honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen) addressed the following question to me:In view of the patriotic action of many country communities during the war in subscribing funds for the purchase of ambulance vehicles for presentation to the armed forces, will the Government consider, as a matter of policy, allocating to such communities in need of ambulance services suitable vehicles from existing army stocks? The Government has a full appreciation of the generous gifts of ambulances which were made available during the war, but is unable to see its way .to depart from the principle of not returning these donations as any such departure would involve the Commonwealth in many claims which would be impossible to meet. The Commonwealth Disposals Commission, which is charged with the disposal of all surplus vehicles, will give sympathetic consideration to any application to purchase an ambulance from the limited number of vehicles available.

113,Mr HABBISON,PRICE OF,"- the Minister f Air, upon notice I. Is it a fact that an promised into the recent detention' of an airman, A.C.I. Jones, for 111 days, while Awaiting court-martial on a charge of being absent without leave? 2. If so, what is the outcome of that noticeinvestigation, and what compensation docs' the Government propose to make to A.C.I. Jones and1.

Is it a fact that many members of the Royal Australian Air Force have' been kept yet uncollected waiting months for trial by court that an Air Force spokesman has admitted 30th June, 1946? had thatone airman, L.A.C. Smith, of the Care and Maintenance Unit, Narromine; was kept waiting mure than.100 days for court martial? 4. What action does the Government confollows:template to ensure that personnel awaiting court martial are not kept waiting for long periods before being brought to trial?",67
114,Mr DKAKEFOED,PRICE OF,"=The answers honourable member's questions are as follows :1. Yes. The investigation was conducted by a specially constituted' court of inquiry composed of Air Commodore A. L. Walters (President) and Mr J. O'Driscoli, barrister at law. 2. The court found that (a) a period of 111 days elapsed between the datea of arrest of A.C.I. Jones by the civil police and of his trial by court martial; (b) an unreasonable delay did occur in bringing the airman to trial and that responsibility, in varying degrees, rested upon six Royal Australian Air Force Officers, whose cases are now under consideration by Air Board. It has been the usual practice for courts martial to 'award sentences of not less than 120 days in cases of unlawful absence from duty similar - in character and for approximately the same periods of absence-as that of A.C.I. Jones. Although the court martial' awarded A.C.I. Jones, 28 days additional to the 111 days be had already served in open arrest, directions were given that that . airman should. not undergo any sentence in excess of the normal period awarded for similar offences (i.e. 120 days) in consequence of which hiB discharge was then arranged after his having spent a total of 118 days in custody. He thus suffered no injustice as the result of the delay in hiB being brought to trial and no compensation is payable. 3. No. In comparison with the number ol courts martial held, the instances in which members have been kept waiting months for trial have been few. It is a fact that, in the case of L.A.C. Smith, a delay of about 100 days occurred between the times of his being charged and of his appearing before court martial. This airman was never in close arrest that period, throughout which he conto perform his normal Air Force duties4. Air Board is taking appropriate action, in conjunction with Commands, to reduce, to o r the absolute minimum, delays in future in the bringing lo justice of members charged investigation was with offences.
