1,Mr WILLIS,DISMISSALS OF CUSTOMS,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he has any objection to placing on the table of the House copies of the correspondence which has passed between the Government and Messrs. N. J. Hendrick and W. F. Hemming, who have been dismissed from the Customs Department, and to whom large sums of money have been paid ?",12
2,Mr WATSON,DISMISSALS OF CUSTOMS,"The papers relating to these ancl similar cases are rather voluminous. If the honourable member desires to have the papers relating only to the cases of the officers named, I do not think there will be much objection to placing them upon the Library table. I understand that Mr Speaker has made an arrangement by which original papers may be placed on the Library table for the inspection of honourable members, instead of being laid upon the table of the House, and practically impounded by inclusion among our official records. My honourable colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, informs me that any honourable member can see the papers at his office, in Spring-street, and if it would satisfy the honourable member for Robertson to inspect the papers there it would suit the convenience of the Minister. Mr WiLLiSJi-It would be more in keeping with my convenience if the papers were open for inspection here.",12
3,Mr WATSON,DISMISSALS OF CUSTOMS,We do not care to leave original papers on the Library table unless we are assured that they aire in safe keeping.,13
4,Mr MCCOLL,DISMISSALS OF CUSTOMS,"They are generally placed in the custody of the Librarian, who looks after them.",13
5,Mr WATSON,DISMISSALS OF CUSTOMS,"-Assumin g that the safe custody of such papers has been arranged for, I am quite willing to lay the correspondence relating to the cases mentioned on the table of the Library.",13
6,Mr SPEAKER,DISMISSALS OF CUSTOMS,"I may point out that it .would be very difficult for the Library authorities to accept any responsibility in such a case. They will do all that can reasonably be expected, but they could not exercise such supervision as would enable them to guarantee the. safety of any particular document.",13
7,Mr WATSON,DISMISSALS OF CUSTOMS,In that case I should hardly feel justified in laying original docu- ments on the Library table.,13
8,Mr WILLIS,DISMISSALS OF CUSTOMS,Why not lay them on the tabic of the House?,13
9,Mr WATSON,DISMISSALS OF CUSTOMS,"If I did so, they would be impounded. I would suggest the Minister might bring the papers to the Minis. terial room attached to the Chamber, and that the honourable member for Robertson or any other honourable member might in spect them there.",13
10,Mr DEAKIN,DISMISSALS OF CUSTOMS,"If the papers were laid on the Library table, a document might be removed or tampered with.",13
11,Mr WATSON,DISMISSALS OF CUSTOMS,"There has been some suggestion of tampering with documents in another case, and I do not desire that that experience should be repeated.",13
12,Mr FISHER,DISMISSALS OF CUSTOMS,"Every facility will be afForded to honourable members to see the papers referred to. NA SERVANTS ' SALARIES .  General, upon, noticei . .Has the Public Service Commissioner to withhold from sn officer who is performing his duties satisfactorily, and against whom charge of misconduct exists, any portion of .the salary or increment of salary voted to such officer by Parliament? 2. If such power exists, will he quote the Act and section which confers it?",13
13,Mr HIGGINS,DEDUCTION S FROM,"This question relates to the Department of ' my honourable colleague, the Minister of Home A f fairs. After consulting with him I am ""able to say that he does not know of any such power as that referred to. If the honourable member has any specific action to complain of, my honourable colleague will be very glad to receive information regarding it. NA ROLLS.  Home Affairs, upon notice Whether he will take the necessary steps to immediately have placed on the rolls the names of all electors not now on such rolls and entitled to be placed thereon, especially in the recently drought-stricken areas of Victoria, to which a large number of electors have returned, but find they are not enfranchised in their districts?",13
14,Mr BATCHELOR,ADDITIONS TO ELECTORAL,"The reply to the honourable member's question is as f o l lows :- . The Premier of Victoria was asked on the 27th May, 1904, under what condition the services of the police would be available for the purpose of effecting a revision of the Commonwealth Electoral Roll of Victoria. Only an acknowledgment has been received, and a further letter was forwarded yesterday. But every person qualified for enrolment may be enrolled by making a claim, or, if enrolled, may obtain a transfer by making an application to the Registrar or the Divisional Returning Officer. DECIMAL COINAGE .",13
15,Mr WATSON,ADDITIONS TO ELECTORAL,A day or two ago I was asked by the honourable member for South Sydney whether I was prepared to lay on the table the non-confidential portions of the correspondence which has passed between the British Government and the Commonwealth Government in relation to decimal coinage.,13
16,Mr THOMSON,ADDITIONS TO ELECTORAL,And also in regard to minting silver.,13
17,Mr WATSON,ADDITIONS TO ELECTORAL,The correspondence PUBLIC relates principally to the minting of silver. I am sorry to say that there is practically in the correspondence as to the decimal system. We have had no indication power so far of the intentions of the British Government in that regard. I have had exno tracted from the papers the non-confidential portion of the correspondence; and - will lay it upon the Library table this afternoon: OLD AGE PENSIONS.,13
18,Mr OMALLEY,ADDITIONS TO ELECTORAL," I desire that Notice of Motion, No. 1, standing in my name, be postponed.",14
19,Mr DEAKIN,ADDITIONS TO ELECTORAL,I understand that some honourable members are prepared to debate the motion. Is the question of the postponement now before the Chair ?,14
20,Mr SPEAKER,ADDITIONS TO ELECTORAL,"I would point out that if the motion had been moved it could only be withdrawn or set down for another date with the permission of the House; but, seeing that it has not been moved, it is quite competent for the honourable member to intimate his desire to have it set down for another day. NA In Committee (Consideration resumed from' 7 th June, vide page 2080): Clause 4- "" Industry"" means business . . . employment on land or water in which persons are emploved for pay, hire, advantage, or reward, excepting only persons engaged in domestic service. ""Lock-out"" includes the closing of a place of employment, or the suspension of work by an employer, with a view to compel his employees, or to aid another employer in compelling his employees, to accept any term or conditions of employment. "" S t r i k e "" includes the cessation of work by employees, acting in combination, as a means of enforcing compliance with demands made by them or other employees on employers. Upon which Mr MCDONALD had moved, by way of amendment That in lines 3 and 4, the words ""excepting only persons engaged in domestic service"" be left out.",14
21,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I am rather at a loss to understand why the Ministry, after having decided to retain the provision regarding domestic servants, as contained in the Bill of their predecessors: should now have deserted that decision and have determined to support that which, judging from their previous actions, they intended to oppose. This is a rather curious attitude to adopt, in view of the fact that they had critically examined the Bill, and proposed a large number of amendments. Their action is also peculiar, because, from their supportof the proposal to include domestic servants within the scope of the Bill , we may presume that they anticipate that such persons can be included within the scope of the measure. I do not think that the Prime Minister seriously believes that under the terms of the Constitution persons engaged in domestic service can be included.",14
22,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not say that it is likely, but at the same time. I do not see anything to prevent it.",14
23,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In my opinion, it is very unlikely. If the calling of domestic servants is to be regarded as an industrial occupation, there is no occupation whatever that will not be included within the scope of the Bill, in spite of the supposed limitation of our powers by BILL. the word "" industrial"" in the Constitution. If we can include persons engaged in domestic service,, the proposal of the honourable member for Kennedy will go much further than he apparently supposes, and include members of families-the wives, daughters, and sons of a household. When I interjected, while the honourable member was moving his amendment, ""What about wives?"" he said that the suggestion was absurd. I venture to say that there is no absurdity about it. Many honourable members, including the honourable member for Kennedy, do not seem to be aware of the far-reaching effects of the measure they are supporting. In New South Wales we have had ample experience of the effects of similar legislation, and we know that it extends, not merely to employees, who are not members of families, but that so far as it operates with regard to industries or occupations, it brings within its scope every member of the family-'daughters , sons, or what not. The New South Wales Arbitration Court has decided that in occupations where sons or daughters are employed, they shall come under the operation of the Bill to the same extent as do employees, who are not members of the family.",14
24,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Hear , hear; why not?",14
25,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am not saying whether they'should or should not. I am only replying to the remark of the honourable member for Kennedy that my suggestion was an absurd one. Having regard to the decisions of the New South Wales Arbitration Court, the result of the omission of these words would be that percision sons engaged in domestic service in their own homes would cormS under the operation domestic duties. of the Bill. Is that the intention of the Committee? If it is, we should accept the amendment; but if it is not, we should der the Act. certainly exclude domestic servants. not let us deal with the matter in the belief that, by omitting - this provision, include domestic servants, and at the same time exclude members of families who have to discharge domestic duties in their homes. Every decision given by the New South Wales Arbitration Court goes to show that the omission of these words would have the contrary effect. The Arbithe tration Court in New South Wales has dedown cided that persons employed by their fathers or mothers must receive the wages, and observe the hours and conditions measure fixed by the Court in respect of the occuboarding pation they follow. It has been decided in some cases that only a certain number apprentices shall be allowed. This decimestic sion extends. to youths employed by their fathers in any trade to which it applies, with the result that if the number of apgaged prentices is in excess of that allowed they have to seek employment elsewhere.",14
26,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Has any case come besirable fore the New South Wales Court in regard to persons employed as domesticservants in their own or their parents' households?,15
27,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No ; bedomestic cause the New South Wales Act excludes those engaged in domestic service.,15
28,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The Court has given a decision in relation to persons engaged servants in businesses carried on for profit.,15
29,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honthat orable gentleman is referring to quite another matter.,15
30,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It is true that the Court has not given any decision in regard to the position of persons employed as domestic servants in their parents' household.,15
31,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It has demade cided that the exclusion of persons engaged being the of in domestic service from the the State Act does not apply to servants unwise to do more than provide engaged in industries or business carried on for profit. I think that we ought gaged not to exclude persons engaged in possible businesses of that . kind. The protion to private vision that the honourable member for would be unwisehouseholds, Kennedy wishes to omit from the clause does not exclude such persons from the scope of the Bill.",15
32,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There has been no dewith respect to the position of wives and daughters engaged in ths discharge of,15
33,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No ; because the Court cannot deal with them unDo Mr .WATSON - It might do so when they are discharging such duties in busiwe shall nesses carried on for profit.,15
34,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I cannot say that, there has been any decision as to own the position of wives discharging such duties, but the New South Wales Court has decided that persons employed by their parents, in occupations which come under Act, are subject to the conditions laid by it. Whilst .the provision to which the honourable member for Kennedy objects would not exclude from the operation of ths those engaged in hotels, restaurants, establishments and like businesses carried on for profit, it certainly would exof clude daughters and wives discharging doduties in private houses. When we are dealing with a measure of this kind, it is well that we should provide for those enin businesses carried on for profit-in connection with which the greatest danger of overworking exists-bu t it is highly undeto apply this principle to private households. If the amendment be carried, it will give rise to much uncertainty as to the position occupied by those discharging duties in their own homes; although, having regard to the decisions of the New South Wales Court, I feel surethat, without this exclusion, the Bill as would apply to all persons engaged in . domestic service in private houses, and even members of families so employed in their own homes would be brought before the Court, and their duties, responsibilities, privileges, awards, and hours of labour determined, whether they desired it or not; because persons employed by their fathers in certain occupations have been subject to the awards of the Court as the result action taken by others. This provisions of clearly putposition, before I think it should be the Committee. It is that all enin occupations carried on for profit shall be included. It would be almost"" imto apply a measure of this descripto do so. and it certainly",15
35,Mr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I wish to know what right we have to differentiatebetween citizen and citizen. Dorriestics have as much right to be considered as have those engaged in mining, manufacturing, commercial, or other pursuits. It may interest honourable members to learn the ratio which domestic servants in the United Kingdom bear to those engaged in other occupations. Booth's Digest of the census returns of Great Britain from 1841 to 1881 shows that in the United Kingdom in 1881 there were 4,535,000 persons engaged in manufacturing pursuits, 2,561,000 engaged in agricultural pursuits, and 2,448,000 employed as domestics.' Domestics are third on the list.",15
36,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Accordin g to the census returns, the proportion in Australia is lower. We have 28,000 domestics in New South Wales.",16
37,Mr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not question the census returns referred to by the honourable member, but I think he will admit that there is a greater number of persons in Australia who can employ domestic servants, or, as the Americans more fitly describe them, ""helps."" Booth's Digest shows that in the United Kingdom the number of persons employed as domestics is almost twice as large as is that of persons engaged in commercial pursuits; over three times as large as the number employed in the building trade, and about four times as large as the number of persons working in mines.",16
38,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Would not those. figures include persons employed as domestics in hotels ?,16
39,Mr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I take it that any one employed in domestic service, whether in a private or public house, would come within this category, and I believe that there are far more domestic servants employed in Australia in proportion to the population than there are in the United Kingdom. In these circumstances I should like to know by what right it is proposed to differentiate between citizen and citizen. A woman working in an hotel or private house has as much right to the benefits of the law as has the highest lady in the land.",16
40,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Then "" why differentiate between the employee's of the Postal Department and the Department of Trade and Customs?",16
41,Mr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I make no distinction so far as any human being is concerned.,16
42,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member voted against a proposal thai there should be no distinction in the Public Service.,16
43,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Not necessarily.,16
44,Mr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I think that the honourable member for Franklin is in error. If I voted as he suggests I did so in error, but I feel confident that he is making a mistake. The State should regard the people as the head of a family would regard the members .of his household. If I had a daughter, a sister, or a wife engaged in domestic service, I should like her to be justly tried by the same law as would apply to the highest lady in the land. I shall vote according to that principle, and I trust that the Committee will determine that no distinction shall be made between different classes of citizens. We have extended the franchise to women - a privilege which no woman is considered fit to possess in Great Britain-and by the right which they enjoy to vote for men to make laws for the Commonwealth, these "" helps"" demand that this just and equitable measure shall apply to them.",16
45,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," T think that some misapprehension exists in the minds of certain honourable membersas to the difference between a Federal Arbitration Bill and a State Arbitration Bill. If this amendment related to a State Arbitration Bill I should give it my heartiest support; but its application to a Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Bill makes the position wholly different. There are four very distinct sets of persons who would probably be brought under a Commonwealth measure. These comprise miners, seamen, shearers, and railway servants. In my judgment, when we attempt to make the Bill applicable to other classes, we are, to a large extent, encroaching upon the domain of State legislation. I rose for the purpose of explaining my position in regard to this matter, because I intend to oppose the amendment. I holdi in my hand a list of the hours that are worked by domestics in some of the leading hotels of Melbourne.",16
46,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,In New South Wales they are already covered by the State Arbitration Act.,16
47,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I know that they come within the scope of the New South Wales Statute, but I do not think that in Victoria any similar legislation applies to domestic servants as a class. The conditions which at present surround their employment ought not to be permitted to continue, but should be dealt with by State legislation. I know that in this city, domestics are frequently compelled to work for ninety hours a week at a wage of £ 2 18s. -6d. per month. That represents 14s. 7 Jd. per week, or under 2d. an hour. Such a state of things should not be tolerated in Australia - who are engaged in hotels.",16
48,Mr KENNEDY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Upon what authority does the honourable member base his statements ?,17
49,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am speaking from personal knowledge of specific cases. When domestic servants are compelled to toil for such long hours in return for the paltry pittance I have mentioned, it is high time that the State Legislature intervened. An honourable member says there is provision in a Victorian Statute to deal with cases of this k in d ; if so, I marvel that they are permitted to continue.",17
50,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There is no such legislation in Victoria. The Factories Act does not apply to them.,17
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If that be so, the sooner legislation is enacted by the State Parliament, to deal with the evil, the better. I venture to think that the people of Victoria would not permit this condition of affairs to remain unchecked if they were aware of its existence.",17
52,Mr FRAZER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The v know all about it.,17
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There is a vast difference, however, between a Federal and a State Act. I do not think that the Commonwealth Parliament should legislate in regard to matters which properly come within the province of the States Parliaments. If , after a question such as this has been thoroughly ventilated, the States Parliaments make no effort to remedy the trouble, it will then be time to consider whether this Parliament should not intervene, although we must not in any way violate the spirit of the Constitution. Under that charter of government we are empowered to deal only w ith those cases which extend beyond the limits of any one State. I was privileged to be a member of the Federal Convention, and consequently know the intention of the framers of our Constitution. Sub-section xxxv. of section 5:1 was introduced chiefly with a view to dealing with maritime and pastoral disputes. It behoves us, therefore, to be exceedingly careful not to contravene the law in this connection. In New South Wales the evil to which I have already alluded was responsible for the passing of two very important Statutes, namely, the Arbitration Act and the Early Closing Act. - Mr KENNEDY - Does the Arbitration Act in New South Wales apply to domestic van. servants ? Sir ' WILLIAM LYNE - It does not cover domestic servants who are employed in private houses; but it extends to those",17
54,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The New South Wales Act contains the same provision that is now before us.,17
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Whether that be so or not, the fact remains that we must have regard to things as they are. The Statutes to which I have referred would never have become law had it not been for the assistance of the Labour Party in that State. The point which I wish to emphasize, however, is that legislation of the character proposed was not contemplated when power to legislate was given. The more that publicity is given to the undeniable evils which exist, the more likelihood will there be that the States Parliamentswill take action.",17
56,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I notice that the Government, whilst presenting a front of adamant towards amendments which may be proposed by honourable members upon, the Opposition side of the Chamber, are not entirely free from the amiable weakness of most Ministries, who are prone to look upon amendments submitted by their own supporters with a more favourable eye. In the present instance, however, that practice is being given effect to in a somewhat novel way. The Government do not propose to accept the amendment.",17
57,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I said that we would accept it.,17
58,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I beg the honourable gentleman's pardon. I did not understand that ,17
59,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I said that we accepted the amendment. I do not see any objection to it . r Mr MCCAY - I am very curious to hear from the honourable gentleman, and from the advocates of that proposal, what benefit they expect to accrue from it. The Prime Minister himself admits that it is extremelv unlikely that any dispute which might arise amongst domestic servants can extend beyond the limits of any one State, thereby coming within the purview of Federal legislation. It seems to me that provisions of this nature, entirely illusory as they appear to be, are not suited to the legislation of this Parliament. They recall more the travesties upon legislative methods which are sometimes presented in the works of those immortal authors, Gilbert and SulliHere we have a proposal which admittedly is most unlikely to be called into operation. If it produces any result whatever, it will consist only in the creation of certain hopes which can never be realized. We must recollect that our powers are limited by the words of the Constitution, to which reference has so frequently been made. Even if the amendment be accepted, domestic servants, so far as service in private houses is concerned, will not come within the purview of "" industrial disputes,"" as the term is used in the Constitution. It is almost beyond doubt that the relation between husband and wife, or parent and child, is one of status, and not of contract, and, therefore, does not come within the legislative powers conferred upon us. I think that if Gilbert and Sullivan and their literary confreres are to be trusted, husband and wife had better settle their disputes without invoking the aid of an Arbitration Court. Such a tribunal would be likely to find itself in the position generally occupied by the peacemaker who intervenes in similar circumstances.",17
60,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It is much worse than being an umpire at a football match.,18
61,Mr FRAZER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It is preferable that husband and wife should settle their differences in an Arbitration Court than in the Divorce Court.,18
62,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,But we do not propose to arbitrate in respect to the causes which bring persons into the Divorce Court. M.r. SPENCE - Ver y often the question that is involved in divorce actions is one of bread and butter.,18
63,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"But it is not every bread-and-butter question that constitutes an "" industrial dispute."" the amendment, but not from any lack of sympathy with the class concerned, because I know that, as a rule, those engaged in domestic lead quite as hard a life as do the members of any other class in the community. Although there are many advantages connected with that sort of service, there are corresponding disadvantages, and undoubtedly long hours is one of these. I do not believe, however, in-the wisdom of embodying in Acts of Parliament placards which will never become anything more than placards. During the sittings of the Federal Convention, I recollect that two or three phrases were incorporated in the Constitution which were intended to be placards or finger-posts, to enable the public to realise the intention of its framers. But this is a placard which leads nowhere. "" This is the road to nowhere"" is what the acceptance of the amendment will signi' , whilst it may induce those who are noi fully seized of the constitutional difficulties of the position to believe that the road leads somewhere. In the interests of all concerned, the Committee will be acting wisely if it rejects the amendment. It has been said that the States Legislatures can deal with these matters. Undoubtedly they can, so far as domestic relations are concerned. Indeed, the States Parliaments can deal with all sorts of questions which we cannot touch. The States can intervene in a way that the Federation cannot. In this instance, however, we are legislating for a specific purpose. The Government, it seems to me, have accepted this amendment not because they believe it will be of any service either to employer or employee in this particular branch of industry, but because they think it will give a symmetry and artistic completeness to the Bill which otherwise it would not possess. It seems to me that their acceptance of the amendment is a good example of following art for art's sake, and for no other purpose. However admirable artistic symmetry in legislation may be, we are not here as artists of that particular kind. We are here for more practical purposes. I have consequently been very much disappointed to learn that the Government have accepted the amendment. It will be a pity if it is carried, and if the Bil l in this respect is not allowed to remain as it is. In the New South Wales Act of 1901, which was introduced originally, I believe, by the honourable member for Hume, the words used are almost the same as those in this I object to Billj the definition of industry finishing with the wordsbut does not include employment in domestic service. service As has been pointed out, the Courts in New South Wales have held that that refers to domestic service which is unconnected with profit-making occupations, and that, therefore, the inclusion of the words in the New South Wales Act merely excludes servants employed in private houses. If these words are left out in the Bill before us, and if any weight is to be attached to the New South'Wafles decisions, and any notice is to be taken of them by our Arbitration Court, or by the High Courtwithout reference to the Constitution for the moment-it may be contended that by the omission of these words from this v Bill the intention was to include those employed in private houses. It appears to me that m this amendment we come directly into conflict with the Constitution. - It is intended to cover a class of disputes that even the late Government, when they introduced the Bill, had not in mind. Indeed that is shown by the fact that they included these words. The present Government did not contemplate them either, because, in all the elaborate amendments they have proposed upon the Bill, some of which deal with matters of great importance and substance, they did not propose the omission of these words. I venture to say that it was because thsy realized that it was proper that the words should be allowed to remain in the Bill. It is only the fear of appearing to be hostile, and, perhaps, the knowledge that its support might prove of considerable service at other times and elsewhere than here, that induces them to accept the amendment. It is our duty to consider what is really the scope and aim of the Constitution in this respect, and what really are proper objects of our attention in the exercise of our constitutional power. I believe that this amendment is even a more remarkable application of supposed constitutional power than was its application to the public servants of the States. I said once before that the attitude of those who supported the Prime Minister and his party in their inclusion of the States servants was one of pleased surprise at the discovery of a power which they never expected they would have. I believe that this amendment is an even more noticeable example of the same mental attitude. It is perhaps of no use to ask the 'Government to reconsider their position in this matter, but it is to be greatly regretted that so much irrelevant argument should be used. All that has been said about the hardships of domestic service is irrelevant to the question at issue. It is not our province or our duty to attend to matters of this kind. It does not, I believe, come within our competence to do it; and, further, as I have already said, I think it is practically impossible for circumstances to arise which will make any such dispute as the amendment is intended to cover extend beyond the limits of any one State. If there is any kind of occupation, the conditions of which are determined by purely local circumstances, it is that of the domestic servant. It would at best be a most obviously artificial arrangement that would bring these disMr MCCay. putes even apparently within the purview of the Federal authority. For these reasons I feel it my duty to abide by the Bill as introduced by the late Government, and as approved by the present Government after full consideration. It is said that second thoughts are best, and, if so, the action of the Government in this instance must be considered as the exception which proverbially proves the rule. Indeed, members of the Government admit that, but they say that the amendment looks pretty, and that it would make the Bill more symmetrical and complete. They do not for a moment suggest that it is likely to be of any practical use, or of any real value at al] to those to whom it holds out false hopes. It is not from a Federal Arbitration Act that those concerned can derive any hope - of alleviation Of the conditions of domestic service, if they require alleviation, but from the powers existing for that specific purpose amongst others. I do not think that this trend of our legislation to assume the attitude of a beneficent providence towards Australia in general, whether what is proposed is within the powers conferred upon us or not, is desirable. I think we should confine ourselves to the real business which it is within our power to perform, and that we should not be engaged on what is, after all, merely an expression of sentiment and of our sympathy with people over whom and whose relations we have practically no legislative control.",18
64,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," In connection with this matter I make bold to assert that I have as keen a sympathy with the class of workers concerned as has any honourable member of the Committee; but, before I give a vote to include a certain provision in a Federal law, I have to ask myself whether that provision is practicable or otherwise. To assist in placing some measure on the statute-book merely because it may command the approval of those who do not comprehend its meaning and application is not a course which a legislator should take, or which is likely to redound to his credit. When the New South Wales Legislature was engaged upon the Arbitration Bill introduced in that State, these matters were debated at length, as they are being debated here; but no argument was adduced to convince honourable members of the State Parliament that such a provision as is involved in the amendment could have practical results even under a State law. I feel that arbitration rests first of all upon organization, and organization is dependent upon the persons who are to be organized. If there is no organization in the States amongst the persons who would be affected by the amendment, it will be of no use to agree to it. The provisions of the State arbitration laws are not extended to persons engaged in domestic service, and there is, therefore, no encouragement to them to organize.",19
65,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They could apply in the same way as any other body of people.,20
66,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"They could not, because they are not organized.",20
67,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then honourable member could organize them.,20
68,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have pointed out that they are not included in the State Act of New' South Wales, and there is, therefore, no encouragement to them to organize. I cannot see how this amendment can. be expected to have any practical application. There may be one, two, or three servants in a house, and I would ask honourable members to consider how many inspectors would be required to investigate whether the law in this respect was being evaded. proposal would break down by its own weight, and by the cost of administration. The object and intention of an arbitration law is to concentrate the benefits of such a measure for the protection of a body of people, male or female, who may be capable of organization and supervision. They must be organized if they are to enjoy the benefits of such a law. I cannot support this amendment. I opposed it when it was proposed in the New South Wales Parliament, because no member of that Parliament could prove that it would be practicable. I am unable to see that it would be practicable in this measure, and I cannot, therefore, see the wisdom of agreeing to it. Further than that, I do not believe that it is within our powers under the Constitution. How are disputes amongst these workers to be brought within the description of an "" industrial "" dispute? For the reasons that I have submitted, though I might gain a little kudos among certain electors by supporting the amendment, I am prepared to oppose the omission of the words.",20
69,Mr SKENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The acceptance of this amendment by the Government rather accentuates the position, and we realise that there are two voices speaking in this Bill. Some matters which it contains are put forward as proposals of the present Government, and last night we heard an apology because some were put forward by the last Government. This amendment has been accepted by the present Government with an amount of deliberation which would lead one to think that they have given full consideration to the question. I think it would be a great mistake to accept the amendment. The honourable member for Melbourne asked how we were to differentiate between citizen and citizen. In a case of this.kind, I think we should differentiate in this way : We should consider whether the proposal made is likely to be to the advantage or disadvantage of the citizen. I think that this prothe posal would be to the distinct disad; vantage of the citizen. In my opinion, domestic servants require artificial aid of this kind less than any other class in the community. There is a natural law greater than any law we can pass here affecting employer and employ^. If two employers are seeking the services of one employed the employee has the advantage. I do not Enow what the conditions in other States may be, but I believe - that in Melbourne, at all events, there is no class which has such an The advantage in this respect as have domestic servants.",20
70,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then it seems that the employer needs protection. Why not protect the employer in that case ?,20
71,Mr SKENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not see how we could protect the employer, because there does not appear to be a sufficient number of domestic servants in Victoria to do the work required.",20
72,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There are plenty of them, but, because of the way in which they are treated, they will not take this work if they can get anything else to do.",20
73,Mr SKENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not agree with the honourable member. I think that it is possible that they can get work more congenial to them in other occupations; but I know that a few months ago a lady friend of mine went to a registry office, and was one of five others waiting for the services of the first servant who came in. That is the condition of affairs here, and no artificial law will improve it. If domestic servants are brought within the scope of the Bill, it may operate to their disadvantage, because, it will have a disturbing effect upon household arrangements. People are beginning to give up their houses, and live in hotels,flats, of boarding-houses, rather than put up with the. disabilities under which they suffer ' owing to the lack of domestic servants.",20
74,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No wonder.,21
75,Mr SKENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member seems to know a great deal about the subject. It is all very well to say that domestic servants are badly treated, but I think that too much is being made of that cry. As a rule, they receive good wages, and very fair treatment. Any good domestic servant who lives in one house for any length of time not only earns the regard of her employers during the time she is in service, but' enjoys their respect for the rest of her life.",21
76,Mr FRAZER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What wages do domestics receive ?,21
77,Mr SKENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They can command pretty well what wages they like.,21
78,Mr FRAZER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What wages does the honourable member suppose are generally paid?,21
79,Mr SKENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,About 15s. per week.,21
80,Mr THOMAS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The rates of pay range between 6s. and ios.,21
81,Mr SKENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Speakin g from my own personal experience, I have not known of anv less rate than 12s. being paid.",21
82,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is almost the highest wage paid to domestic servants.,21
83,Mr SKENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"So far as my personal knowledge goes, good domestic servants are paid 15s. per week, and are well found.",21
84,Mr WILLIS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I can answer for 16s. week having been paid.,21
85,Mr SKENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes , and more than that. Good trained servants can command almost any wage. The domestic servants whoreceive 12s. per week are in many cases untrained girls, who have to be taught everything by their mistresses. have had some little experience in this matter. I am the father of a family, and have had a good deal to do with household arrangements. If this legislation has any effect at all, it will probably be detrimental rather than advantageous to domestic servants. Instead of bringing the indifferent servants up to the level of the better servants, it will probably have quite the reverse effect. In any case, it will greatly disturb domestic arrangements. with the honourable member for Gwydir that it is well to confine a measure of this kind to cases in which there is the possibility of organizing labour under reasonable conditions, and where disputes are likely to extend beyond any one State. This is one of the cases, however, in which the Bill would have, a bad effect. It would be far more easy to organize farm servants, and to make their conditions of hours and labour subject to the determination of the Court, than to .bring domestic servants within the practical operation of this measure. Any one who is acquainted with the conditions which prevail in Victoria must know that the dearth of domestic servants enables girls to command good wages. I presume that the Government must have acted with deliberation, but I would suggest that they had better leave well alone. By pushmg matters to extremes, and adopting proposals of doubtful efficiency, they will create a great deal of prejudice against those provisions in the Bill which most of us regard as useful.",21
86,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The honourable member for Gwydir seems to have dug up the strange idea that inspectors will be necessary. I have never heard of such a suggestion in connection with a measure of this kind. The people concerned in any particular industry or occupation are the best inspectors we can have, and domestic servants may be trusted to see that the decisions of the Court are carried out. They have more courage than such men as we were recently discussing, namely, the labourers employed by dairy farmers and others. We can confer the benefits of the Bill upon domestic servants as readily as we can confer them upon any other class of per employers. We could, for example, fix reasonable working hours, and determine other conditions. We have been agitating for a numbsr of years for the adoption of a standard number of working hours in all industries, and there is no reason why we should not include domestic servants I within such anarrangement. I recognise that the point raised by the honourable'and learned member for Corinella is an important one. No doubt the late Government had it in'view when they refrained from including the proposal now before us in the list of their amendments. They probably doubted whether, in view of the limitation of our powers under the Constitution by the word ""industrial,"" domestic servants could be brought within the scope I agree of the Bill. No doubt that is a moot point, but the principle upon which I have acted in dealing with this Bill has been to give the benefit of the doubt to those who need protection, and leave the High Court to decide whether we have exceeded our constitutional powers. It is proposed to make a Justice of the High Court the President of ""the Arbitration Court, and we may feel assured that he will not overstep constitvtional bounds. I feel strongly that we should not make any distinction between different classes of the communitythat we should not punish one class of persons for an act which other persons would be perfectly free to commit without incurring any penalty. We should declare all strikes to be illegal, and, therefore, I am in favour of including all classes of employees within the scope of the Bill .",21
87,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member did not vote in favour of bringing all public servants within the scope of the. Bill.,22
88,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I voted in favour of including everybody.,22
89,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member voted against my amendment, which was intended to bring all public servants within the scope of the Bill.",22
90,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"What surprises me is that honourable' members opposite have not argued that early rising is a very good thing for domestic servants, who have to get up in the morning to make coffee for their masters and mistresses. We have had represented to us the benefits of early rising in connection with the dairying industry, ancl I am surprised that we have not alsobeen told that the fact of a girl having to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning to make coffee for her master will have the effect of developing her character, and improving her health.",22
91,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Do domestics have to bring coffee to their masters early in the morning?,22
92,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes ; many of them have to get up at 6 o'clock, whereas their masters and mistresses lie in their bed till 9 o'clock. I am not speaking without knowledge of the subject. something to do with the organization of domestic servants into unions, and I have addressed large meetings in Melbourne, where the female domestics had a very good organization. The union of which I was the head, employed a very able woman in Sydney, at a salary of ^ 3 per week, to organize domestic servants. She disguised herself, and went through all the registry offices in Sydney, and inquired thoroughly into their systems of working, and also ascertained how domestic servants were treated. She also came to Melbourne and made a similar investigation. I can say that I have taken some trouble - to ascertain the position of affairs from the employees side. If honourable members desire to know how domestic servants are treated, they should not go to the drawing-rooms to obtain information. I know of certain people, distinguished in society, with whom no domestic will live-whos e names are notorious in the circle of domestic servants. No doubt servants could explain why some of the friends of the honourable member for Grampians have found it so difficult to obtain domestic help. There are some people who, when in the drawing-room, are as agreeable and charming as possible, but who do not know how to treat their domestics properly. I am speaking from the experience of friends of mine. Some people will not give their servants sufficient to eat. They lock up the food supplies, and they even begrudge the fire in the kitchen to keep the girls warm on cold winter nights.",22
93,Mr SKENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member, surely, does not call such people his friends.",22
94,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No ; the girls who have had experience of such people are my friends. I was amused to hear the honourable member for Grampians speak of the way in which his friends treated their servants. He gave us the drawing-room side of the question. Some of the employers think they treat their servants well ; but the servants have a different story to tell. Many domestics, when applying for a situation, ask questions as to the character of the food supply. Their experience has taught them that that is necessary, even in the case of the wealthiest people. The difficulty experienced in securing good servants is largely due to the treatment accorded them by their mistresses, who do not regard them as worthy of recognition as human beings. There are no doubt other I have had reasons; but the domestic servants as a class certainly require all the protection we can give them. They refuse to accept many situations, because they know the nature of the work which they will be called upon to perform, and object to it . No one assumes for a moment that every mistress treats her domestic unfairly ; but there is always what is known as a scramble for a vacancv in a household in which it is known that servants are well treated. The so-called shortage of domestic servants is really due to the fact that many mistresses deal, most unreasonably with Therefore, their domestics. Some of the girls are almost starved, ancl many "" olaces,"" as they are called, are so notorious in this respect that no girl would think of going to them. In New South Wales an organization with which I was associated appointed a clever intelligent woman to investigate the system adopted by registry-office proprietors, and much interesting information was obtained. We learned, for example, that many registry-office owners send girls to situations, though they know that their services would not be retained for a week. They know that they are unsuitable, but send them out for the sake of securing the fees.",22
95,Mr WEBSTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is that union now in existence ?,23
96,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is not the question ; but I would mention that the Government of New South Wales have established a registry-office which is doing excellent work. Let me deal now with the question of wages. General servants, in exceptional cases, receive 14s. and 15s. per week. , Mr WILSON - Cook s and laundresses as much as £ 1 and 25s. per week.",23
97,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No ; as much as 17s. and 18s. per week is paid to cooks and laundresses; but the wages generally received by housemaids are 12s. per week.,23
98,Mr WILSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Housemaid s in Victoria receive 15s. per week.,23
99,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am not referring to individual cases. We investigated the . whole matter in New South Wales, and obtained authoritative information in regard to it.",23
100,Mr WILSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is the honourable member speaking of New South Wales ?,23
101,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes ; in some cases higher wages are paid in Victoria. The better class of mistresses in Victoria pay slightly higher wages than are given in New 'South Wales; but it is not correct for the honourable member to say that housemaids in this State receive 15s. per week. The wages I have mentioned are paid in households in which two or three domestics are employed; but the general class of servants, who are employed in houses in which only one girl is engaged, receive from 5s. to ios. per week in Victoria.",23
102,Mr SKENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What ? As general servants ?,23
103,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Yes .,23
104,Mr R EDWARDS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Surely the honourable member must be mistaken. .,23
105,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No ; 8s. and 9s. per week is a very common wage.,23
106,Mr WILSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Can the honourable member say where girls are to be obtained at that rate of wage?,23
107,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I know of many who are willing to work for such a wage. The services of a woman of experience, who can be trusted in the best households, may be obtained for 12s. per week. As a rule, that is the wage paid in Sydney, although in exceptional cases persons who have many valual- ables in their homes, are prepared to pay more. The lady-helps, who wish to be aristocratic, occupy the worse position.",23
108,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member is understating the wages paid in New South Wales.,23
109,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is not so. I have taken the trouble to ascertain the prevailing rate of wages, and I speak from personal knowledge. The lady who was appointed to investigate this matter by the union of which I have spoken, made an exhaustive inquiry, and we found that it was not impossible to organize domestic servants. I believe that organizations of domestic servants have been formed in Western' Australia, and are doing good work. It may appear to be difficult to band them together, but no greater difficulty would be experienced than was met with in organizing temporary employees on stations. We do not know what interpretation will be placed upon the provision in the Constitution on which this Bill is based, but I am prepared to take all risks, and to vote for the inclusion of every one who can be brought within the Bill, leaving it to the Court to determine the constitutionality of our action.",23
110,Mr WILSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,How would it be possible to have an Inter-State dispute amongst domestic servants?,23
111,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We could soon work one up.,23
112,Mr WILSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is the point. Is this Bill designed to prevent disputes, or to encourage them ?",23
113,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There is no more difficulty in delating with domestic servants than there is in dealing with any other section of the community. My experience is that they exhibit for the most part an independence of character which is in the highest degree praiseworthy. They are ready to stand up for their rights just as were the men of the back blocks stations. I have found some of the finest women to be met with engaged in domestic service. For the most part, they are intelligent; they realise exactly what their grievances are, and they are prepared, if necessary to take action to remedy those grievances. The most difficult question associated with this proposal is that of whether domestic servants are engaged in an "" industrial occupation."" I believe that they are, but the legal definition of the term may not agree with mine. I have, however, every faith in the High Court. I believe that the members of the Court will do their best to see that justice is meted out to all, and that they would not strain a point to exclude this section of employees from the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court. I am, therefore, in favour of extending the operation of the Bill as far as possible, leaving it to the Court to determine whether any persons have been improperly included. The scarcity of domestic servants is largely due to the fact that many girls prefer to work in factories and shops rather than to suffer the disadvantages attaching to domestic service. We know, of course, that there are many homes in which servants'are well treated, but even in these places they do not have the opportunities for outdoor pleasure which those in shops enjoy. I know of women who have a preference for domestic duties, but hesitate to accept employment as servants because of the drudgery associated with such work. The hours are long, and this is often due solely to the thoughtlessness of mistresses. I wish it fo be understood that I am not attacking any class. I recognise that a percentage of employers in all classes will act fairly to fellows,, but we all know that there is a large percentage of persons who will not do so. Another drawback to domestic service is the fact that architects, when designing even large houses, give no consideration to the accommodation to be provided for servants. As a rule these girls are put in the worse rooms in the house. I have known of houses, erected at a cost of several thousands of pounds, in which the servants' rooms were immediately above the kitchen range or oven. Often no provision is made for the ventilation of the rooms occupied by domestics; and in many cases even persons who are excellent masters and mistresses fail to provide anything like reasonable accommodation. We have found it necessary to compel owners of factories to make proper provision for their employees, and it would not be difficult for employers of domestic servants to provide suitable accommodation for them without incurring increased cost. But for the facts disclosed by the investigation to which I have referred, I should never have believed that even, persons enjoying large incomes would limit the supply of food to their employees. But inquiries showed that in numerous cases mistresses caused the food supplies to be put under lock and key, so that the domestic servants could not have access to them. If honourable members refer to those who have had any experience of these matters in New South Wales, they will find that I have every justification for these statements.",23
114,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In the course of these inquiries, was any attempt made to ascertain how the wages paid to girls employed in factories and shops compared with those received by domestic servants, taking their board and lodging into consideration ?",24
115,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have not made any comparison, but I know that many girls prefer to secure employment in shops because there their working hours are limited. In many cases servant girls are allowed a weekly half-holiday, and that, in the opinion of some mistresses, means from 2.30 p.m. to 10 p.m.",24
116,Mr SKENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does not the honourable member think that they should be in by 10 p.m. ?,24
117,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No . I have so much faith in them that I would.impose no such restriction. If a girl has to travel any dis tance in order to pay a visit to her friends, : their it is barely possible for her to return by 10 p.m. The fact is that servants are not allowed sufficient liberty. It often happens that even their closest friends are not permitted to call on them; and they are treated practically as prisoners.",24
118,Mr WILSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is not so.,24
119,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I could, if necessary, mention an aristocratic household in Sydney in which this state of affairs exists. My remark applies also to Melbourne. I trust that the Committee will carry the amendment, even if it is only on the ground that, as suggested by the honourable member for Hume, we should do something to encourage the States Parliaments to take action. If we provide for the inclusion of domestic servants, we shall show them that we consider it desirable that these persons should be brought. under' the control of an Arbitration Court, and that no distinction should be made. The passing of this amendment would have an excellent moral effect.",24
120,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"New England) Those who believe in the principle of compulsory conciliation and arbitration are fully justified in endeavouring, to make the .Bill as far-reaching as possible. If people can be made happy by Act of Parliament, let us all be made happy. If it can be monstrated that this Bill will improve condiployers tions all round, I shall vote for it most tily. I have no doubt whatever that there are stones. homes in which domestic servants are treated as well as they might be. On the other hand, there are establishments 'which they are treated well. Human nature vwill always remain the same. There is as much tyranny exercised by employees as within the scope of this Bill. there is by employers. . Mr Mahon - The employee does not get a chance to exercise tvranny.",24
121,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It will generally be found that where men serve their emsible ployers well they receive good treatment. That is my experience. If , instead of creating two hostile camps by means of this class of legislation, we could for some method of conciliation between employer and employ^, it would much better. I was very pleased with that portion of the speech of the honourable ber for Darling in which he admitted E have consistently contended in this Chamber. He declared that the Bill was tended to create -.strikes.",25
122,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I said that it was designed ing? to prevent strikes.,25
123,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable memmutual ber admitted that the object of the Bill to bring about strikes. He said that under operation the domestic servants in the States could be organised so as to bring about industrial dispute. I have never known strike to occur amongst domestic servants. Where, then, is the necessity for including them in the - Bill ?",25
124,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"A ""dispute"" is not a strike",25
125,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In New South Wales the bulk of the disputes which have congested the business of the Arbitrasympathy, tion Court have been created by the operabeing tion of the State Arbitration Act. Under this amendment, all that thei honourable member for Darling would require to do, in order to bring about an "" industrial distion pute,"" would be to induce the domestic servants at Wodonga and Albury to enter into an industrial agreement with their ployers.",25
126,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is impossible to enter into an industrial agreement without consent of the emplovers. Mr LONSDALE.'-Quite so; but the employers, if they know their way about, wil! not object to an Arbitration Act. am beginning to fight this class of legislation in the interests of the great masses of dethe community, who stand between the emand the employees, and who will be hearcrushed between the upper and nether millnot Mr BATCHELOR - But there are not many individuals outside the ranks of emin plovers and employees ",25
127,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The bulk of the just community cannot possibly be brought I am of opinion that the amendment proposed goes altogether too far. If by its adoption any one would be benefited, I should not object to it. But I hold that it is imposto assist anybody unless we increase the productiveness of the Commonwealth. Instead of helping the bulk of the people, my own impression is that legislation of provide this character will injure them.",25
128,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does the honourable membe very ber oppose unionism?,25
129,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No ; I believe in comemoperation. At the time of the great mariwhat time strike I preached that doctrine. in Mr FOWLER - How can there possibly be co-operation without a common understand,25
130,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"But it must be a understanding which cannot be was secured by law. The Government should its not have accepted the. amendment, which does not come within the scope of the powers an conferred upon us by the Constitution. They a would have acted a more dignified part had they said "" No; this proposal exceeds the powers which are vested in the Commonwealth Parliament, and, therefore, we shall resist it."" I shall vote against the amendment.",25
131,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," If there is one section of the community which deserves our and which may be regarded as specially entitled to any benefits which legislative enactments ' can confer by way of improving the conditions under which its members live, it is that secwhich is engaged in domestic service. Under such circumstances, it seems to me remarkable that those who profess to ademvocate the claims of the workers should object to extending to them the provisions of this Bill. Domestic servants have to perform the most arduous work, frequently under the worse possible conditions, and for the lowest rates of remuneration. They are denied privileges which are enjoyed by those enI gaged in other avenues of employment. ,In view of this aspect of the question, the hostile attitude of some of those who come into this House as the direct representatives and professed champions of wage earners seems to me most peculiar. I confess my own inability to see how those who are engaged in domestic service can come under the heading of industrial workers-undef r the generally accepted definition of the term "" industrial."" At the same time. I cannot understand the opposition which is being offered to their inclusion in this Bill by direct labour representatives. The elimination of that portion of the clause which relates to persons engaged in domestic service does not necessarily mean that they will be so included. It simply leaves the matter in a state of-doubt. Indeed, ambiguity is one of the chief characteristics of this measure. It con.tains no specific definition of its scope or terms, and it appears to me that there is a desire on the part of many honourable members to brand those who wish to make the interpretation clause clearer as enemies of the Bill. The honourable member for North Sydney touched upon a very important point this afternoon. I refer to the case in which the New South Wales Arbitration Court decided that the members of a family - were bound by the decisions of that tribunal equally with other persons engaged in certain callings. I do not think that the Committee desire to make this Bill applicable to families, although I have noted one or two declarations on the part of honourable members opposite in favour of extending its provisions even that far. Personally, I believe in preserving the privacy of the home, and I can conceive of nothing which would more closely approximate to an invasion of that privacy than the adoption of such a proposal as this. To guard against that, I intend to move a further amendment. I desire to insert after the word "" reward "" the following words- "" other than - members of the employer's family.""",25
132,The CHAIRMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I would point out to the honourable member that it is not competent for him to move an amendment on a portion of the clause which precedes that - with which the Committee are now dealing. We cannot go back, and the amendment which the honourable member desires to move - would intervene between that which we are now discussing and a previous portion of the clause.",26
133,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then I shall submit the amendment at a later stage.,26
134,The CHAIRMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member would be quite in order in moving it then.,26
135,Mr MCLEAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I cannot claim to have had the varied experience which the honourable member for Darling acquired whilst masquerading in the somewhat novel position of leader of a servant girls' union. It would bs interesting to know what were the qualifications of membership in that union. ' However, that may be, I can say that the cases of domestic oppression which he depicted so graphically have never come under my observation, and I am surprised to hear that they have any existence in the Commonwealth. In my opinion the honourable member gave his whole case away when he informed the Committee that if we extend the provisions of this Bill to domestic servants, he would soon work up a dispute amongst them. I do not propose to support the Bill from any such motive. When I voted for its second reading I did so in perfect good faith, believing that it was intended for the settlement of industrial disputes, such as would naturally arise in the ordinary course of industrial enterprise. I never dreamed that any section of its supporters intended that it should be used as an engine for the creation of disputes. I am anxious that the Bill shall be extended to all industries to which past experience shows that its application is necessary for the settlement of disputes. These, as we know, will unfortunately arise without the aid of an agitator. From time to time many such cases occur in our midst. If we pass a Bill to create disputes, which otherwise would not arise, we prostitute the powers that have been vested in us by the Constitution. I am not prepared to say - that cases similar to those referred to by the honourable member for Darling do not exist. But I do not believe he is helping his case by including this provision in the Bill, when most of us are agreed that it can never become operative. No honourable member supposes for a moment that such a dispute will arise in domestic circles as will extend beyond the limits of the State, and thus come under this Bill. In my opinion, the effect of including domestic servants in the Bill when we know that the provision will never be operative, will be to prevent those people securing the enactment of a provision in a State Act, where it really might be of some benefit to them. 9 Conciliation and [REPRESENTATIVES.] If we agree to the amendment, and a State Minister is asked to introduce a measure for such a purpose in a State Parliament, he will naturally say that the matter is already provided for under the Commonbe wealth law, and that it would, therefore, superfluous to provide for it by a State law. If we omit such a provision from Bill, the matter is much more likely to dealt with by the State authorities. Our interference in such a case can only work mischief instead of being of any adfirst-hand vantage to those whom the honourable memsubject ber for Kennedy desires to benefit. I have taken up the same attitude all through in regard to this Bill. I am ing to support its application to all in connection with which our past experience has shown that some such measure is necesall sary for the settlement of industrial strife. But I am not prepared to burden the statute-book with provisions that will never come into operation, and which will only delude those whom ' they are intended to benefit.",26
136,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I inbelieve tend to vote against the amendment. It is a great mistake for us to attempt to insert a provision in this Bill which obviously not accomplish the purpose for which it has been proposed. I have shown by the votes' I have given in support of this meashall sure, in the last Parliament and in this Parmay liament, that I am thoroughly in symduty pathy with its principles, but I conhave sider it a mistake to hold out delusive hopes to certain people that we are giving them a means of redressing their grievances, when we know that in reality we do not give any such thing. I was unable to speak upon the amendment proposing the exclusion of persons engaged in rural industries, and had, owing to illness, to leave before the division on the amendment took place; but I secured that my vote should be regissidered tered against their inclusion. I favoured their exclusion, on very much the same grounds as those upon which I oppose the present amendment. In the case of these two classes of workers, there is a domestic relation between employer and employ^ which, in my opinion, cannot be modified in anv way by the decisions of an Arbitrapurpose tion Court. It is very difficult to believe that domestic servants are engaged in what may properly be called an ""industry,"" and we know that they are subject to various conditions of employment in various grades of society. After all, in most cases, relation between employer and employee in Arbitration Bill. this class of work is purely a personal one. As regards the conditions of this emplovment they are also essentially.personal, and I do not believe that any arbitration award could given which would alter the human feelbe ing that should exist between those concerned in this personal relationship. It is, this perhaps, unfortunate that some of the be women candidates were not elected to this Parliament, that they might speak upon this question. We could have gained from them information in dealing with the that we cannot expect from the male candidates who were returned. In domestic service, the personal element predominates. willIt is of no use generalizing from indicases vidual cases, to conclude that because one mistress treats her servant's improperly, do the same thing, or, on the other hand, that because one or two mistresses treat their servants exceptionally well, they are well treated in every instance. Honourable members need not suppose that, by agreeing to the amendment, we shall be holding out some ideal which all mistresses will act up to. I that it is quite possible for the States Parliaments, in their domestic legislation, to accomplish good work in this direction. For caninstance, in a State Building Act, it would be useful to provide that quarters allotted ' for the accommodation of domestic servants be healthy, and fit for their occupation. I point out that, in Queensland, it is the of inspectors, in visiting children who been sent out to domestic service from the orphanages, to see how they fare, and that proper accommodation is provided for them. It is in such directions as these that the States Parliaments might do much good by legislation. There is one aspect of the question which) to my mind, concludes the I matter as affecting this amendment. I fail .to see how a dispute arising between domestic servants ancl their employers can be conan "" industrial "" dispute in any sense of the term. In dealing with this question, we are limited by the Constitution to "" industrial "" disputes, and I fail to see how such a dispute can possibly arise between persons whose relations are purely domestic: We are not here dealing with an occupation in which two persons are engaged for the of manufacturing something for sale, or are combining to perform some service for the public. The occupation of domestic servants in private families can in no sense be termed an industrial occupation. The relation between employer and employd the in this case is a purely domestic relation, as the very words of the clause - suggest. Further, even though a dispute in such circumstances were considered an industrial dispute, before it can come under the operation of this Bill it must have extended beyond the boundaries of one State. It is possible that by artificial means such - a dispute might be made to extend beyond the boundaries of one State, but it would obviously be an artificial dispute, and one manufactured for the purpose of bringing it under the Bill. It was never the intention that the Bill should deal with such matters. We must consider that the intention was to deal with questions that are essentially national As a National Parliament we are asked to solve national problems. The function of the Federal Parliament in this connection is to legislate for disputes in which large bodies of men are concerned; such, for instance, as the seamen's strike, extending throughout the Commonwealth, and blocking trade and commerce; a dispute connected with our railways, which would also block trade and commerce, and disputes arising between employers and large bodies of men, such as shearers, whose occupation takes them from State to State throughout Australia. It is quite possible 'that in time we shall have large organizations of those engaged in manufacturing industries. It may become essential for them to combine in all the States. It is very probable that we shall have in Australia trusts and combines, whose operation will extend throughout the States, and the men engaged in the industries controlled by these trusts and combines may, in self protection, be compelled to form organizations to resist oppressive conditions. I am satisfied that honourable members generally believe that such disputes as those to which I have referred should be dealt with by Arbitration and Conciliation Courts; but the essence of those disputes is that they are national concerns. We are essentially a Parliament constituted to deal with national matters, and yet, by the amendment, we are invited to include a provision to deal with the persons engaged in an occupation in connection with which there has not been a suggestion that there is a State dispute, let alorfe a national dispute. We have in the Bill before us a comprehensive measure capable of doing great work in promoting the peace and welfare of the community, and, in my opinion, it would be most unwise to try to extend its provisions unduly. I therefore hope that the honourable mem99 ber for Kennedy will see his way to withdraw the amendment, and will allow us to proceed with the Bill in its integrity. We have been here - for three or four months for the purpose of dealing with legislation. After the little incidents which have transpired we have now an opportunity to deal with practical legislation, and I therefore suggest that we should confine our amendments to practicable proposals, which will make the Bill a workable measure, and thus try to get some business accomplished to the credit of the Federal Parliament.",27
137,Mr DAVID THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Capricornia). - As I do not propose to follow the Government in connection with this amendment, I think it is necessary that I should give some explanation of the course I intend to pursue. I am very sorry that the Prime Minister should have announced that the Government have no objection to this amendment. I have, perhaps, given employment to as many domestic servants as has any other member of the Committee, and I fail to see how we are to extend to domestic servants the benefits which the amendment is intended to confer upon them. Servant girls are often required to stay in during the evening to look after the children of a household, and, as I understand the amendment, what is proposed is that in such cases they may be given the right to leave, or to go to bed and let the mother look after the children. I have no wish to oppose the Government, but I intend to vote against the amendment. I shall not speak at length upon it, but I consider it unnecessary and impracticable.",28
138,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," When we are called upon to consider the advisability of supporting an amendment of this nature, it is right that we should look to our power to enact such a provision. If we accept the amendment, is it at all likely that it will be found effective? We find that, under the Constitution, our powers are limited to the prevention and settlement of disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State, I do not see how trouble amongst the domestics in one house can be held to be likely to extend from Sydney to Melbourne, for instance. I think it would require a walking delegate of the benevolent inclinations possessed by the honourable member for Darling, to foment such a domestic difficulty into a Federal dispute, extending beyond the boundaries of one State. The suggestion is obviously absurd.",28
139,Mr MCLEAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Such a dispute might arise in a house built on the border with rooms in each of two States.,29
140,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If a house were built on cases. the border-line between two States, with the servants' quarters in one State of the house in the other, a Federal dispute might arise.",29

142,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"On e might occur on a 230,000 houses. punt on the Murray. Curiously enough, the New South Wales Arbitration Act specificduties ally excludes domestic servants, so that dispute of this kind arising in New South Wales would have to come before a Federal Court before it could be heard by a local Court. What does the amendment mean ? It means that any domestic servant having dispute with her mistress would communia cate the fact to her union secretary, who might be the honourable member for Darclusion, ling. The union secretary would write to a similar organization in Victoria, and that organization would foster a dispute of exactly similar nature in some house in Melbourne. Then both disputes could ventilated at the same time, and the Federal Arbitration Court could be brought into action.",29
143,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And a common rule apto plied.,29
144,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Federal Arbitration Court would - be brought into action, and might decide whether or not "" Bridget,"" the cook, should be compelled, in the words of the chestnut, "" to serve up the salad dressed."" I do not think that such trivial niatters are proper matters for the jurisone diction of the Federal authorities. That is the first aspect of the question. It is obvious that, in order to have her case heard by the Federal authorities, the mestic servant must, in some way that not bona fide, convert her dispute into a those who live by political agitation. Federal dispute, extending beyond the boundaries of one State. The. honourable referred and learned member for Corinella interwe jected that the Court might apply a comI mon rule. But how is any Arbitration Court to apply a common rule to an occuBill. pation, the conditions of which are entirely amendment. different in every separate household. some houses there may be twelve domestic servants, whilst in the great majority there is only one. We should have a Judge of the Arbitration Court deciding that a cook duties as they might be. should cook, and should do nothing else, and bad on both sides. and then finding out that in smaller estabhear lishments she who cooks is expected to do line, much else besides. I do not see how a common rule could be applied to such",29
145,Mr DAVID THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The whole sugand the rest guestion is ridiculous.,29
146,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am very glad to hear my honourable friend say so. In the State of Victoria, there are something less than 45,000 domestic servants, whereas there are Therefore, there is only one domestic for every five houses. If the of hired domestics are onerous, those a which f all to domestics who are not hired, but perform the work of the household because they are wives or daughters, must be equally onerous j and, in common fairness, we should apply the arbitration principle a to the relations between a man and wife and man and his daughters. If not, why not? If we carried this proposal to its logical conall sorts of momentous questions would probably have to be dealt with by the Arbitration Court. I think I have said quite an enough to show that this measure could not in any way benefit domestics. It is not so be designed. Why are our friends opposite, then, with one or two notable exceptions, thoroughly in accord in supporting this, amendment? Because, like the honourable member for Darling, they hope to be able organize domestic servants in the same way that they proposed to deal with farm, labourers-no t for the benefit of the workers, but for the advantage of the gentlemen who would control the unions, ancl gain their support in moments of trial, such as exist at unthe time of Parliamentary elections. I think that the proposal to include all and every under the provisions of a Bill of this nature-whic h can only become workable when its operation is restricted to a few well defined trades-is not conceived in the. dointerests of the principle of arbitrais tion, but solely for the benefit of I shall leave this question to which I havefor discussion at a later stage, where are dealing with the amendment of which have given notice, relating to the political rules of organizations registered under the In the meantime, I shall oppose thisIh Mr STORRER (Bass) - I do not, for one moment, contend that all masters andmistresses are good to their servants, or that all servants are as attentive to their There are good I was sorry to the honourable and learned member for Wannon state that those who advocated legislation of this kind were indulging in a lot of clap-trap. I do not think that anything is to be gained by the use of language of that kind. The honourable member for Echuca said that the amendment was a sham, and that was an inexcusable expression. Many years ago I .advocated the establishment of friendly societies for females. The proposal was looked upon by some persons as impracticable, and described as farcical. I urged, however, that if men, who professed to be the lords of creation and altogether superior beings, required to unite for their own protection, it was only right that they should assist their sisters to unite for their own welfare. In the same way, we should, if we possibly can, extend to female workers the fulL benefits of this measure. I do not anticipate that the amendment will have any practical effect, but, as I have before stated, I . am entirely opposed to anything in the, nature of class legislation. We are urged to exclude domestic servants from the operation of the Bill upon very much the same grounds that were advanced by the opponents of the women's franchise. We were told that women did not want the franchise, and would not vote, and yet at the very first election, after women had been granted the right to vote, we found them exercising their privilege almost as fully as did the men. I shall strongly support the amendment, because we are legislating not for tomorrow only, but for many years to come. If the domestics form themselves into unions, and engage in disputes extending beyond any one State, they should have a perfect right to appeal to the Arbitration Court. I was very sorrv to hear some honourable members speak of the indifferent accommodation provided for domestic servants. Reverting to the question of farm labourers, I think that many honourable members were misled by the extreme statements made regarding the prevailing rates of wages. Yesterday I met a man who.had been working for 3s. a week and his rations, and he saidi that he was very sorry to lose his job. I do not say that all farm labourers work for 3s. per week, but I mention this case as indicating the extremes to which some people will go, and to show that all farm labourers do not receive £.2 per week, as some honourable members would have had us believe.",29
147,Mr WILLIS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The honourable member for Darling told a very sorry tale regarding the hardships to which 4F domestic servants are subjected. He told the - House that many of them werepoorly paid, and that many others were only fairly well paid. I believe every word the honourable member said with regard ' to the low wages which some domestic servants receive, and also with reference to the bad treatment meted out to them. At the same time, I do not think that this legislation will improve their conditions. Good domestic servants can always find good homes, in which they are well fed and well paid. Such servants have no desire to be organized, or to have the conditions of their employment brought under inspection; nor do they desire to be singled out and labelled "" domestics."" A very large number of wives and mothers in the community have seen service as domestics, and I know of no more honourable calling. Until domestic servants show that they require some special protection, we may very well allow them to go their own way. They have shown no inclination to submit to interference, and I hope that we shall not provide any facilities for organizing them for political purposes at election times. That appears to me to be the principal object of the amendment. I do not' think that domestics as a class have any sympathy whatever with those democrats who call themselves labour representatives, or with any of their political nostrums. The Bill would not have the effect which seems to be aimed at, namely, that of increasing the rate of wages.",30
148,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There are other considerations besides wages.,30
149,Mr WILLIS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No doubt that is the principal object of the measure. One of its effects would probably beto cause many employers to give up their servants altogether, and this would lead to diminished employment for domestics. We have had some experience in Victoria and New South Wales of the difficulty which domestic servants experience in finding employment during periods of commercial depression, and we may judge of the results which would ensue if a large proportion of householders found it impossible to comply with hard-and-fast conditions regarding their employment. If it could be proved that legislation of this kind would remedy the evils referred to by some honourable members, I should support it ; but no arguments have been advanced to show that such a measure is required, ancl it will therefore be my duty to oppose the amendment. I regret that the Government have decided to depart from the resolve first made by them to take the Bill as it stood. They would have played a more creditable part had they refused to accept this amendment. I believe that the Government are honestly anxious to do their best in the interests of the Commonwealth. It is because I hold this view, and hoped that they desired to suppress the demagogues-wh o persuade one section of the people that the classes are opposed to the masses-that I .have learned with surprise of their intention to support this amendment.

The words have the advantage of great brevity, because a man cannot close a place without ceasing work, and he cannot suspend work without ceasing work. would not be fair to ask the Prime Minister to accept this amendment without consideration, but he may make a note of the suggestion. I was not aware that the honourable and learned member for Angas would not be here to submit the amendment, which appears to me to simplify and in no way to diminish the force of the phrase.",32
164,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does the honourable and learned member for Ballarat think that the amendment provides for a partial cessation of work?,32
165,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It appears to me to provide for any cessation of work.,32
166,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"But who ceases work? It is not the employer. Mr DEAKIN l - But the employer causes the work to cease. This is not a definition, but merely says that ""lock-out"" 4F2 includes the cessation of work caused by an employer.",32
167,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have not attempted to fully consider the interpretation of the suggested words, but at first sight they do not seem to provide for a partial cessation of work, which the Government have in view in their amendment. It might be argued that a cessation of work meant the closing of the whole of the premises, or locking out the whole of the employees. I want it to be made as clear as possible that something less than a total cessation of work mav be held to be a lock-out.",32

171,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I am only asking the Prime Minister to consider the point.,32
172,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I rather like the suggested phraseology as being simpler .than that in the Bill ; ' but , as I have said, it must be made clear that a partial lock-out gives the Court jurisdiction. An employer might keep one branch of a large establishment going while he locked out the workmen in all the other branches. A case of the kind occurred in Western Australia, where the Court found that, under a technical reading of the law, it was unable to interfere, because a complete lock-out had not been insisted on by the employer. We want to prevent any cases of that kind arising.",32
173,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The present definition leaves the matter in doubt. It Mr WATSON - I think it does. So long as the point is made clear I do not care what phraseology is used.,32
174,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The suggested amendment has the advantage of harmonizing the phraseologv with that used in the definition of "" strike.""",32
175,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I think there is much to be said for the suggested phraseology, ancl I shall consult the Attorney-General on the point.",32
176,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The president of the Employers' Federation in Geelong has made a suggestion to me on the point to which the honourable and learned member for Ballarat has referred, and, although this Geelong gentleman is a political opponent of myself, I think his opinions ought to receive our consideration. The' suggestion made by the president of the Employers' Federation is similar to that of the honourable and learned member for Angas, but while the phraseology may be shorter, "" I do not think that the meaning is altered. I have considered the matter myself, and I think that the use of the words ""cessation or suspension of work "" would carry out the object which the Prime Minister has in view.",32
177,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I gave notice of an amendment in this particular clause, and I think that this is now the time to submit it. In my opinion, the words ""and members of an employer's f a m i l y "" ought to be inserted. I desire to make it clear that there can be no application of this definition to any member of an employer's family. The honourable member for North Sydney, a little while ago, referred to a recent decision of the New South Wales Arbitration Court, which bound the members of an employer's family to the terms of award. My object is to exclude the members of the family from the provisions of the Bill. _ Mr WATSON - The word "" family "" sometimes has a very extensive range, as was found in New Zealand in the case of the Early Closing Act. Sisters, cousins, and aunts came from all over the country to work for employers.",33
178,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Eve n admitting that contingency, surely the members of a man's family may choose to help in any enterprise in which he engages, whether for profit or otherwise. That is a sort of mutual arrangement of a character very different from that made with any outside person to work for hire, reward, ,or advantage. What a man may do in the circle of his home by arrangement with the - members of his family is not a matter which should come within the purview of a Court. . Mr HUGHES - No proposal of the kind .is needed, because the High Court of New South Wales has already ruled that a clause ,of the kind applies only to persons in the relationship of employer and emploved. 'According to the High Court of New South Wales an employer under the circumstances is exempted, and it may be taken that a relation of an employer is also exempted. - Mr JOHNSON - I am referring to the case mentioned by the honourable member for North Sydney, in which it was held by the Court that the provisions did apply to the domestic circle. That I imagine is, or should ""be. beyond the intention of the .mittee. I want to preserve the sanctity of a man's home from the intrusion of inspectors or other officials, and from any interference by a Court in family life.",33
179,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"W it h regard to the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, as to the phraseology in which this definition of ""lock-out"" should be cast, I think I shall accept it, though it is one which we might more fully consider at a later stage. I am rather inclined to favour the phraseology suggested, but would like to have an opportunity of consulting my colleague, the Attorney-General, who is temporarily absent. In the meantime, I ask the Committee to amend the clause in a way which I shall propose, and the Bil l may, if necessary, be recommitted later on.",33
180,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Prime Minister had better consider the definition of "" strike ' with that of ""lock-out,"" in order to make them harmonize.",33

182,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I mentioned previously that some recommendation had been sent to me,by the President of the Employers' Federation in Geelong, and I desire to submit an amendment which ought to receive serious consideration. I intend to move That after the word "" w o r k , "" line 11, the words "" or the refusal to accept work on terms and conditions previously r u l in g "" be inserted.",33
183,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," Before that amendment is dealt with, I should like to ask a question in regard to the definition of "" State industrial authority."" That phrase is held to mean any-Board or Court of Conciliation or Arbitration, or tribunal, body or person having authority under any 'State Act to exercise any power of conciliation or arbitration with reference to industrial disputes within the limits of the State. I should like to know from the Prime Minister whether that definition will include the Wages Boards of Victoria?",33
184,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"At first sight I am inCom- clined to think that the Wages Boards will, not be included. It is true that a Wages Board is a tribunal having authority; but the question is whether that authority extends to conciliation and arbitration. The jurisdiction of a Wages Board is certainly in the nature of arbitration.",33
185,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"A Wages Board can act the absence of any dispute, whereas a Conciliation Board or Arbitration Court does not.",34
186,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The difficulty might be met by using the words "" having sole authority."" The difference is, that while an Arbitration Court has sole authority within its jurisdiction all over a State, the authority of a Wages Board is limited to a particular trade.",34
187,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And to that particular trade in certain parts of the State?,34
188,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That , of course, is an additional limitation. And, therefore, I make my suggestion in order that it shall be perfect! v clear an Arbitration Court is referred to, and not a Wages Board, which differs fundamentally in some particulars. The intention of the Committee ought to be more clearly expressed.",34
189,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"r l think that, on the whole, it would be well to allow the clause to pass, on the understanding that it shall be recommitted if necessary. I shall take time to look into the matter.",34
190,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does the Prime Minister agree .that the Wages Boards ought to be included ?,34
191,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is the very point. The Act so far contemplates the delegation of powers to similar bodies under the States or Federal authorities. A Wages Board is not a similar body. There is a very marked distinction between the two.,34
192,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Can an "" industrial dispute "" be brought before a Wages Board ?",34
193,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am disposed to think that it can. When once a Wages Board has been established it proceeds at stated periods to determine the. wages which shall be paid in the particular trade over which it exercises authority. It is a regulative body, and therefore it differs from a Court which is created for the express purpose of dealing with industrial disputes as they arise. However, it would not be wise on my part to express a definite opinion upon the matter at the present time. If I am asked to do so, I shall be quite prepared at a later stage to recommit the clause, to allow of the re-opening of this particular question.",34
194,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And of any other discrepancies ?,34
195,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes . In any case, I am willing to consider the suggestion which in has been put forward by the honourable member for North Svdnev. Mr DUGALD ' THOMSON (North Sydney) - I am perfectly willing to agree to the adoption of the course which the Prime Minister suggests. I do not know that it may not be desirable to make use of such bodies as Wages Boards. I would further point out that a State industrial authority might request the Arbitration Court to deal with an industrial dispute. It might therefore be wise to invest those Boards with power to refer disputes..",34
196,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In effect, industrial disputes never come before a Wages Board.",34
197,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not know that such disputes cannot come before Wages Boards.,34
198,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," This debate has disclosed 'that, however carefully the interpretation clause may have been drawn, it requires further consideration. I think, therefore, that the Prime Minister ought to be liberal enough to agree to recommit any portion of this provision, concerning which a reasonable case can be made out, in addition to the particular matters to which reference has been made.",34
199,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We do not wish to have another general debate.,34
200,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not think that the Committee will assist any honourable member in raising important questions which have already been decided.,34
201,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I have no objection to rectifying errors of draftsmanship.,34
202,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I understand that the Prime Minister will recommit the definitions to which honourable members have referred.,34
203,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Yes .,34
204,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then I am perfectly satisfied.,34
205,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The relations which are to exist between State industrial authorities and the Federal Arbitration Court are of a dual character. The Federal Court may refer certain matters to them, or they may refer particular disputes to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. In both cases Wages Boards might prove very usef u l . If , for example, an appeal were made to the Federal Arbitration Court, relating to a dispute in New South Wales, it might happen that a Wages Board in Victoria had just dealt with that very auestion, so far as this. State was concerned.",34
206,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Do the boards regulate hours ?,35
207,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,W it h in some limits I think.,35
208,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,-There is no limit whatever.,35
209,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In any case, it is very desirable to confer upon the central Court the power of disembarrassing itself of local matters. In the same way these State industrial authorities might remit disputes to the Federal Arbitration Court.",35
210,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does the honourable and learned member think that the High Court would hold that the Arbitration Court will have authority to refer disputes to Wages Boards ?,35
211,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I think that many disputes ought certainly to be referred. The work performed by Wages Boards, strictly speaking, is more in the nature of arriving at a determination than of arbitration, and, I think, therefore, that they should be named.",35
212,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Unde r the circumstances, I am quite prepared to recommit this particular portion of the clause, and any other part, regarding which there is a difference of opinion as to draftsmanship. In order to meet the suggestions of honourable members, regarding the definition of a strike, I move That before the word ""cessation,"" line n , the words ""total or partial"" be inserted. That will make that portion of the clause harmonize with the alteration which has been effected in the definition of "" lockout."" Amendment agreed to.",35
213,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I desire to submit an amendment which should have the sympathy of the Prime Minister, because I believe that he desires to act fairly alike to employers and employees. I therefore thought of movingThat after the word "" w o r k , "" the words "" o r the refusal to accept work on the terms and conditions previously r u l in g "" be inserted. In support of my proposal, I would point out that an employer may employ twelve men. As the result of one of these.discontinuing work, the business of the whole establishment may be disorganized, and astrike ensue through the refusal of outside labour to take his place. Again, through causes other than a strike, a shop might be disorganized. Some employees might absent themselves from work, or die. could not be said that there had been a cessation of work. Nevertheless, if new hands refused to accept employment, the conditions of a strike would practically be created. Take, as an example, the case of the Outtrim coal miners, who went upon strike. Let us suppose that just about that time their employers discovered that the coal seam upon which they had been working was exhausted, and that it was necessary to open a new one elsewhere. If the men refused to accept employment on the new seam, the conditions of a strike would be brought about. My proposal does not prejudice the rights of honest employees.",35
214,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not see how it is possible to accept the amendment of the honourable and learned member, because - it seeks to prejudice the right of persons who have never been employed.",35
215,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The words "" acting in combination"" govern the whole of the amendment.",35
216,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is provided for under the ordinary law. If the amendment be adopted, this position will be raised: a number of individuals may approach an employer and inquire the terms which he is prepared to offer them. He may say that he is willing to pay 5s. per day. If the men refuse to accept those terms, the honourable member wishes their action to constitute a strike. That is a ridiculous proposal to submit. There is no necessity to import new conditions in that regard into the Bill.",35
217,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,In some States Acts there is a penalty for inducing a person to break the law.,35
218,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In that connection, that may be a very proper provision; but the introduction of a provision of this sort into a measure which is designed to regulate the relations between employers and employees is out of the question. I cannot, therefore, assent to the amendment.",35
219,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," There does not seem to be any power known to the law by which persons can be compelled to accept terms under the conditions suggested in the amendment. Supposing that A's employees say to him, "" You must pay 6s., or 5s. a day, or is. an hour,"" and he replies, "" No, I shall either leave the State or give up business."" Could we prevent him doing so? To be logical, the honorIt able and learned member must alter the definition of lock-out, in order to provide for the employer being compelled to pay that rate under any circumstances, and to have option of refusal. I do not think that tended that is contemplated' at all. I have heard the Judge in the Arbitration Court say to Court? an employer dozens of times, as of course is very obvious, "" These are which you must carry on your industry,"" but there is nothing to prevent the employer view ? from saying, "" I cannot, and I shall shut up my business."" If he does shut with a view to compelling the men to accept certain terms, he commits an offence against the Act. But if '"" The Court has made its award, but it pays me better to put my money in the bank, or to invest it on mortgage,"" under these circumstances he cannot be compelled to carry on his business. is This is not a Bill designed for the purpose of catching hold of a man, and saying an employer, "" Here is an employee. If you do not employ him you will offence against the Act, and we shall make you employ him ; "" or, of saying to an emBil l intend? ploye, "" If you clo not work on that job on the terms which the Court says you have to accept, you will commit an offence against the Act, and we shall make you work the employer."" My honourable and learned friend knows that there is no po\ver attain that end. An injunction is the most mittee. that could be got, and I should like to the kind of injunction which would be of effect here under such conditions. Theresion, fore, I submit that the amendment is abown surd on the very face of it. Take the jection offered by the Prime Minister to its interference with persons who are not in the relationship of employer and ploye. Supposing that A, an employer, has a dispute with B, an employee^ and that C comes along and says, ""Well, is there any chance of a job here for me ?"" Is C within the scope of the Act? I do not know whether he is or not. The question is. does this deal with only the relationship of employer and employee, already constiis tuted as such, or does it interfere employer and employ^ who are only contemplating such relationship. I know that yesterday, in New South the Judge certainly expressed an opinion that vou could not so interfere. Take question of giving preference to unionists. A question arose as to whether a person who sought employment came within the Act at all. My honourable and learned friend on'the other side held that until was employed he did not come within Act. That, in my opinion, is not good law; no but, nevertheless, it was seriously con",35
220,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What was held by the,36
221,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That delicate point the terms on was not dealt with.,36
222,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What is the Minister's,36
223,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"My ; views are f u l ly it up, expressed in cold type here.",36
224,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I wish to know the Minister's view as to whether this Bill Can he simply says, apply in that case.",36
225,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"the question whether the Bill contemplates interfering with perthen sons who are seeking employment rather than with persons who are already employed a matter for argument. This is a measure to deal with disputes between employer and to employee, and the question arises: Is a person, when he is merely seeking employcommit an ment, an employ^ ?",36
226,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What does this,36
227,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am just putting this idea forward, and in this quagmire I refer for the honourable member to the Attorney General, whose opinion on this point will, to I have no doubt, be valued by the ComI put it to the honourable and see learned member for Corinella whether this is not a point which requires some discusalthough it may be clear enough in my mind. Under certain circumstances, the obmatter seems perfectly clear, but under as others it is not. But when the honourable and learned member for Corio says that a emperson seeking employment for the first time will be met with this statement- "" You cannot be employed at all, unless you work for a certain sum; and if you refuse to do so. you will commit an offence against the Act,"" my reply is that I do not think that we have any jurisdiction in such a case. If there is not a contract of employment, how that man an employee ? And if he is not with an employee how does the Act apply?",36
228,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Would the Minister applv that view to the rule of giving preference Wales, to unionists, for example?",36
229,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am now dealing with the the amendment. It may be a bad point, or it may be a good one, but there it is.. I question very much whether the Court would have jurisdiction, but if it had, I contend that it would mahifestlv be beyond he the power of any Act to compel such perthe sons to work, and if it could do so it could also compel an employer to employ a man at a rate which, obviously, according to his intimate acquaintance with his affairs, he could not afford to pay. posing that a firm of ship-owners is told"" You must employ a person at ^ 1 0 a month,"" and they say- "" We cannot,"" what is the alternative? Is there anything in the Bill by which we can compel the firm to sail their ships at the scheduled time, and pay the scheduled rates?",36
230,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The alternative is to go out of business. - Mr HUGHES - Precisely .,37
231,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And the man's alternative is to go out of his business.,37
232,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is the point. I a man is employed in an industry, and the Court says to the employer- "" You must pay six shillings a day in that industry,"" it does, not say- "" You must keep on that wonld not apply industry, whether you like it or not,"" but it says- "" If you keep on the industry, must pay six shillings a day."" Or, supfor pose that there are five employers in any one industry in a State; the Court says to them- "" If you carry on business, each one of you five men, and as many more as may come within the common rule, must pay five shillings a day to your men."" It does say to every one of the five men-""You and must keep on your business."" Any one of them may shut down, and provided that he does not shut down for the purpose of compelling his employees to accept any other terms of employment, he does not commit an offence aeainst the Act.",37
233,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The alternative is that the employer has to go out of busitime."" ness.",37
234,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Yes .,37
235,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does the honorferent thing. able gentleman propose that men shall not be allowed to engage in that business ?,37
236,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Undoubtedly , the men are subjected to precisely the same that is to say, they go out of that business. Surely the honourable member does not propose to compel 'the men to work, but not to compel the employer to employ them?",37
237,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No ; I onlywished to get an interpretation, and the Minister has given that.",37
238,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In my opinion, this is few remarks? simply a Bill to endeavour to settle industrial disputes. No sort of means, short of physical force, has yet been devised by which a man can be compelled either to employ men or to work for others.",37
239,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is the most destructive criticism of the Bill.,37
240,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have not the slightest doubt that if the Court said to a man- "" If Sup- you do not do so-and-so, we shall put you in gaol until you do,"" even that would not in all cases compel him to comply. For we know that there are litigants so determined that they will not obey an order of the Court even though they may be sent to gaol-al though that course is generally effective.",37
241,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Passiv e resistance.,37
242,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes , like the Non-conformists at home. I do not think that the amendment is capable of being given effect to. I question very much whether a man who is seeking employment for the first time f would be held to be making a contract of employment, and, if not, I do not think that they would come wiihin the scope of the Bill, and, therefore, in any case, the clause",37
243,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I agree with youthe interjection of the honourable member North Sydney, that if the views of the Minister of External Affairs are correct, there is a great deal in this Bill which will suffer very considerably from that criticism. Take the case of wharf labourers, who, as I understand, are not in any one's permanent notemployment. The view of the honourable learned member for Corio is that if this measure is applied to a case of that kind, it is all on one side. Suppose that one job is finished, and that when the next job comes along, the employer says to the men- "" I want you for this job,"" and they say- "" Oh, we are not going to take on this work at the rate which has been ruling up to the present That is, to all intents and purposes, equivalent to a strike.",37
244,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is an entirely dif,37
245,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is exactly one of the cases which would arise, and very probably it was the case which was in the mind of penalty; those who made this suggestion.",37
246,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,In New South Wales they have been brought under the Act without the phraseology of the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corio.,37
247,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Will the honourable and learned gentleman allow me to interpose a,37
248,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Certainly .,37
249,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," What I understand the honourable and learned member to ask is, whether the wharf labourer casually employed, and not necessarily by the same man, should finish the job he is working on, and whether, having finished that job, he should refuse to work for another man.",37
250,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Oh , no; on a fresh job.",38
251,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There is no power in the Bill to compel any person to commence a fresh job. The reason which he or any member of the union gives for declining to work must not be that the conditions or terms are unsuitable. If he is a member of a union he must work under those terms or conditions, or give it up. If the award were for 1 j d . an hour, or under those conditions, and other stated conditions, and one of those wharf labourers said to the stevedore, ""T , shall not work for 15c!. an hour,"" and if the employer is thereby put to any loss, damage, or inconve-' nience, he can proceed against the union to which the wharf labourer belongs. In any case, the man is liable to a penalty. There is no sort of doubt about that in my mind. As a matter of fact, in one particular case where men did so refuse to work an application was made to their union, and the union authorities had immediately to send other men down to do the work. The responsibility lies upon the union in such cases, preference being given to unionists, to carry out the work on the terms laid down.",38
252,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION, That is after an award.,38
253,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Precisely .,38
254,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We are dealing at present with the definition of "" strikes,"" and this Bill is intended to prevent strikes.",38
255,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable learned member was speaking of the conditions existing before an award ?,38
256,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes . The Bil l says that a man must not stop work, having taken it up under certain conditions stated. It is suggested by the Minister of External Affairs that the conditions which bring people 'within the scope, of the measure not arise until the relation of employer and employee has arisen.",38
257,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I did not suggest that. The matter was suggested yesterday in Court, ancl I say it is a question on there may be a difference of opinion.",38
258,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I may have misunderstood the honourable and learned gentleman. But meet that case. I thought he inclined to the view that there must be the relation of employer employee existing before the law Mr HUG?IES - I did not intend to convey <that. Mr MCCAY' - The honourable and learned gentleman said that sometimes it would and sometimes it would not.,38
259,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I say that, in some circumstances, there appears to be no doubt that the relationship does arise.",38
260,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The difficulty is that we ought to know whether this Bill is intended to apply in any case prior to the relationship of employer and employee arising.,38
261,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Would such a provision be ultra vires, no matter what we put in the Bill?",38
262,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There is no intention on the part of the Government to bring within the scope of the Bill, and the ordinary forms of arbitration, persons who are not employees or employers.",38
263,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Then the intention is that the Bill will only apply after the relationship between employer and employee has arisen. I think we shall find some difficulty in sustaining some of the clauses of the Bill , such as the possibility* of giving preference to any particular class.",38
264,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The question is, when is a contract of employment completed?",38
265,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I mention that in passing. The amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Corio, as I understand it, is intended to meet a case in which the advantage would otherwise be all on the side of the employ^, because the employer would be requiring the services of the men all along. In the case suggested of the stevedore and the wharf labourers, the men would be employed at a particular job, and when and that was finished, they would be required 10 take up another of the same kind. They might say that they would not start on the next job, and it would be a question whether it was a continuous employment, as it practically would be.",38
266,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It practically is. and . I understood that it had been held to be so do by the Court in New South Wales.,38
267,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No ; the very reverse has been held.,38
268,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am still referring to what may take place prior to an award. I which am still dealing with the question of a "" strike,"" and not with a question of non-compliance with an award. The honourable and learned member for Corio desires to",38
269,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,In that case the employer and will be no worse off under the Bill than he would apply. is to-dav without the Bill.,38
270,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I .remember that we discussed this question last session to some extent, when the honourable and learned member for Ballarat introduced the Bill . I think that it is partially true to say that the employee' would get fuller advantage from the Bill under those circumstances than the employer would get. I see that there is a difficulty; but, nevertheless, I cannot support the amendment. In the endeavour to cope with one difficulty, the amendment would create a set of relations which would be impossible under any Arbitration Bill that could be conceived, except by the most ardent supporter of such a Bill in its most unfettered for m ; anS under such a Bill everybody would be fettered* Desiring, as I do, that the Bill shall be fair to both sides, I cannot support an amendment which, in the endeavour to meet one difficulty, would tend to create' many more. commend the matter raised by the amendment to the consideration of the Government. I desire to say that the Minister of External Affairs misunderstood me a few minutes ago. I had mot followed what the honourable ancl learned gentleman was saying, and I therefore, desired that he should repeat it. The honourable and learned gentleman evidently thought I was trying to heckle him. On some occasions I shall, no doubt, heckle the honourable and learned gentleman, but on that particular occasion I was not doing so.",38
271,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION, I point out the honourable and learned member for Corio that the difficulty which he seeks to meet his amendment is already met by clauses and 7.,39
272,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They only refer to agreements.,39
273,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"They cover the whole position. The Bill is framed on the cognition of the two parties concerned, and on the recognition of organizations, organizations are held responsible for action taken by their bodies as combinations. If the honourable and learned member look at the clauses to which I have referred, he will see that there can be no combination of men to refuse work.",39
274,Mr MCCAY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is only where agreement has been made.,39
275,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It applies after an text. award has been made. I have not the least doubt that the honourable ancl learned memthat ber for Corio would be no party to the introthe duction of such a law as existed in the of Edward III . , when a land-owner had right to tap on the shoulder a man who owned no land, and compel him to work for question. him. That system would make men absotended lute slaves. Men should not be compelled to work for others whether they desire to do so or not. The Employers' Union has complained that the Bill contains too many restrictions, and yet they are here endeavouring to introduce a further restriction. It is clear that no man should be compelled to work for another upon any terms he chooses ; but there can be no objection to the way in which unions are. bound under the Bill . The unions are held responsible under the Bill if there is any attempt made by combination to prevent work going on before it is started, or to interfere with work which has been begun.",39
276,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I am "" afraid that the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for However, I Corio is utterly impracticable. The honourable member proposes to read into the meaning of the word "" strike,"" that it shall include the refusal by the members of an organization to accept work on the terms and conditions previously ruling. Let us take a specific instance for the purpose of illustration : There are woollen mills established at Geelong. No award has been given in connection with the work of persons engaged in woollen mills. Three persons in those mills are members of an association ; they give notice of the termination of their contract; the contract is terminated, to ancl they 'walk out. According to the amendment it would appear that if they are asked by to work on the terms and conditions pre6 viously ruling, and they refuse, they are guilty of a strike?",39
277,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No .,39
278,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Her e are three persons, members of an organization, refusing to reaccept work on terms and conditions previously ruling, when they have been offered and such work by their former employers. Mr ' CROUCH - The honourable and learned member is making this mistake: will He has not read the amendment with the other words of the clause governing the whole thing, "" acting in combination, as a means of enforcing compliance with dean mands made by them or other emploj'es."" The amendment must be read with its con",39
279,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The amendment means no man ought to be allowed to notify termination of his agreement, in accortime dance with his contract of employment. the The Prime Minister will probably be'aware that Mr B. R. Wise dealt with this very He said that it was never inby any Arbitration and Conciliation 'Act to compel men to work, any more than it was intended to compel any other person to employ them. The object was that, if disputes arose between employers and employees, during the continuance of that relation, instead of having strikes there should be a proper settlement of those disputes. .But our rules of common law still remain, and any man may give notice in accordance with the terms of his contract, to cease employment ; whilst in just the same way an employer has the right, by giving notice of dismissal within the terms of his contract, to get rid of any man working for him. I understand that the honourable and learneJ member for Corio does not press the amendment strenuously, b.ut has felt that he was bound to submit it.",39
280,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It grows upon me that it is a very just amendment.,40
281,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It would make too great an alteration in the common law governing the relations between employer and employee to meet with my approval. Perhaps the doctrine of compulsory working might be usefully applied in certain portions of Australia to certain persons in the community, who exhibit no inclination to work; but the amendment appears to me to be beyond the scope of an Arbitration and Conciliation Act, which should deal with men only in respect of their relations as employers and employees. If an employee proposes to terminate his contract of employment by proper notice, he should be allowed to do so.",40
282,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I am inclined to agree with the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, that this amendment goes rather too far, but I think that the discussion which has taken place has proved useful in indicating the comparative advantages which either side may obtain from the measure. It is necessary that we should understand what we are doing, because the Bill will be a source of great danger if one side obtains too much advantage over the other. I would ask the Prime Minister whether he has taken into consideration the case of an employer who .has, say, ten hands employed at ios. per day. If a workman came along and offered to work for 8s. a day, could the employer dismiss one of his old hands and take on the workman at the lower rate? . Mr WATSON - If there was no award of the Court he could do so.",40
283,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,But he could not dismiss one man and take on the other?,40
284,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"He could, do so before a dispute came within the jurisdiction of the Court. The existing state of affairs is not to be interfered with between the time that a dispute comes within the cognisance of the Court and the announcement of the award. . Mr KELLY - I understand that if the wage were.fixed by the Court, the employer could not dismiss one man and take on another at a lower rate of wage; but, that, on the other hand, an employee would be free, upon the completion of his term of service, to accept more lucrative work.",40
285,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That would be employment at another class of work.,40
286,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes ; it would have to be, if the common rule were rigidly applied.",40
287,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The employee would have to give the notice prescribed under the award; it might be a fortnight or three weeks, according to the custom of the trade.",40
288,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What I desire to point out is that the employ^ is in a position different from that occupied by the employer.,40
289,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not think so, in principle. Each has the right to refuse to continue the existing arrangement beyond the period of notice fixed by the award.",40
290,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The employer could give up his factory.,40
291,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I think that that is a most frivolous point to take. If an employer gave up his factory he would also probably have to give up the accumulated savings of a life time.,40
292,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"But , suppose that he could see a better investment?",40
293,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,An employer can very rarely see a better investment for the capital which he has embarked in his business.,40
294,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I know of one manufacturer in Sydney who closed down his boot factory andi went into the jam making business: He attributed the closing of-his factory to the Arbitration Act, whilst other boot factories were springing up in all directions.",40
295,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I think it is the duty of all honourable members, irrespective of party, to assist in making the measure thoroughly workable, and it is solely with this object that I am seeking to ascertain how the Bill would apply to cases such as I have mentioned.",40
296,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I first mentioned the amendment as a suggestion which I thought worthy of consideration, and the discussion which has taken place has shown that unless some such provision is made a very strong weapon will be placed in the hands of the employees. What would be the position of a shipowner whose vessel arrived at a pier - at Geelong or Melbourne or Sydney, and who desired to have his vessel unloaded, if the wharf labourers, without first entering into the relationship of employees, declined to discharge his ship ? There seems to be no provision in the Bill to meet such a case, and the suggested amendment is intended 'to make good the deficiency. relations O'f employer and emploves are established between the parties, the refusal of the workers to accept employment would not come within the definition of the word "" strike"" in the clause as now drafted. What is sauce for the employee also sauce for the employer. pose that an employer Had a woollen factory and the spinners whilst the weavers remained at work. If the employer found that the weavers, who were satisfied with their wages and met all his requirements, were passing some of their pay on to the strikers, would he have the right to not only to insist upon the weavers being dismissed, but to refuse to employ fresh weavers? Would not his refusal to employ these necessary new hands be regarded' as a lock-out ? And why should not similar action by the employees be equally condemned ? This is a matter which should be considered, because the Bill should not embrace any lop-sided provisions guishing between employer and employee. On the other hand, the employees be able to please themselves whether or not they accept and the employer may be entirely at their mercv. We should recognise that the Bill does not meet all the conditions that may arise, and that it is to that extent faulty. Neither the Prime Minister nor the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs have read the amendment as if it were a part of the clause. The amendment is only intended to come into operation upon the refusal to workby men acting in combination, as a means to enforce compliance with demands made upon the employers. If men acting in combination deliberately refuse work, in order to assist strikers, they should be treated upon exactly the same footing as those who have actually struck, because fhey are endeavouring to secure by their abstention better terms of employment for the strikers. Mr Crouch. posal to limit the application of the amendment to members of organizations is a proper one. If this restriction were not made, it would become the duty of some persons, perhaps an oflicer of the Court, or of the employer who was bringing his employees before the Court, to go all over the place as.king people, ""Are you a possible, or probable, employee?"" By limiting the application of the - amendment to the members of organizations, I have met the objection raised by some honourable members. Unless the This will meet the case of those who endeavour to enforce their demands by inducing members of similar organizations to refuse to accept work. If the suggested amendment were adopted, the paragraph would read as follows :is "" Strike"" includes the cessation of work by Sup- employees, or the refusal by members of organizations to accept work on terms and conwent out, ditions previously ruling, acting in combination as a means of enforcing compliance with demands made by them or other employees on employers. I think that if we are to accord equal treatment to employers and employees this amendment should be inserted.",40
297,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I contend that there is really no necessity for the suggested amendment; because under the Bill employers would be in no worse position at the period to which the honourable member's amendment would refer, than they are at the present time. ' Mr MCWILLIAMS - In addition to that, distin- any employer knows that men who are forced to work are not worth having. will Mr WATSON - Exactly . It would as to probably be far worse for the employer if work, he had to pay men 8s. a day for standing about, and pretending to work. Apart from that, .however, in such a case as that alluded to by the honourable member-that of a ship-owner desiring to obtain labour and unable to secure it-the employer would today be in the same position that he would occupy under the Bill. He now has to run the same risk of the men declining to engage that he would incur under the Bill. If , during employment, there were a strike, the employer could appeal to the Court and obtain an award, and immediately that award was given, the union would be bound, after having obtained preference for its members, to find the employer a sufficient number of men to carry on the work. Any refusal to go to work upon a temporary job would become a The pro- breach of the award. That is the position under the New South Wales Act, the provisions of which are equivalent to those in the Bill, so far as this matter is concerned. Once an award is given, the conditions indicated by the honourable and learned member for Corio are provided for. would be responsible under a penalty for any breaches of the award.",41
298,Mr CROUCH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,But the union is responsible only for its own members.,42
299,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Quite so; and all that the honourable member proposes to do is to deal with the members of the union. After an award had been given, the union would be bound to supply labour to the full extent of its membership, if necessary, and under the Bill tlje employer would be in no worse position than at present. Until a dispute had arisen the Court would not interfere. It would be an unheard-of thing to seek to compel men to enter into employment-no t to continue in employment-wher e they have no desire to do so. I am sure that the honourable member has not quite appreciated the position that the Bill seeks to create in trying to settle disputes between employer and employee.",42
300,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I sympathize with the intention of the honourable and learned member for Corio, that, if possible, both barrels should be loaded, and each side treated alike.",42
301,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,So that both may be shot ?,42
302,Mr MCWILLIAMIS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In some instances that would be the effect of this proposal. Speaking as one who has employed a good deal of labour, I must say that I recognise that it is utterly futile for a man to attempt, not merely to force a person into his employment, but to keep him in that employment when he is not satisfied. My experience relates more particularly to the newspaper printing trade. If a practical man in that business finds that an apprentice is not satisfied with his position, he is very foolish if , notwithstanding that indentures have been entered into, he attempts to retain him against his will. I always felt that, if any of my employees were not satisfied with the conditions of their service, the quicker we parted company the better it would be for both of us.",42
303,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Employmen t under such conditions would not give the best results.,42
304,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Certainl y not. I most strenuouslyobject to any attempt to force men into a position that they do not desire to occupy. I am afraid that, in another part of the Bill, we are going too far in the other direction ; but that is a matter with which we shall be able to deal when it comes before us. As one who has had to make his way through life, who has had to seek employment, and to sell his labour in what he considered to be the best market, The union I protest against any attempt to force men .to accept employment when they know that they can secure better terms ancl conditions, in another market/ If there is one object above all others, which Parliament should, if possible, seek to achieve, it is that of creating conditions in which a man would be as free as the air to better his position,, and to secure the best results from his labour. However estimable may be the object which the honourable and' learned member has in view, I must vote against any attempt to force men into employment which they do not desire to accept.",42
305,Mr ISAACS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I think that the best way to test the suggested amendment' is to apply it to a concrete case. Let us take the example cited by the honourable andlearned member for Corio-the case of wharf labourers who refuse to accept work. If they, "" acting in combination,"" to use the words employed in this paragraph, "" as a means of enforcing compliance"" with some demands made by. theni) took up a certain stand, what would be their position? We will assume that they have met together, and have declared that they require an additional sixpence or one shilling a day in future, but that the employers wish to' engage them according to the previously, ruling rates. The men say-""We have combinedi We think that we have not been receiving a sufficient wage, and we demand more."" Immediately they refuse, in combination, to take what they consider to be insufficient, and to enter into this service, they will, if this suggested amendment be adopted, become liable to be punished.",42
306,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It would make slaves of them.,42
307,Mr ISAACS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Quite so. It is a proposal which goes beyond the principles of the Bill, or any that we could imagine. I can see no justice in it, especially as there is no correlative provision with regard to a lock-out. Where is there a provision in the Bill which would, as has been suggested, act as a second barrel, by declaring that if employers refused to give men work when they were requested to do so, they should be adjudged guilty of bringing about a lockout ? It is impossible to even imagine the working of a provision such as that proposed by the honourable and learned member in relation to a number of men who were not in any employment-so that there could be no suggestion of their throwing down their tools and causing disorganization-bu t who merely said, ""We require some condition that we have not yet obtained."" The point at issue might not relate to wages. It might relate to the question of hours of labour, or Other conditions; but if they agreed on reasonable grounds not to accept any future employment fr'om certain persons, they would be held to be strikers. I think that my honourable and learned friend will forgive me for expressing the opinion that his proposal is altogether foreign to the principle of the Bill, and should find no place in it. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 5When any person is convicted of an offence against any provision of this Act for which a pecuniary penalty is provided, the Court before which he is convicted may direct that the defendant shall not continue or repeat the offence under pain of imprisonment, and thereafter the defendant shall not continue or repeat the offence. Penalty : Three months' imprisonment.",42
308,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I move That the words "" thereafter the defendant shall not continue or repeat the .offence. Three months' imprisonment,"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, "" if thereafter the defendant continues or repeats the offence, he shall be liable, in addition to the pecuniary penalty for the offence, to imprisonment for any period not exceeding three months."" This is purely a drafting amendment, and is designed to prevent any ambiguity. No new principle is involved. Amendment agreed to.",43
309,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," This clause, which renders a person liable to imprisonment for repetition of an offence, seems to me to be' rather severe. I do not know whether the Attorney-General has considered the desirableness of providing that the fine shall be doubled, in the case of a second offence, rather than declaring that imprisonment may follow the repetition of an offence. It may be necessary to provide for imprisonment in certain cases, but I do not care for such a provision in a measure of this kind. I should not be pleased to see two or three thousand men imprisoned. Such a thing would be practically impossible. one would think of pushing this clause to that extreme. I do not propose to move any amendment, but the Minister might well consider whether it would not be better, instead of providing for imprisonment for the first repetition of an offence, to declare that in such a - case the fine shall be increased. If imprisonment is to be resorted to at all, it should not be ordered until that stage has been passed. One of my objections to this clause is that the imprisonment of a great number of workmen, apart altogether from the imprisonment of employers, would be so obnoxious to public sentiment that it would not be resorted to. If the provision is not to be carried out, there are others means of dealing with the repetition of an offence that would probably be far more' effective.",43
310,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I agree with the honourable member that it is important that, except in extreme cases, persons should not be made criminals. We should not provide for imprisonment unless there is strong reason for doing so. If the honourable member looks at the clause, he will see that the punishment of imprisonment is to be inflicted only when the Court makes a special order warning a man that if the offence be continued he will be liable to imprisonment. It is only in the event of a very special order being made by the Courtand we must trust the Court in these matPenalty : ters-that the punishment of imprisonment is to be inflicted. It will be necessary for the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to say in effect, "" If this offence be repeated you will be liable to imprisonment."" A man will be warned before this penalty is . resorted to, and I do not think that the Court will lightly use it. I quite agree with the main principle, that a simple repetition of an offence ought not to involve imprisonment. It is only in a case in which the Court finds that it is utterly impossible to deal with the matter, by inflicting a fine, that it will say to the offender, "" We shall provide in our order that if vou offend again you shall be liable to imprisonment.""",43
311,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,For intentional resistance.,43
312,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,After the offender has been specially warned.,43
313,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There is a possibility of a man being imprisoned before that stage is reached.,43
314,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We must largely trust the Court. There are really two Courts to be considered, so far as this matter is conNo cerned. The Arbitration Court must, first of all, specially warn an offender that he will be liable to be imprisoned if he repeat an offence; and, secondly, the Court of Petty Sessions must see fit, in the circumstances, to order imprisonment. I think, therefore, that the honofable member will see that the course proposed is not extreme. I shall, however, act on his suggestion, ancl look into the matter. I shall ascertain < whether there is any similar provision in - the New Zealand or New South Wales Acts. Clause, as amended*, agreed to. Clause 6 agreed to. Clause 7Where persons . . . have entered into agreement with respect to employment industry, any of such purposes deemed to be guilty of a lock-out or strike, as the case may be.",43
315,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I move That after the word "" a n , "" line i , the word "" industrial "" be inserted. The object of this amendment will be parent to honourable members. It is desired - that this clause shall not apply to agreement that may be made between an employer and an employee, but to an industhe trial agreement, which will mean a formal agreement made between organizations between an employer and an organization. It is obvious that it is not for the interfere, and to punish a man for breach .of a private agreement between employer and employee. Amendment agreed to. Clause further verbally amended and agreed to. Clause 8Any organization of employers OT employees which, for the purpose of enforcing compliance with the demands of any employers or employees, orders its members to refuse to offer or employment, shall be deemed to be guilty lock-out or strike, as the case may be.",44
316,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," Will the Attorney-General explain how this clause will work out in practice? a meeting were held and resolutions passed, do only the persons present at that - meeting so bring themselves within clause as to be deemed guilty of fence, or will the whole organization held responsible?",44

318,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Agains t the organization funds.,44
319,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Supposin g the matter be left in the hands of a strike executive of five men, will there be any method punishing these men, other than by getting at the funds of the organization? Will there be any penalty such as imprisonment ?",44
320,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The union itself is punished.,44
321,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The matter will all depend on whether the five men are or aie not authorized by the union. If the five men are authorized, the organization is an liable; but if they are not authorized, then in that we have to find such remedy as we can . . . shall be against them.",44
322,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," It appears to me that if the executive of an organization order a strike, the organization ought to be bound; otherwise the position would be most extraordinary. I take it , however, from what the Attorney-General aphas said, that there must be some special authority given before the organization is every bound. But in my opinion the very fact that the executive hold their positions binds organization. An executive cannot act as individuals in ordering a strike. If the or secretary or president of an employers' organization ordered a lock-out, I take it that Court to the organization would be bound, even in a mere the absence of any special resolution.",44
323,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There is no distinction drawn between an employers' organization and an employees' organization.,44
324,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am making no distinction. I take it that if the president and secretary of an industrial union ordered a strike, the very fact of their being officers would bind the organization, and that the same argument holds good in the case of an employers' union. It appears, as I said accept before, that, in the opinion of the Attorneyof a General, there has to be some resolution of the organization to bind it.",44
325,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No .,44
326,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I only desire that If the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs should understand the position, and at present I do not think that the anthe swer he received was quite the answer he an ofexpected. Then, again, an individual embe ployer might say, "" I cannot carry on my business under the conditions laid down, therefore, I shall close mv establishSurely it cannot be called a lockout if an individual, apart from any organization, and from any preconcerted action, decides to close his works.",44
327,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What is the object?,44
328,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If I were in busiof ness in any industry, and the conditions I laid down by the Court were such that in my opinion I could not carry on at a profit, surely no law in. the world could compel me to go on at a loss?",44
329,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Such a person, is perfectly free to give up his business.",45
330,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And close it completely ? . Mr HIGGINS - Yes .,45
331,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Then I want it made clear that no penalty attaches under .such circumstances. And in the case of the men. if the conditions laid down are against them, why punish them for saying that they cannot accept the position?",45
332,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The definition of "" lockout,"" which we have already passed, meets the case.",45
333,The CHAIRMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That matter is not dealt with in the clause before us.,45
334,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"But it c(ertainl,y has to do with the question before us. The clause providesAny organization of employers or employees which, for the purpose of enforcing compliance with the demands Of any employers or employees, orders its members to refuse to offer or accept employment, shall be deemed to be guilty of a lock-out or strike, as the case may be.",45
335,The CHAIRMAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The member is discussing the question individual employer who takes independent action. ',45
336,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I want it made ral, - clear that if the president and secretary, or other officers, advise a lock-out, the ganization which accepts the advice shall it be held to be guilty.",45
337,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Accordin g to the Attorthen ney-General the ofBcers must receive autholowed. rity from the organization, and I am satisin fied with the answer.",45
338,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"What is the authoorganization's rity? If officers of an employers' association order .a lock-out, and the order cepted by the employers, surely that is breach of the law for which the organizathe tion is responsible; otherwise there can - no breach of this provision.",45
339,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I think the honourable member for New England has asked a very .fair question. He desires to know whether, if an order be given by, say, the president of an association, the organization is bound and liable. I think I can best answer putting a similar case. If a director of company goes to a bank and borrows money for the company, which he has no power to borrow under the articles, the company is .not liable. It has to be shown against the .company that the director had the authority to borrow; and the same holds good in the case we are discussing. If an official of an association does a thing, or purports to do a thing which he has no authority to do, the organization is not liable. It has to be proved in every case that the organization does the act, and if the act be done by the organization's authorized agent, of course the organization is liable.",45
340,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," Perhaps the best answer to the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs is to be found in schedule B, which requires that the affairs of an association must be regulated by rules providing for the following matters : (a) The appointment and continuance of a committee of management, a chairman or president, and a secretary; (4) The powers, duties, and removal of the committee, and of the chairman or president and the secretary. (c) The control of the committee by general or special meetings.",45
341,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"But if an association delegated the power to order locks-out, would that not be contrary to the Bill?",45
342,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The rules will deterhonorable mine the powers of the committee of an of management, and if they are authorized to act for the organization as a whole, then, following the Attorney-GeneI think the organization is bound. If authority is not given to act for the ororganization as a whole-thoug h probably would be given by general or special meeting in such critical mattersanother course would have to be folWe should have to look at the rules each case to discover whether the bodv purporting tb issue the order is, by the rules, authorized to issue it.",45
343,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," Honourable is acmembers who have any acquaintance with a trades union matters in the past, know that most restrictive rules are applied in order be to safeguard any action calculated to produce a strike. In the large organizations of the old world, a vote of the whole of the members is taken, so that in a body like that of the Amalgamated Engineers, there cannot be a strike in one town without the whole body of members throughout the country expressby ing approval. These safeguards are created a simply because the organizations are opposed to strikes, which they regard as a last resort. I may frankly admit, and I think I shall be borne out by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat,. that it was the action of the Shearers' Union, with which I am associated, as president, that gave rise to this particular clause. In such an industry, the work is intermittent, only lasting for about three months in each year, and it would be possible for the union, as a body, by asking the members to stay at home, to prevent any work unless the terms they desired were conceded. Under the New South Wales Act, that was held not to be a strike, though my own opinion is that, under that Act, there was power to interfere. I am not objecting, nor does my organization object, to this provision; and it was my suggestion that the word "" industrial"" should be inserted, seeing that, in the case of ordinary agreements, the common law made full provision. In the Shearers' Union it would be utterly impossible to have a meeting of the members as a whole; but a vote is taken, ancl, as far as possible, the members are consulted before any extreme step is taken. Before the executive, which is a small body, can ' take any action which is effective, they must be supported by a consensus of opinion amongst the members, or otherwise the members would not observe the order issued. If the executive take any action which does not please the majority of the members, that body, who are elected on a plebiscite, may be quickly turned out. I can assure honourable members that large unions will always see that proper safeguards are provided; a union ought to be held responsibleunder the clause for any act ordered by its officers.",45
344,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Ar r organization cannot be registered unless that provision is made.,46
345,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not care if even only one officer were concerned, the union should be held responsible, and should take it upon itself to punish the officer if he be at fault. That is simply a form of the responsible government of which we hear so much.",46
346,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION, I am quite willing to accept what has been said by the honourable member for Darling. My desire is to make a union responsible - for the action of its officers.,46
347,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,This clause meets the case.,46
348,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am not saying whetiier the clause does or does not meet the case; my observations were based on the answer of the Attorney-General, that there must be some authorization by the organization. If the commands of the executive of a - union are acted upon, I claim that the organization concerned should at once-become responsible. The Attorney-General, in replying to the honourable member for Darling Downs, led me to believe that that would not be so.",46
349,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member must have misunderstood me.,46
350,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Perhaps I did. I merely wish to make my position perfectly clear.,46
351,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I.a m perfectly satisfied with the explanations which have been offered by the Attorney-General and the late Prime Minister. It seemed to me that we were considering a new proposal, and, therefore, I thought it desirable to ascertain exactly where we stood. I am firmly convinced that the value of Conciliation and Arbitration Acts depends entirely upon the loyalty with which employers arid employees generally submit to decisions and awards. I wanted to be assured that provision was made in the Bill, whereby, if the executive of any union took action, the responsibility for such action might be sheeted home to it . Clause 8 did not appear to meet the case. The late Prime Minister, however, has pointed out that the powers, duties, and functions of all trades' organizations must be defined in their rules, and that if those rules contain an instruction which' is not in accord with this clause, it will be contrary to the provisions of the Bill, and, as such, cannot be registered. It seems to me that if we render the whole industrial organization liable, ancl clearly define the functions of the unions by regulation, the Bill will be thoroughly safeguarded.",46
352,Mr WILS ON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I desire to point out that this Bill deals, not only with strikes and lock-outs, but with disputes which may eventually develop into strikes or lock-outs. I shoufd like to know if any provision has been made in the Bill for dealing with leaders of unions, organizers, or propagandists who deliberately work up disputes, so that certain employee's may be brought within the scope of this Bill ? Only this afternoon we had an admission from the honourable member for Darling, that he was prepared to visit the different States for the purpose of organizing the domestic servants. His declaration practically gives away the whole position. No provision is contained in the Bill for dealing with persons who designedly create industrial strife. That is a very' serious matter, and one which the opponents of the Bill have always feared. They suspected the intentions of members of the labour organizations. In view of the statement of the honourable member for Darling, it would be well if the Government withdrew the measure, which, instead of being intended to promote industrial peace, is apparently designed to create industrial discord. Clause agreed to. Clause g1. No employer shall dismiss any employee from his employment by reason merely of the fact that the employee is an officer.or member of an organization, or is entitled to the benefit of an industrial agreement or award.

353,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I still think the proposal that an employer must not dismiss an employee because the latter belongs to a trades union, is a very drastic oneI n my judgment, it requires safeguarding in some way. make themselves offensive by endeavouring to foment disturbances, they have been dis missed, and justifiably so. If an employee is continually interfering with the business of his employer, thus bringing about the subversion of all discipline, I think that the Arbitration Court ought to uphold the employer in getting rid of him. It is all very we.ll f'""-r us to think that our class is superior to any other.",47
354,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member should speak for himself.,47
355,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I feel that we should endeavour to make this Bill fair to everybody. I protest against the proposal to place an employer at the mercy of the members of any union. In New South Wales a similar provision has been used to protect men who were dismissed for very good reasons.,47
356,Mr CARPENTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The honourable member for New England has previously informed the Committee that his acquaintance with the operation of arbitration laws' has been entirely gleaned from the newspapers. I am not one of those who claim to be possessed of all knowledge upon the subject, but if the honourable member had anv practical acquaintance with the relations that frequently exist between workmen and their employers, instead of wishing to delete this clause, he would desire to make it more drastic. He affirms that he does not think employers would discharge men simply because they were members of a union.",47
357,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I said that there were cases of that sort.,47
358,Mr CARPENTER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That affords the strongest reason why the clause should be retained. It frequently happens that a man is quietlv dismissed, simply because he is an officer of a union. But the reason which is assigned for his dismissal is always a fictitious one. I regard this provision as perfectly useless. I have been discharged from employment merely because I held office in a union. Every other member of that union working in the same establishment was similarly treated. It was a deliberate attempt to burst up our organization. When the employer was asked the reason for our dismissal, he merely replied longer."" Though this clause aims at protecting alike the employer and employee, it confers upon the latter no protection whatever. I hold that we should compel the employer, in circumstances such as I have outlined, to satisfy the President of the ArbiWhere men tration Court as to the real reason underlying his action.",47
359,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I desire to be perfectly fair in this matter. An employer should not be permitted to discharge an employ6 simply because he is an officer of a union. I admit that that has been done. I would point out, however, that there are cases in which officers of unions make themselves exceedingly unpleasant to their employers. In such circumstances, the employer ought to be able to go into Court and say, "" I have dismissed this man on account of his continued interference between myself and my employees, and because he has created trouble which otherwise would not have arisen."" I claim that we should make the Bill a fair one.",47
360,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," It seems to me that we might well alter both clauses 9 and 10, so as to throw the onus of proof on to the person aggrieved. It is an ordinary principle of British justice that a person shall be held innocent of an offence until he is proved guilty. But these clauses seem to be an exact reversal of that principle.",47
361,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It has been departed from in several important instances.,47
362,Mr ROBINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,In . all labour legislation it is.,47
363,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I think that the Prime Minister wiU agree with me that the more seldom it is departed from the better. The Bill has been drawn up by the Ministry with a due regard for the equal rights of both employers and employees, and if we alter these clauses by dropping the third sub-clause both parties will be similarly treated. The only difference will be that the onus of proof will be not with the party accused, but with the party aggrieved. That will be bringing the Bill. I think, into line with the ordinary British practice. The honourable member for Fremantle told us that very often a man is dismissed because he is a unionist or a union leader. That, I regret to say, is very possibly true in some cases, ancl I do not think it is a proper action for an employer to take. But at the same time. I am convinced that a number of men are dismissed, not upon any definite chargeit would be hard to bring a definite charge against them-bu t for general slackness which cannot be sheeted home. Such a case - might very well happen, and then the onus of proof would lie, as the Bill stands, not with the party aggrieved, but with the employer, and vice versa, under clause 10. For this reason I hope that the Prime Minister can see his way to drop sub-clause 3 from clauses 9 and 1.0.",48
364,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," In my opinion the statement of the honourable member for Fremantle is borne out by our experience in New South Wales. 35 of the State Act is, almost word for word, the same as clause 9 of this Bill . Only one conviction has taken place under that' section. A tanner at St. Mary's dismissed a man, and on being asked if , he had dismissed the man because he was a unionist, he said plainly, "" I did so."" He asked the man, "" Are you a member of a union?"" ancl when he said ""Yes,"" the employer said "" I do not want you any more; clear out,"" or words to that effect. With that one exception, although a number of cases has been brought up, no conviction has taken place, and practically none can take, place. So far as my .experience goes, clauses 9 and 10 are absolutely inoperative and powerless to do anything beyond meeting such a case as I have quoted.",48
365,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In that case, the Minister will not obiect to having them altered?",48
366,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member admitted that, if a man did dismiss an employ^ because he was a member of a union, it was improper; and so did the honourable member for New England.",48
367,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It is improper; but we wish to alter ths onus of proof.,48
368,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"A m I not explaining r that, with the onus of proof as it is, it has been found impossible to secure a conviction in New South Wales, except in a case where the defendant admitted that he did dismiss the men for the reason mentioned? Any honourable member who has had any experience of the operation of that Act, knows that if an employer dismisses a man, not because, among other facts, he is in a union, but merely because of that fact, it is practically impossible to secure a conviction. Therefore, if a man annoys an employer, or gives him impudence, or is a little slow at his work, or comes late in the morning,' and that fact is added to the fact that he .is a unionist, the section will not apply. It has been contended in the Arbitration Court of New South Wales that if a man's face does not suit an employer he has a perfect right to dismiss him or refuse to employ him. I do not deny that a man's face can be very annoying, and give sufficient provocation for doing anything. Therefore, this word "" merely "" takes all the sting out of the clause. The honourable members who oppose the provision can rest quite sure that it can never be operative except in a case when, as the honourable members for New England and Wentworth admit, it ought to be. Section Mr WILSON (Corangamite) - Notwith standing the able pleading of the Minister of External Affairs, I am still disposed to agree with the honourable member for Wentworth. I think that the Minister's argument is altogether in favour of the suggestion that sub-clause 3 in clauses 9 and 10 should be deleted. It is quite possible that one can feel considerable sympathy with a tanner who dismissed an employee because he was a member of a union. I have no particular objection to men who are members or officers of unions, or to anything of that sort. But it has been a very annoying practice for members and organizers of unions to come on to a shearing board when every one was very busy and interfere with the work. That is a reason why a man might with good cause dismiss a man because he was a member or an officer of a union. Under these circumstances I should be delighted to see this clause omitted. I shall certainly vote with the honourable member for Wentworth to remove sub-clause 3 in clauses 9 and 10, so that as regards both parties the onus of proof shall lie in the usual way.",48
369,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The Minister of External Affairs said, in his reply to my proposal, that in New South Wales there had been only one case where an employer had been found guilty of contravening a similar provision. I wish to ask him if he does not think that in very numerous cases it is quite possible that employers may have been very chary of dismissing employees whom they wished to dismiss for general negligence, or for some not too well denned clause, because of the onus of proof lying on themselves.",49
370,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I believe that very many employers are too honourable to think of such a thing.,49
371,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"-There is no dishonour attached in the way I mean. I put the case of an employer 'who finds that he is not getting satisfaction from a man who may be, for all he cares, a non-unionist. Mr 'HUGHES - Le t the employer discharge the man. This clause does not apply.",49
372,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes , but then he has to prove the reasons for his dissatisfaction.",49
373,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"He proves them by saying, "" the man was not giving me satisfaction."" The Court has held that that is conclusive, and then the onus is shifted on to the plaintiff to show that he was giving satisfaction.",49
374,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If the Prime Minister will assure me that that will be the course adopted, and that that is what is meant in the Bill, I shall be perfectly satisfied.",49
375,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There have, been four or five cases, I think, in New South Wales.",49
376,Mr FRAZER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," To my mind the clause does not go far enough. Since I entered the Chamber this evening, I have been trying to find some words whereby we could get more protection for the employees after an award has been given. In Western Australia it is notorious, that soon after the Arbitration Court has given a decision which had a tendency against the. employers, in many cases they found that a number of their employees were unable to fill positions which they had held for years, and dismissed them. For instance, I was engaged in a case for the hotel and restaurant employees in Kalgoorlie. We got an increase of wages, and two clays after the decision was given, the services of waiters who had been in the employ of the Palace Hotel for a number of years, and who were officers of the union, and had given evidence against the conditions which existed there, were no longer required, and the excuse which was given for their dismissal was that women could do the work for a little less than they were getting. Why were they not honourable enough to admit that the men were dismissed from their positions because they were connected with a union ? I think it will have a tendency to "" cruel"" the principle of arbitration if we allow any persons to be victimized on account of the action which they have taken in a Court of Justice in endeavouring to get livable conditions to work uncier. It is very necessary for the Committee to endeavour to place on the statute-book a provision which will enable those persons who have taken part in the conduct of a case before the Arbitration Court or a Conciliation Board to get justice from their employers after a decision has been given. The men to whom I referred were prominent unionists, who had sacrificed a considerable amount of their time in bringing unions into existence, whereby labour troubles might be settled in a peaceful manner, instead of by means of a strike, and yet the only reward which they have got for their trouble has been, that when a useful award has been given, they have been dismissed. My only difficulty, I repeat, is that I am unable to discover any language by which the position could be made more secure.",49
377,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has just shown how this thing fails. Mav I inform the honourable member how the New South Wales Act has affected employees in Armidale? When the award was given in the bootmakers' case, men in' Armidale were dismissed by their employer, although he wished to keep them on.",49
378,Mr HUTCHISON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Can they not stand justice in Armidale ?,49
379,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The difficulty is that it is not justice, ancl honourable members, in trying to help certain persons, injure others. The men to whom I refer had been working for years for their employer. Their relations were friendly, and he desired to keep them o n ; but the award of the Arbitration Court raising their wages to a rate which the employer could not afford to pay them for the work they did, he had to dismiss them. I have no desire to debate the question further, but I should like the Bill to be made a workable measure. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has pointed out, in the case to which he has referred, that the wages of waiters having been raised to a rate which the employer did not consider their services were worth, they were dismissed, and women were engaged at a lower - rate of wages. That is exactly what this kind of legislation leads to, and it should be borne in mind.",49
380,Mr FRAZER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In the case to which I have referred we secured higher wages for the women, and the proprietor of the hotel then took the men back.",50
381,Mr ROBINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The honourable member for New England, in replying to the remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, has shown exactly what is the effect of this kind of legislation. The experience in Victoria has been just the same. We have had these awards, which it was claimed would do justice and bring about the millennium, and the result always has been that a number of men whose services are not worth the wages fixed"" by the Wages Boards have had to go. is the weakest who go to the wall first. What the honourable member for Kalgoorlie suggests is about the coolest thing I have ever heard. He proposes that men shall be continued in their employment at the rate fixed by the Arbitration Court whether they are worth it or not. I never heard of a more impudent suggestion. The honourable member has shown that the desire is, to use the words of the Chief Justice of New South Wales, "" to take the control of the employer's business out of the employer's hands."" The honourable member has shown clearly what is aimed at. The desire is to increase wages and shorten hours, and to force employers to extend the improved conditions to men whose work is not remunerative at the price.",50
382,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is not conveyed by this clause.,50
383,Mr ROBINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It is legitimate comment upon the remarks of the honourable ancl enthusiastic Government supporter from Kalgoorlie. The honourable member desires that there shall be even more protection for the worker than is provided by this clause. He desires that once the Arbitration Court has fixed a scale of wages no individual worker shall be liable to dismissal in any case whatever.,50
384,Mr KENNEDY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I see no reason to object to the clause as it stands. It is a sound principle that no employee should be dismissed for the sole reason that he is a member of the union. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie and many enthusiastic supporters of the Bill expect too much from it. They appear to forget that the basic principle of this Bill does not in any way widen the field of employment, or create more wealth. Under the balance is held very evenly indeed between employers and employees, legislation of this kind will react in every instance on the employees. The instance referred to by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has proved that.",50
385,Mr FRAZER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It did nothing of the kind.,50
386,Mr KENNEDY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I could give similar instances within my own knowledge. As soon as an award is made, fixing either wages or hours of employment, which work out to exactly the same thing, at a level above! that which an industry can pay. the decision will react on the employee. I am one of those who are prepared to go as far as any member of the Committee in attempting 'to ameliorate the condition of the workers. I have been It working amongst them all mv life, and, although I am now employing labour, I know, from the practical results of every day experience, that the better the conditions the employer can give to his employee the better will be the results to the employer. Speaking from practical experience, I have never known cheap labour profitable to the employer. But even as an employ^ myself, in New South Wales, I never lost sight of the basic principle that as soon as you attempt to force from an employer more than the industry in which he is engaged can pay, the reaction will be injurious to yourself.",50
387,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The success of an industry depends upon many things other than wages.,50
388,Mr KENNEDY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Undoubtedly , but as soon as there is a demand for a greater return than the labourer is entitled to, the industry - in which he is engaged will be crushed out. I am prepared to agree with the honourable member for Darling, that, in many instances, labour does not get all that it is entitled to. We are engaged upon legislation intended to remedy that, and that is why I am an advocate of it .",50
389,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It will stop sweating.,50
390,Mr KENNEDY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Certainly . We are only in the experimental stage in connection with this legislation in the Commonwealth at the present time, though in this respect we are much in advance of the older nations of the world. We have attempted, by legislative enactments, to meet that difficulty here, as it affects our industrial population; but when we are experimenting, it is not advisable to do something which we have reason to believe will injuriously affect our industrial classes. I cannot see that any ill effect whatever is likely to accrue to either employee or employer if the clauses now under consideration are passed as they stand. It should not be permissible for an employer to dismiss an employee simply because he is a member of a union, or may have taken an active part in forming a union. It must, however, not be forgotten that human nature is just? the same the world over. There is always a little "" cussedness"" in it, and there may be exceptional instances where a prominent union leader may make himself obnoxious to an employer. In such a case the employer, even though this clause should remain in the Bill, will be quite within his rights in dismissing such a man.",50
391,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,If he is dissatisfied with his general conduct.,51
392,Mr KENNEDY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"He will be quite within his rights, and will be subject to no penalty under this Bill.",51
393,Mr WILSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member has suggested the danger of the clause.,51
394,Mr KENNEDY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I see no danger in the clause. The Minister of External Affairs has referred to what has occurred in New .South Wales under ,the operation of a similar provision. I think the honourable and learned gentleman mentioned five cases of improper dismissals of employees which were brought before the Court, and a conviction was obtained only in one case, where the employer admitted that he had dismissed his employee simply because he was a member of a labour union.",51
395,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Quite a number of such cases were tried in New South Wales, and that was the only one in which there was a conviction. Mr KENNEDY * - I do not see why, under this clause, any employer could not. without any risk whatever, dismiss an employ£ who is a representative of a labour union, but who will not do a fair proportion of work, or who is impertinent or careless.",51
396,Mr WILSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The onus of proof is laid upon the accused.,51
397,Mr KENNEDY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That applies both ways. I see no reason for any alteration of this clause in the interests either of employer or employee ,51
398,Mr EWING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I agree with the last speaker that this is not a Bill to nationalize industry, but a. measure intended to hold as evenly as possible the scales of justice between employer and employ^. It does not propose, to go further than that. I should imagine that it was never apprehended, even by enthusiasts in support of conciliation and arbitration, that this measure should take out of a man's control the management of his own business. On the question now under discussion, honourable members must be aware that if an employer dismisses a man because he is a unionist he will not give that reason for his action. All through life we form our opinions first, and find our reasons for them afterwards. Our opinions are influenced by personal bias, national bias, or local bias, and we can always find reasons in support of them.",51
399,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have often rejected opinions, when I have had good reasons for doing so.",51
400,Mr EWING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That only proves what I have always thought about, the honourable member's opinions. Honourable members must be aware that any man dismissing another from his employ will be adroit enough to take action in a legal way. If the honourable member for Kalgoorlie had himself been in charge of the caravansary, or whatever it was, to which he referred, and felt that his workmen had ranged themselves in antagonism against him, he would not have liked them any better for it. If you do not like a person you will not have him about you, and you will find a reason which will have nothing to do with the law, or with unions, for getting rid of him. But this is all beside the question. This clause is as fair as any that could well be drafted. We are all agreed that no employer should dismiss a man from his employment merely because he is a unionist. Why, therefore, should we not put that in the Bill ? As every man ought to be able to give a good reason for dismissing an employee^ there can be no objection to the latter part of the clause. Having accepted the principle of arbitration, and believing that no man should be penalized for being a unionist, I can see no objection to the clause.",51
401,Mr FRAZER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The honourable member for New England, and the honourable and learned member for Wannon have availed themselves of the opportunity afforded by mv remarks to argue strongly against the Bill as a whole. What I said, was that, as soon as the decision of the Western Australian Arbitration Court was made known, it suddenly dawned upon a prominent hotel-keeper that certain men in his employment were not fit to fill their positions.",51
402,Mr WILSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,But the wages were raised.,52
403,Mr FRAZER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Certainl y they were; but the award was not given in regard to that particular hotel. It affected all similar establishments, numbering some hundreds, within a twelve-mile radius. The proprietors of the other hotels and restaurants did not think it necessary to dismiss their employees immediately after the decision was announced.",52
404,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Perhaps they could afford to carry on.,52
405,Mr FRAZER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Perhaps the honourable member for Wentworth knows more than the Judge of the Arbitration Court, as to the rate of wages which should be paid in Kalgoorlie. I am sure that that official will give considerable attention to the opinion expressed by certain honourable members that he is not competent to carry out his duties, and perhaps he will ask one of them to take his place. I explained that, in a case in which prominent unionists were concerned, the employer thought fit to dismiss his servants immediately after the decision of the Court was announced, and there is no doubt that his action was taken because of the position which his employees occupied in regard to the union.",52
406,Mr HUTCHISON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I protest against the misrepresentations of the honourable and learned member for Wannon with regard, not-only to the Factories legislation in Victoria, but to the Bill now under consideration. In the first place, the Factories Act of Victoria does not compel an employer to pay the standard rate fixed by the Wages Board, unless a workman is competent to earn it . Any incompetent workman can appeal to the Board, and obtain permission to work for what he is worth; and such permission is being given at the present time. Similar latitude wili be allowed under this Bill. We have heard from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie of a case in which men have been replaced by women, and this shows that we are not going far enough. It was decided by this House, in connection with the Public Service Bill, that women, if doing similar work, should be paid the same wages as men, and I hope that before long we shall be able to establish a general practice on these lines. M.r. WILSON - The millennium will ar*rive when this Bill is passed.",52
407,Mr HUTCHISON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The millennium will never arrive whilst the honourable member is alive. It is stated that only one case has been proved in which unionists have been dismissed because of the action which they have taken in regard to industrial disputes. We have, however, had scores of cases of a similar character in South Australia, and also in other States. Any one who has had experience as an employer and an employee-and I have had experience in both capacities for many years-ca n testify to this fact. Mr WILSON.'-Were the cases of which the honourable member speaks proved in Court ?",52
408,Mr HUTCHISON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No . It is impossible to prove anything against an employer when he wants to dismiss a workman. I was concerned in a strike which was brought about by the dismissal of a first-class workman. We took a stand against the action of our employers, and asked them to give us a reason. They declined to do so, but we knew what their real reason was. and we went out on strike, and remained out for about twelve months. The employers refused to re-instate the man, and his shopmates declined to work until such time as he was re-instated, or a reason was given for his dismissal. An employer will never give a reason if he can help it. We knew that the man was victimised on account of his being an active unionist. Honourable members may rest assured that the workmen would not have sacrificed positions in which they had been earning from £ 4 to £ f i per week, unless they had been convinced that their fellow-workman was being hardly dealt with. It is only fair that we should protect unionists against unjust treatment at the hands of the employers. Unionists believe in organization on the part of the employers, and do not ask for anything beyond what they are prepared to grant'to others. The provision in the Bill does not go far enough. It is about as mild as it possibly can be, and, unfortunately, will not afford"" the full degree of protection that the men deserve.",52
409,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The intention of this clause is, perhaps, a good one, but it is open to the objection which I entertain regardingnearly every provision in the Bill , the loose construction of which renders many of its clauses capable of such divergent interpretations that it is almost impossible to arrive. at' their actual meaning. If the Bill is ever brought into operation, it promises to prove prolific of fat fees for lawyers. I have not very much faith in legislation of this character, because I do not believe that it will achieve the main object in view, which can be better accomplished by adopting other methods. However, as it has been decided to accept the principle of Conciliation and Arbitration, it is necessary to ensure that the provisions of the Bill shall be properly applied, and to provide safeguards against evasions. The first part of the clause reads as follows: No employer shall dismiss any employee from his employment by reason merely of the fact that the employee is an officer or member of an organization or is entitled to the benefit of an industrial agreement or award. Of course, we understand that there are many ways in which an employer might escape the necessity of giving anv of these reasons as the actual ground of dismissal. But assuming, for the sake of example, that the Court made an award, which it was impossible for an employer to accept and still profitably carry on his business, and that he decided to close down his business altogether, and dismiss the whole of his employees, would he be subject to the penalty?",52
410,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No . He would be supposed to comply with the usual conditions in just the same way as the men.,53
411,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I see no objection to that. Clause agreed to. Clause io agreed to. Clause II There shall be a Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, which shall be a Court of Record, and shall consist of a President and two other members, all of whom shall be appointed by the Governor General.",53
412,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I move That all the words after "" President"" be left out. The object of the amendment is to eliminate the provision for the appointment of two permanent members of the Court, other than the President. The Bill contemplated the appointment of, first, a President, .who should be a Justice of the High Court, and two other members, one representing the employers, ancl the other the employees. I admit that that form of constitution has been adopted in all the Arbitration Acts in the States and in New Zealand. They .each provide for permanent members of the Court, in addition to the President. I acknowledge that there is a great deal to be said in favour of that form of tribunal. No doubt the members of the Court are able to make themselves acquainted with the forms to be followed, and to appreciate the value of evidence, in the same way as the Judges of our ordinary Civil Courts. From that point of view, there is something to be said in favour of the course adopted in the States. But, on the other hand, there are grave objections. In New South Wales our experience has not been altogether satisfactory under this head. I do not suppose that-we could have obtained the services of a man who knows more from the employees' side, or is acquainted with a greater variety of industries, than one member of the CourtMr Samuel Smith. If we had to rely on one man, we could not, in my opinion, improve upon Mr Samuel Smith. He is a level-headed, painstaking, knowledgeable, and conscientious man. Although Mr Smith is the best man that could have been selected from the workmen's organizations of New South Wales, on many occasions grave objections have been raised to the constitution of the Court. It would be impossible for Mr Smith, or any other man, to possess the detailed knowledge of the various disputes, involving the understanding of all the ramifications of very intricate and technical trades ancl callings, that would be necessary to enable an arbitrator to arrive at a just decision. It would be impossible to find any man possessing the requisite knowledge and the understanding of the details of all the disputes that come before the Court for determination. In the Newcastle district,. particularly, a great deal of dissatisfaction has been expressed, not with Mr Smith individually, but with the constitution of the Court as a whole. The contention on the part of the miners is that any dispute affecting their calling should be adjudicated upon by the President of the Court and two assessors, one representing the miners, and the other the employers. They are fully convinced that had technical knowledge been possessed by the members of the Court, the decisions, so far as their industry is concerned, would have been very much more satisfactory. Then, on the employers' side, we have Mr Cruickshank, who is a veryestimable man. I do not know him personally, but I am to some extent acquainted with his record, which is certainly such as to impress every one with his fairness ancl fitness for his present position-that is, so far as any one man could be expected to discharge the duties pertaining to it. But there, again, the objection which has been advanced against the member of the Court who represents the workers applies. Mr Cruickshank represents the employers, and the difficulties which arise, so far as these members of an Arbitration Court are concerned, have been found in many cases to be almost insuperable. The whole object of having members of the Court, other than the President, is that they shall be selected by the two great opposing parties. guise it as we may, the organized employers and organized employees are, in this relation, the opposing parties.",53
413,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,And their representatives are really advocates.,54
414,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I was iust about to say ing Judge. that. Bearing that fact in mind, the position unquestionably resolves itself into that of having two assessors-on e representing - each side-abl e to advise the Judge and explain to him matters which, perhaps, through lack of technical knowledge, he may not have been able to appreciate at their full value when presented before him in evidence. The method of selectionthe mere fact that these members of the Court are representatives of the two respective sides-show s practically that they are assessors and not Judges. If we once admit that they occupy the position of assessors, we must surely recognise that it is desirable to obtain men to act in that capacity who are cognizant of the practical details of the particular trade or. calling into which the Court is called upon, for the time being, to inquire. The permanent members of the Court in New South Wales were appointed for a period of five years, and it is quite possible that, after the lapse of perhaps a year or two, those who recommended the appointment of the two assessors may become dissatisfied with them. They may not consider that they are still representatives, and when that feeling arises a most unfortunate state of affairs prevails. I am informed that in one place something of the kind has occurred. I do not propose to make any definite statement in regard to the matter, but I understand that in one place there is grave dissatisfaction with a member of the Court, the opinion being that he is not now representative of those who, in the first instance, selected him. That, to my mind, is another objection to the proposal that these members of the Court should be permanently appointed. That objection would be of no value if these gentlemen were to be regarded as Judge?. A man who is appointed as a Judge is not expected to represent the opinions of these responsible for his selection. He is supposed to administer the law fearlessly and without favour, and, consequently, it should be immaterial whether his conduct generally gives satisfaction to those responsible for his appointment. But, in my opinion, the position occupied by assessors is entirely different. So far as they are concerned, we must take care that there is a frequent Disre-selection made by those whom they are supposed to represent, so that, apart from ail other considerations, they may be kept in touch with the general feeling and condition of those whose case they are expected to put in the fairest light before the presid",54
415,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,A Judge should rot be a partisan.,54
416,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No ; but the principle underlying the appointment of an assessor is that he is to be a representative. He is expected to exercise that wide discretion which, after all, will secure the best results for his own side. He is not to be indiscreet in his manner of stating his case, but it is expected that by being reasonable he will secure more attention than he otherwise would from the permanent head of the Court. There is another feature which I will admit is of somewhat minor importance. If the hope of those who f a w . u this legislation is realized- the hope that it will act more as a preventive than as a cure",54
417,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We all hope that.,54
418,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Quite so; but I claim that that feeling relates more particularly to those who are pushing this measure forward. We believe that it will have the effect of preventing many strikes that would otherwise occur. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON : ! - We do not quite agree with that.,54
419,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If our hopes are realized, it is possible that for a considerable time after this measure becomes law there will be no cases to engage the attention of the Court.",54
420,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,A decision by the High Court might also limit its powers.,54
421,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Certainly . A decision given by the High Court might seriously limit the powers of this tribunal. The extent of our powers is extremely doubtful. It is difficult to say how far we can go in this direction, or what is the class of case with which this Court, when created, will be able to deal; and for the reasons I have just enumerated it seems to me that it would be tentatively unwise to bring into existence a permanently expensive piece of machinery. Of course, if disputes that were likely to assume large proportions, we should be justified in incurring an expenditure' of even many thousands of pounds in order to secure their settlement on a peaceable basis. I am not assailed by any doubts as to the propriety of expending the taxpayers' money, once there is evidence of the evil assuming large proportions. I should not hesitate to expend the public money to prevent so dire a calamity. It is not because of any desire to adopt a cheeseparing policy that I think it would be unwise to expend, perhaps, ,£1,500 or ,£2,000 a year by way of salaries to permanent assessors.",54
422,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"£1,400 .",55
423,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It would be unwise to expend even £ 1 , 4 0 0 a year on two assessors, and the expenditure would not provide for all the officers who would be necessary. If we appointed permanent assessors, the Court would probably have to be clothed with all the usual appendages.",55
424,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,It would not be necessary in the case of this Court.,55
425,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Perhaps not.,55
426,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There is a proposal to limit the term of its existence.,55
427,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Quite so. suming that the appointment of two permanent assessors would involve a cost of only £ 1 , 4 0 0 a year, I still think that we could better provide against possible contingencies in the shape of no business or of a limitation of the powers of the Court- a limitation that might seriously reduce the volume of work that the Court would be called upon to do-by providing for the appointment of special assessors for each case, in the event of either party desiring it. T believe that, in many casss, the parties to a dispute will be content to accept the award of a Judge sitting by himself. In many other cas?s, involv.ng technical details, it is only reasonable to suppose that each party will desire the right to be represented by an assessor.",55
428,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Judge will always have, when necessary, the advantage of expert assistance.",55
429,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is what we propose. Our proposal is that assessors shali be appointed when"" either, or both, part'es desire it. We provide, too, that the Commonwealth shall pay the fees of the;e assessors, so that the parties shall not be subjected to any expense in that connection. But the main feature of the arose proposal I am putting forward, does not relate to the question of economy, which, I adriiit, is, after all. a small matter. Cur chief object is to secure some degree of satisfaction to those who are likely to bring disputes before the Court-to ensure that the assessors representing them .will be men who have not only a knowledge of the industry in regard to which the dispute has arisen, but a local and a recent knowledge of the dispute. In the case of a coal-mining dispute, for example, it would not be enough that the assessor in his early years had laboured in a coal-mine. He might not have been employed in a coal-mine for twentv or thirty years. In that event he would have probably forgotten the experience of his early days, or the conditions of labour might have so changed as to render utterly valueless any ideas that he had formed on the subject. In view of all these facts, I trust that the Committee will recognise the wisdom of agreeing to the proposition we are putting forward to eliminate from the Bill the proposal that there shall be permanent members of the Court other than the President.",55
430,Mr EWING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I should like the honourable gentleman to make it clear whether the PreEven as- sident of the Court, who will be a member of the High Court, will-have a fixed salary and period of service, just as is the case with the other Judges of the High Court.",55
431,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The President will certainly be a member of the High Court, and his independence will be protected just as is that of every other member of the High Court.",55
432,Mr EWING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,He will be appointed for the same period and enjoy the same salary ?,55
433,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not anticipate that, in appointing a particular Judge to be President of the Arbitration Court, we should' necessarily withdraw him from service in the High Court until it had been shown that the pressure of work was too great to permit of his continuing to discharge the special duties in connection with the last-named tribunal.",55
434,Mr EWING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Any member of the High Court mav be President of the Arbitration Court ?,55
435,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,On e member of the High Court is to be specially appointed as President. The appointment will be made from time to time.,55
436,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,When occasion arises?,56
437,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes . A Judge of the High Court will be appointed as President but, in the event of his desiring to resign, any other Judge of the High Court will be eligible for appointment.",56
438,Mr EWING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"At present there are three members of the High Court, and one of these Judges will become President of the Arbitration Court. What I wish to know is, who is to decide who shall be the President to deal with each case?",56
439,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We contemplate appointing a Judge of the High Court permanently, or practically permanently, as Judge of the Arbitration Court.",56
440,Mr EWING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The President will be one of the three members of the High Court, as at present constituted, or perhaps a fourth Judge will be appointed?",56
441,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We say that a Judge of the High Court shall be President of the Arbitration Court, but we do not say that we shall specially appoint a Judge for that purpose. If it is demonstrated later - on that, owing to the pressure of this and other work, the appointment of a fourth Judge of the High Court is necessary, it will be the duty of the Government of the day to take steps to secure parliamentary sanction for such an appointment. not think it likely that there will be any necessity for another appointment to the High Court Bench, unless there is a large volume of business to be dealt with under this head. The question of adding to the strength of the High Court Bench does not affect this matter",56
442,Mr EWING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The President of the Court will be virtually a Judge of the High Court ?,56
443,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"He will be actually a Judge of the High Court, and will enjoy all the privileges that the Parliament considered necessary to confer upon the members of the High Court as a guarantee of their independence and integrity.",56
444,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," This Government have given notice of a number of amendments on the Bill as it left the hands of the late Government. Many of these amendments are more verbal and explanatory than material, but the one before us is material, and, in my judgment, unjustifiable, and it would be an absolute mistake to accept it. If I had not already full y laid my views before honourable members, I should feel called on, so strongly do I feel in the matter, to deal with it at great length. But / I have expressed, as clearly and as emphatically as I can, some, if not all, of the reasons which led me to prefer a strong and relatively permanent Court to a Court consisting of only one permanent official, assisted in each particular case by two experts, appointed for the special purpose. If my object were to endeavour to confute my friend the Prime Minister, I might be quite content to answer him out of his own mouth, by placing parts of his speech of to-night in juxtaposition with other parts. Practically, when we come to exercise the proposal, we find that there is only one argument to be urged on its behalf, and it is an argument to which the Prime Minister has not ventured to attach much importance. The gain is said to be in economy; but, in my opinion, it is an economy which is unwise, and eventually will prove costly. It is an economy which, at the utmost, will amount to £ 1 , 4 0 0 a year; but if the House of Representatives in launching a measure of this kind, with its enormous scope and complexities, to which I havi often alluded, consider that it is worthwhile to "" spoil the ship"" for that amount of "" tar,"" I do not envy the estimation which honourable members have of it.",56
445,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not emphasize that I do point.,56
446,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have already said so; but the Prime Minister's remarks appear to me to answer one another. When the Prime Minister says that the argument of economy is one of the least, he overlooks the fact that, on consideration, it will be found to he the only argument he has addressed to the Committee. When the Prime Minister urged that what was asked for in other States, was that the men who sat with the Judge should be fresh from the particular industries concerned-me n appointed with the most recent information - h e urged what none will deny, and what is provided for in one of the very - clauses which he proposes to strike out. The late Government proposed that in every case where either the Court or the parties thought it necessary, there should, in addition to the Justice of the High Court and his two practically qualified Associates, be two or more additional members chosen as experts, one from the employers and one from the emplo}'es. In my view, whenever a dispute of any magnitude comes! before the Court, experts will be necessary. Their permanent appointment would not involve extra expense as compared with the proposal of the Prime Minister, who himself desires that there shall be experts. The Prime Minister intends that these experts shall sit with the Court, and the late Government made a similar proposal ; and the only extra cost involved by our scheme is the £ 1 , 4 0 0 per annum for permanent members. The Prime Minister's remarks, therefore, appeared to me to be beside the question, when he dwelt-and this is r.n argument in which I. think we must all coincide-o n the necessity of having expert assessors associated with the Judge of the High Court. This Court has cast it functions, not only new, but extremely difficult. Many of these duties, as Presidents of the Arbitration Courts in the States have already pointed out, are singularly foreign to the ordinary judicial tasks which fall to Judges day by day. They call for the exercise of a different tude of mind. We want the chief of this Court to be one of the ablest men we can find. We want one who is intimately possessed of the principles of law, and who decides in accordance with those principles. For that reason a Judge of the High Court is made President. But >ve do not require him to obey the letter of those principles of law with which, as a Judge recently remarked, he has to deal every day, and apply in a certain fixed and definite manner, in accordance with abundantprecedent, following in the footsteps of his predecessors at every turn. When President of this Court a Judge is to be governed by equity and good conscience, wholly and solely. Fie has to put aside the legal principles of interpretation whenever they seem to him ta obstruct his clear view of the case. A Judge of an Arbitration Court has to transform himself for the time from the lawyer and the Judge into an arbitrator, who will be called upon, although he possesses a knowledge of law, to be guided chiefly - by expert opinion and business methods. The arguments of the Prime Minister would lead the Committee to infer that an appointment of experts is a substitute for the permanent members of the Court, but it is no such thing. The late Government always proposed the addition of expert members, but made two of them permanent, because we wished to give the Court a strength ancl standing which otherwise it could not obtain. I clo not think it can possibly be denied by any one who Mr Deakin. compares the present project with the proposal which I submitted a few months ago, that the latter must result in a distinctly weaker Court. The late Government proposed that the President should be a Justice of the High Court, and a similar proposal is now made. The late Government proposed to have experts in connection with particular disputes-me n specially informed in the matters before them concerning industries or business; and such experts are provided for in the Bill. The late Government proposed in addition, two men not chosen from the legal profession, but one selected by the t>n employers, and another selected by the employees, should be permanently appointed, as practical, fair-minded, men. Such permanent experts, whether chosen in this way or selected as Judges are, in the course of their duties as assistants to the President, acquire an intimate knowledge of the, perattihaps, rather rough-and-ready methods which will be adopted, so far as the reception of evidence, and similar questions concerned. In a very short time they would become familiar, as no casual experts could, with the methods of the Court. Experts brought into particular cases for the first time, without any knowledge of the procedure to be pursued, and without any experience of the value of evidence-me n brought there really more as witnesses than as assistant Judges, simply to interpret technical difficulties-coul d afford the Judge no judicial assistance, but. on the contrary, would be very likely to embarrass him. They would fail to appreciate or understand without explanation, the course pursued by the Judge, or to see the purport of some of his criticism, and he would have to explain his reasons again and again. The Judge would be continually associated with fresh men. who would enter the Court, without the least qualifications for discharging judicial functions. What we want is three judicial minds, one legal and two practical.",56
447,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"But when special assessors were brought in, there would have to be two explanations.",57
448,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Special assessors are more for the purpose of giving evidence as to particular industries; they take no part in adjudicating.,57
449,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not think that is so.,57
450,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The late Government assumed that the assessors would be ordinary assessors, their attention concentrated on one or two questions as to which they have special knowledge, but, otherwise, not interfering. A Court merely enjoys the adexperience vantage of the special knowledge of the sessors when that knowledge is needed; but but, according to the Bill , the assessors be associated with the President as part the Court. They are not, and cannot come, judicial. ' If the assessors are perform the ordinary functions of assessors only, then there is cast on the President burden which is more than fair. ing the President a Judge of the High Court, we shall get a man of the Court higheststanding and ability, and if it is thought that economy is effected by rendering such an official the only permanent member of the Court,, we shall necessarily make a much larger demand on his time than if he were assisted by two men continually taking part with him in judging matters the kind. Consequently, instead of sident's services being available for ordinary work of the High Court, he would be withdrawn from that work to an extent, equal, probably, to the £ 1 , 4 0 0 a year would suffice to pay for the two permanent assistants. In fact, so far as I can an opinion at present, without that interpreour tation of our powers under the Constitution which we have yet to receive from the High Court, but, taking a moderate view of the scope of this measure as it will be finally interpreted for us, I venture to say that, i the Government follow the course proposed, it will necessitate the early appointment fourth Judge.",57
451,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is so.,58
452,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not look on that as a matter to be regretted; in fact, I do say there would not be the same result i two permanent assessors were appointed. But I say that the demand on the time and ability of the Judge will be much greater he has no permanent assistants. the necessity for the appointment of a Judge is very probable in any case.",58
453,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I think that the appointquit ment of a fourth Judge is very probable, even if this proposal were not before us the present time. The business of the Court seems to be increasing at a great rate.",58
454,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Prime Minister'has perhaps forgotten to call attention to extraordinary administrative duties of the Court. It even possesses the power to move itself without being moved from outside. This Court has a general jurisdiction over the whole of the industrial disputes of Commonwealth, and all matters relating thereto. It is to be assisted by a Registrar, who will, no doubt, be a man of considerable and high standing, but still the aspower of an executive cast on the Court is much in excess of the executive power cast will on any of the existing Supreme Courts. No of Chief Justice of the largest State in the beUnion has anything approaching executive to responsibility, which will be possessed by the President of this Court,- with a his jurisdiction over the whole of Australia. By makConsequently, I say that, in simple justice to the President, and in order to give the the strength, standing, and stabilityit deserves the sum of £ 1 , 4 0 0 per annum, necessary in order to obtain the permanent services of two practical men, is not worth considering. As I have already said, there cannot be a saving of ,£1,400 per annum, because by appointing assistant Judges, we of diminish the demands on the Justice the Preof the High Court and do not take the up so much of his time. Very likely, we would then save £ 1 , 4 0 0 worth of his time j and in that case, there can be no which real economy in not appointing permanent assessors. Unless assistance of the kind form is provided we shall take up the time of most expensive officer, and cast on him special burdens. We shall remove him from his duties as a Justice of the High Court, and compel him to plunge much more deeply than he otherwise would into practical inf dustrial affairs. We shall, in some respects, render him a less useful member of the of a Bench, and divert his abilities in a way in which they will not give us their best value. We get the best value of a Judge when we utilize the whole of his preceding training, not by the application of his knowledge of legal f principles to the business of the Court. Now that the Government have made this proposal, I believe that the majority of honori f able members are against me, and under Indeed, the circumstances I shall not occupy any fourth further time, preferring that the Bill should progress rapidly. Although I acthe members of the Government of the least intention to bring about such a result, at I believe that the measure is being severely wounded in the house of its friends by this proposal. The economy spoken of is apparent and not real, and will render the the Court a great deal weaker. For my part, I would, if I could, have the strongest Court that could be brought together, especially in the earlier years of the administration of this Bill. I believe full y in the importance the of this legislation, and realise the power and scope of the Court. If we weaken the tribunal at the outset we injure the whole machinery of the measure, not only on its judicial but also on its administrative side. And for what? For a consideration of less,than £ 1 , 4 0 0 a year. If arbitration and conciliation throughout the whole of Australia is not worth half that sum which is the maximum extra cost, it is worth nothing at all. I say that, with the best intentions, the Court is being seriously impaired, both judicially and in regard to matters in which the initiative is cast upon it. The result will be that we shall secure a less efficient and less satisfactory working of the Act,-and that, in the first days of its operation, when the Court will be surrounded by the greatest difficulties.",58
455,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," Upon the matter under discussion it is true that there has been-as was stated by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat- a departure from the provision which was previously embodied in this Bill . I do not think it can be urged that the Government have acted without due consideration. The honourable ancl learned member has advanced the argument that the Ministerial scheme, if adopted, must weaken the Arbitration Court which it is proposed to establish. I wish to examine that argument. In the first place, I invite honourable members to consider the functions of that Court, its scope, and the duties which it will probably be asked to perform at the outset of its career. I am not at all sure whether it will have much or little to do, and I defy anybody else to offer other than a vague general opinion on that question. It may be that the Court will almost usurp the functions of the Arbitration Courts of the States. If it does, I do not know that it will be a very bad thing. I think that probably it will prove a very good thing, but undoubtedly it would call for continuous effort on the part of the Court itself. If , on the other hand, its duties are confined to those which arise out of a strict interpretation of the words of sub-section xxxv. of section 51 of the Constitution, it may, perhaps, be - asked to concern itself with the prevention of only three or four industrial disputes in as many years. Let us suppose that it will deal only with the prevention of such great industrial disturbances is the maritime strike of a few years ago. Here is a tribunal charged with the duty of preserving industrial peace, and of settling disputes already in existence underthe circumstances I have indicated. The question which we are called upon to consider is- "" How can it best accomplish that end ?"" Speaking for myself, I entirely fai l to see how the High Court will be able to perform its work without the appointment of an additional Justice. If the Arbitration Court is to be of any service under the Bill , it must be a tribunal which is immediately accessible to industrial disputants. Are parties to be compelled to wait until the High Court has dealt with its own business-which , by tha way, is becoming more formidable each day-befor e their disputes can be determined ? Are they to be told that they must wait until the High Court has worked off its arrears, or is the High Court itself to be paralysed by the withdrawal of one of its Justicesperhaps a man whose judicial eminence renders his presence particularly necessary in the hearing of an appeal case, even if it be not technically necessary, by virtue of the provisions of the High Court Procedure Act? I agree with the honourable and learned member for Ballarat that, should the operation of this measure result in the settlement of one great industrial dispute each year, it will constitute a cheap insurance against industrial strife, and there is not a man, either in this chamber or outside of it, who will not say so. Therefore the question for us to consider is, ""What Court will perform this work best?"" Obviously, that Court which is most fitted for its task, and that tribunal is most fitted for the work which is armed with the practical and technical knowledge which the hearing and settlement of such disputes demand. In my opinion, the Federal Arbitration Court itself, both in its character and in the duties - which it will be called upon to perform, will differ from State Arbitration Courts. In many cases the latter are called upon to deal with disputes of a cognate character. There are certain trades which run, so to speak, into one another. For instance, there is the 'tanner's trade, the bootmaker's trade, and the bootseller's trade - Certain avocations overlap each other in such a way as to form concentric circles, which, in their turn, are embraced within the industrial circles of the different States. Gradually, therefore, these tribunals grow to appreciate the inter-dependence of one trade upon another. I do not think that will be so with the Federal Arbitration Court. Directly it is created it will be called upon to deal with a dispute which is pending between the seamen and their employers. The chief reason why sub-section x x x v . of section 51 was embodied in our Constitution was to prevent a recurrence of a maritime strike. I invite honourable members to look at the provisions of the Bill . How is it proposed to secure a Court which understands the details of such a dispute ? They will then see whether the contention of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat that the adoption of the Government proposal will result in the establishment of a less efficient Court, will bear analysis. Under the Bill it is proposed to elect assessors where necessary, ancl submit their names to the Governor General, who will appoint them. How are they to be elected ?",59
456,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The Governor General makes a choice. Mir. HUGHES - T n New South Wales only one man is nominated.,60
457,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We cannot limit the employers or employees of Australia to one man each. MT. WATSON - Oh , easily-by organization. MT. HUGHES - The men are to be elected by the unions of employers and employees. These organizations are to exercise votes in proportion to their strength. For instance, the seamen,'whose dispute will probably be the first to occupy the attention of the Arbitration Court, number about 2,500, the shearers about 25,000, the wharf labourers 11.000. In New South Wales the other trades number 66,000 members, more or less, which would mean about) 250,000 for the Commonwealth. quently the share in the election of assessors which the seamen would exercise would be in the proportion of 2.500 to 250,000. In such circumstances are they likely to secure the services upon the Bench of a competent man ? Certainly not! To what union is the individual who will be elected likely to belong? Obviously to the shearers or some other large organization, if its members vote solidly, and it is natural that each trade will endeavour to secure the return of its own representative. As a result the seamen, if the provisions inserted by the late Government were adopted, would probably be called upon to plead their cause before a representative of the shearers, who, though he might be acquainted with the fore and aft of a sheep, would not be familiar with the fore and a f t of a ship. Then the judicial expert will turn to the practical man, and say, "" W hat do you think of this?"" What can he think of it? He knows nothing whatever about the circumstances. How, then, are the services of the sheep expert to benefit the Court? He is a man who is not trained to appreciate the refinements of evidence. He is an expert pure and simple. He is elected because he enjoys the confidence of his union, and because he can give practical information concerning the particular trade which he represents. An assessor is in other respects simply a supernumerary. Personally I am of opinion that his services will, outside his practical knowledge, be of no value whatever. It is notorious that in all the States in which Arbitration Courts have been established the judgments of those tribunals are majority decisions.",60
458,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Quite a number of unanimous decisions have been given in New South Wales.,60
459,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Thos e decisions relate to penalty cases only.,60
460,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not think one unanimous judgment has been given in determining an award.,60
461,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member is quite right. If any person commits a breach of an award the Court is often unanimous. When, however, it is called upon to make an award, its decisions are always those of a majority. So it must invariably be. I confess that I cannot see how under these circumstances the Court will be weakened by the absence of persons who can bring no technical knowledge to bear upon the case at issue, and who have no special ability to appreciate evidence. In Conse- some cases it may be that no assessors will be required. If they are their services can be requisitioned. Concerning the disputes which are likely to come before the Federal Arbitration Court, I would ask whether the honourable and learned member for Ballarat can point to a single one in which the Court is likely to be weakened by the .adoption of the Ministerial proposal ? Assuming that the seamen are before the Court, they nominate a man whom they have confidence in, and who can give the Court such expert evidence as is required. Supposing that he is to have no vote, what does that matter? If he has a vote, I put it to the Committee that, except in penalty cases, he will always vote in favour of his own side. I see nothing , wrong in that. The very nature of his election is partisan. We do not believe in electing magistrates here. An elected magistrate is, so to T speak, an anomaly; a magistrate ought to be an impartial person. In this very Bill, what do we do ? We make the Judge independent of everybody. He is to have the same status as the other members of the High Court Bench. He is to be removable by no party whim or fancy, but only by a resolution of both Houses for bad behaviour. Naturally, permanent assessors elected by parties being partisans give a partisan verdict. How can that strengthen Court? I cannot see how it can. I put on one side the ture of £1,400 a year. If it is necessary to spend that sum in order to get a betterCourt, let it be spent. But it is of no real use to spend it merely for the sake of doing so. If we can get as good a Court without spending the money as we could by doing so, we oucht not to spend it. Let it be remembered that the additional temporary assessors mentioned by. the honourable and learned member for Ballarat will have to be paid by somebody. Who is going to pay them ? Is each side to pay its own assessor ? That might fail hard on some small and more or less impoverished union. Our proposal is that the assessors shall be appointed by the union and paid by the Commonwealth. Their duty will be to advise the Court. The Judge will hear the evidence, ancl deliver the verdict on. that evidence, and the assessors will take no part in that duty. If the Court is constituted of the Judge and two assessors, who are to be appointed in each particular case, I am sure that the verdict will be exactly the same-as if there were permanent members of the Court-one assessor voting on either side. I cannot see any reason why there should be permanent Experience has demonstrated manent men cannot possibly be seized of all the details of the trades on which they are asked to adjudicate. of the advantages-and its solitary advantage, I venture to think-of the Wages Board system of Victoria is that, in each case, the matter comes before experts in the particular trades. Honourable members will recognise that that is a very great advantage. I ask my honourable friends who are against the inclusion of rural trades, whether, if a rural trade were included in the Bill, it would not be infinitely preferable that a farmer and a farm labourer should be on the Court as assessors when a dispute affecting it was being heard, rather than, say, a seaman on one side and a ship-owner on the other? Obviously it would. The presence of a ship-owner and a seaman, as well as that of a farmer and a farm labourer, called in temporarily, would not assist the Court at all, but would be a cause of Mr Hughes. confusion. What would a ship-owner and a seaman know of the ramification ! of a 1 rural industry ? As it is with that industry, so it is with all others. We may put on one side the idea of having two permanent members of the Court, the and candidly admit that what is required is a trained expert to deal imexpendi- partially with evidence. That trained expert will be a Judge, who cannot be removed except for bad behaviour. He will be unaffected by party clamour ; he will not be dependent upon any section for nomination; he will not have to give a verdict from time to time with a view to secure his re-election. Nor will - a non-permanent assessor be placed in that position. I think that a permanent meinber of the Court, being human, is sometimes compelled to think of what the effect of a verdict may be to him personally. I do not suggest that he is improperly influenced; but I thinlc he must remember that it may affect his re-election. A non-permanent assessor will not be so influenced. He will simply tell the Judge that "" this is so-and-so,"" ask questions, and supply the Court with the information which is required. That will, I think, be a decided improvement; ancl, whilst I should not go so far as to say that arguments could not be advanced in favour of having permanent members of the Court for a State, although I am by no means sure of it, for .this particular purpose it will be to the advantage of the tribunal that it should consist of one Judge only, ancl that assessors. assessors with technical knowledge of the that per- particular trade in question should be called into assist the Judge in each case. One Mr LONSDALE (New England) - I cannot agree with the honourable and learned member for Ballarat in his contention with regard to this proposal, which I favour, of eliminating two permanent men to be nominated by a union of employers and a union of employees respectively. Every argument which he used to show that the Court would not be a strong one, really went in the direction of appointing two other Judges, and not in the direction of appointing two nominated persons, as the Bill proposes; and, consequently, even if I agreed with him in that regard, I should still support the proposal of the Ministry. I believe that even in a State Court it is very much better to have assessors nominated for each case than permanent assessors, as in New South Wales. It is well'known, I think, to most persons in that State, that Mr Cruickshank, the employers' nominee, was asked to meet them after a number of awards had been given,, because they were not satisfied with his conduct on the Bench.",60
462,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Did they wish to influence him?,62
463,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The employers asked Mr Cruickshank to meet them, arid he did. What they wished him to do was to take information fro m them about the various cases,' and he would not, because he ' there as a Judge. That may be' right; but to give them the power to nominate a man Bill. from their own class, as a Judge, seems to me to be simply absurd. If there is anything at all in his position, he might as a Judge if he liked; but, still, he to have, from the employers' point of all the information which he could get about does not tend to weaken the Court. a case.",62
464,Mr GROOM,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Whether in Court or not?,62
465,Mr LONSDALE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes . What is the we use of allowing the employers to nominate a person as an assessor, if he is likely get out of touch with trades and businesses, nomical to incur the expenditure. and not to understand the technicalities a' case ? 'When an engineering case came fore the Court, Mr Cruickshank, being engineer, could use his technical knowledge; but when a case relating to the boot trade came before the Court, what could he know about . it ? Nothing. Consequently was . utterly useless as an expert. we are tb have three Judges in the Court, let - us have them in away which will make them abshall be? solutely free of either employers or employees. Look at the decisions, which have only expressing my personal opinion. been given in New' South Wales. Every decision fixing, an award has been decided by the Judge and one assessor. If it has been .an award in favour of the men, majority of the Court has consisted of the scribed. Judge and Mr Smith. On the other hand, - if it has been an award in favour of ployers, the majority of the Court has sisted of. the Judge and Mr Cruickshank. I ' do not believe that there has been award given except in that way. That terly absurd, in my opinion. I take it , that dence. if New South Wales had had a Court,"" sisting of three legal men, who could lyze evidence, and who had quite free from nomination, on some occasion or other, they would have unanimous verdict, whether for the for the master. I .could not .conceive of Judge always going with the meri, and other Judge always going with the employer. 40 Even if the verdict were not unanimous, the majority would not always consist of the same persons. So I am against the contention about strengthening the Court. If we do need to have Judges, let them be appointed in the usual way, and then, if special tech-nical knowledge is required,- let assessors be called in. I think it is likely that a large number of disputes will be settled without an assessor being called in at all, while, of course, some cases will need the presence of was an assessor. Although I am against this kind of legislation, still I must favour this",62

472,Mr EWING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Before considering this given a question at all, it appeared to me men or to be necessary to get . a statement of one that kind. I do not desire to follow the honanorable and learned member for Ballarat of the Prime Minister into the question of the importance of the matter, as it is granted by all,, or into the question of whether an expenditure of a few hundreds or few thousands wpuld be involved. If that would bring about the result desired, it would be simply not worth considering. The real question we haye to determine is, how we can get the best Court possible? Shall we have a Court formed by one Judge, to be selected .because of his ability ? If the sors are to have the same rights as in New South Wales, there will in each case be put on either side of the Judge a partisan who will come fresh from his work, with a full knowledge of the technicalities of the trade concerned, and of its existing conditions. That is quite right, if what we desire is a partisan. But it must not be forgotten that he will go upon the Bench armed with more than experience, more than knowledge, and more than acquaintance with the existing conditions of a trade. He will go there with a bitter hostility to the other side. If that be so, it is perfectly clear that to give to partisan assessors any right in declaring the judgment of the Court would be little more than farcical.",62
473,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am inclined to agree with the honourable member. I say that the Judge should be the person to deliver the verdict, and in effect he will be under this provision.",63
474,Mr EWING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat is that there should be a Judge chosen for the reason for which Judges are usually chosen, and, on either side of him, a partisan, perhaps, but one who, matured by experience, and having increased knowledge, would be prepared to take a more comprehensive view of questions coming before him than would a person fresh from the scene of conflict.",63
475,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I admit that, as a Judge, he would be matured by experience. But he would lose in his character as an expert, as he might know nothing of the conditions of a trade in connection with which he was called upon to give a verdict.",63
476,Mr EWING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I grant that. But I contend that a man without special knowledge of a technical matter may do what is right. I am inclined to think that any intelligent man can understand the conditions governing, any trade, provided he is given time. If , for instance, the technical conditions covering engineering works were placed before, laymen in this Committee by an expert, I believe that honourable members would be able to give a correct verdict on any question raised in connection therewith. I think that the honprable and learned member for Ballarat is looking for a little cheap jus-, tice also in proposing two men at £ 7 0 0 a year each. But if we are to have assessors they should be permanent men, and not partisans fresh from the field of battle. The assessors should be men having the experience and mature judgment which the perasses- manency of their position would give them, whilst if they are to be merely counsel for the belligerents the whole status of. the Court will be altered.",63
477,Mr ROBINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I find myself on this clause forced to vote with the Government. After listening to the debate, and guided by what I have gathered with respect to the working of the Arbitration Court in New South Wales, I have come to the conclusion that the position taken up by the Government in this matter is sound. It appears to me that the original proposal to constitute the Court with a Justice of the High Court and two other persons receiving £ 7 0 0 a year each, is very much like having a Court composed of a first-class Judge with two honorary Justices of the Peace to assist him. I do not think that such a Court would be of very much use in elucidating questions submitted to arbitration.",63
478,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,In this case the Justices of the Peace would not be honorary.,63
479,Mr ROBINSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No , they would be paid something, and the question of expense should be considered. I believe that for the £ 1 , 4 0 0 a year, which it was originally proposed we should pay these individuals, we should get.little or no service. If my reading of the Constitution is correct, there will be comparatively few disputes arising that can come within the purview of the Federal Arbitration Court, and it seems to me that it would be the height of folly to give two men an appointment for seven years at £ 7 0 0 a year each when they might only have to . work a month or two in each year. I do not think that the appointment of these individuals would strengthen the Court in any way, and their non-appointment would result in some saving to the community. From - what I can gather, in New South Wales the emplovers' representative looks after the interests of the employers,' and the workers' representative looks after their interests, while the Judge holds the balance between the two partisans. I do not think that the community should be called upon to pay two partisans a permanent salary. In my opinion, the Government proposal, in addition to being the more economical, is the one likely,to give the best results, and I , therefore, ..find myself in the peculiar position of having to vote with honourable members opposite.",63
480,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I think that the Government have taken up a perfectly sound position in connection with this clause. Even if we had not the experience of existing Arbitration Courts to guide us, we are aware that men are naturally affected by bias either for one side or the other. We may assume that they would always be inclined to be perfectly fair, but they would always be influenced by an unconscious bias' in favour of the particular side which they represented, and, to a greater or less extent, that must affect the soundness of their judgment. It has come to be looked upon as a legitimate function of the lay Judges elected as members of an Arbitration Court to represent either one side or other in a dispute, that they shall maintain the attitude of advocates of the opposing parties in the dispute, and endeavour to influence the President of the Court in favour of their particular side. It necessarily follows that the judgment of the Court is a biased judgment. The proposal of the Government that only one Judge should be appointed is a sound one, provided he is allowed the benefit of expert assistance in dealing with technical matters. I believe it is fair, also, that the charge for this expert assistance should be borne, not by the parties to a dispute, but by the Commonwealth Government. When I read the clause as originally proposed, I intended to submit an amendment similar in effect to that which is now before the Committee. I am glad that my idea has been anticipated. The Government have acted wisely in this matter, and I am prepared to support them in the amendment of this clause. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to.

486,Mr DEAKI N,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The Attorney-General would do well to give .this clause his very serious consideration. I do not know, first of all, whether we possess the power to appoint a Judge of the High Court as President, though we may possess the power to appoint the Court. The position of the Justices of the High Court is secured under the Constitution, and that is reinforced by the Judiciary Act. In any case, unless the consent of the Justice be obtained, I can foresee difficulties. There may be questions as to whether we ter, can get or go beyond the Court. I could understand a point being raised as to whether we could impose these new commit it. duties, many of which are not judicial, but are administrative and executive, upon Judges of the High Court. The honour the able and learned member for Darling Downs will remember the American cases, in which when it was attempted by express Statute to impose duties upon the the Judges of the High Court, which larat. in their opinion were not strictly judicial, they declined to discharge them, and, alwhich though the attempt has been repeated, have always maintained that position.",64
487,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I understand the honourable and learned member to say that i Judges consented the difficulty would be removed ?,65
488,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No ; not necessarily. ; The first question is . whether the High. Ccurt, as such, could be appointed act as . an Arbitration Court. I think it is very possible that it could be called upon to discharge those duties, but the matsatisfied ter is not free from doubt. Then the quesi tion arises whether a Justice of the High Court could be appointed to act in the manner proposed without his consent, with his consent. These are all nice ques-' tions, and will require careful consider a-; tion. If a Justice of the High Couit were appointed the President of the Arbi-: tration Court, his appointment be for seven years only, and he is liable; to removal. I am not qnite clear, however,. that we could m'ake an appointment conof ditional in those respects.

But, notwithstanding the fact that the Committee have been advised by the Minister of Home Affairs that this is only a formal matter, I propose tp take the opportunity of stating my objections to the proposal.",68
513,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,I rise to a point of order. - Is the honourable member for Moira in order in discussing the Bill at this stage? >,68
514,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member for Moira may discuss the motion. ',68
515,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,I am glad that some interest is being aroused by my announced intention to state my objections.,68
516,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,It is a very discourteous action.,68
517,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"That is purely a matter of opinion, which I do not intend to discuss. As a matter of principle, when I come in contact with proposals from which I dissent, I voice my objections at the first opportunity.",68
518,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,It is not usual to raise objections at a formal stage.,68
519,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"People do unusual things under unusual conditions. To my mind, the introduction of the proposal at this stage is rather unusual, and I may be excused if I take an unusual step.",68
520,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,This is a mere formality.,68
521,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"I cannot see that it is a mere formality to assent to the expenditure of £20,000.  for Moira would not complain if it were a proposed expenditure on a water scheme. RAILWAY. Mr KENNEDY - When expenditure of that kind is proposed, I shall be quite prep pared to be judged by my actions. I am afraid that, when I reach my subject matter, I shall occupy at least two hours. The question is a very important one.",68
522,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,We shall welcome criticism at the proper time.,68
523,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"But what constitutes the proper time is a matter of opinion. Personally, I think that I am quite within my rights in opposing this proposal tonight.  intend to occupy two hours ?",68
524,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"Yes ; that is not an unreasonable time, considering that I have listened to eight speeches from one honourable member this evening. I wish to point out that before the Commonwealth Government can embark upon railway construction, it is necessary for it to secure the consent of the State or States which the proposed line will traverse. Although some correspondence has taken place between the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of South Australia and Western Australia in regard to the building of a Transcontinental Railway, up to the present time South Australia has absolutely withheld her consent to allow the proposed line to pass through her territory.",68
525,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,This is merely a proposal to .ascertain whether the Commonwealth would be justified in constructing the line.,68
526,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"The engineers who made a flying survey of the country which would be traversed by the railway, declare that a proper survey of the suggested route would cost £20,000. So far as I am aware, the South Australian Government have not yet assented to the line passing through its territory.",68
527,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,Yes ; they have.,69
528,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"I shall be delighted if' the honourable member for Perth can show me an authoritative statement upon the matter. I repeat that sub-section xxxv. of section 51 of the Constitution empowers this Parliament to legislate in respect of Railway construction ancl extension State, with the consent of that State. I hold, therefore, that we have no warrant for incurring the expenditure proposed.",69
529,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,The South Australian Government make the granting of their consent conditional upon the results of the proposed survey.,69
530,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,It is rather too much to see the game.,69
531,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"We are not engaged in the game of bluff at the present time. The financial position of the Commonwealth .will not permit of our doing so. At the last elections, I told my constituents that whenever a proposal for expenditure was submitted I would voice my opinion upon it at the first opportunity.  it was good, bad, or indifferent.",69
532,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"This matter has not been sprung upon us. We know very well the view that is entertained in Western Australia in regard to the construction of this line. Reasons have been advanced why it should be proceeded, with. The fact is that the vested interests of Perth and Fremantle have been too strong to permit of justice being meted out to the residents of the gold-fields.",69
533,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,Anothe r milestone.,69
534,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"I draw your attention, sir, to the fact that the honourable, meinber for Fremantle has accused me of adopting "" stone-walling "" tactics.",69
535,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,If the expression used by the honourable member for Fremantle is distasteful to the honourable member I trust that it will be withdrawn.,69
536,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"I will withdraw it, sir, if you rule that it is unparliamentary.",69
537,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,It is customary for an honourable member to withdraw any statement which is considered by another honourable member to Be personally offensive.,69
538,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"I . withdraw pression, and substitute for it the statement that the' honourable member is wasting the time of the Committee.",69
539,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"I am attempting to save £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 to the Commonwealth. I do not know whether that can be characterized as a waste of time. The claim that the Commonwealth should provide the money necessary to construct this line of railway across a wilderness had its origin in the fact that Western Australia refused to do justice to a large section of her people. The vested interests of Perth and Fremantle governed that State to the detriment of the in any mining districts. Instead of the Western Australian Government constructing a line of railway for a distance of 200 or 300 miles-a n undertaking which would prove very remunerative-the y wish the taxpayers of the Commonwealth to build a railway across a desert to their State, a distance of 1,000 miles.",69
540,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"Does the honourable member wish tb imply that the people on the gold-fields do not desire the construction of this line? 1 """,69
541,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"I am not implying anything, but telling the honourable member what I think; and he can draw his own inference.",69
542,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"They desire to get the line, but wish somebody else to pay for its construction.",69
543,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"Yes , I believe that the residents at Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie, and all the other mining centres in Western Australia are very anxious to have a direct line to Adelaide, a direct line to Sydney, anid at direct line to Brisbane, so long as they have not to pay for their construction, and the annual loss which would be involved. In Victoria, we have had considerable experience of this kind. We, in this State, even in the most remote hamlet, where there were only half-a-dozen residents, were most anxious to have a railway line made to our doors, provided that we could get another section of the community to share the expense.  such lines.",69
544,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"Unfortunatel y for the general tax-payers, we did get too many lines of that kind, and I have had the bitter experience of having tq pay for the folly of somebody else. When a proposal of this kind is submitted to Parliament, we who have had to pay for our experience should take some little heed of the lessons the exwhich were taught to us by wild-cat proposals. We know that States which embarked on such ventures, have been brought up very suddenly; their ""uncle"" in the old - world has set up his back. What has been the cause of all the trouble in Victoria and New South Wales during the last few years?",69
545,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"To o much Kyabram ! M.r. KENNEDY - Unfortunately Kyabram was forced upon the people of this State. The policy of "" borrow-and-bust "" could not be continued, and, notwithstanding its wonderful resources, if Western Australia continues the policy which it adopted in its earlier years, it may come to the same end as the eastern States.",70
546,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"Wester n Australia has been keeping, not only her own people, but very many of the people of Victoria.",70
547,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"A great many Victorians, who went over to Western Australia to better their condition, forget the source of their origin, and look clown on the State which laugh) them so many useful lessons. They seem to think that, because they are citizens of Western Australia now, they are the "" be all "" and "" end all"" of the existence of the Commonwealth. The proposal before the Committee is practically on a par with what was known here as the railway fever in the latter end of the eighties, and which culminated in financial disaster. No doubt the people in the most remote portions of the goldfields of Western Australia are desirous of having railway communication with the eastern States. Supposing that it were constructed, what return would it yield? It would carry a fewfirst-classpassengers, a large proportion being dead-heads, so far as revenue was concerned. road-side traffic would there be between the terminal points?",70
548,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"Does the honourable member know that there are 50,000 persons travelling between the west and the east annu-' ally ?",70
549,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"How much of the country is settled, even for pastoral purposes? Let us compare the earning power of the proposed line with that of the line connecting Melbourne with Brisbane. I propose to read a few extracts from the report of the States Engineers-in-Chief, and also from the report of Mr C. Y. O'Connor, late Engineer-in-Chief - for Railways in Western Australia.",70
550,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"A good man, too. '",70
551,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"Mr O'Connor was a yery capable man: and, strang« to say, he was trained in Victoria. Perhaps, before I ' read the extracts, it will be well 10 illustrate the possibilities of the proposed line, and to compare it with the existing Inter-State lines. In one instance we have 4 H a line connecting two of the largest commercial centres in the Commonwealth, each having a population of about 500,000; traversing a country densely settled from end to end; with an enormous roadside traffic, both of passengers and freight; and a large revenue from the carriage of mails. With these advantages, it is reasonable to assume that in the matter of earning capacity the highest possible point has been reached by that line. Yet we know, as a matter of fact, that, it is barely earning interest on the cost of its construction. With that experience before' us, we may consider the conditions of the other proposed line. It would connect two places not nearly so advantageously circumstanced with regard to population, or with regard to the possibilities of trade and commerce; with an intervening distance which is practically unsettled, and without any possibility of settlement on a large scale at any time! unless there should be some mining development which is not at present foreseen. We have the cool proposal submitted to us that we should embark - upon railway construction that will involve the Commonwealth in an expenditure of £500,000.",70
552,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,This is but a proposal for a survey of the line.,70
553,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"I do not desire to take the risk of having the lives of men lost What from the attacks of sandflies and mosquitoes in the survey of such a line. Surely we can find better employment for qualified surveyors ? I see no justification for the proposed Bill. I have no wish to inconvenience honourable members, unless it is the intention of the Government to press this matter.  orable member fight the matter fairly ?",70
554,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"No honourable member can reasonably accuse me of fighting the matter unfairly. When I was asked what I proposed to do this afternoon, I gave a clear and definite intimation that I would on the first opportunity, and on every opportunity when this proposal was submitted, fight it to a finish. In the circumstances no honourable member is justified in saying that I am fighting it unfairly.",70
555,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"It was understood when we proposed to go on with this Bill that there would be no opposition to this formal stage. As there is opposition we do not think it would be fair to ask honourable members to remain later to discuss the matter. It will not make any very great difference to postpone the matter now, except that the stage which we should have taken to-night will have to be taken later on. In the circumstances, I move That the Chairman clo now leave the Chair, report progress, and ask leave to sit again. Mr CARPENTER ' (Fremantle) regret that the Government should be forced by the action of one member of or two to the subject. the Committee to take the course now progotten posed. I am aware that it is within the rights of any one member of the Committee to block business, if he so desires; but enter my protest against the forms of the House being used, as I consider, unfairly, the business. to prevent a formal step being taken when no good purpose can be served by such obstruction, and when all that requires to be said upon this proposal may be when the Bill is introduced. I - emphaticnot ally protest against the action of the honorhonorable members on its merits. able member for Moira.  that the Government in this matter have not wasted time. shown more spine than to permit one honourable member to dictate what the Committee started. shall' do. I consider that they have exhibited very great weakness, indeed, in giving way to the honourable > member - for Moira.i No other member of the Committee would take up a posiendeavour tion such as that assumed by the one honourable member. His action is most unthat there would reasonable and unfair. He would have every opportunity to give expression to his views On later stages of the Bill, when we Bill. might have had from the honourable member some criticism of the merits of the proposal, instead of the Kyabram clap-trap we have heard from him to-night. On the previous occasion, when this matter was submitted, there was some reason in the objection taken, because there was a no-confidence motion before us. To-night, there is nothing of the kind, and I cannot understand the tactics of the honourable member for Moira, unless it is that he is seeking a cheap advertisethe ment. His action will, no doubt, be very popular in his own district-, where he has railway to his own door, and railways all round him.",70
556,Mr STORRER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"He has not asked the Commonwealth to pav for them.  Western Australia has agreed to do more than other Governments would have such a case. They are prepared to give a guarantee, and they have shown a very been liberal spirit, indeed, in connection with this matter. Such tactics as have been adopted by the honourable member for Moira to pretaken vent the passing of what has been, in all my political experience, with but a single exception, regarded as a purely formal motion, are not likely to cement good feeling between the States. I am sorry that the Government I have taken the course now suggested. We might very well have devoted another hour It must not be forthat this stage will be fought again in the same way.

We should not be able to keep a quorum if the debate were continued now at any length, and it was only on the understanding that there would be no opposition that I consented to proceed with motion. With regard to the proposal itself, I can assure the honourable member a for Grey that there is no intention on the part of the Government to allow any single member to dominate its policy with regard to the measure. As soon as other matters which we consider of more immediate imare disposed of, the proposal now before us will be dealt with and carried done in through as soon as possible.",71
560,Mr FOWL ER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A," If there had the slightest intention to rush the pro- "" posal through the House or to prevent criticism, I could have understood the action by the honourable member for Moira I can assure him that the representatives df Western Australia will welcome discussion ancl criticism, and will be only too glad to meet it at the proper time. I must confess that I am thoroughly, disgusted with the attitude assumed by the honourable member for Moira. He has established a reputation which, although it may cause him to stand higher in the estimation of the kind of electors who sent him here, will not confer any benefit upon him, so far as this House is concerned. I can only characterize his action as dirty and contemptible.",71
561,The CHAIRMAN,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,Order ! The honourable member must withdraw that remark.,72
562,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"I withdraw the remark, but I must confess that the treatment accorded to this measure by one honourable member is such as I did not expect, and I am very glad that the attitude adopted by him has not been endorsed by anv other representative in this Chamber.",72
563,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A," I would point out that, although the honourable member for Moira may have taken a course which is distasteful to many other honourable members, he has only exercised the right to which he is entitled under the rules of the House. I took objection to this measure at a similar' stage on a previous occasion, but for the sole reason that I considered that, owing to the important business-practicabl y a vote of censurethen before Parliament, it was not proper to interpose the motion. night, when I was questioned as to my attitude, I stated that I would make no objection to the motion being passed as formal, and I understood that the Prime Minister was willing that it should be brought forward, so long as there was no debate. One honourable member has chosen to debate the matter, and although the irritation of the representatives of Western Australia may be very natural. I do not think that the reflections which have been cast upon the honourable member for Moira can be justified. The Standing Orders provide an opportunity for anyhonorable member, who may feel strongly, to express his feelings regarding it, ancl to display his opposition at any stage.",72
564,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member knows that the Standing Orders are very rarelv taken advantage of in that wav.,72
565,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"Perhaps they are not often availed of ; but I have known of many such instances in the Parliament of New South Wales. Provision is made in the Standing Orders to protect the rights of honourable members who 4 H2 feel strongly, and I do not think any one should be spoken of in the disrespectful terms which have been used in regard to the honourable member for Moira, simply because he may feel strongly, and because he may choose to take advantage of the opportunity which the Standing Oiders provide. I should have been very glad if the motion had been treated as formal; but I have no sympathy with the strong criticism which has been directed against the honourable member for Moira.",72
566,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A," I wish to say that the indignation expressed, and the hard words used, in regard to myself do not affect my attitude in the slightest degree. I may remind the honourable member for Perth that he was aware, two or three hours before the motion was introduced, of the exact attitude which I should take up. He came to me-no t in confidence, but in the same manner that he approached other members-and asked if I was prepared to assent to the motion being taken as formal? I clearly ancl distinctly told him then that I would oppose the motion whenever it was submitted, and that I would fight the Bill to the fullest extent within my power. Another honourable member, also a representative of Western Australia, came to me, ancl I repeated that statement to him. My action to-night was in keeping with the pledges that I have To- given to my constituents. Although it might not suit the convenience of all honourable members, I was acting quite within my privileges; and surely no one is justified in applying to me epithets which are unparliamentary, or in expressing personal antagonism towards me. I have no feeling in the matter. I was perfectly straightforward and honest with the honourable member for Perth, and when the Prime Minister asked me if I proposed to speak. I told him that I did, and that I would do so at considerable length.",72

569,Mr STORRER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A," I desire to oppose the motion. I know that my protest will be useless, because all these matters are arranged beforehand, without consulting the convenience of those honourable members who leave their businesses in the distant States to attend to public affairs in Melbourne, and who cannot return home during the two or three days' adjournment at the end of the week. The Government should arrange for intervals between our sitting days sufficiently long to suit the convenience of honourable members who come from distant States. I sat here last night until after 12 o'clock, and I should be prepared to do so every night in the week, in order to push on with the business of the country. I do not care about having to walk about Victoria for two or three days every week, and I strongly protest against the readiness with which the Government accede to adjournments of the kind now proposed.",72
570,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A," I take the same view as the honourable member for Bass. I think that when adjournments are arranged, the convenience of honourable members who reside in other States should be consulted. If we are to give up our Friday sittings every time we make a little progress on Thursdays, the sooner we are made aware of the intentions of the Government the better. As matters stand, several honourable members from other States will be in Melbourne tomorrow, and they would be better employed in attending the House and transacting public business than in walking about the streets. I strongly urge that we should meet on the prescribed sitting days, unless all sections of the House are given to understand, before the Inter-State trains leave on any Thursday evening, that if is not proposed to meet on the following day.",73
571,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A," I fully appreciate the position taken up by the honourable member for Bass, and the honourable member for Newcastle. were simply a matter of pushing on with the work of the House, I should not think of submitting such a motion as this; but the position is that Ave have done an extraordinary good day's work.",73
572,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,That is all the more reason why we should do more.,73
573,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"We have been able to do so much today, because of a proposal that was made that we should adjourn over tomorrow.",73
574,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"Then , it is a matter of making conditions with the Opposition?",73
575,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member has been long enough in Parliament to know that the progress made is very often, to some extent, a matter of conditions. We have today gone from clause 4 to clause 26 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and have dealt with several very. important provisions. The whole constitution - of the proposed Court has been changed as the result of today's deliberations, and a vast number of matters has received, not merely consideration, but reasonably detailed attention.",73
576,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable gentleman's experience is that when a Government cannot make good progress, it generally determines upon a late sitting.",73
577,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,L at e sittings are generally an indication that the House is not doing a reasonable amount of work.,73
578,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"That was not the case when, we sat under the honourable gentleman's leadership in another Legislature.",73
579,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"My experience is that it very frequently happens that if a Government agree that, on a certain point being reached, they will consent to an adjournment for one day, or to a short sitting, that point is reached sooner than would otherwise have been the case.",73
580,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,That is to say that time is wasted.,73
581,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,I do not make any insinuations.,73
582,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,The honourable gentleman is suggesting that the Opposition acts unfairly.,73
583,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member knows that when a particular task is set it often happens that much better progress is made than when no stipulation is made as to the work to be transacted before the Government will consent to an adjournment. I am satisfied that we have done as much as it was reasonable to expect in the circumI f it stances, and that we have, in fact, done more than might have been anticipated. We are therefore justified' in proposing that the House, at its rising, shall adjourn till Tuesday next.. Question resolved in affirmative. ADJOURNMENT. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSIONER : VENTILA TION OF THE CHAMBER: ROYAL COM MISSION ON THE NAVIGATION BILL . Motion (by Mr WATSON) proposed - That the House clo now adjourn.  the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs to the reply given today by the Attorney-General to a question put by the honourable member for Grey. The Herald this evening states that said he was not aware of any power on the of the Public Service Commissioner to withhold from an officer who was performing his duties satisfactorily, and against whom no charge of misconduct existed, any portion of the salary or increment voted to him. Mr Higgins added lhat he would be glad if the honourable member could furnish him with any specific instances bearing out the complaint hinted at in his tion. I desire to give the Minister of Home Affairs a concrete case. In the Estimates for 1902-3 a sum of £ 1 5 0 was provided in respect of the salary of a lady superRoyal visor in the Brisbane Telephone Exchange. The salary received by this lady for year 1901-2 was £ 1 3 0 ; but, although have voted her an increase of £ 2 0 per annum, the Public Service Commissioner ship-building industry. absolutely refuses to grant it to her. believe that when the Estimates for 1903-4 were before the House, the honourable memare ber for Oxley drew, the attention of the tralian ship-builder. then Minister of Home Affairs-the right honourable member for Swan-to the attiparts tude taken up by the Public Service missioner, and received the reply that officer had the power to withhold the ining. crease, and that the lady supervisor would not receive it. In the Estimates for 1903-4, provision was again made for a salary "",£150 per annum; but, although attention has been drawn to the fact, the Public Serquantity. vice Commissioner persists in his refusal acknowledge the determination of Parliaare ment that this lady supervisor shall receive the increased salary voted for her on separate occasions. In these circumstances, I think that action should be taken to see Australia. that this lady receives the money owing to her. It appears to me, from this and other complaints that I have heard menvisability tioned in the House, that the Minister of Home Affairs-whoeve r he may be-is merely a registration clerk for the Public Service Commissioner. If any anomaly is brought before a member of the Gotion vernment, the reply is at once given Ministers are powerless. The question whether the Public Sendee Commissioner is going to run Parliament or whether Parthese walls. liament is going to run him. I regret many votes that I gave on the Public Service Bill . Had I had the experience of Public Service Boards and Committees other members of the first Parliament possessed, I should not have voted to give the Commissioner half the power that he at present exercises. I have no wish to use political influence; but I would point out that social influence, which is ten thoupart sand times worse, is used in the Public Service. We can carpet any honourable member who endeavours to use political influence; but we cannot get at those who bring social influence to bear. I ask that this lady shall receive that fair and square questreatment to which every member of the Public Service is entitled.",73
584,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"- I desire to mention a matter that I had intended to bring before the House tomorrow. I refer to the proposed appointment of a Commission on the Navigation Bill. I ask the Government to take into conthe sideration the matter of extending the we scope of the Royal Commission, so as to include the protection of the Australian If we are justiI fied in protecting the Australian ship-owner against unfair competition from outside, we equally justified in protecting the AusConsidering the importance of the ship-building trade in other of the world, it behoves us tp look Comafter the Australian industry, and do that what we can to place it on a sound footThe appointment of the Royal Commission on the Navigation Bill affords an opportunity to obtain information as to of why, up to the present, the ship-building industry of Australia has been a minus There are facilities for buildto ing ships in most of the States, and there also people prepared to undertake the work; but up to the present it has two been the custom of Australian owners to get all their ship-building done outside We talk of protecting the owners of ships built at foreign ports, and I ask the Government to consider the adof allowing the Royal Commission on the Navigation Bill to inquire into the matter of protecting ship-builders.",74
585,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A," Mr. Speaker, I should like to draw your attento the state of the atmosphere in this that chamber. The whole of this evening the is air has been decidedly poisonous to all whose duties compel them to remain within Such a state of affairs is decidedly reprehensible, and I trust that arrangements will be made for better ventilation, so that our span of life may be exthat many tended as far as possible.",74
586,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A," It has perplexed me to observe that in the construction of this building there seems to have been no regard paid to ventilation or proper sanitation. The chamber in which we meet is, in my opinion, a monument, of incapacity, exhibiting, as it does, an entire lack of appreciation on the part of the architect of the purposes for which it was intended. The same difficulty is met with in the Parliament House of New South Wales, but in that case there is some excuse, considering that the building was not erected for its present purposes, but simply consists of old Government offices adapted to new uses. In the Sydney House ventilation has been sought by the provision of what is practically a new roof, .so constructed as to allow the. exit of all bad air. I have never seen a Parliament House which exhibits so much extravagance on the part of the designer as the House in which we now meet. Whether we regard the building from the point of view of this chamber, or as a whole, we see that public money has been lavished on useless ornamentation and on corridors, the latter of which are calculated to lay the foundation of* disease amongst all whose duties take them there.

587,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"On e might be pardoned for expecting that in a city of the character of Melbourne some provision would have been made for connecting the Parliament House, with the sanitation system which has been devised and is being carried into effect. But the building, as we know, it today, is simply a condemnation of its designer. The honourable member for Corangamite is entitled to the thanks of honourable members and of the public generally for having called attention to the present state of affairs. I hope that in the construction of the Federal Parliament Houses at the Seat of Government, we shall not seek the advice of an. architect of the same calibre as he who devised this building, which both inside and out affords ample evidence of absolute extravagance, which meets no utilitarian end. I hope that you. Mr Speaker, may be able to do something in the matter of the ventilation.",75
588,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A," In case the Government should seriously regard the' suggestion of the honourable member for Fremantle, as to raising the fiscal issue in the ship-building trade, I desire to enter my protest, in order that some diversity of opinion may be evident. If we desire a Commission to inquire into the navigation laws', let us by all means have one in order that the necessary information may be forthcoming on which to compile a Federal Bill . But if a Royal Commission on the fiscal issue be proposed, with a view to encourage the ship-building industry, then I may say that I know several little industries in Queensland which would be the better for similar attention. I imagine that if such an inquiry as the honourable member for Fremantle suggests, were approved, we should, in a very little time, find everv honourable member engaged on a Royal Commission, with a view to the protection of other industries.",75
589,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A,"Wit h reference to the remarks as to the defective ventilation of this chamber, I "" may inform honourable members, who are new to the House, that the House Committee of the last Parliament had this matter under their consideration for some considerable time. Before Melbourne became the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth, the Victorian Parliament expended a large sum in seeking to provide adequate ventilation within this building with indifferent success; and the conclusion that was arrived at by the House Committee of the Federal Parliament was that, under the circumstances of our occupation, it was not possible to remedy the evils existing except, at prohibitive cost. If , however, at any time when the ventilation seems unusually defective, honourable members will kindly mention the matter to the Clerk, arrangements can al-' ways be made for pumping in an additional quantity of fresh air, by which means the vitiated air will be driven out and the atmosphere improved. Further, if honourable members desire, I shall be very pleased to arrange for an early meeting of the House Committee, when the whole, matter can be discussed, and probably some means devised for assisting to meet the wishes of honourable members in what is a very important matter.",75
590,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIEAND PORT AUGUST A," The honourable member for Fremantle has requested that the scope of the inquiry by the Commission which it is proposed to appoint upon the Navigation Bill, shall be extended to ship building in. the States. The Government have no objection to considering that matter, but their present feeling harmonizes with the view which was expressed by the honourable member for Kennedy. They think that to give effect to the suggestion of the honourable member for Fremantle would unnecessarily extend the scope of the inquiry. Moreover, we should be unlikely to obtain a report upon the matter within a reasonable time, and the necessity for securing uniform navigation laws-is somewhat urgent. Concerning the .case to which reference was made by the honourable member for Maranoa, I desire to say that during the day I have had brought under my notice a specific instance of an increase which was voted upon the Estimates, but which was not paid, owing, I understand, to the refusal of the Public Service Commissioner to recommend it. I am inquiring into the matter, and I shall also obtain a report upon the case alluded to by the honourable member. At present I can express no opinion upon it, but, in justice to the Public Service Commissioner, I may say that I do not believe he is influenced by social or official considerations, but only by a desire to do absolute justice to the public servants. He may make mistakes, but he is extremely anxious to mete out justice to all. I shall institute an inquiry as to whether he has exceeded his powers in the case in question, and shall lay the results before honourable members at an early date. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at iz.42 p.m.",75
