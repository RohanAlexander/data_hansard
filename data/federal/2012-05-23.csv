1,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Ms AE Burke) took the chair at 9:00, made an acknowledgement of country and read prayers. Australian Human Rights Commission Amendment (National Children's Commissioner) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
2,Ms ROXON,Unknown,"Gellibrand-Attorney General and Minister for Emergency Management) (09:01): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Promoting the rights, well-being and development of Australia's children and young people is a fundamental priority for the Gillard government. Children and young people are our future, but they are often also vulnerable. Australia's future depends on them reaching their full potential. The Gillard government wants every child to grow up safe, happy and well. We want to give kids the best start in life. Labor came to government with an important agenda for supporting and protecting children. We have been determined to put children's interests at the centre of policy making, not on the margin. Across all areas of government, including family law, education and early childhood, youth health policies and programs and child protection and welfare, we are working to improve the well-being, rights and safety of Australia's children. In 2009, Labor delivered the first ever National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children. The national framework outlines an ambitious, long-term national approach to ensuring the safety and well-being of BILLS Australian children. It aims to deliver a substantial and sustained reduction in the levels of child abuse and neglect. It includes practical reforms so children at risk are identified and protected, such as improved information sharing between agencies like Centrelink, Medicare and state protection authorities. Working with the states and territories, we have developed national standards for out-ofhome care. These national standards seek to drive improvements in the quality of care so that children and young people in out-ofhome care have the same opportunities as other children and young people to reach their potential in life no matter where they live in Australia. Our ongoing commitment to the Family Support Program complements state and territory services through early intervention and prevention support for children and families at risk. It also supports the government's commitment to putting the safety and well-being of children at the heart of the government's social policy agenda. And putting the safety and well-being of children front and centre is exactly what Labor has done in relation to changes to the Family Law Act that will come into effect on 7 June this year. These changes will provide better protection for children who are exposed to family violence. This means the Family Law Act will continue to promote a child's right to a meaningful relationship with both parents, but with a stronger emphasise that the child's safety must come first. In February 2011, Labor delivered Australia's first National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children. The national plan is unprecedented in the way it focuses on preventing violence by raising awareness and building respectful relationships between young people to foster attitudes and behaviours that reject violence against women. Labor introduced new National Quality Standards for early childhood education and care so that Australian children receive better care and attention and can participate in play-based learning activities led by trained early childhood educators. Labor's significant reforms and investment in early education are directed at giving all kids the best possible start in life and will give all Australian kids access to 15 hours of early childhood education and care for 40 weeks a year by a university-trained teacher. We have made unprecedented investments to close the gap and address the unacceptable levels of disadvantage faced by too many Indigenous children. The Labor government is committed to working in partnership with Indigenous families to deliver better opportunities for Indigenous children. Labor is working to support families and children with funding for playgroups, creches, youth workers and safe houses in communities across Australia. We are also significantly increasing the number of Communities for Children sites, which provide services such as early learning and literacy programs, parenting and family support programs and child nutrition advice. The government is also providing additional funding for the Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters, otherwise known as HIPPY, in this year's budget to better prepare disadvantaged Indigenous children for school though a home-based parenting and early childhood program in 100 sites across Australia. These significant reforms for our most vulnerable children complement the changes we have made to help families with the costs of raising children. Labor increased the childcare rebate in July 2008 from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket childcare expenses up to $7,500 a year, making it easier for parents to return to work and contribute to the family budget. We have introduced Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme because giving new mums the financial security to take time off to bond with their newborns is giving babies the best start in life. And in this year's budget, we have delivered a new schoolkids bonus to help lowand middle-income families with the costs of school, as well as increases to the family tax benefit part A starting next year. Labor is very proud of this record for children but we know more can be done. Children and young people need an independent voice on the national stage. A National Children's Commissioner will be a strong and forceful voice for Australia's children and young people and will play a proactive and positive role in their well-being and development. Our children are our future and if we do not value them we cannot ever hope to protect them. A National Children's Commissioner will put their needs front and centre. I held this view as shadow minister for children and youth in 2002 when I announced my intention to introduce a private member's bill to establish a National Children's Commissioner and I hold that view today. In fact, Madam Deputy Speaker, with you in the chair, I believe we were actually in your electorate when we announced that policy. The bill was introduced in 2003. Sadly, the then government would not support the important initiative at that time. And that is why I am so pleased that, although it is 10 years later, the Gillard government will now establish for the first time a dedicated advocate focused on the human rights of children and young people at a national level. In this context, I am pleased to introduce not had one. the Australian Human Rights Commission Amendment (National Children's Commissioner) Bill 2012, which will establish the position of National Children's Commissioner within the Australian Human Rights Commission. This bill's basic principle is that every child is a valued member of society. These amendments will ensure there is an independent, child focused voice to advocate for children and young people at the national level. A National Children's Commissioner will raise public awareness of nationally significant issues affecting children and young people through discussion, research and educational programs. The commissioner will examine relevant existing and proposed Commonwealth legislation to determine if it adequately recognises and protects children's rights in Australia and report their findings to government. The commissioner will consult directly with children and their representative organisations, which will ensure they can influence the development of policies and programs that affect them at the Commonwealth level. This will signal to children and young people that we as adults think that they matter-that we value their childhood and that we will listen to their needs and hopes. Importantly, the National Children's Commissioner will have a clear focus on vulnerable or at-risk groups of children, such as children with disability, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, homeless children or those who are witnessing or subjected to violence. The commissioner will give a voice to those groups of vulnerable children that have A National Children's Commissioner will also provide an annual report to the government each year on key issues affecting children's rights, well-being and development that will be tabled in the parliament. The position will also contribute to meeting Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and reinforce our commitment to our international obligations and relationship with the United Nations. It is another example of how Australia is turning commitments made during its Universal Periodic Review at the UN into reality. The commissioner will not duplicate the roles of state and territory children's commissioners but will seek to work with them to identify issues of national importance. The commissioner will not have a guardianship role nor will it have a complaint handling role or a role in dealing with individual children, including individual cases in the context of child protection or family law. However, the commissioner will have a limited role to seek leave to intervene in court proceedings which raise significant children's rights issues but this will not extend to representing individual children. I also take this opportunity to briefly report on a related issue, the government's project to consolidate Commonwealth antidiscrimination law, including the Australian Human Rights Commission Act, into a single act and I can report that it is anticipated draft legislation will be released in 2012. I can advise that these amendments introduced today have been brought forward earlier, ahead of the consolidation project, to enable the role of the National Children's Commissioner to be established as soon as possible. The government calls on other members in this place to support this bill to ensure a National Children's Commissioner can be established as soon as possible for the benefit of Australia's children and young people. The creation of the National Children's Commissioner is an important initiative in the government's work to protect our children and young people and promote and protect their human rights. I commend this bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Legislative Instruments Amendment (Sunsetting Measures) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
3,Ms ROXON,Unknown,"Gellibrand-Attorney General and Minister for Emergency Management) (09:07): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This government is committed to reducing red tape and unnecessary regulation on industry and small business. We recognise that Australia's 2.7 million small businesses are this nation's economic engine room, employing over five million Australians and making up a third of our economy. These businesses comprise hard working men and women who, through their time and effort, are building a career and a better that future for their families. This government is doing its part to make sure business owners can get on with growing their enterprises, not spending time searching for relevant assistance or wading through unnecessary red tapes and additional laws. The Prime Minister recently announced the creation of the Small Business Commissioner to provide a direct voice to government and a one-stop shop for small business services and information. And it took this Labor government to ensure small business is represented in cabinet. This bill is another step in the process to reduce unnecessary regulation and in an orderly, efficient and consultative way. It will provide a clear process to assess, renew or allow to 'sunset' the thousands of pieces of subordinate legislation currently on the statute books. In 2003 the Legislative Instruments Act was enacted to establish a consistent system for the registering, tabling, parliamentary disallowance and sunsetting of Commonwealth legislative instruments. The sunsetting provisions of the Legislative Instruments Act provide that most legislative instruments sunset, or automatically cease, after 10 years. This limit was introduced to ensure that legislative instruments are regularly reviewed and only remain operative if they continue to be relevant. The 10-year limit on validity remains appropriate. However, at the time of enactment, the then government did not accurately assess the number of legislative instruments in existence, apart from those 663 already published in hard copy in the Statutory Rules series. This Labor government has prioritised extensive work to discover and register a large number of additional instruments, consistent with our commitment to clearer laws. These were instruments made under previous governments which were for the first time made publicly accessible by this government-so that small business and indeed all members of our community would have ready access to the laws to which they are subject. Due to the large number of instruments registered in the years immediately following commencement of the Legislative Instruments Act, sunsetting will cause the mass expiration of over 6,300 instruments from 2015, with two peaks in 2016 and 2018. As the legislation was structured in 2003, assessing which legislative instruments remain necessary would put unnecessary strain on industry, business groups and other stakeholders, as well as government. The Productivity Commission, in its 2011 report Identifying and Evaluating Regulation Reforms, expressed concern about the mass expiry of instruments from 2015. They identified an increased risk that instruments will be remade without adequate review and without proper consultation with business and other stakeholders. The commission noted that the sheer quantity of instruments required to be remade by government increases the risk that business and other stakeholders will not have sufficient time to make a meaningful contribution to any review. Consistent with the recommendations of the Productivity Commission, the purpose of this bill is to smooth these sunsetting peaks and to encourage high-quality consultation before regulations and legislative instruments are remade. It is also intended to ensure the information on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments is current. The specific measures in this bill are as follows. Firstly, this bill will smooth sunsetting peaks by simplifying sunsetting dates. For instruments that were registered in bulk when the register commenced in 2005, sunsetting dates will be spread out to reduce the number of instruments that expire at the same time and provide ample time for proper review and consultation. The bill also establishes a new default rule for regulations and legislative instruments. They will now sunset on their date of registration, making sunsetting dates easier to calculate. Secondly, the bill will insert a new provision into the act to provide for thematic reviews. The introduction of thematic reviews was recommended by the Productivity Commission. By contributing to these reviews, key stakeholders will be able to actively participate in the regulation of their sector and contribute to consistency in regulation making. Under this new provision, the Attorney General can declare a common sunset date for a number of legislative instruments if satisfied that the instruments will be subject to a single review. The new aligned sunsetting date must be within five years of the sunset date of the earliest sunsetting instrument. The Attorney-General's declarations will be tabled in parliament for public scrutiny and be open to disallowance by either house of parliament. Thematic reviews will provide industry and business with the opportunity to engage in one comprehensive review process instead of having to provide comment on up to dozens of separate regulations without a view of the wider regulatory framework. Thirdly, the bill will allow repeal of spent and redundant instruments on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments. According to the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing, approximately 40 per cent of the 40,000 titles on the register are either spent or redundant, but to a person looking for information on the register, these instruments appear to be in force. To ensure the register accurately represents the current state of the law, the bill provides for the automatic repeal of instruments and provisions which have commenced in full and whose only effect is to amend or repeal other instruments. This amendment will only apply to instruments and provisions that are created after the bill commences. For instruments already contained in the register, the bill will enable the creation of a specific regulation to effect a bulk repeal of instruments which are spent or redundant. Bulk revocation will only occur after extensive consultation. The Attorney General will also need to be satisfied that the instruments are in fact spent or redundant. Regulations that effect a bulk repeal will be tabled in parliament and open to disallowance by either house of parliament. Finally, the bill clearly communicates the requirements for explanatory statements that accompany legislative instruments. It is these statements that help businesses and individuals understand the effect of legislative instruments. But too often in the past these materials have been confusing or apparently contradictory, forcing business to spend time and money obtaining advice on their legal obligations. By setting out requirements for explanatory statements, the government will reduce the effort necessary to understand what steps are necessary to for the efficient comply with the law. Although this bill may be largely technical it will support efficient and effective consultation processes applying to all delegated legislation-much of which has a direct and significant affect on individuals, business and the community. This government is determined to keep our economy strong, and recognises the essential contribution of hard working individuals in our small business sector in keeping us the envy of the developed world. This bill is yet another example of government working with the community to create a clear, understandable and fair framework for doing business in Australia. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",22
4,Ms ROXON,Unknown,"Gellibrand-Attorney General and Minister for Emergency Management) (09:19): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012 is one of the most significant developments in privacy reform since Labor introduced the act in 1988. With this bill, the Gillard Labor government has implemented more than half of the Australian Law Reform Commission's recommendations in the 2008 For your clear information report. This bill will bring Australia's privacy protection framework into the modern era. Labor is protecting the privacy of working families. In an online world, we are increasingly sharing our personal information on social networking sites and paying our bills and buying footy tickets over the internet. While these technological changes bring immense benefits to working families, there are risks. That's why Labor is tightening up the rules around how companies and organisations can collect, use and disclose personal information. For the first time, new Australian Privacy Principles will apply to both the private and public sectors. The principles will continue to deal with the collection, storage, security, use, disclosure, access and correction of personal information. But we are introducing a new privacy principle for direct marketing and stronger protections for consumers when companies disclose personal information overseas. The new direct marketing privacy principle will more tightly regulate the use of personal information for direct marketing. Put simply, it will give working families more power to opt out of receiving direct marketing materials. The onus will be on companies to provide a clear and simple way of opting out of receiving direct marketing materials. Labor is also extending privacy protections to unsolicited information and introducing stronger and clearer rules around data quality and data protection. There will be a new requirement in the Privacy Principles for organisations and companies to develop detailed privacy policies-and make them clear and easily accessible to consumers. Labor is shifting power away from big companies-back to individuals and working families. There will be stricter rules about sending a family's personal information outside of Australia. Specifically, privacy policies will need to include whether a company or agency is likely to disclose information to overseas recipients and, if so, which countries the information is likely to go to. In addition, before a company or government agency discloses personal information to an overseas recipient, the company must take reasonable steps to make sure the overseas recipient does not breach the Australian Privacy Principles. Privacy entities will continue to be accountable for information that is sent overseas. The Australian Privacy Principles will also require a higher standard of protection to be afforded to 'sensitive information'which includes health related information, DNA and biometric data. The government is aware that senators and members receive numerous letters and emails about credit reports. Australia's complex and often confusing credit reporting system is being reformed. In addition to the Gillard government's responsible lending reforms in the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, we are making it easier for consumers to access and correct their personal credit information. It is the first major reform since Labor introduced credit reporting in 1990. This bill modernises credit reporting provisions and will make the credit reporting regime more flexible and less prescriptive by emphasising industry-led complaint resolution. Banks and financial institutions will be able to see more accurate and positive information about: (1) the types of accounts that families have and when they were opened and closed; (2) the current credit limits of each account (but obviously not the day-today balance, to protect privacy); and (3) positive information about repayment history-for example, when a credit card was paid off on time, not just information about overdue payments. These reforms will mean more families can access credit. And it will mean the banks can assess credit risks more accurately. These reforms will be good for business. The finance and credit industry have been heavily involved in developing these reforms. They know-as does this Labor government-that these reforms will enhance responsible lending in Australia. It was Labor who supported Australia's economy through the global financial crisis. We supported small business and created three-quarters of a million jobs. These reforms will give the Australian finance and credit industry information-with the appropriate privacy protections-so that they can make more accurate risk assessments. More information-which will need to be more up to date and accurate under this bill-will assist both consumers and the credit reporting industry. It is expected that these reforms will lead to decreased levels of over-indebtedness and then lower credit default rates. For Australian businesses and the credit industry more comprehensive reporting will enable better management of capital and growth targets, improve credit decisions and enhance the effectiveness of how credit reporting agencies collect data. It is also expected to lead to more competition and efficiency in the credit market, which may in turn lead to more affordable credit and mortgage insurance for families and first home buyers. Credit providers will now have positive obligations to help consumers correct their credit information. It will be easier to make complaints about incorrect credit reporting information. The bill will also prohibit the collection of credit reporting information about individuals reasonably known to be under the age of 18. Businesses will get more information, particularly in relation to repayment history-but Labor will protect the privacy of this information. For example, given the sensitive nature of repayment history information, this information will only be available to credit providers who are subject to responsible lending obligations under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. In addition, repayment history information can only be retained for a rolling two-year period, rather than five years like most of the other information in the credit reporting more system. For families to fully utilise these new powers, they need to be able to get an enforceable remedy. That's why the Gillard Labor government is enhancing the powers of the Australian Privacy Commissioner to improve the commissioner's ability to resolve complaints, conduct investigations and promote privacy compliance. Under this bill, the Privacy Commissioner will be able to make a determination to direct an organisation to take specific steps to stop credit certain conduct, or take reasonable action to redress any loss or damage suffered. The commissioner will also be able to obtain enforceable undertakings from an organisation. A court can then make appropriate orders, including orders for compensation. The commissioner will also be able to apply to the court for a civil penalty order against organisations. Penalties range from 200 penalty units-$22,000 for an individual and $110,000 for a company-to 2,000 penalty units, which is $220,000 for an individual and $1.1 million for a company. For serious and repeated breaches of privacy, the penalty will be 2,000 penalty units. This is another remedy for consumers and will encourage compliance with the Privacy Act. The Privacy Commissioner will also be able to direct agencies to perform a privacy impact assessment, and will be able to conduct privacy performance assessments to check that agencies and organisations are complying with the Australian Privacy Principles. This bill will make dispute resolution simpler, quicker and cheaper. The commissioner will have a new power to recognise and approve an external dispute resolution scheme for credit reporting disputes. There are new conciliation provisions, so that conciliation can be a dispute resolution option. In essence, the Australian Privacy Commissioner will have new powers, including the power to seek enforceable remedies for consumers who have had their privacy breached. These are major reforms. They are major reforms which will help working Australians in practical ways-from correcting their credit information when apply for a loan, to making a complaint against a bank or telecommunications company. Labor is giving more power to individuals and to working families. The government is allowing industry and government agencies nine months to review and update their privacy policies and practices. That's why the bill will commence nine months after royal assent. Finally, I would like to thank all of the stakeholders who have worked so hard on these reforms since 2008. The government is looking forward to continuing to work with them on the regulations and the credit reporting code. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Combet. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",24
5,Mr COMBET,Unknown,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (09:29): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Gillard government has passed historic reforms to build a clean energy future which will strengthen the economy and protect our environment. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is a key part of the government's plan. It will encourage private investment and help overcome financial barriers to commercialising and deploying cleaner energy technologies. There is global recognition of the importance of moving to cleaner energy they sources. Due to its endowment and use of low-cost fossil fuels, Australia is a late starter in the transformation to clean technology. The clean energy future plan, along with the Renewable Energy Target, will cut carbon pollution and drive investment and innovation in clean energy technologies. This will ensure our economy and industries remain competitive in a world that is becoming carbon constrained. The transformation of our economy will be most evident in the electricity sector. It is expected that the sector will over time move away from coal fired generation to more renewable generation, with renewable energy growing from 10 per cent to 40 per cent of the generation mix by 2050, and conventional coal fired generation falling from 70 per cent to below 10 per cent; however, this will be a gradual transition. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will facilitate increased flows of finance into the clean energy sector to support this transformation, removing barriers that would otherwise prevent the financing of projects. Several factors can inhibit the financing of clean energy projects, including the current global financial conditions, the complex nature of Australia's electricity markets, the cost of renewable energy, the preference of investment institutions for listed assets and a limited track record of returns. Given the complexities involved, the Gillard government appointed an expert review panel to design the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The review was chaired by Ms Jillian Broadbent, an eminent Australian with extensive experience in the financial sector. The review recommended a framework for how the corporation should operate. The government is implementing recommendations through this bill. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will be independent from government, with no ability for the government to direct the corporation in relation to specific projects investment. This will ensure an independent decision-making process. The corporation will operate based on three principles. Firstly, the corporation is a mechanism to help mobilise private investment in renewable energy, low-emissions and energy efficiency projects and technologies in this country. The corporation will also invest in manufacturing businesses that provide inputs to the clean energy sector. The corporation will focus on catalysing private finance into Australia's clean energy sector. It will provide financial products and structures that address the financial barriers currently inhibiting private investment. Such facilitation is critical in transitioning the Australian energy market. To ensure the effectiveness of this capital mobilisation the corporation is expected to require private co-investment in projects. It is unlikely ever to be a sole financier. This approach will build investor experience and confidence in the clean energy sector. The corporation will invest at least half of its funds in renewable energy technologies. The other half will be available to fund energy efficiency and low-emissions technologies. Secondly, the corporation will apply a commercial filter when making its investment decisions. It will focus on projects and technologies at the later stages of development, consistent with the report of the expert review panel. The commercial filter will apply privatesector skills and disciplines to investment the selection. Having a public policy purpose, the corporation has different financial risk and return requirements and values any positive externalities from investments. For a given financial return, the corporation may for take on higher risk and, for a given level of risk, due to positive externalities, may accept a lower financial return. Thirdly, the corporation has the capacity to offer concessional finance and directly influence financial barriers that inhibit the financing of this sector. The individuality of each project necessitates a case-by-case approach. The corporation can tailor concessionality in each case and apply it through tenor or cost of finance. In setting the terms, the corporation will provide only the least generous terms required for a proposal to go ahead. Guaranteed funding The funding that the corporation will receive for making investments is set out in this bill. This will provide long-term support and continuity to the clean energy sector. The corporation will receive $2 billion per year for five years from 2013-14 through the special appropriation in this bill. The corporation will also be provided three years of funding through the annual appropriation bills to assist with the establishment and operations of the corporation. The corporation is intended to be selfsustaining once mature-that is, it will not require further assistance from the budget. Rather, the corporation's profits and funds returned from its investments will be available for reinvestment. To allow the corporation to focus on its primary function of investing in the clean energy sector, a special account is being created to manage surplus funds and limit the corporation's need to undertake a cash management function. This bill establishes mechanisms for flows of payments between the special account and the corporation that guarantees access to funds as needed to undertake its investment function. Board This bill establishes the Clean Energy Finance Corporation as a Commonwealth authority under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. The corporation will be managed by an independent board comprised of experts in areas such as banking, finance, economics and energy markets to ensure a robust and availability, rigorous organisation. The board will be appointed by the government and will be responsible for the management, operational and investment decisions of the corporation. The board will be responsible for appointing the chief executive officer, who will take on the day-today administration of the corporation under the directions of the board. The staff of the corporation will be well experienced to provide the necessary support to the board and CEO to determine the best investments and manage taxpayers' money appropriately. Investment mandate The government will also provide the board with an investment mandate that, when combined with the legislation, will set the parameters for its management of investments. This allows the board to develop its own investment strategy, in line with the government's broad directions. Similar to the Future Fund, this bill ensures the board is consulted on the investment mandate and its response tabled in parliament. The government expects the corporation to apply a commercial filter when making its investment decisions. Investments will focus on projects beyond the research and development stage, have a positive rate of return and have the capacity to repay capital. This approach will ensure the corporation invests responsibly and manages risk to achieve a targeted rate of return and ultimately be financially self-sufficient. Technologies with a track record have generally had fewer problems accessing finance as the financial market has experience with their risk/return metrics. As such the corporation is not expected to fund these projects. One example of this would be conventional gas which may technically be eligible for funding as a low-emissions technology. The government also intends on requiring the corporation to apply Australian industry participation plans through the investment mandate. Industry participation plans ensure Australian industry is afforded full, fair and reasonable opportunity to participate in projects. As a part of the clean energy future plan, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will complement other Australian government policies and programs. This includes the Renewable Energy Target, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), the Clean Technology Investment Program and the Clean Technology Innovation Program. It will be particularly important for the corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) to maintain an active ongoing dialogue as projects funded by ARENA provide a potential pipeline of projects for the corporation. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will bring to bear the utmost rigour in assessing its investments, but will also give effect to its important public policy objectives by facilitating transactions where financial barriers are inhibiting the mobilisation of private sector funds. Passing the legislation in enable the corporation to undertake the necessary preparations to commence its investment operations from 1 July 2013. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum to the bill and to the Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Bill 2012 and to the Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Bill 2012, and a corrigendum to the explanatory memorandum, presented by Mr Combet. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",27
6,Mr COMBET,Unknown,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (09:40): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill makes amendments to the Clean Energy Act 2011 and related acts. These amendments support the establishment of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. They also address commitments made by the government during the passage of the original legislation or are minor and technical amendments designed to improve the operation of the carbon pricing mechanism. Gaseous fuels During passage of the Clean Energy Act in 2011 the government, following consultation with industry, committed to consider the coverage of gaseous fuelswhich include liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas-in a similar way to how large liquid fuel users may be able to opt into the carbon this sitting will price mechanism. This commitment responded to representations by the gaseous fuels sector and to a recommendation made by the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Clean Energy Future Legislation. Today, following those consultations and the committee's recommendations, the government honours the commitment that we made, which provides the gaseous fuels sector with the flexibility it sought to meet its carbon price liabilities. The gaseous fuels sector has expressed a strong preference to be able to access the carbon market and be part of the emissions trading scheme that we have legislated. This is a similar preference that companies like Qantas and Virgin expressed to the government last year about their ability to be covered by the Clean Energy Act 2011. The government has consulted extensively with participants in the gaseous fuels sector to develop the approach proposed in this bill. From 1 July 2012, compressed natural gas, CNG, will be covered by the carbon pricing mechanism, rather than the fuel tax system. This bill, together with the Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Bill 2012 and the Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Bill 2012, which I will address and introduce shortly, give effect to that change. Furthermore, from 1 July 2013, LPG, liquefied petroleum gas, and LNG, liquefied natural gas, will be covered by the mechanism. A transitional period will allow the required administrative changes to be made by the industry, as well as within the Australian Taxation Office and the Clean Energy Regulator. The government has been working with industry on arrangements to streamline and reduce costs during this transitional period. CNG is covered from 2012, as I said, as it may be treated as natural gas for the purposes of the carbon price mechanism. These measures were notified to stakeholders and then announced in the 2012-13 budget. National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 The bill also amends the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 to enhance its operation for reporting entities. A person with 'operational control' of a facility is generally responsible for carbon price liability and associated reporting obligations. Where operational control is not clear, a nomination may be made. The bill streamlines the requirements for nomination. Annual nominations will no longer be required and nominations may last for as long as required. The bill provides that the regulator only needs to publish a 'net energy consumption'. An additional requirement to publish 'total energy consumption' is removed. The 'net energy consumption' requirement is more appropriate because it does not include the transformation of one energy commodity into another. Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011 The bill also makes technical amendments to the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011 to ensure the robustness of the processes supporting the Carbon Farming Initiative. The bill maintains the integrity of the Carbon Farming Initiative by requiring that projects have secured all required regulatory approvals before they receive any credits. It simplifies the process of finalising methodology determinations by clarifying the material to be used by the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee in making determinations. The bill provides more time to approve methodologies for existing projects to facilitate the transition of these projects into the CFI. Methodologies submitted for assessment by the middle of 2012, and approved by the middle of 2013, can be backdated to the middle of 2010 and that will improve the operation of the Carbon Farming Initiative for project proponents. Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011 The bill amends the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011 to enhance the security of the registry. The bill increases the amount of time during which the Clean Energy Regulator may defer giving effect to a transfer instruction from 48 hours to five business days, giving the regulator time to make decisions about deferral and deal with suspicious transactions. The bill also provides for conditions restricting or limiting the operation of certain accounts to apply in circumstances. Clean Energy Finance Corporation As I indicated earlier, the bill amends legislation establishing the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Regulator to provide for the appropriate sharing of information between those agencies and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. These amendments will enhance the operation of the carbon pricing mechanism and support the establishment of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, whose establishing bill I previously introduced to the House. I commend this amendment bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Combet.

7,Mr COMBET,Unknown,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (09:47): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill is part of a package of bills amending certain aspects of the Clean Energy Future plan that I referred to in the two previous matters on notice. As announced in the 2012-13 budget, compressed natural gas (CNG) used for nontransport purposes will be now included in the carbon pricing mechanism from 1 July 2012. This changes the originally proposed treatment of compressed natural gas, which was to be subject to the effective carbon prescribed price using the fuel tax system. This bill will amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to achieve the same outcome as amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 made by the Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Bill 2012 but for imported compressed natural gas.

National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Plibersek. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",32
9,Ms PLIBERSEK,Unknown," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2012 will amend the National Health Act 1953 to support the operation of a more efficient Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The PBS is a major government health program with expenditure expected to reach $9.7 billion in 2012-13. The bill reflects the Gillard government's commitment to ongoing improvement of Australia's health system to ensure that every health dollar continues to be used as effectively as possible. The bill is also in keeping with the statement of principles signed by the government with industry and consumer organisations in September 2011. The main amendments in this bill relate to the pricing structure for PBS medicines. From 1 October 2012, PBS prices will be expressed at ex manufacturer level based on one price for each pharmaceutical item. This is instead of pricing at approved price to pharmacists which includes the ex manufacturer price and a wholesale margin. This will create uniform pricing for all brands of a medicine across different PBS programs and mechanisms of supply. The new pricing structure will be carried through to all functions involving PBS prices, including calculating the Commonwealth price for subsidies, provisions for price disclosure, and applying 2012 price reductions. Current arrangements-nature of the problem Under the current legislation, the price of a PBS medicine includes a margin for the wholesaler, but this margin varies depending on the price of the medicine. A percentage rate applies for less expensive items and changes to a flat fee for very expensive items over $1,000. The margin also varies depending on where a medicine is supplied. For example, the margin is different for supply of a medicine through a community pharmacy or a hospital. For some PBS supplies there is no wholesale margin. In this circumstance, a notional approved price to pharmacists is used to satisfy the requirement to price at that level. This is further confused by different PBS pricing calculations applying at different points in the pricing process. For example, statutory price reductions apply to the approved price to pharmacists, but price disclosure calculations take place at manufacturer price level. In essence, the difficulties arise because the approved price to pharmacists is not at the beginning of the pricing sequence and is no longer suitable as the core PBS pricing level. This means that pricing amounts continually need to be converted administratively between the two pricing levels. This is cumbersome. It can create inconsistencies due to rounding and it increases the risk of error in PBS listing pricing processes. Amendments The amendments in the bill remove the concept of approved price to pharmacists, as the level at which pricing agreements are made, and replace it with approved ex manufacturer price-the price set at the beginning of the process. In doing so, only one ex manufacturer price will need to be agreed or determined for a brand of pharmaceutical item-by reference to the quantity in the lowest PBS pack size for any brand of the item. The price for different pack sizes of any brand will then be calculated from the approved ex manufacturer price as a proportional ex manufacturer price. There are many provisions and functions in the act that currently rely on approved price to pharmacists. They will work equally well, or better, using ex manufacturer prices. For example, the bill also amends provisions for calculating the Commonwealth price, the 16 per cent price reductions for new brand listings, and price disclosure, so they operate using ex manufacturer prices. However, the processes for undertaking those calculations remain effectively the same. The Commonwealth price includes the manufacturer price, wholesale margin, pharmacy or hospital mark-ups, and pharmacy dispensing and other fees. It is the amount which determines the government subsidy and the safety net amount for the patient. Wholesale mark-ups will continue to be based on the pricing provisions in the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement. They will be included in the existing legislative instrument that determines the manner for calculating the Commonwealth price. In and moving from approved price to pharmacists to approved ex manufacturer price, the pharmacy level price, which includes the wholesale mark-up, will now be referred to as the price to pharmacists or PTP. The new pricing arrangements will still allow for a premium or special patient contribution to be claimed by companies in addition to the amount the Commonwealth is willing to agree for a subsidy. As is currently the case, this becomes the additional amount payable by the patient for higher priced brands. Transitional-convert to ex manufacturer prices Transitional provisions in the bill set out the method for converting current PBS prices to an ex manufacturer amount. This involves the applicable wholesale margin being subtracted from each price in force on the day before the commencement date. For over 98 per cent of the 2,400 pharmaceutical items on the PBS, the conversion calculation will result in a single ex manufacturer price for the quantity in the lowest pack size. For those items, the converted price is expected to become the approved ex manufacturer price. Indicative ex manufacturer prices calculated using this method will be made available publicly on the PBS website by the end of May, with notice of this being provided to all companies and other stakeholders. This gives companies over six weeks to review prices and discuss them with the department before they need to be finalised for 1 October 2012. A small number of conversion calculations from current prices will result multiple prices, so adjustments will be necessary to achieve a uniform ex manufacturer price. This will occur for around 40 pharmaceutical items, which is less than two per cent of total PBS items. For many of those 40 items, the difference in price will be only one or two cents. The legislation provides that, where a price change is required, the new price may be negotiated with companies or, failing this, a default price will apply. All pharmaceutical companies with a listed brand of an item requiring any price adjustment will be contacted by the department and invited to negotiate a new price on a case-by-case basis. The transitional arrangements are designed to achieve new prices that are as close to equivalent to current prices as possible, either directly or through new agreements. There are no savings associated with this proposal. The intention is that the move to the new pricing structure will have a neutral effect on PBS prices overall, and no impact on PBS expenditure. For the vast majority of negotiations, the Commonwealth will advise companies of a weighted average price for the item based on prices and volumes of supply of different pack sizes or supply via different PBS programs. Once a new price is agreed it will apply for all brands. The weighted price has not been legislated as the new price for these items because it would not produce the best result in all situations. Importantly, it would not provide the necessary flexibility for negotiating based on individual circumstances where appropriate. The aim is not to get a price reduction, but to arrive at an average across existing prices that is most representative of in the effective PBS price and, thus, give the most neutral pricing impact. However, for the PBS to operate, all listed products must have a known price. In the event that a price is not negotiated for an item, a default price which is the lowest of the converted ex manufacturer prices for the item will apply. In a very small number of cases, about 11 items, the method in the bill does not arrive at the current lowest ex manufacturer price. For these items, the default will be set in the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Regulations. Reliance on a default price is not the government's preferred method. The bill makes clear that a negotiated price will always take precedence over a converted default price. Nonetheless, the default provision is important and necessary to ensure continuity for the PBS. Once an approved ex manufacturer price is in place, prices for different pack sizes of those items will be calculated proportionally. For all brands, the price for the same quantity is the same. Premiums on transition Where brands currently have claimed prices resulting in premiums or special patient contributions, those premiums are expected to remain very similar to current amounts. Claimed prices will be converted to ex manufacturer level by applying a change equivalent to the change in the approved price. This is the same approach used for premiums affected by statutory price reductions and price disclosure. Companies can discuss with the department any impact on a premium resulting from a converted price. If a new ex manufacturer price is negotiated for an item, the existing premium for a brand can also be adjusted. Single brand combination pharmaceutical items will need new price agreements as there are special considerations when pricing these medicines. The new prices will be negotiated taking into account the converted ex manufacturer portion of the component drug prices. In keeping with agreements The government understands importance of the agreements it has with pharmaceutical industry, consumer, wholesaler and pharmacy bodies. When the expanded price disclosure arrangements were put in place, it was as a result of the policies negotiated with industry in the 2010 memorandum of understanding between the government and Medicines Australia. Consistent with this government's approach to partnering with industry, the amendments in this bill formed part of the 2011 statement of principles of commitment between stakeholders. This was signed by the government, the Consumers Health Forum, the Generic Medicines Industry Association and Medicines Australia. The amendments in this bill are in keeping with those agreements and honour commitments made in good faith. The transitional arrangements regarding negotiation of prices are true to the method described in the statement of principles. Timing Each year there are generally three price change dates-in April, August and December. Transitioning to the new structure in October, a month that is not normally subject to pricing changes, will reduce complexity for industry and provide transparency for any price differences. In the event that a company wishes to pursue a price that is different from the 1 October pricing outcome, they will of course be able to use the usual price change processes for 1 December 2012. Relevance of the changes-a better more efficient PBS This bill recognises that pricing practices the that have grown up with the PBS and served us well in the past are no longer the best fit for the many different subsidy and supply arrangements in use now. The changes will support improved pricing practices generally, and more efficient application of price disclosure across an increasing number of PBS medicines. The bill also contains a technical change which will improve the efficiency of listing medicines on the PBS for supply only via PBS prescriber bags. Industry cooperation and acknowledgement This legislation is due in no small part to the commitment shown by the pharmaceutical industry to support pricing changes needed to improve the efficiency of the PBS pricing structure. It also reflects the support of consumer, wholesaler and pharmacy groups. Implementation will rely on government and industry working together to achieve the outcomes needed to fulfil the undertakings given on both sides in the agreements. I have asked my department to work with pharmaceutical companies so that, in the relatively small number of cases where prices need to change, the effects are shared between companies, and with government, as evenly as possible. Summary-efficiency and benefits Sound pricing arrangements are vital to the PBS. In effect, the pharmaceutical industry has always used ex manufacturer prices. There are benefits for the government and users if the PBS does the same. The new pricing structure will improve the application of current PBS policies with no change to the operation of the scheme for patients, pharmacies and suppliers. There is no effect on PBS funding, on the medicines listed on the scheme, nor access to them. However, the benefits from better, more efficient PBS practices will flow on indirectly to all users of the PBS-and that is a good outcome for everyone. I am confident that, based on the goodwill shown thus far, that result will be delivered. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Clare. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",33
10,Mr CLARE,Unknown,"Blaxland-Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (10:05): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Passenger Movement Charge Act 1978 to increase the rate of the passenger movement charge by $8 to $55 per passenger. This will take effect from 1 July 2012. The charge will also be indexed annually by movements in the consumer price index from 1 July 2013. This increase was announced by the Treasurer in the 2012-13 budget. The increase will fund the establishment of the Asia Marketing Fund that was also announced in the budget. Sixty-one million dollars will be allocated to the fund, which is aimed at supporting the promotion of Australia to growing markets in Asia as a premium holiday and business travel destination. It is estimated that, in less than a decade, there will be 100 million outbound travellers per annum from China alone. This fund will help promote Australia as a touring and business destination in this important market. The passenger movement charge was increased in 1999, 2001 and 2008. Annual indexation of the charge will ensure the charge maintains pace with inflation. This is in line with a number of other charges levied by the Commonwealth. It will also provide certainty to the tourism industry about future increases. The charge is mostly collected by airlines and shipping companies at the same time a ticket is sold, and remitted to the Commonwealth. The increase and future CPI increases will only apply to tickets sold on or after 1 July 2012. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment (Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Tony Burke. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",37
11,Mr BURKE,Unknown,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities) (10:07): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act 2005. It implements the response of the Standing Council on Environment and Water, comprising environment ministers from the Commonwealth, state and governments, to the 2010 independent review of the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards scheme. This independent review, which considered the first five years of the scheme's operation, was a requirement under the act. The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards, or WELS, scheme was established by the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act 2005 as part of the Council of Australian Governments' National Water Initiative. The WELS scheme is also supported by complementary state and territory legislation to ensure comprehensive national coverage. The WELS scheme's objectives are to conserve water supplies by reducing water consumption, to provide information for purchasers of water use and water saving products, and to promote the adoption of efficient and effective water use and water saving technologies. Products currently in the scheme include clothes washing machines, dishwashers, showers, toilets and tap equipment. All of these products must be registered and labelled with a water efficiency rating. The rating is zero to six stars, with six stars indicating the most water efficient products. The labels inform consumer purchasing decisions in the same way as energy rating labels on electrical appliances. The scheme currently also sets minimum water efficiency standards for toilets and clothes washing machines. Water, A number of state and territory programs reference WELS water efficiency ratings, which provide a convenient and authoritative source for setting rebates and prescribing water efficiency requirements. The independent review considered the appropriateness, effectiveness and efficiency of the scheme. Consultation was undertaken territory with state and territory governments, water utilities, industry and consumer representatives. The review concluded that the WELS scheme is a good policy and that its objectives are appropriate. The review cited research estimating that the scheme would reduce national water consumption by a total of 800 gigalitres by 2021. The review made 41 recommendations, including recommendations concerning governance, compliance, administration and funding arrangements. In November 2011, the Standing Council on Environment and Water endorsed the bulk of the recommendations. It also approved a new three-year strategic plan for the scheme and determined that 80 per cent of the scheme's costs between 2012 and 2015 should be recovered from industry, with the remaining 20 per cent to be provided by governments. As shown in the review, this level of cost recovery is consistent with the ratio set for the scheme at its commencement in 2005. This bill will provide the basis to implement the decisions by the standing council. It also makes some other refinements to the bill to improve the scheme's efficiency and effectiveness. The bill will enable the Commonwealth minister, through a disallowable ministerial determination, to determine more of the detailed arrangements for the scheme than previously. This differs from the current position in that some aspects of the scheme, such as the five-year period for product registration, are entrenched in the act and corresponding state and territory legislation. Under the amended act, it will be easier to adjust matters of this kind without the need to amend nine sets of legislation. Agreement from a majority of state and territory governments will be required before the determination can be made. Once this bill is enacted, a new ministerial determination will be developed. It will include revised registration and fee arrangements, and other changes such as removing the requirement for gazettal of registration decisions and instead specifying that the decisions will be published on the WELS website. The changes will deliver improvements not only for the scheme's administration, but also for industry. The improvements include simplifying and streamlining product registration processes so that these are easier for registrants, and providing a common expiry date for all registrations so that retailers will know when the registrations of products they supply are due to expire. The bill will also introduce a broader range of compliance and enforcement options. Consistent with recommendations from the 2010 independent review, it introduces civil penalties to match existing criminal offences and remakes some of the existing criminal offences for clarity. The bill also provides for orders to be given to persons that they remedy their non-compliance with the act. An example would be to order the replacement of an inaccurate WELS rating label with the correct label. In this way the act's objective of providing information for purchasers of water using products can be better achieved. WELS labelling plays an important role in consumer purchasing decisions. The scheme also receives widespread support from the industries affected by it. This bill has been developed taking into account extensive consultations with stakeholders as to the nature of the changes proposed. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Higher Education Support Amendment (Student Contribution Amounts and Other Measures) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Bird. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",38
12,Ms BIRD,Unknown,"Cunningham-Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (10:13): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Higher Education Support Amendment (Student Contribution Amounts and Other Measures) Bill 2012 amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to increase the maximum student contribution amount for units of study in mathematics, statistics and science from 1 January 2013. the The bill removes eligibility for Commonwealth supported places and the Higher Education Loan Program schemes for Australian citizens who would not be resident in Australia. To support continued growth in the higher education sector, the government is increasing the maximum student contribution amount for units of study in mathematics, statistics and science from 2013. All students will pay the same student contribution amount for maths and science units of study regardless of when they commenced their course of study. The government believes the reduction in student contributions for maths and science that commenced for students starting a course of study from 1 January 2009 was not delivering value for money. The majority of students undertaking maths and science units in 2009 and 2010 were not enrolled in a maths or science course of study, nor were they studying an education course. It is clear the policy was not substantially increasing the number of maths and science graduates in the workforce as intended and it was not improving the supply of quality maths and science teachers. In 2011, the Prime Minister asked the Chief Scientist, Professor Ian Chubb AC, to advise on ways to encourage increased enrolments in mathematics, statistics and science courses at university and school. The government considered the Chief Scientist's advice and announced a $54 million response as part of the 2012-13 budget to improve student engagement in maths and science. To improve the supply of qualified graduates entering maths and science teaching at school, the government will fund projects and courses that improve the quality of teacher training. To ensure the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute (AMSI) continues to provide support to mathematics researchers and students, the government will fund AMSI to provide scholarships and a range of intensive short courses for later year university maths students. The government will also fund innovative partnerships between universities and schools that are experiencing difficulty in engaging students in science and maths, have poor outcomes in maths and science, or have low numbers of students going on to further study in these disciplines. These initiatives ensure universities receive more money to support the teaching of maths and science so Australia has people highly skilled in these disciplines. This will be critical to developing a knowledge based economy and ensuring future generations are also equipped with these skills. The government is removing eligibility for Commonwealth supported places and the HELP schemes for Australian citizens who do not reside in Australia. The government believes its funding priority should be to support those students who are most likely to pursue careers in Australia, repay their HELP debts and use their education to benefit Australia's workforce and economic needs. Students undertaking study as part of a formal exchange or who are engaged in a study abroad program for some of the units in their course, including those students receiving assistance through the OS HELP scheme, will not be affected by this change. The estimated number of people who may be affected by this change is relatively small. However, with the removal of all limits on the number of undergraduate places in bachelor level courses and growth in online delivery of courses, it is important to clarify the eligibility conditions for Commonwealth support before there is further growth in the number of students who do not live in Australia and are being assisted by the government. There are around three-quarters of a million Australians living overseas permanently or long term. In the last three years over 120,000 Australians left the country with the intention of permanently residing overseas. The government does not believe it is appropriate that they continue to receive large subsidies toward obtaining a higher education degree from an Australian university while they are overseas. The small number of students who are not resident in Australia and are currently enrolled in Commonwealth supported places or are accessing HELP will continue to be eligible for the schemes for the duration of their current course. This amendment complements last year's changes to the act clarifying that Australian citizens are not entitled to Commonwealth support or to access HELP when they are undertaking courses of study primarily at an overseas campus. Debate adjourned. National Vocational Education and Training Regulator (Charges) Bill Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",39
13,Ms BIRD,Unknown,"Cunningham-Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (10:19): I take this opportunity firstly to thank the members who spoke on the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator (Charges) Bill 2012. This government fully recognises the critical role the VET sector plays in building our nation and our society. The challenge is for the VET sector to be responsive to the need for economic growth and increase productivity through skills and the need for a more mobile workforce ready to adapt to changing economic needs across state boundaries. The Australian Skills Quality Authority began operations on 1 July 2011 as the national regulator for the VET sector. The commencement of ASQA is a great achievement and represents one of the most significant reforms of the VET sector in the past two decades. It has come about through the cooperative effort of state and territory governments and the Australian government as well as real commitment from the VET sector for this reform. This bill is the final piece of establishing legislation for ASQA and will enable ASQA to implement part of the cost-recovery model recommended by the Council of Australian Governments in December 2009. The costrecovery arrangements were subject to extensive consultation in 2011, and the proposed fee and charge structure, including the consultation process, is explained in a cost-recovery impact statement which has been publicly available since the commencement of ASQA. Under the risk assessment process used by ASQA, high-risk registered training organisations assessed as having a greater 2012 risk of non-compliance will be monitored more closely. This bill enables ASQA to recover reasonable costs and expenses associated with additional monitoring activities of these organisations, as well as the costs of investigating substantiated complaints. It is important that ASQA is adequately resourced and appropriate that the costs of ensuring a quality VET system are borne by the organisations that benefit from the system. I note that the Senate Economics Legislation Committee tabled its report on the bill on 10 May 2012 and, having examined the provisions of the bill and the submissions made to the inquiry, recommends that the bill should be passed in its current form. The committee's report raised a couple of issues around the need to ensure transparency and clarity of charges and that regional and rural training providers are not disadvantaged by the charges. The cost-recovery impact statement clearly articulated the design of the charges and makes it clear that regional and rural providers will not be disadvantaged when compared to their metropolitan counterparts. This bill reflects the government's continued commitment to working with governments and stakeholders to continually improve the quality and consistency of training across the VET sector. A strong, nationally consistent regulatory framework is a key step in achieving this, and I commend the bill to the House.",41

15,Ms BIRD,Unknown,"Cunningham-Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (10:31): by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (10:32): I rise on this occasion to speak on this bill, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012, to follow up the excellent speeches, particularly that given by the member for Bradfield, regarding the concerns that people have about trade union members being appointed by their trade unions to serve on the board of superannuation industry funds. Particular attention was paid by several members to one Mr Wally Curran. We are very much indebted to Mr Hedley Thomas from the Australian and his report of 18 May, and also to Mr David Crowe of the Financial Review, for both dealing with the question of what occurred with the meatworkers union, a union of relatively low-paid union members-which does seem to be a track record in this parliament, where lowly paid members are sustaining a very high lifestyle of senior union operatives. In this case, Mr Curran was on the board of the superannuation fund for the meatworkers union and they had a total of $350 million invested, which meant that individual members of that union only had a super fund worth about $18,000. What occurred is that over the years Mr Curran took tens of thousands of undisclosed dollars from one Austcorp, a company to which that superannuation fund then lent $30 million. Mr Hedley Thomas, in two excellent articles, outlines what a risky venture it was. The article said: The meatworkers' superannuation fund was one of the biggest losers after Austcorp's failure because most of the $30m invested could not be recovered. Indeed, their total assets are said now to be something like $50,000 and are pieces of artwork. The creditors are likely to get less than half of one cent in the dollar. Mr Curran, in the usual way that trade members seem to act when they have been caught out, said he had done nothing improper. He had taken tens of thousands of dollars from this Austcorp corporation, and then lent it $30 million out of a total of the $350 million they had invested. These are lowly paid meat workers, who had their money lent to risky ventures. These articles go on to say: … while the payments were not disclosed to the 30,000-strong membership of the superannuation fund, the board wasapparentlyaware of the arrangement. There was another person identified in the article, a Mr Jon Addison, who said yesterday there was nothing untoward in him or Mr Curran receiving payments from Austcorp-the corporation to which they paid the $30 million by way of loans. And they have lost the lot. We then go to this bill itself. We are, again, obliged to Mr David Crowe of the Financial Review, who writes about yet another trade union heavy who is now a member of parliament and who is now the minister concerned. He writes that the proposals for dealing with recalcitrant trade union members of the trust superannuation fund go as follows: The proposed measures would also require directors to face renewal every three years, acting on concerns that some trustees, nominated by unions or employer groups, can sit on the same funds for decades without facing a vote. Yet the new rules may not impose tough sanctions on trustees who fail to disclose their conflicts, relying instead on the regulator to rectify a situation after it has been identified. Trustees will be asked to reveal any payments they receive on a conflicts register held by the super fund, the new rules state. A breach of the rules, such as the failure to disclose remuneration or shareholdings, would not lead APRA to levy a fine or other penalty on a trustee. Instead, the regulator would instruct the trustee to meet the original obligations. If the instructions were ignored, APRA could seek fines or other penalties. In other words, there would be a slap over the wrist from a minister with a heavy background in the trade union movement. He is now the minister in charge of superannuation and is looking after his union mates sitting as trustees on superannuation.",43
16,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," I remind the member for Mackellar that she has been in this place long enough to know standing order 90, which says that imputations of improper motives to a member and personal reflections on members are highly disorderly. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sorry if you think saying someone is a trade union heavy is a reflection on them.",44
17,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The member knows that that is not what I was referring to. The member will return to the bill. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: The article goes on: of the Severe cases could lead the regulator to ask the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to consider charges. The ACTU said the arrangements reported at the meat industry fund were ""highly unusual""'Highly unusual'! Isn't that interesting. The meat workers, 30,000 of them, lost $30 million, and it is 'highly unusual'but would be stamped out under the new persuasion of the governance regime. But it will not be. The important thing we have to see here is that there seems to be one rule for people who are engaged in industry funds with trade union appointees and another rule for people engaged in retail funds. I think that the need to have far greater scrutiny of trade unions is starting to manifest itself. The Labor Party and the government like to tell us that the HSU is a single rotten apple in the barrel. But it is not. We have seen what has gone on with the HSU because of the FWA report. We have seen what has happened with Mr Wally Curran and the meatworkers union, and for this we are grateful to some journalists who are usually attacked by the Australian Labor Party and the government because they write for the Australian. And then there were the actions, which were never pursued either, of Mr Bruce Wilson of the AWU. So the suggestion that the HSU is a single rotten apple in the barrel is just not true. There are clearly systemic problems, and we are going to have to have far more penetrating legislation to try to clean up the mess.",44
18,Mr SHORTEN,Unknown,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (10:40): I thank most of the members who participated in the debate on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012. Trust and transparency are critical to the maintenance of confidence in our superannuation system. The Labor government has made and will make long-term decisions to improve transparency in the governance of superannuation and financial services. These long-term decisions include banning the payment of sales commissions to financial advisers. The recent inquiry of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into the Trio collapse noted that hefty commissions were paid to an adviser who recommended Trio products and that some of the advice provided may contravene the government's new best interests hurdle. Yet those opposite, including the member for North Sydney and the member for Mackellar, did nothing to stamp out conflicts of interest in financial planning when they had the chance. Why did they not, as part of the Financial Services Reform Act of 2001, ban commissions? Why did those opposite, when they were in government, fail to introduce a new duty for advisers to put the interests of investors first? The same goes for governance and superannuation. Those opposite, when they were in government, had ample opportunity to improve governance standards for superannuation. But the record shows that those opposite, whilst they talk about governance and superannuation, failed to act time and time again. In fact, some of the governance examples cited by the member for Mayo in his attack on funds in his speech on this bill appear to have happened on the Howard government's watch. It was disappointing to read the speeches on this bill by the member for Mayo, the member for Forde and the member for Bradfieldand I suspect that, when I read the Hansard of the member for Mackellar's speech, it will fall into the same disappointing category. The divisive and extreme views put forward in these speeches echo the extreme and divisive views held by the Leader of the Opposition. It seems that the standard tactic of those opposite is to fill speeches with extreme rhetoric in an attempt to disguise their lack of policy. They have no policy to boost superannuation savings and create wealth for millions of Australians, no policy to help better management of people's savings when they enter retirement and no policy to boost Australia as a financial services centre. Too much time is spent, I am afraid, on the attack rather than on looking for the positives. Their negative rhetoric shows how out of touch some of those opposite are with the concerns of fund members and those who work in the financial services industry. The all-out assault by those opposite on a legitimate segment of the industry funds market ignores a statistic that is at the heart of members concerns-long-term investment performance. That is how little some of those opposite understand superannuation. This government has plans, which it will continue to deliver on, to boost the superannuation wealth of Australians, to make the superannuation system more efficient and transparent and to create jobs and growth in our financial services sector. These plans include the measures in this bill as well as future legislation. The measures contained in this bill implement changes recommended by the Cooper review into the governance, efficiency, structure and operation of Australia's superannuation system. They impact 216 registrable superannuation entity licensees. New requirements for trustees and directors will improve trustee decisions and fund efficiency and effectiveness, thereby helping to grow the superannuation entitlements of members and confidence in the system. I thank Paul Costello, who chaired the consultation panel that has advised the government on how best to implement the Stronger Super package of which these reforms are an important part. I also thank the hard working team from APRA and Treasury which has been involved in the development of this important legislation. The amendments in schedule 1 of the bill apply new duties to trustees, including: exercising the same degree of care, skill and diligence as a prudent superannuation trustee; acting fairly in dealing with classes of beneficiaries and beneficiaries within a class; and, where a conflict exists, giving priority to the duties to and the interests of beneficiaries over other persons. Trustees will have expanded requirements in relation to their investment strategies. They will have a new requirement to develop an insurance strategy and a risk management strategy for members of their fund and to maintain financial resources either as trustee capital as fund reserves to cover the operational risks of the funds they manage. In most cases trustees are corporations that have a board of directors. The Cooper review of the super system was concerned that there are difficulties for the directors corporate trustees in understanding what is expected of them and that, as the industry consolidates, conflicts of interests and duty may arise more regularly. Importantly, the bill identifies clearly the duties that individuals who are directors or corporate trustees of superannuation funds, including acting honestly and in the best interests of members. This is an important new requirement: a new duty is being applied to individual directors to act honestly and to have members' interests at the forefront of their minds. Trustees who are authorised by APRA to offer a MySuper product will also have additional obligations, reflecting that members have effectively delegated all decisions for their superannuation to the trustee. There will be a primary obligation to promote the financial interests of members of the MySuper product-in particular, returns after the deduction of fees, costs and taxes. The bill contains an obligation for trustees to determine that there is sufficient scale. Where a trustee determines that assets or member numbers are insufficient, the trustee will need to take appropriate action to rectify the insufficiency so that they continue to meet their general obligation to promote the financial interests of beneficiaries. APRA will consult with industry to provide prudential guidance on processes trustees could adopt to form a determination and relevant considerations for trustees in rectifying insufficient scale. It is not intended that trustees will be or required to make detailed comparisons of their performance against every other fund in the market. It is expected that many large funds will be able to determine quickly that scale is not a problem for them. It is expected that many well-performing funds of will also be able to determine readily that the members are not being disadvantaged due to insufficient scale. However, small poorlyperforming funds will need to consider actively whether insufficient scale is a factor apply to impeding their performance. Schedule 2 to the bill will provide APRA with the ability to make prudential standards. APRA already has this ability in banking and insurance. Prudential standards will provide APRA with greater flexibility to adapt effectively to industry developments in superannuation and the ability to provide regulated entities with clearer and more tailored legal requirements. APRA released draft prudential standards on 27 April and is consulting on them until 20 July this year. The provisions introducing the power to make prudential standards will apply from the date of royal assent. Duties for trustees and directors, including those offering MySuper products, will apply from 1 July 2013. I am committed to reforming the governance and supervision of our superannuation system and will be bringing further changes before the parliament. These will include additional disclosure requirements for trustees, enhanced data collection and publication powers for APRA and also rules for financial advice charges deducted from members' accounts and charging for intrafund advice. The government has a strong track record in improved transparency, including in relation to the future of financial advice reforms, implementing MySuper and the Productivity Commission inquiry into the selection and ongoing assessment of default superannuation funds in modern awards. The Productivity Commission will develop transparent and objective criteria against which funds wishing to be eligible for default fund status in modern awards can be assessed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the best interests of members are met if their superannuation contributions are allocated to a default fund under the modern award. I will continue to work with industry and people of goodwill to ensure that superannuation trustees adopt best practice in terms of governance and transparency. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",44
19,Mr BILSON,Unknown," I move: (1) Schedule 1, item 9, page 6 (lines 1 omit paragraphs 29VN(b) and (c). [obligations of trustee] This amendment was foreshadowed by my friend and colleague the shadow Treasurer and member for North Sydney, I reflect on the fact that a key issue raised by the coalition in the second reading debate was not addressed adequately in the minister's summation. I am hopeful that he may be able to provide some small insight into the government's thinking. Our amendment relates to the scale test for MySuper funds that is contained in new sections 29VN(b) and (c). This requires trustees to determine on an annual basis that there is sufficient scale in terms of assets and beneficiaries such as not to disadvantage the financial interests of beneficiaries relative to the financial interests of beneficiaries in MySuper products held and operated by other funds. Just to explain our thinking here, an otherwise perfectly acceptable fund that satisfies all of APRA's requirements in terms of prudential standards- its governance, its investment performance, its commitment to the best interests of beneficiaries, its fees and its returns-must now pass an additional scale test in order to be an acceptable provider of a MySuper product where they can be authorised by APRA to be one of the default funds that the minister talked about. Essentially what is happening here in the opposition's view is that the government is seeking to legislate to provide for an unsubstantiated presumption that, when it comes to super, bigger is best. This is the only policy rationale that seems to be driving the government's actions-that somehow bigger is best and that, invariably, larger funds provide for lower fees and higher returns. Sadly, there is no evidence to substantiate that assumption, yet that presumption is now being legislated in what the government is providing. So here we to 20), have a presumption, with no basis of evidence, being injected into this framework. It is clear that a number of smaller funds, as the shadow Treasurer outlined, can be more nimble and better able to exploit market opportunities and in this way actually provide returns superior to those that are offered by larger, less flexible and less agile funds. At best, we think this provision seems redundant because the minister outlined all of the new requirements and touched on the best interests of members and how those are enshrined and then the prudential framework that APRA would be putting in place. But now there is this additional test, We are concerned that that may confer an advantage on larger industry superannuation funds that is simply not substantiated and not justified by the facts and that these larger funds simply get a head start because they are large, not reflecting on any of the performance criteria or governance or prudential requirements that the minister spent a few moments talking about. We are concerned that this would have an adverse impact on competition and would represent a new, unjustified barrier to new entrants, and interestingly the coalition is not alone. It should come as no surprise to the minister that these are concerns shared right across the sector by stakeholders. The minister spoke about being prepared to work with people of goodwill to further develop this framework, yet clearly he has not been listening to the input he has been getting, and in fact this input should come as no surprise. It was input that was provided when there was draft legislation prepared and it is input that has been reflected in the parliamentary joint committee. Even the union-controlled Industry Super Network commented, 'We agree that the scale test is problematic.' We then saw the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia concur with that view: 'We believe the current wording of the scale test is problematic.' They urge that the scale test be reviewed. Mercer, one of the larger funds, which might have thought it would be advantaged by this, itself identified that 'the scale test is not needed if the trustees have the responsibility to act in the member's best interest'. If all of the safeguards that the minister alluded to are to have any value and utility at all, the scale test becomes completely redundant. The Financial Services Council identified that the scale test should not be in the law. It said: Not only is it a barrier to entry but the test, as suggested in the current drafting, is very a scale test. subjective, very open. There is nobody we can find who actually thinks this scale test adds anything whatsoever. Mr Shorten interjecting",47
20,Mr BILSON,Unknown,"Sorry, I stand corrected. The minister put his hand up and said there is one person who thinks it is a good idea: it is the minister. We are blessed that he has such wisdom and foresight to share when everyone else active in the sector-all those people he urges to be consulted-do not think so. So we think this is redundant and should be removed. (Time expired)",48
21,Mr SHORTEN,Unknown,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (10:54): I thank the member for Dunkley for his contribution, but I want to reassure him that, by having a test about scale, we do not assume that big is automatically best. I also want to assure him that small, well-performing funds will be able to demonstrate that size is not impeding their performance. So I hope that puts some of his concerns to rest. I also heard him say that he felt that the government was not listening to the contribution of those opposite. When we talk about scale and the problems that they say there are with scale, I might go to what the member for Bradfield specifically said: Secondly, the scale test, which is one of the centrepieces of this reform, does not make good sense in economic logic or day-today practice. He said it was a bad idea. He has also unfairly accused me of being slow to act on the Cooper review, when in fact that is not the case. We responded to the Cooper review in December 2010, within a fewMr Billson interjecting",48
22,Mr SHORTEN,Unknown,"No, the member for Bradfield mentioned that. Thank you, Member for Dunkley. He said that we had failed to respond comprehensively to the Cooper review. Let me say that the scale test is a classic example of detail contradicting the rhetoric of those opposite. In the Cooper review it was recommendation 1.6(b). So the Cooper review, which the government has been accused of not following, explicitly called for the scale test. In fact, I wonder if some of those opposite have even read the full Cooper review. They also showed this lack of attention to detail when they argued that the opt-in arrangement in our financial reforms was an industry fund plot. I think it is fair to say of the contemporary opposition that, whereas they can no longer find any reds under the beds and are still looking for the Greens under the beds, they are certainly convinced that industry funds are under the beds engaging in some sort of takeover of Australia, which is unfair. I think the attack on industry funds is also terribly unfair to many of the trustee directors who serve on industry funds. I would point out that Peter Collins, former Liberal leader in New South Wales, is a director of an industry. fund. I think that when those opposite attack industry funds-be it in the bilious attack by the member for Mackellar or the comments of the member for Dunkley, or indeed others-they are attacking a lot of hard working employer reps, union reps and, indeed, former leaders of the Liberal Party. I for one do not believe that the people who serve on industry funds with the equal representation model are cat's paws for one point of view or another. I believe that they are motivated to serve in the best interests of their members. There have also been concerns in terms of this scale proposition that somehow, by requiring trustees to consider scale, this will cause unforeseen and inappropriate outcomes. We believe that talking about scale does not mean that it will be necessary for funds to make detailed comparisons of performance against every other fund. Certainly many funds will be able to determine very quickly that scale is not an issue for them. Also, we have said in this bill that we will send a signal to smaller, poorly performing funds that they need to actively and regularly consider whether scale is an issue. APRA will consult with industry on processes that trustees could adopt to form a determination about scale and relative considerations for trustees in rectifying insufficient scale. I think it is about time that this parliament tried to be constructive and work on the issues we agree on. If the opposition, but for this issue of scale, would support the rest of the matters and is willing to put itself into that difficult ground, I am interested to see whether, if it cannot win its amendment on scale, it will oppose improvements to the governance of superannuation funds and trustees.",49
23,Mr BILSON,Unknown," It was curious that the minister failed to directly address the points that we were making in support of our amendment. I suspect he might have had pre-prepared remarks that went to a bit of a slap-around of the opposition, which seems to be his combative nature. But he failed to turn his mind in any way to the points that were raised in support of our amendment. He did say that APRA would give some guidance to poorly performing smaller funds. I would hope that, as he has suggested elsewhere, APRA would give guidance to poorly performing funds full stop. The issue about whether the fund is performing well or not should stand in its own right. The issue about its size is being introduced as another variable. As he launched into attacks on me for comments relating to industry super funds, none of which were actually made in my contribution-which was a curious line of attack-I was actually pointing out that the Association of Superannuation Funds was actually supporting",49
24,Mr Shorten,Unknown,Far be it from me to attribute something to the member for Dunkley which was not in his contribution. I was confusing his contribution with the other four contributions. I withdraw that.,50
25,Mr BILSON,Unknown,"A gracious moment, sir. The point I was making was that the union controlled industry superannuation network actually concurred with the coalition's view that there are problems with the scale test. We have been listening to stakeholders. All the stakeholders that have come forward and made a submission see no great utility and, in fact, some risks with a scale test which seems to belie all the other measures in the bill relating to proper governance, the best interests of members, the returns for the fund and the level of fees. All of a sudden all the things that are performance related in the bill run into this idea that size is a fundamental determinant of whether a fund product should be authorised as a default fund under MySuper. I again urge the minister to turn his mind to the chorus of concern about this particular issue and the direct input that has been provided through the inquiry process around his draft legislation, all of which points to simple fact that this scale test is problematic, confusing and redundant. It is an uncharted area where there is inadequate guidance and it seems to displace the very purpose behind some of the amendments that the minister spoke strongly in favour of which go to the performance of the funds: the prudential standards, the best interests of those participating in the funds, and fees and returns. That should be what really matters. That is about performance and outcomes for members' money and the scale contribution adds nothing whatsoever.",50
26,Mr FLETCHER,Unknown," I am pleased to rise to make a contribution as we consider in detail the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012 and, in particular, the amendment moved by the opposition to remove the specific provisions that give effect to the scale test, which we on this side of the House think is ill considered. There is no dispute from this side of the House with the central proposition that what we all ought to be concerned about is the optimal and efficient operation of superannuation funds and making sure that trustees and others charged with the operation and management of superannuation funds do so in a conscientious and effective way. We on this side of the House have difficulty with the issue that the relevant provision-proposed section 29VN-would have the effect of baking into the law of the land an assumption which we consider is contentious and not well made out-that is, the assumption that bigger is always better when it comes to the size of a superannuation fund. The minister told the House earlier that there was no assumption that bigger is somehow better behind this new provision. If there is no such presumption it is very simple: take the the provision out-because, by putting into black-letter law an obligation upon trustees to consider the scale of the fund every year, what you are doing is imposing upon them the obligation to consider the merits of the proposition that a bigger fund is better. If that is not a proven, well-made-out assumption-if finance theory, among other things, does not provide a good basis for that assumption-then you should not be legislating on the basis of that assumption. That brings up the obvious question: why is the government legislating on the basis of this assumption? What are the merits behind this idea? Why is it reflected in this piece of legislation that the House is considering today? It is very instructive that the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, which represents superannuation trustees including trustees operating in industry funds as well as every other kind of superannuation fund, had this to say to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services: While accepting that scale may provide benefits to members, AIST confirms the position we put before the Committee. That is, the pursuit of optimal net returns to members having regard to risk considerations and the safe stewardship of members' benefits should [be] the overwhelming obligation upon trustees of MySuper products, and this obligation should not be clouded, diminished or distracted by other considerations including scale. The body which speaks for trustees of superannuation funds is saying that as a matter of black-letter law, drafting and policy it is a bad idea to put into law a formal obligation upon trustees of superannuation funds to give consideration specifically to the question of scale. Of course superannuation trustees must always have regard to delivering the best outcomes for members of the fund-that is not in contention. What is in contention before the House today is whether it is good policy and good law to impose a specific obligation upon superannuation trustees to have regard, on an annual basis, to the matter of scale. On this side of the House we say that is a bad idea. That is not a good element of this piece of legislation and that is why we are moving this amendment. There is a host of good policy reasons to argue against it, and if I have time in another contribution I will make some broader observations, but I want make very clear this specific point: we do not contest that superannuation trustees have an obligation to fund members. Of course they do. What we contest is the legislative drafting stratagem of putting this specific duty in the bill. We say that is a bad idea. all Mr SHORTEN (Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (11:06): I appreciate the attention that the member for Bradfield pays to the topic of superannuation, but I cannot agree with some of the assertions he made and I feel compelled to set the record straight. It has been put by him and others that there is no support for a scale test. I challenged that when I said, 'What about the Cooper review's explicit recommendation?' We know the number, don't we, Mr Fletcher? Recommendation 1.6(b) explicitly says that a scale test is a good idea. How is it that those opposite can say that we have not followed the Cooper review enough? Yet when it comes to the test, when there is a specific measure in the Cooper review, which we are implementing, the opposition is strangely struck silent. But it was not just the Cooper review that found that a scale is central to a trustee optimising performance for members; it was the Costello report. Again, the Costello report had input from a whole lot of people from all points of the compass in terms of superannuation policy in Australia and they supported the scale test. Certainly industry said that they wanted to be reassured as to how the test would operate in practice. That is why APRA has made it clear that it will consult and provide guidance. So we do need to make clear to all those trustees who are being made nervous by some of the assertions of those opposite that APRA will consult about the practical implementation of scale. Furthermore, the policy behind the scale requirement in the legislation is that it sends an important signal to small, poor-performing funds that they need to actively and regularly consider scale as an issue. The member for Dunkley said that somehow small poor-performing funds were receiving more attention than poorperforming funds generally. That is not right. One issue that may need to be considered with respect to small poor-performing funds is their size. Where a fund conclude that scale is a factor in their poor performance, APRA will be able to ask trustees how they intend to continue to promote the best financial interests of their MySuper members. This may result, for example, in trustees having to proactively seek merger opportunities. My concern is that if those opposite were successful with their amendment, saying that trustees of small funds do not need to consider the context of scale-whether or not having a small fund adds to greater operating costs-then giving people a leave pass on that question sends a signal to funds that they do not have to worry about this matter at all. Furthermore, we believe APRA would find it difficult to explicitly pursue scale issues through either prudential standards or general supervision of funds if there were a decision to remove the scale requirement from the legislation. That is why we do not support removing the scale test. If the opposition think that a requirement for funds to look at scale is so important and if they are unsuccessful on that amendment, will they turn their back on better governance in superannuation funds because of one proposition for which there is legitimate, steep support for and interest in the government's position? We await with interest.",50
27,Mr FLETCHER,Unknown," I think we should focus very carefully on what the minister has just said, because it reveals the fundamental flaw in logic which underpins proposed section 29VN, which the opposition's amendment proposes to remove from the bill. What the minister said to the House just now is that this provision sends a clear signal to small poor-performing funds. Note very carefully the way he put together two different concepts: small and poor performing. If you listen to the minister, you hear that 'small' and 'poor performing' are effectively the same thing. But of course they are not. The difficulty with what the minister proposes and the difficulty with the bill, which the minister has brought into the House, is that this provision will not just send a signal to small poor-performing funds; it will send a signal to all small funds-well-performing small funds and poor-performing small funds. The policy problem with that is that a consequence of this provision is that funds which are small and which perform well may end up finding themselves pushed into a course of action which, arguably, is not in the interests of fund members. It is hard to avoid noting the kind of language which is used in the explanatory memorandum, in paragraph 1.27, where the author refers to the obligation on trustees: … to rectify the insufficiency so they continue to meet their general obligation to promote the financial interests of beneficiaries. If you are putting a provision into legislation, if you are making it part of the black-letter law of this country and if you are imposing formal legal obligations on trustees with all the consequences that go with that, you need to be sure that the policy basis for imposing that obligation is a good one. We have heard no argument from the minister as to why the policy basis for imposing this obligation is a good one. We heard from the minister that the scale test is a good idea because the Cooper review says it is a good idea. There is much in the Cooper review which contains merit, but it is surely not appropriate for House of Representatives-the people's house-to abdicate its function of bringing to bear an independent judgment, an independent exercise of weighing up the merits and the disadvantages of pieces of legislation which are brought to the House. That, in effect, is what the minister is asking us to do this morning, because he is arguing: 'The scale test is a good idea because the Cooper review says it's a good idea.' I do not find that argument persuasive. I believe that our obligation in the House of Representatives is to consider the merits of the idea. Let us just remind ourselves of the idea which is embodied in this provision, which the opposition's amendment seeks to remove. The idea is that bigger is better. The idea is that scale in superannuation funds is a good thing. If that were not the underpinning idea, this provision would not be here. The reason the opposition object to baking this into black-letter law is that that idea is deeply contentious. There are advantages to scale but there are also advantages to being small and nimble. Smaller investment funds can take advantage of investment opportunities which are not available to very large funds. Smaller funds have the capacity to invest, for example, in small companies which may produce better returns. However, it is a well-known problem in investment management that very big funds are, in practical terms, precluded from investing in small companies because the minimum size of investment they need to make for it to make a difference to their members is so big that it is impractical for them to take a stake of that size in a small company. So there are good arguments in economic theory and policy as to why scale is not an unmitigated advantage, and that is why we say the idea underpinning this provision is a bad one.",52
28,Mr SHORTEN,Unknown,"Maribyrnong-Minister this for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (11:15): Sometimes in this place the opposition twist what the government says and you let it go through to the keeper because that is their DNA. But in this case I cannot allow that to be so. I accept that the member for Bradfield was not here to hear my second reading speech so he may be unaware that I made it very clear that small funds are not automatically worse than big funds. Indeed, in response to the contribution from the member for Dunkley, I made it very clear and I used the term 'small, well-performing funds'. We will be able to demonstrate that size is not impeding them. But despite the verballing by the opposition and the incorrect portrayal of what the government said in the speech, what I also know to be the case is that the Cooper review, which was an independent reviewfar more independent than the Liberal member for Bradfield-came to the conclusion that scale can be a factor in operating costs and economies of scale do exist. That is not to say that small funds should not be present in the market. I accept that small funds do provide some of the opportunities the member for Bradfield enunciated. What I do not accept is that we can simply dismiss this review and say, 'We're the people's house and we do not have to follow an independent review because it is being conducted.' That is true. That is very true. What I also know to be the case is that it was put by members opposite that somehow the government is going in a different direction from what the industry believes. Clearly the Cooper review, which represents a lot of points of view in the industry, did have a distinct view which is in alignment with the government. Therefore, when we talk about the government acting on its own, that is not correct. People say that, if you have a requirement for trustees to periodically consider scale, that is somehow an assault on small funds. That is not correct. It is put to us that we say big funds are better than small funds. That is not what the government has said. What we do recognise is that we have an obligation to constantly and relentlessly seek the cheapest possible costs in the administration of superannuation and exert downward pressure on the fees and charges. I also note that, despite the reservations expressed by those opposite, I have not yet heard their position. Do they regard this requirement to consider scale as sufficiently important that, if they are unsuccessful in that amendment, they will turn their backs on the rest of the propositions on trustee governance? I sincerely hope not.",53
29,Mr FLETCHER,Unknown," There is a curious logical contradiction in what the minister is saying to the House this morning. He has just told us that the government do not say big is better than small. Well, if you do not say that, do not put a provision to that effect into the legislation. It is very simple. Let us be clear. Trustees of superannuation funds have an extremely comprehensive and extensive range of duties. There can be no question that superannuation fund trustees today have extensive legal duties to act in the best interests of members of the fund. The proposition from the minister that what we need to do on this specific point is buttress the existing law by adding in a specific obligation to consider scale is one that we should therefore test very carefully. We should only expand upon the existing black letter law duties of trustees of superannuation funds if a very good case is made out for that change. When you look at the merits of the argument, it is clear that scale has pros and cons. Yet we have an amendment put by the government, a provision in the bill, which assumes that scale is an absolute good. It asks the trustees of small funds to consider each year whether they are big enough and, if not, to consider whether they should merge. The policy case for that has not been made out. But it is clear that there is one segment of the industry whose interests are very well served by such an amendment, and that is the existing larger funds, particularly the larger industry funds. If you are in charge of, for example, the $43 billion Australian Super, this probably looks like a great idea. If you are the Industry Super Network, representing a range of industry funds including a number of the very large funds, this probably looks a good idea. But I can tell you that' if an argument of this kind were being made in other industries, you can only imagine the howls of protest that would result. If it were put to the House that there should be a duty every year on the directors of Virgin to determine whether their company was as big as Qantas and, if it was not, to change its business structure accordingly, you can only imagine the howls of protest. If there were a duty imposed every year upon the directors of Bendigo Bank to ask whether their company was as big as Westpac and, if it was not, to pursue a change in business structure accordingly, you can only imagine the howls of protest. And looking at the industry from which I came before I came into the parliament, the telecommunications industry, if it were put into the legislation that there was a duty every year on the directors of AAPT, Primus, Internode and iiNet to ask themselves whether they are as big as Telstra and, if they were not, to pursue a change in their business structure, you can only imagine the howls of protest. You can only imagine the arguments which would be put saying this is a change to the law which suits the interest of the big end of town and the case has not been made out on policy grounds. But that is exactly the position we are in when it comes to this provision of this bill which the government is seeking to have this House pass. This is a bill which suits interests of the big end of town in the superannuation industry, and that is not a good thing when the policy case for what is being proposed has not been made out. We have nowhere heard from the minister, from the government, a convincing policy case as to why scale is an absolute good. That is why on this side of the House we have moved an amendment which would remove these contentious provisions from the bill. We would remove the contentious proposed section 29VN because it is based on an underlying policy idea the case for which has not been made out. When the peak body representing superannuation trustees has expressly put the view that it is misconceived and it is based on an improper prioritisation of the objectives which ought to be motivating superannuation trustees, then we on this side of the House have very profound reservations and it is those reservations which underpin the amendment we have put.",54
30,Mr KATTER,Unknown," In addressing this matter I want to say that I fully realise that the intentions of the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation are good and we very much admire work done by the minister in many areas. But in this area I have a lot of specialist trainers in my electorate, particularly in the field of the first Australians and in the field of rural activities, and we have a very big organisation called RITE that works out of Charters Towers and is probably the leading trainer of people going onto cattle stations in Australia. But, of course, what is most relevant to us is the 40,000 jobs and I can serve notice here that neither the ALP nor the LNP are going to be flying workers in from overseas. Those 40,000 jobs will belong to Australians. Addressing the actual amendment that has come before us",55
31,Mr Shorten,Unknown,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a the point of order, this is a debate about superannuation trustees. I am not sure if Mr Katter is referring to this or another bill.",55
32,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The minister is correct, the House is debating an amendment moved by the member for Dunkley to omit two paragraphs from the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill.",55
33,Mr KATTER,Unknown,"I apologise, it was something I wanted to raise, but I will move back onto the superannuation issue. In North Queensland we have the great treasure troves of Australia that need to be opened up. They need superannuation moneys; I do not think they can be opened up without superannuation moneys. We have 40 per cent of Australia's coal reserves in the Galilee Basin-40 per cent of the nation's entire coal reserves. They need probably $1,000 million or $2,000 million worth of railway line to go in there, Minister. That money can only come from superannuation funds. In the whole history of Australia this infrastructure has been built by government, except for in the last 25 years. There was a 60-40 rule which existed in superannuation, Minister, which is very relevant to the amendment being moved by the opposition here. That 60-40 rule said 60 per cent of all superannuation moneys went into government securities. That money was used to build a canal to get our phosphate and our iron ore out from north-west Queensland, so instead of coming 1,200 kilometres back to Townsville it goes 300 kilometres on water up to the gulf. We need electricity, and God bless your government, Minister, for already having committed $350 million-which is more than I can say for the incoming LNP government, who have knocked it on the head. They are not going to have any infrastructure at all, those stupid people. And, as I said, we need railway lines and we need one into the Galilee Basin. So, Minister, the amendment, yes, but we would plead with you to look at the issue of superannuation moneys simply going into shares and inflating share prices, and into property and inflating property prices, and none of it going into nation building, where it has traditionally gone in the past. If it is Simpkins, LXL government managed then it is secured by the government and you can safely return 7½ per cent, 9½ per cent, to the investors, which they will not get in the long term out of inflated share prices and inflated property prices. We applaud the opposition on this initiative, but we also applaud the minister and his work and we plead with him to address this problem, which I think is the greatest problem facing Australia today in our way forward.",55

Third Reading",56
35,Mr SHORTEN,Unknown,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (11:35): by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. NOES Mr TRUSS (Wide Bay-Leader of The Nationals) (11:36): I rise to speak on the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012, which implements a number of amendments to support the introduction of body scanners at Australian international airports. It should be acknowledged that the introduction of body scanners at these airports is of concern to some Australians and this is understandable. When considering the implementation of this new technology at our international airports, the community will need to be assured that the scans are safe and that their privacy is absolutely protected. Legitimate concerns have also been raised about the level of inconvenience and delays travellers will face at airports and the value that body scanners will add to our overall national security regime. As Minister Albanese outlined in his NA second reading speech, the government determined to implement body scanners at Australian international airports after an incident on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day in 2009. A passenger on Northwest flight 253 attempted to detonate an improvised explosive device as the flight descended into Detroit airport. The man had successfully concealed an improvised explosive device in his underwear through security screening in Amsterdam and Yemen. The bomb contained no metallic parts and was made from two highly explosive substances. The man was able to walk through a metal detector without causing any alarm to sound. Thankfully in this instance the passenger was not successful. He was detained, and last year pleaded guilty in a US court. The thwarting of a bomb plot using an explosive device similar to that used in Detroit in 2009 by US officials earlier this year indicates that the use of non-metallic explosives is a current threat. It is understandable that the community would have reservations about the introduction of this new technology at Australian international airports. The coalition referred the bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications to obtain assurances that appropriate health and safety privacy standards are met and that the machines are effective and add to our national security framework. The committee has recommended that the bill be passed. A Senate committee inquiry report has been twice delayed but is expected later this month. The coalition would have preferred this debate to be held after the Senate report was tabled. It is possible that the Senate may propose some amendments to the bill. This is an ongoing issue which I need to raise on almost every bill that comes before this parliament. The committee processes are truncated, there is no opportunity for committees to effectively look at the issues and frequently a bill is brought on for debate in the parliament before the committees have even reported on it. In this case, the House of Representatives committee has reported but the Senate committee, which has been dealing with some other issues, has not reported. So the House has its only opportunity to deal with this bill before the Senate committee of inquiry has been completed. This has been happening too often particularly in the transport portfolio, but I know it has been happening in other places as well. If the government needs to have this legislation passed by a particular date, do not rush it in at the last moment and expect the whole parliament to blindly debate it without having had any proper scrutiny. The member for Lyne has made much of the need to improve parliamentary scrutiny and to have a committee system that looks more effectively at the bills. The reality is that the committee system is working worse now than at any other time that I can remember in parliament. The government uses its numbers to push these debates through and get bills to the stage where they come into the parliament even though there may be significant issues that have not been properly resolved. I think that is unsatisfactory process. Having been critical of the way in which the government manages the legislation in that regard, can I thank the minister for taking up the suggestion I made that the scanners be brought into parliament so people could actually see for themselves how they work. I think that was a useful exercise and I know a number of members did take the opportunity to put themselves through the scanner to see how it worked.",57
36,Mr Crean,Unknown,Did you do it?,58
37,Mr TRUSS,Unknown,"Yes, I did, and I notice that all of us are still alive. To our knowledge, it certainly did not have any adverse effect on those who were involved. The health impacts are one of the issues that are being raised quite extensively in the community. I have certainly been made aware-and I am sure other members will have been as well-of people in the public who have concerns about the health impact of these scanners. Employees at airports who may have to use the scanners many times a day, international business and leisure travellers, and airline employees as well as the operators of the machines need to be assured that they are safe. There are two primary methods of body scanning technology: millimetre wave and backscatter technology. They operate differently. The millimetre waves are a part of the radiofrequency spectrum which is used by a number of different devices such as mobile phones and wireless devices. Backscatter technology is an advanced form of X-ray imaging technology. The government has determined to implement millimetre wave technology. I am advised that the power density exposure for a person undertaking a scan is thousands of times lower than that of a single mobile phone call and is comparable to the passive exposure from a mobile phone used several metres away. The US Transport Security Administration has stated that the technology emits 10,000 times less radiofrequency energy than an average mobile phone call. The exposure is also much lower than that which passengers routinely experience during a flight. I think this is a particularly important point. Anyone worried about these body scanners should not be flying as they will be exposed to more waves on board the aircraft than they will experience passing through these scanners. The millimetre wave scans are within the limits set by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. The waves emitted by the scan are directed inwards so the exposure of security staff who operate the machines is considered insignificant. The coalition has been assured by the government and the Office of Transport Security that the machines are safe. It should also be noted that active implanted medical devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators are designed to meet a series of standards which require the devices to be protected from interference by mobile phones and other similar devices. The power levels for the scanners are lower than many of these other sources, including mobile phones, and as such there are no known safety concerns in relation to people with these devices undergoing the scan. Additionally, unlike walk-through metal detectors, people with internal metal implants, such as false hips and pacemakers, will be undetected by the machines and this will address the inconvenience these passengers regularly experience when travelling. The Office of Transport Security has advised that a person with any illness, injury or disability that would prevent them raising their hands above their heads and standing still will be screened using alternative methods, as will infants and small children. Perhaps the most prevalent concern in the community about the new scanners relates to personal privacy. It is important in this respect to note that section 44(3)(3B) of the bill states that any image produced by a body scanner: ... must be a gender-neutral, generic image such that the person is not identifiable and no anatomical or physical attribute of that person are revealed. As I mentioned by way of response to the interjection from the minister at the table, early this year I undertook a scan in one of the machines that this bill will allow to be introduced at international airports. I can vouch for the fact that the image it produces is indeed a generic outline with a yellow box highlighting the area of your body which the machine detects as potentially having something concealed. Of course, there are examples of these kinds of screens available to members. Without wanting to offend the standing orders, Deputy Speaker Georganas, I think this picture gives a clear example that in fact there is nothing offensive about the image and that it is done in a way which should avoid public concern. This is unlike some technology that has been used overseas, which saw graphic images of passengers produced, stored and transmitted. Not only must these machines produce a generic image but the machines are also unable to transmit or store images. I understand that as a result of the committee inquiry the government intends to propose an amendment to the bill to ensure that any technology that may be implemented in the future also cannot store or transmit images. This will further protect the privacy of Australians. In introducing body scanners at our international airports, the bill repeals 95A of the Aviation Transport Security Act, which currently allows a person to choose an alternative screening method over a selected screening procedure. This means that, where a person is randomly selected to undertake a body scanner, they may not choose an alternative method of screening such as a frisk search. If a person refuses a scan they will be unable to pass through the screening point and will not be able to fly. This is a pretty drastic action and the fact that there no alternative available means that people are going to have to make up their minds whether they are prepared to be scanned and if they are not prepared to be scanned then they simply will not be able to travel on that flight. I understand that this is the same approach that is adopted in the United Kingdom, though not in the US and some other countries. The department has advised that this decision has been made primarily because the scanner is designed to detect items that are by their nature difficult or impossible to detect by other means. The only alternative to the body scanner which may achieve the same security outcome would be an extensive and invasive frisk search. It is the Commonwealth's belief that this would not meet Australian security standards. But I think also that it is reasonable to comment that those undergoing the frisk search may well find it more offensive, more intrusive than going through the scanner. Additionally, the department has advised that the significant investment they have made in the new technology will only be justified by having a compulsory scheme. I have to say that I think that is something of a weak argument. It simply raises the question: why make the investment at all if it cannot stand on its merits? Finally, the department believes that the type of technology to be section implemented in Australia mitigates the privacy and health concerns to such an extent that the optional system is not required. As I have mentioned earlier, there is no evidence-and it is almost difficult to conceive that there could be any evidence that going through this scanner is damaging. The concerns about privacy it seems to me have been strongly addressed through the use of the type of technology that is proposed in Australia. So the department's observation is that this technology is such that it mitigates the privacy and health concerns to such an extent that an optional system is not required is a reasonable argument. The fact that children and those who cannot raise their arms above their head will not be required to go through the scanners creates, however, some significant holes in the security net. The scanners will only add incrementally to aviation safety. Only a handful of countries are actually using this technology. Indeed, it is perhaps interesting to note that one of the few countries that does use scanners is the Netherlands, yet the Northwest Airlines flight which carried the passenger that has been the reason for this legislation coming into the parliament actually went through the security in Amsterdam. That demonstrates that this system, like all the other systems of security, at least to some extent, is not entirely foolproof. The only total solution is to stamp out terrorism and suppress any ideology which compels people to carry out attacks on civilian travellers. That involves a determination to win the war on terror and strike at the heart of those of ill will towards our country. Evidence of a lack of commitment to stamping out terrorism or exhaustion in the fight will encourage more evil behaviour. We must work to encourage better understanding in our community and a universal commitment to renounce terrorism and attacks on innocent travellers. Scanners can help identify those of ill intent, but only a complete global end to terrorism can make us completely safe. Finally, I would like to make some comments on the efficacy of the machines. The trial at the Sydney and Melbourne international airports last year saw 23,577 scans undertaken over approximately three weeks. An analysis of the trial indicated that 57 per cent of passengers were able to proceed immediately through the screening point. This represents a much higher alarm rate than walk-through metal detectors. The Office of Transport Security has advised that this higher than usual alarm rate was caused by passengers not being clear on what items they had to divest themselves of prior to scanning. According to the analysis conducted after the trial, alarms were commonly caused by high boots with buckles, currency, hair clips, watches, jewellery, pockets on cargo pants, and additional zips and studs on jeans and pants. As awareness increases as to what items are required to be removed prior to a scan, the proportion of alarms from these sorts of items should decline. It will take some time for people to realise that the kinds of things that are likely to be picked up in a scanner are different from those picked up through conventional metal detectors. Bear in mind, this scanner does not work on detecting metal or some other kind of material; it works on comparing images with standard profiles within the computer technology. So it is a different kind of system, and different kinds of things will trigger it. That is what makes it obviously worthwhile-it is able to detect some things that cannot be detected by current technology. It should also be noted, however, that the alarm resolution is much quicker than with a walk-through metal detector, as the general location of the article that caused the alarm is identified by the scanners. These new machines are costly and, like all the additions we have had to security in this country, will add to the cost of boarding aircraft in this country. The government is providing up to $28.5 million to help with the capital cost, but airports will be responsible for the ongoing operational costs, which will add further to the cost of air travel around Australia. We have just been listening in the Senate estimates to some of the impacts on passengers of the costs of the recent round of security measures in regional airports which are coming online and expected to be operational by 1 July. These measures, which will have absolutely minimal effect on improving the security at our airports, are going to add very substantially to the cost of passengers boarding, particularly in small regional airports with relatively small throughput. The machinery in itself is expensive, but operating the machinery will be an ongoing permanent cost. The department has admitted in estimates today that costs of up to $50 per passenger will result from these new government regulations, which are effectively imposing a new level of security in regional airports that is difficult to justify. Indeed, I think the $50 figure is conservative, and-when you have the situation where you are going to have to put teams of staff on to check luggage and passengers, sometimes with only one flight every day or two, and with the minimum wages that will have to be paid-the costs will be very substantial. Unless concessions are made or sensible ways found to deliver this level of security, the cost will amount to hundreds of dollars per passenger and not just $20, $30 or $50. It is also worth noting that the recent federal budget has provided further cost impositions on Australian aviation, and they are just making it so much harder for our tourist industries to be competitive. There is the budget increase in the passenger movement charge, taking it to $55 per passenger from 1 July 2012. The budget has also announced that that charge is going to be indexed annually thereafter. The increase is going to see the government raise an extra $610 million over four years-at the expense of our struggling tourism industry. And by 2015-16 the passenger movement charge alone will collect over $1 billion. This departure tax was originally designed as a cost recovery measure for border services, but now it is just a new tax-a new tax that the government is imposing on our tourism industry and at a time when it is struggling to be competitive internationally. In addition, the government is now going to charge airports for the cost of AFP officers being present on their site. This is a part of the security regime that people just take for granted: we do not expect to pay our local policeman when he patrols our street. But now when the Australian Federal Police do their job at the airport a bill is going to sent to the airport operator. The impact of that is clearly going to be, again, higher airport user charges because the airports have got to recover these costs, and inevitably, therefore, yet another cost is going to be imposed on our airport users. It will be a $40-million-a-year charge on airports to partly recover airport policing costs. At the same time as the government has cut funding to customs and the budget for passenger processing at airports, it has put up the charges. Indeed, one of the distressing things about this legislation is that it demonstrates the government's double standards: more machinery, more scanning equipment et cetera, but, at the same time, in almost every budget it has cut expenditure for customs and quarantine, reduced the numbers of inspections of cargo and reduced the numbers of passengers whose luggage is being inspected at the airports. This is adopting a very slack approach towards security at our airports. Instead, the government is going to impose new charges-a much higher passenger movement charge, and now these extra scanners which will add to the cost of the system-while, at the same time, turning its back on customs and quarantine inspections. If all of this is not bad enough, we have got the carbon tax also adding to the cost of travel in our country. These measures are on top of the carbon tax, which will cost Qantas at least $110 million in 2012-13 and will add $45 million to Virgin Australia's costs. Australia is becoming an unattractive place to visit because of the cost being imposed upon it by the taxes that this government invents. The carbon tax is clearly going to be the worse of them all. These machines, for which this legislation will provide authorisation, are a further be intrusion into our lifestyle. They will slow down passenger movements at international airports and they will test our patience. They are not perfect and trigger many false alarms. I wish they were not necessary. But the coalition notes the advice of the Office of Transport Security and the government that these machines are necessary to improve our national security framework. No responsible government or opposition can fail to heed such professional advice on a matter of security. The coalition is assured that the Commonwealth has taken all possible steps to ensure that the machines are safe and that the privacy of Australians will be upheld. For these reasons the coalition will not be opposing the bill and, in doing so, will not oppose the introduction of body scanners at Australian international airports.",58
38,Mr MITCHELL,Unknown," It is always a pleasure to follow the shadow minister for transport in one of the rare moments when he is up there talking about transport issues. I thought it was a pretty good speech until we got to the 16 minute mark and it just fell down very quickly from there. Trying to blame the carbon tax is just absolutely ridiculous. It is ridiculous coming from the leader of a party that is shutting country TAFEs in Victoria-he is shutting country kids out of education and he sits there and smiles. I guess that says a lot about them. I am very pleased to be speaking on the Gillard government's Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012 because the Labor government understands the vital importance of maintaining safe and secure methods of travel and the risks posed with international flights-risks posed by the more sophisticated and elaborate ways in which unseemly characters are trying to stop Australian travellers from enjoying the freedoms of air travel. The minister reminded us in his second reading speech: On 25 December 2009, a passenger attempted to bomb Northwest Airlines flight 253 en route from Amsterdam to Detroit. This would be bomber successfully smuggled a viable improvised explosive device through aviation security screening and onto the without being detected. The device, which was concealed inside the passenger's underwear, contained no metallic components and was therefore able to be carried through a walk-through metal detector without triggering any alarm. This event highlighted a significant vulnerability in global aviation security screening practices, including in Australia. Body scanners will be introduced at international departure and transit points in Australian airports later this year. I think that is a very telling thing. When Australians get on aeroplanes they want to know they are safe. What that tells us is that these unsavoury characters are using more sophisticated and elaborate ways with which to inflict harm on the innocent lives of people who are quietly going about their business and using air travel. That is why protecting Australians against the threat of any kind of violence, including terrorism, is an imperative for this government, particularly when examining the security methods of aviation transport, as the bad guys find new and more dangerous ways of practicing their trade. The bill will ensure that Australian airport security is strengthened, with minimal impact or delay to passengers and, really, the impact will be small and become the new normal for the thousands of travellers who will use this technology in the years to come. I am proud to be part of a government that has introduced this bill-a bill that protects Australian travellers from harm and does so in a non-intrusive and safe way. The fact is we are not introducing the same scanners as used in the US and Europe. The concerns stemming from the American and European models cannot be accurately transferred to the Australian model. Comparing these new aircraft scanners to the American and European models is like comparing apples to oranges, and it is contributing to a growing scare campaign as part of the ugly exploitation of the fears of Australian travellers by those opposite. We on this side of the House are choosing to sift through the nonsense, to take the facts and to leave out the scaremongering and the mistruths. Our policies are based on what is real and relevant to Australians. That is why we have taken heed of the concerns about the backscatter scanners used in America and have chosen not to use them here. We understand that there is a difference, millimetre wave technology is the safe body scanning alternative. The Gillard government recognises Australians have legitimate concerns for their health-that is important and is why the government has acted accordingly. We are not introducing the backscatter scanners to Australian airports; we are instead introducing body scanners that use millimetre wave technology, because emissions from these scanners are negligible. You would actually receive more radio frequency energy as you go about your everyday life. Whereas a single backscatter X-ray emits the equivalent of two minutes in an aeroplane, the millimetre wave scanners we are introducing use ten thousand times less radio frequency energy than your average mobile phone call. That is like standing in the kitchen while someone is using a mobile in the lounge room at home. There are no conclusive studies to suggest that there is any health risk posed by the millimetre wave scanners that will be introduced to Australian airports; the studies dispel the misconception that millimetre wave technology is somehow bad for Australians. I am proud to be part of a government that is delivering a safe and harmless method of protecting our aviation industry, protecting Australian travellers and protecting Australian jobs. It is important to note that scans taken by these machines will not be intrusive or breach the privacy of our citizens. The government understands every person likes their right to privacy, and for this reason privacy enhancements to the scanners will be made mandatory in Australia. There have been instances in the US where we have seen genuine concerns for the so-called 'pornographic pictures' taken and stored by body scanners, but we are not using the American model. The privacy enhancements and that this government has made compulsory prevent any image from being stored, transmitted, displayed or even created. Noone travelling through Australia's international airports will ever have to worry whether their image could be displayed on some sort of body scanner dotcom website or something. The protection is there that no image is created in the first place. This bill will ensure that the closest thing to raw images that will come from these scanners will be some sort of resemblance to the kids' character Gumby. The picture of the head might be a little bit more symmetrical-like the little green animation figure-but the images that come from body scanners will be humanoid, and rightly so. That is about as far as it goes. These are generic human shapes, unidentifiable, nonspecific, genderless stick figures, which are used to highlight areas of concern. The purpose of these stick figures is to highlight areas of a person which warrant further investigation by highly trained security staff-inspections which could save the lives of passengers and crews on international flights. Security will be able to go directly to the point of concern and immediately clarify any concerns. We understand that airport security can sometimes appear cumbersome. I am sure we have all queued up in those lines at the airport to put our bags through the scanners, and waited and waited and waited as big long queues form because someone has left a deodorant in their bag. But that is what we have to deal with. Standing in front of the metal detectors with your arms out can also be very slow and awkward. The process of body scanners will help ease that strain, with a direct approach to security points of interest. The bill will ensure that, whilst the safety of Australians is protected, the effects security processes do not heavily impinge on the every-day commuter's trips. Technology is changing and it is vital that our security systems change with it. Too often we hear 'back in my day'. Nostalgia may be comforting when we remember those days, when Pluto was a planet and the daily paper was about 20c but that sepia-tone haze cannot protect us any more from the evolving technology of those who wish to do us harm. Yes, there was a time when we did not have these body scanners, but there was also a time when we did not need them. That time is the past, and it does not do well to dwell on it. We must learn from the past and we must not remain in it. When we see a hole in the system, when technology has evolved that can be a threat to our safety, we must act. When the bad guys see an opening, we have to block it. The Gillard government understands that metal detectors alone are no longer enough. We have seen in recent years how terrorism is evolving and we need to ensure that our bases are covered. Metal detectors will not be replaced by body scanners and will still be used by airlines. However, it is important that our aviation industry is also protected against alternatives to metallic methods of terrorism. Those such as the 'shoe bomber' and, more recently, the 'underwear bomber' have already successfully bypassed current security systems. It was only three Christmases ago that the underwear bomber was able to smuggle plastic explosives on board an international flight. That person was able to successfully pass through security checkpoints onto the plane, smuggling non-metallic explosives in their underwear. Thankfully, the explosives failed. But it would be irresponsible for us to let this happen again. Labor' response to this failed attack was very swift. Body scanners are just of the another way in which we continue to enhance Australia's aviation security. These body scanners will prevent terrorists like the underwear bomber from making it onto that plane. The government is making it clear that those who think they can get through Australia's security are wrong and will be caught. It is also for this reason the bill will deliver a no-opt-out policy. This means passengers must go through whichever primary screening procedure is used at that e airport, with the exception of those who have a serious physical or mental reason to use an alternative. No screen: no fly. Being able to opt out for an alternative method means being able to choose which security procedure may best be exploited. The Gillard Labor government is removing the gaming from aviation security. If a person will not undergo the nominated screening process, they cannot choose which alternative best suits them and they cannot fly. It is vital that we do all that is possible to prevent those who intend to do us harm from getting the upper hand. Here on this side of the House we say 'yes' to protecting Australians' right to privacy, to be healthy and safe from threats of harm by extremists. I am proud to say that the Gillard Labor government is delivering on this goal.",63
39,Mr BALDWIN,Unknown," I rise to speak on the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012 and to support this bill, but I do so with some reservations about this government's policies and the effect they are having on the tourism and aviation industry. This bill seeks to introduce body scanners at international airports and remove section 95A opt-out provisions that allow a person to choose a frisk search rather than being scanned. We support that entirely. We all want to be secure when we travel. On its own it would be hard to quibble with the notion that Australians be afforded the highest level of protection against aviation terrorism. Neither would the coalition argue with the aspiration for new security technology, such as body scanners, to be used in such a way that give travellers the greatest protection with the minimal inconvenience. The need for greater security was brought home to us back in 2009 when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab boarded a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. What was unique about this man was that, unbeknown to security officials, he had a 15-centimetre explosive device sewn into his underwear. The device was not detectable, despite the stringent security measures in place-as anyone who has travelled to the United States can testify-as it did not contain metallic elements. Had the so-called underwear bomber been successful, 290 people would have perished in the air-not to mention the collateral damage on the ground. The coalition welcomed the government's announcement of a package of measures in February 2010 to ensure a similar incident does not occur here in Australia. We believe it is important to follow the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and the Netherlands in introducing body scanner technology. We will therefore not oppose the repeal of section 95A, particularly as body scanners were successful in thwarting a device similar to that worn by the underwear bomber in the US last month. Now that there has been a voluntary trial, where some 20,000 scans were undertaken at Sydney and Melbourne international airports in August and September last year, we see no reason to delay their use any further. Putting the requisite safeguards in place, where body-scanning equipment is used-that the image must be gender neutral and nonidentifiable-is extremely important, as is the provision that machines not be able to store or transmit any information or data. With the power density exposure for a person undergoing a scan less than a thousand times that which emanates from a mobile phone, according to the USA Transport Security Administration, any health concerns in this regard would appear to be slight. This brings me to some reservations I have as the shadow minister for tourism and regional development. Our tourism industry contributes $73.3 billion share to Australia's GDP, and along with the hospitality sector provides almost one million Australians with employment. As I have said in many forums, the industry has been doing it very tough in recent years due to a number of factors. These include: the anaemic growth in many of our largest markets for inbound visitors, exacerbated by our strong dollar; competition from new and highly-competitive destinations in our region; the impact of natural disasters such as the Victorian floods, Western Australian bushfires and Cyclone Yasi; and, of course, short-sighted, ill-conceived and economically counterproductive policies introduced by this government. The latter has been responsible for Australia falling in the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index from fourth in 2008 to 13th last year. The coalition is determined to ensure the industry's global competitiveness. With the phenomenal growth in China, which has seen Chinese visitors surpass those from the United States to become our third-largest market for international visitors, and the growth from other Asian markets, we are excited by the further prospects our Asian neighbours can generate for Australian tourism. However, for that to occur it is important for Australia to make a good first impression. The government therefore needs to understand that there are no second chances at first impressions, and must ensure that measures in this bill are administered with the least inconvenience to the travelling public. Although we want our nation to continue to be seen as a very safe destination to travel to, there must be a recognition that airports are usually the first experience many of our international guests have of Australia, and the last impression they have of us when they depart. It is important that their experience of travelling from our airports is not perceived as an unpleasant one due to unnecessarily overzealous, inefficient or unfriendly security measures. I must say that previous experience of this government's policy does not provide me with a lot of confidence. For only in the last budget this Labor government has cut the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service funding as part of its forward estimates, and cut its capital expenditure by $19.5 million during the same period. This leaves open the real likelihood that despite more international arrivals there will be fewer officers and services to process them, leading to lengthier queues and longer waiting times. After the dramatic failures of their border protection policies at sea, it is strange that this government thinks it is a good idea now to make cuts at airports: impressions, impressions. Not only will queues lengthen due to Customs and Border Protection cuts but our international guests will now only be able to bring in two packets of their favourite smokes. On the face of it, this may seem a very minor hindrance. However, what the government has not considered is that this will require a wholesale printing of landing cards which currently state that you can bring in a carton. I can just see an elderly Chinese couple arriving on QF130 from Shanghai at 8.30 in the morning. Despite the hospitable service of our national carrier, they are tired after an 11-hour flight and wearily they disembark the aircraft with a carton of 'Double Happiness' ciggies for a friend who had specially requested them. They join the lengthening queues at Sydney Airport to be processed by a reduced number of customs officers who now have to spend additional time charging duty or confiscating cartons from passengers. As I said, Mr Deputy Speaker: impressions, impressions. In any case what plans has the government to put in place to update international duty-free schedules around the world? What monies have they set aside to let our international visitors know of these changes? When in the next month is it going to happen, and where is the estimated $10 million cost of an emergency reprint going to come from? It certainly will not come from any surplus revenue the government is expecting because, as Steven Clarke from the Australian Duty Free Association highlighted in his media release last week, the government has seriously overestimated its receipts from this policy. Tourism is a price-point sensitive product in what is an increasingly competitive global marketplace. But this government has not only increased the likelihood of waiting times at our airports; it has made it more expensive for visitors to arrive in this country. From its 45 per cent hike in the passenger movement charge since 2008, with a 17 per cent increase in the recent budget alone, and increases in visa fees, tourism has simply been a cash cow to plunder for this government. Despite employing more people than those working at the country's federal and state governments and the private agricultural, finance and insurance sectors, tourism was seen as less deserving than the Australian steel workers. They received $300 million in carbon tax assistance, but the tourism sector did not receive a cent-not one cent in direct industry-specific assistance. Australia is one of the most, if not the most, urbanised nations on earth. Of our nearly 23 million people, 80 per cent live in three per cent of land mass and in just six cities. This fact, coupled with our relatively small population, creates a range of policy challenges for policymakers and regulators. There is the age-old problem of communications: we all expect first-world services when we are as a people early adopters of technology, including smooth and clear phone calls. Yet the costs of these services spread over few people means that as individuals we pay dearly for them. Although an urban people, we identify strongly with rural, regional and remote areas and their populations. While many of our regional locations in Western Australia and Queensland are doing well out of the mining boom with increased economic activity and air services, I also want to to the attention of the House the significant challenges facing many other regional, remote and rural places that have not been so fortunate. They have not been helped by the significant cost imposts imposed by this government. When the Wheeler review",65
40,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," Order! Can I remind the member that we are debating the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill, and that you are skirting over the borders of that debate? I ask the member to come back to the bill.",68
41,Mr BALDWIN,Unknown,"As I was saying, when the Wheeler review of airport security and policing was released in 2005, it called for security costs at airports to be shared by governments, industry and the general public. It also stated: It is neither practical nor desirable to expect 100 per cent security at regional airports. The sheer diversity of Australia's regional airports makes the challenge of common standards of security an impossibility. Any protective security enhancements should be undertaken in accordance with a local threat and risk assessment and not instituted on the basis of what is sometimes media-driven scaremongering. I am concerned that there are a handful of our smaller remote airports that may not meet the deadline imposed by this government to be security-screening compliant. I hope that we show them some flexibility and afford them some latitude in meeting this challenge. We want to aid rural areas by encouraging tourists, particularly international tourists visiting the outback, yet we face the same cost challenges in making this affordable. Similarly, we want our population to be distributed and remote Australia to have the same access to services that urban Australians enjoy. We have been innovative in dealing with these challenges. For example, the School of the Air and the bring Royal Flying Doctor Service are ways for remote Australians to receive decent education services and life-saving health services. The wonderful thing about technology is that it creates solutions to the tyranny of distance. From listening to regional airline operators at the RAAA Summit held in Parliament House on 19 March this year, however, it is clear that they are facing a disproportionate economic challenge. From 1 July this year, regional carriers are facing what the Australian newspaper called a 'triple whammy' of imposts from the Gillard government. After the carbon tax, the second of these imposts will be the costs of the new fees they will be charged to cover these new airport security measures. If this was not enough, they are also facing the loss of the $6 million en-route subsidy scheme. Brindabella's Jeff Boyd has said that all these imposts will do is increase the costs of an air ticket because the companies have already introduced all of the environmental costsaving measures they possibly can and new, more fuel-efficient aircraft are not currently available. The 'triple whammy' will therefore simply have the effect of reducing regional aviation's competitiveness against the automobile in what is also a price-pointsensitive market. New fees to cover airport security could lead to a $12 to $20 levy per passenger on Brindabella to cover the $4 million cost that Tamworth Regional Council may impose for building new baggagescreening facilities. Factor in the loss of the en-route subsidy scheme and the airline's recruitment levy to sponsor new pilots from South Africa, and flying begins to look much less attractive to travellers. It will not before demand is affected by the growing cost of a ticket, putting regional aviation businesses and employees' jobs at risk. Regional, rural and remote areas are often heavily dependent on their regional air links for visitation, access to services only available in the cities, and tourism and economic development. Without such links these areas could be left condemned to isolation and economic stagnation. In 1997 there were 54 regional carriers operating 237 regional routes, and today I believe that figure is less than 20, flying around 125 routes. As I said in my address to the RAAA summit, four European and two Australian carriers have gone out of business in the past six months, so we can see the effects that these cost pressures can result in, particularly at a time when the global industry as a whole is struggling with falling patronage and rising fuel costs. The costs of greater security being passed on to airports and ultimately airlines should therefore be carefully monitored and regularly reviewed. The carbon tax will also make Australia a more expensive destination to visit, with tourism businesses being affected as disproportionately high energy users. The increased cost will not be felt just by international visitors but also by Australians wishing to holiday at home. It was Qantas's CEO, Alan Joyce, who told a Senate committee that his company estimated the cost would be as high as $115 million in the first 12 months. Virgin Australia has said their equivalent will be $45 million. Qantas said that $6.80 will be added to the cost of a flight from Perth to Sydney, and Virgin said that it will charge an average of $3 per flight to cover this Gillard tax impost. Is it any wonder, then, that there is a growing tourism trade deficit which the Transport and Tourism Forum expects to reach around $8 be long billion in the next financial year? In conclusion, whilst the coalition welcomes measures that make it safer for people to travel to, from and within our country, the government should see this in the wider context of making Australia a more competitive destination to visit. Both the tourism industry and regional Australia deserve better from this government, a government that has made our nation more expensive to visit and which has been quick to take from the tourism sector, giving very little in return. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (12:26): The Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012 is about safety and confidence, without which we would not have an aviation industry and consequently we would not have a tourism industry in this island nation, because aviation lies at the heart of our economic activity as an island nation. The aviation industry underpins our economic growth and provides a gateway to the wider global economy. The sector directly employs around 50,000 people, and a further half a million people indirectly. It contributes around $7 billion to our gross national product. Australian aviation, despite the protestations that the sky is falling in, has seen solid growth for the ninth year in a a fact that has obviously escaped the member for Paterson in his Chicken Little deliverance on this legislation. When I listen to the member for Paterson, I am reminded of the parliamentary cliche that never are so many angry words said as in the course of agreement. The aviation industry is seeing solid growth, and it has for the last nine years, with domestic and international flights continuing to increase, carrying record numbers of passengers in 2010-11-and it is forecast that that growth will increase into the future. The latest Avline report for 2010aviation 11 shows that the number of people flying internationally to and from Australia continued to grow-27.6 million, up seven per cent-along with the number of people flying domestically, up six per cent to 54 million passenger flights per year. In 2030 there will be more than twice the current number of passengers travelling through our capital city airports, increasing from around 100 million passengers today to almost 235 million passengers by 2030-a fact that I will return to in my concluding statements. Right now investment in airports is forecast to be around $9 billion over the next decade, to 2021. Despite the intensely competitive nature of the aviation business and the challenges posed by the high Australian dollar, Australia's aviation sector is strong and its outlook is bright. This does not mean there are not policy challenges to deal with in this sector. In December 2009, the Australian government released an aviation white paper entitled Flight path to the future. This long-term strategy reaffirmed safety and security as the No. 1 priority for aviation. Australia has a world-class security regime but we remain vigilant to new and emerging threats. The member for Paterson recently talked about the underpants bomber and the events that have led to us commissioning the row, report which led to the technology and the legislation which is before the House today. The Australian government has an obligation to all air travellers to ensure that every effort has been made to make their journey as safe as possible. Indeed, following the release of the aviation white paper, the Australian government released a $200 million aviation security package which recognised the importance of cooperation both within the Asia-Pacific region and globally. The legislation, as I said, is about the confidence of the travelling public in the industry, and body scanners are one of the technologies that are critical to providing safety and therefore confidence by the travelling public. As part of this government's investment in aviation security, we are investing in new and improved technologies, increased policing at airports and strengthened security procedures. The introduction of body scanners is one of these important measures. Body scanners will be in place in international airports by 1 July this year. Due to the widely publicised health and safety concerns surrounding the use of backscatter X-ray body scanners overseas, only body scanners that use millimetre wave technology will be deployed at Australian airports. I make this point because there have been some comments made publicly about the health concerns raised in relation to body scanner technology. We did a parliamentary inquiry into and heard evidence on thisboth expert evidence and evidence from concerned members of the public. The upshot of that inquiry is that we are confident that there are no known adverse health effects associated with the use of the adopted technology, the wave body scanners, that will be installed in our airports. As an example, one body scan emits around 10,000 times less radio frequency energy than a person could be expected to absorb during the length of an average mobile phone call. I am confident, as every member of this House should be confident, that these body scanners will present no health threat to the travelling public. One of the things that is different, and be made possible by this legislation, is that we will no longer have an opt-out arrangement. Currently there is the capacity for passengers to opt out of using the body scan and therefore having further and, dare I say, more invasive forms of screening accompanying their trip. But, as a result of this bill, when passed into law, there will be a no-opt-out policy. The no-opt-out policy prevents a person from refusing to undertake a body scan-or indeed any other form of primary security screening-in favour of undergoing some alternative screening procedure. This will prevent 'gaming' of the system-for example, a person having the ability to select the type of technology that they will be screened by. This has both efficiency implications and implications. If a person refuses to undergo a screening procedure, they will be refused clearance and prevented from boarding an aeroplane. It is important to note that allowances will be made where there is a physical or medical reason that would prevent screening by a certain screening technology. These exist at the moment-for example, a person in a wheelchair or a person unable to hold the required positioning in the body scanner will be screened by alternative methods suitable for their circumstances. In the course of community consultation, privacy issues have been raised. I can assure the public that only body scanners with privacy enhancements will be used in Australia. These body scanners will only create and display a generic human or 'stick figure' image. For example, if I were to pass through one of the body scanners, the image that would be visible to the Customs staff or security staff would be exactly the same image as that which would appear on the screen if the member for Paterson were to pass through the screen. We are of will considerably different stature but the image on the screen would be identical for those who are observing the screen as we pass through the screening technology. There will be no 'raw' or 'naked' images, and the various and wonderful different shapes that are presented at airports will not be presented on the screen, or displayed or transmitted by these scanners. Finally, on the issue of privacy, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner has been consulted on this technology and is comfortable with what is being proposed. I would like to conclude with a couple of observations about the aviation industry. As I have said, this technology is critical to the future confidence of the travelling public. The entire white paper and the $200 million security aviation security package are critical to aviation and therefore the tourism industry in this country. But there are other decisions that need to be made by governments at all levels. In March, both the federal and New South Wales governments received one of the most comprehensive independent studies ever done into Sydney's, and therefore Australia's, aviation needs. The 2012 the Joint study on aviation capacity for the Sydney region report shows that existing aviation infrastructure in Sydney will not cope with future aviation demand-which, as I have already said, is set to double over the next 20 years. It is clear that Sydney needs a second airport and it needs it sooner rather than later. All the body scanners in the world-indeed, all the permission to allow the travelling Chinese public to have a few extra packets of smokes in their duty-free luggage-will not overcome the fact that we need to expand our airport capacity in the Sydney region. Sydney airport increasingly operating at capacity and its peak period is growing. Sydney's size and land transport problems mean that the airport cannot deal with the increases that are forecast. The need to act is clear. We need to act now by making a decision about the location of the second airport. By the year 2035 the cost to GDP of turning away flights will be $6 billion per annum. This is something that will be condemned if we allow it to occur, because it is simply an issue about jobs and our economy. International experience shows that airports create 1,000 jobs for every one million passengers. Without action, growing congestion will hurt productivity as flights are turned away, and those that do arrive face longer and longer delays. We are already seeing the impact on one of Australia's aviation hubs, Sydney airport. Sydney Airport is of critical importance because four out of 10 flights nationally Sydney. Canberra-as much as we all love the place-is simply not an alternative. I am pleased that the federal government is acting on this issue by doing a detailed investigation into the suitability of Wilton, including conducting preliminary economic, social and environmental impact studies. The development of an airport at Wilton, a area adjacent to the Illawarra and very close to my electorate of Throsby, would bring new infrastructure, economic development and, most importantly, jobs to my region. It is for this reason, notwithstanding the environmental and social concerns that have been expressed by some peopleparticularly in suburbs relatively more close to the Wilton area than mine-that I believe this is a critical project and one that should be supported by the people of the Illawarra. The many constituents I have spoken to are excited about this project, and I hope to see it move ahead in the years to come. It is is not something that is going to immediately turn the economic fortunes of the Illawarra around, but the approval of Wilton as a site for a second airport for the Sydney region would provide a future economic strategy for the region, which is much needed as we go through the economic restructuring which has been visited upon us by movements in the manufacturing sector, the high Australian dollar and the recent announcements by BlueScope Steel that it will be exiting the export steel market. I am very buoyant about the future of the industry, and I am very buoyant about the capacity of our region to contribute to the future of the industry. As I said at the outset, safety and confidence are critical. The legislation before the House today, which is part of a broader $200 million aviation security package, is critical to that. I commend this legislation, and this industry that is critical to our country, to all members fly into and out of of the House. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (12:40): I rise today to speak on the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012. When Prime Minister Rudd first announced a plan to introduce body scanners into Australian airports in response to the failed aeroplane terrorist attacks on Christmas Day 2009, I was immediately concerned that it might be an overstep into the personal liberty and dignity of Australians. Since the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, almost 11 years ago, democracies across the world have had to weigh the consequences of liberty and safety against each other to find a balance such that we do our best to protect national security while respecting individual rights. Fortunately, since September 11, our robust parliamentary democracy has ensured that these concerns have been considered, debated and negotiated to the finest detail. The concerns in relation to this bill are no exception to that tradition. The coalition supported the referral of this bill to the House of Representatives Committee on Infrastructure Communications in order to be absolutely sure that appropriate privacy and health standards are met and, more practically, that the machines are an effective addition to the national security framework for Australians. During my participation in the committee process, many of the concerns I have just mentioned were assessed in detail, and I am now assured that these machines are a necessary step to enhance our national security framework. I would like to thank the 13 individuals and organisations who provided submissions to the committee, and of course I thank my colleagues who gave their time to the committee process. I note that the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee will provide further consideration and comment on this bill. I look forward to the tabling of the committee's report when the time comes. This bill will implement four amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004. Firstly, the bill states that a person is assumed to have consented to any screening procedure unless otherwise expressly refused, with the exception of a frisk search. Secondly, it has provisions for dealing with people who are unable to pass through a screening point. Thirdly, and most importantly, it lists but does not limit the types of equipment which may be used for screening and also provides that any images produced using body-scanning equipment must be gender neutral and non-identifiable. Lastly, the bill repeals section 95A of the Aviation Transport Security Act such that travellers are no longer able to opt for a frisk search vis-a-vis other types of screening procedures. The technology we are talking about is called the L-3 Communications ProVision millimetre wave body scanner-the same or Standing similar technology used around the world, and including in the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The technology works in three stages. First, a beam of radio waves of a oneto two-second duration is transmitted to a person within the body scanner. Second, receiving antennae pick up the reflected energy and analyse it with software called 'automatic threat detection algorithm' that is contained within the unit. Third, if an anomaly occurs, such as those produced by items on the body or inside clothing, a generic human image is generated with a small box superimposed over the location of the anomaly. One concern that was raised about this new technology is the potential health implications of the radio waves-a common community concern. I understand that the active millimetre wave scanners use what is called non-ionising radiation in the form of millimetre waves, very similar to the radio frequency radiation emitted by mobile phones. This non-ionising radiation produces less energy and fewer physiological effects than ionising radiation, according to the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. These waves are able to pass through clothing and organic material, meaning these appear to be transparent to the analysis machine. The human eye can only respond to and see wavelengths within a very tight band. We cannot see radiation; we can only see its effects. Often, as the human condition dictates, what we cannot feel, touch, see or hear, we cannot understand, and often we fear what we cannot understand. Fortunately, with today's modern technology, scientists are able to experiment with millimetre waves and investigate their impact on humans. The technology in these body scanning machines means an individual is exposed to the radiation for less than one to two seconds, which is the equivalent of a very short mobile phone call, or the equivalent of passive exposure from a mobile phone used several metres away. It is always important to mitigate the risk of health implications when considering radiation-emitting technology and, in this case, it appears that such concerns have been addressed and that the body scanners do not pose a risk to the health of aeroplane travellers. Indeed, passengers are exposed to considerably more radiation just sitting on the aeroplane. Many submissions address the privacy concerns that the body scanning process may create. As Civil Liberties Australia noted in their submission: Australians are being given no choice about being forcibly subjected to the scanners, which is a complete denial of civil liberties … … … … … Australia must start to return … towards our traditional freedoms of movement, speech and assembly which existed before 9/11. This is a view to which I am sympathetic. Politicians and governments of any country must always respect the fundamental importance of vigilance when looking at bills that impose restrictions on liberty. It is easy to resort to extremes. Of course, as some have suggested, if we give up our supposed liberty then the terrorists have won. However, the privacy concerns that Civil Liberties Australia and others have raised do not address the particular details of this bill. What happens when someone undergoes security screening at an airport? As the explanatory memorandum notes in relation to proposed section 44, the ultimate image produced by the body scanner: … must be a gender-neutral, generic image such that the person is not identifiable and no anatomical or physical attributes of that person are revealed. Fortunately, as a result of the committee process, the government intends to propose an amendment which will ensure that any technology used cannot store or transmit images. This is a desirable outcome which will further protect the privacy of Australians. I have seen first hand the types of images that this technology creates and, in fact, because this technology is able to pinpoint an anomaly to a specific part of the body, less intrusion into a person's privacy is required. This also means that cultural and religious concerns are protected, as religious items or clothing would not be required to be removed. Similarly, the selection of an individual would continue in line with the current explosives screening process-that is, someone would not be selected on the basis of their race, religion or gender, and selection would be undertaken on a purely random basis. As such, I would consider the process of going through one of the scanners to be no more onerous then going through a metal detector at the airport or putting your luggage through a scanner. Furthermore, the bill will repeal 95A of the Aviation Transport Security Act, which previously allowed a person to choose an alternative screening method. The bill proposes that when a person is randomly selected to undergo a full body scan, they may not opt out or choose an alternative method of screening, and, in the case that they refuse to be scanned, that they then may not pass through security. I am sure that the vast majority of Australians agree that they are willing to forgo one to two seconds of their time in order to protect the national security of this country. However, I do not agree with the government's argument that because this new scanning technology is so expensive, the program must be made compulsory as a mechanism of inducing cost-effectiveness. That is an appalling line of reasoning-the exact same justification that this Labor government uses for the wasteful way they are rolling out the NBN. It is illogical to suggest that something is cost-effective because you are forcing someone to pay for it even if they do not want to do so. But we know that this government does not believe in logic or reason. However, given that the purpose of the full body scanners is to pick up items that are by their very nature difficult or impossible to detect by any other means, the only other alternative would be an extensive and extremely invasive body search. The Department of Infrastructure and Transport noted: The only alternative method of screening that would provide a similar level of assurance to that of a body scanner is an enhanced full body frisk search. Forcing people to go through an extensive frisk search would not be in line with community expectations and therefore an opt-out provision would be inappropriate in this case. Additionally, this screening process could be beneficial for people with disabilities and other medical conditions that would make a frisk search prohibitively intrusive. I understand the privacy concerns of many, but we must not ideologically dismiss out of hand something that, when examined in detail, is no more a deprivation of liberty than the current security process that many people go through, either at the airport or even as they enter their workplace. The efficacy and consequent impact on passenger facilitation rates was also examined by the committee. Many submissions proposed that the body scanners would be incapable of detecting many types of possible threats. For example, the Australian Airline Pilots Association cited evidence from the United Kingdom that some types of powders, liquid or thin plastic would not show up as anomalies. Similarly, another submission proposed that the scanners would result in an excessive rate of high false positives which may be caused by certain types of footwear, a person's posture or other layers of clothing. Fortunately, we can look at the evidence from trials conducted at Sydney and Melbourne airports last year, which saw almost 24,000 scans during a three-week period. The results from those trials indicated that 57 per cent of passengers were able to proceed immediately through security, which is a higher alarm rate than walk-through metal detectors. The trials will assist with the ultimate rollout of body scanners across Australia, as analysis conducted after the trials indicated that the higher alarm rate was caused by a lack of familiarity among passengers with the new process due to their not being aware of which items had to be removed before they undertook the scan. The resolution process itself, however, was found to be quicker than walk-through metal detectors, as the image produced indicates a specific position on the body part where the anomaly is located. The effects on passenger facilitation rates, which are similar to the effects caused by the current explosivetesting process, would, it seems, be minimal because the basis for selection is random and this is not likely to produce bottlenecks at security stations. Delays would be much more likely to be caused by screening for carry-on baggage-and, indeed, this is the case today. Every person has been through a metal detector and forgotten to take off watches, hairclips or jewellery. I expect that, as passengers become more familiar with the new process, passenger facilitation rates will improve. There were many concerns in the community when this bill was introduced. Throughout the committee process we assessed many issues in reaching our conclusions on concerns about health, privacy, efficacy and passenger facilitation rates. I am satisfied that this bill weighs considerations of liberty and safety and finds a balance which respects the individual rights of Australians while also protecting our national security.",68
42,Mr HAYES,Unknown," Looking around the chamber, I see that there may be at least one or two members who, like me, recall being able to go to an airport for a domestic flight and buy a ticket over the counter and that and there was no need for identification, no screening and no bag X-ray and that you could simply walk on board the plane provided you had a seat allocation. It was a little bit more difficult on an international flight-you needed a passport, at least. In those days we did not even know about digitised imaging on passports. I hasten to say that I certainly do not include you among the one or two members. I mentioned, Madam Deputy Speaker Grierson.",76
43,Mr Chester,Unknown,What a charmer!,76
44,Mr HAYES,Unknown,"I take the interjection! 9-11 changed our world a heck of a lot. It was a serious wake-up call about community safety. No government is going to be accused of being soft on terrorism on its watch; no government is going to wilfully create a window of opportunity for organised crime or terrorists. Since 9-11 things have never been the same, and they will never be the same. This is a tragedy. We all think we grew up in great times but things will never be as they were in the past-and, because of 9-11, they never will be the same. We will always be vigilant about the terrorist threat and we will always ensure that our law enforcement agencies have the necessary tools, technology and support to combat the terrorist threat on behalf of our community. Technologically, too, things will never be the same again. We have seen great advances in technology over the last few years. I am the laughed at when I go to a maths class at a school these days and talk about how I was taught to use a slide rule and that we used log tables.",76
45,Mr Chester,Unknown,Geoff used to use an abacus!,76
46,Mr HAYES,Unknown,"The member opposite is saying that the member for Bass used to use an abacus. He probably did use one in Geelong-but they are advancing too, I notice! The massive improvements in technology been great for the community. We all benefit from it-our productivity and economic advancement depend on it-but there are others who also benefit from advances in technology. Serious and organised crime has made a business out of it. We hear about people's identities being stolen, which we did not know about in the past. More importantly, we are seeing that people will exploit every window of opportunity they can to commit a crime or to terrorise-or to demonstrate that they have the capability to terrorise-our community. We need to have equipment such as full body scanners to be able to combat these acts. This bill aims to ensure that the technology we give to the agencies which are charged with protecting our community is sufficient for them to do their job. I know that many think that what we propose to do with this bill is a serious violation of basic human rights and a gross invasion of privacy. People who say that are right: it is. Many things we do in this place very much limit the rights of members of our community but, hopefully, we do these things for very good reasons and for good purpose. When we do such things, we must balance them with the overall good of the community. I say this passes that overall good test, particularly when you think back to 2009-not all that long ago-when we heard of the Americans arresting the 'underpants bomber'. He had the idea that he could defeat the scanning technology by strapping an incendiary device to his underwear. Obviously a lot of advanced chemistry was involved and a whole host of other things went into planning, but this bloke's whole concept was to defeat the current technology of body scanning. He was successful in getting on board the aircraft, which flew from Amsterdam to Detroit. Fortunately, he was not so successful in properly detonating his device and the plane landed unharmed. Thankfully, he was taken into custody. He was certainly not repentant for his sins against the community. He made it very clear what he intended to do-to destroy the aircraft and everyone on board. That is a classic example of how those that wish to terrorise our community use advances in technology to defeat whatever technologies we have in place to combat these efforts. The world will never be the same in terms of the issue of terrorism, so we can never take our foot off the throat of who would purport to harm our community. About 2½ years ago, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement-of which, I note, Madam Deputy Speaker Grierson, you are also a valued memberinquired into the security of ports and airports. You will recall that, during one of our inspections, we visited the airport in South Australia. Whilst it was not necessarily germane to what we were looking at at that time, they discussed the prospect of full-body scanners. At that stage the notion of what full-body scanners might do ranged from a full naked X-ray of a person through to what you could see under a person's underwear. A whole host of things were canvassed with the committee. But the for- advances that have been made in this technology mean that, with the scan, the figure is graphically shown as a stick figure. So it would not discriminate between the member for Lyons, being the fit and able person he is, and me, being a little bit more sedentary-the same stick figure would show for both of us. That at least gives me a little hope for the future! If something unusual was detected on the body, that would light up. If there was something on the hip, the scan would not show up as a firearm or a knife-that location would just be identified and lit up and security officers could then address that. It is not invasive in terms of having naked pictures of people stored. In fact, this bill will ensure that the machinery, the technology, that is used has no capability of storing or transmitting any material or image. Therefore it is solely a piece of technology that will allow airport security to make the judgment as to whether to detain somebody for further examination on the basis of what is indicated on the image of the stick figure concerned. So, in terms of the argument about civil rights, I think all sides of the those House can be assured that we have the balance right. We have arrived at a piece of technology that does not intrude on people's privacy; it is just able to scan the body to detect unusual objects associated with it. The amendments contained in the bill will support the country adopting, if it is successful, the body scanner which is now being trialled both in Sydney and Melbourne. As I understand it, some 23,000 people have gone through that trial. By the way, they had one scanner here in Parliament House and a number of members participated in that trial, as well as, I understand, a couple of journalists. So people are now confident about the image issue, but I think that, more importantly, they see this as essential to ensure that Australian travellers are afforded the highest level of protection against aviation terrorism. It actually brings Australia in line with countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, just to name some. I know from my discussions with international law enforcement agencies that these technologies are now being widely looked at as being necessary to protect not only the citizenry of countries but people moving in and about their states. This will not be exclusive to the advanced countries I have just mentioned; it is something that will become more affordable for a wide range of countries. It will be implemented not simply because it is becoming synonymous with modern aviation but to protect the safety of the community. The bill will also ensure that technologies such as body scanners will be able to advance in the future. It will ensure that we will be able to upgrade, to acquire further image-processing technologies that may be seen in the future as essential to combat terrorism or those who would attempt to defeat the system. The intention of this bill, apart from ensuring that we will have technology to protect the community, is to be ongoing, to ensure that we stay vigilant-that we do not say: 'This is the be-all and end-all. We've to have it and that's it.' It does at least acknowledge that at the moment this is the best technology available. Down the track, the issue is going to have to be revisited, depending on how technology develops and if this system is likely to be defeated. The bill is consistent with all elements of human rights. It provides a greater measure to strengthen Australia's aviation security. I think that the limitations, where it could be seen to limit an individual's freedom or to offend issues of privacy, are well outweighed by the intention of this bill-that is, to protect the community. I support the bill and commend it to the House. Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (13:07): I rise to speak on the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012. The purpose of the bill is to implement a number of amendments that are to complement the introduction of body scanners in Australia's international airports. Since 11 September 2001, aviation authorities around the world have increased security measures to ensure passengers, crew and the general public are kept safe. Passengers and crew safety is paramount when regulating and administrating an aviation system, especially in a vast nation such as ours where a trip from one side of the country to the other by car can take several days compared to a few hours by plane. Further, larger numbers of aircraft are flying around Australia than ever before. For the year ending June 2011 domestic airlines flew over 610,000 flights, which was up 6.5 per cent from the previous year, and international airlines flew over 150,000 flights during that period. If the increase in aircraft movements is not enough of an indication of the expansion of our aviation industry, the increase in passenger numbers got most certainly is. Around 54.75 million passengers flew on Australian domestic airlines during the year ending June 2011, which was up 5.8 per cent from the year before. In the same year, there were 27.55 million passengers on international airlines, which was an increase of 7.5 per cent from 2010. In my electorate of MCPherson on the Gold Coast, the Gold Coast Airport saw passenger numbers rising to 5.17 million in 2009-10, representing an overall compound average growth rate of 9.6 per cent. According to the Gold Coast Airport's preliminary master plan, there will be an expected total of 16.3 million passengers by 2031-32. That number will be made up of 14 million domestic passengers and 2.3 million international passengers. Airports, as a result of the increasing airline activity, bring a significant amount economic benefit to their surrounding communities. The Gold Coast Airport alone provided over 1,700 individuals with employment at the end of June 2010. The economic impact of the airport precinct was $269 million, whilst facilitating $1.59 billion worth of tourism for the Gold Coast-Tweed region in the 2010 financial year. The aviation industry as a whole contributes $6.5 billion to the national GDP and employed approximately 51,000 people in November last year. Further, the industry grew by 6.3 per cent in the year ending 30 June 2011. It is evident from these statistics that the regulation and administration of safety in the aviation industry is no trivial matter. We are dealing with millions of people every year in an industry that, if damaged significantly, can detrimentally affect the nation and the nation's economy. If flights stop, families do not see each other, businesspeople do not get to and from their meetings or where they need to be, mail and parcels do not get delivered and certain goods being transported by air remain off the shelves. Many businesses count on the Gold Coast Airport to bring in tourists from both domestic and foreign markets. The Gold Coast tourism industry is currently fragile, due to a number of factors-including the high Australian dollar. Businesses and their employees cannot afford for an incident to occur with the transportation of visitors to the Gold Coast due to the lasting perception it would potentially create. We witnessed late last year the detrimental effects of issues occurring within the aviation industry, such as when industrial action was taken against an airline. The aviation industry facilitates trade and commerce in this country, and we witnessed the toll that stoppages could have on the country. Although we hope that it will never come of to this, it is still a sobering thought to contemplate the consequences of a successful terrorist action on board an aircraft. The September 11 attacks showed us that there are not only unnecessary and devastating losses of life but vast economic impacts. Therefore, when a man tried to detonate an explosive device he hid in his underwear on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009, it sparked concern amongst the aviation industry, because the device was not picked up in preflight screenings. This was because the explosive device contained no metallic objects and was therefore not picked up by metal detectors. What was even more concerning was that the would be bomber had smuggled the explosive device from Yemen to Amsterdam before boarding the flight to Detroit. This incident has shown that there are still those who will go to any lengths to harm innocent civilians. It has also shown that there is vulnerability in our security-screening practices at airports and that we must continue to be constantly vigilant when it comes to protecting our national security. As a result, a trial of body-scanning technology was undertaken at Sydney's Kingsford Smith Airport from 2 to 19 August 2011 and at Melbourne International Airport from 5 to 30 September 2011. Volunteers standing in the main queue for screening were asked whether they would be willing to participate in the trial and then were directed randomly to go through the scanner. From the trial, in which over 23,500 passengers were scanned, 57 per cent of passengers were cleared to proceed straight after passing through the scanner. However, the proof-of-concept trial report noted that passengers were six times more likely to alarm in the body scanner than in a walk-through metal detector. The report found that, out of every 1,000 passengers, on average 230 personal items within or under a passenger's clothing were compared to 43 items per 1,000 passengers who walked through a metal detector. Many of the items detected by the scanner were hairclips, jewellery, coins and notes, watches, high boots with buckles and other miscellaneous items. Cargo pants, studs on jeans, zips and buttons, baggy clothes that create folds and sequins on shirts all caused the alarm in the scanner to go off. In Senate estimates, the Office of Transport Security was asked about the rate of false positives during the trial period. The representatives of the office who were present at the hearing stated that the rate was somewhere between 20 and 40 per cent. That would mean that, out of the 230 items detected per 1,000 passengers, between 46 and 92 items were false positives. Screening officers were also required to undergo training due to the high rates of officer-passenger interaction involved. According to the Office of Transport Security this should not mean any changes in the time it takes to process passengers. The average time to scan a passenger is 1.5 to 2.5 seconds, with delays in passenger facilitation rates more likely to occur when luggage is being scanned. The scanner that the government wishes to use, the L-3 Communications ProVision millimetre wave body scanner, has been cleared by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency as well as the Department of Health and Ageing, the Therapeutic Goods Administration and overseas authorities. The power density emitted from the scanner to the passenger passing through it is 1,000 times less than that emitted by a mobile phone call. Although the introduction of the scanner is central to the context of this bill, the bill itself does more than allow for the introduction of the scanners. It amends the detected, act in question to provide legislative support for methods used in the utilisation of the scanner technology. The major changes the bill will make are the assumption of passenger consent to a screening procedure other than a frisk search unless such consent is expressly not provided. The bill will also list the types of equipment that airports will be able to use for screening, as well as specifying that, when body-scanning equipment is to be used, the image used to identify anomalies must be non-genderspecific and non-identifiable. As expectedand this has been raised by previous speakers-some of the changes have raised privacy concerns for our passengers. The body scanners provide a readout on a screen that identifies where the anomalies are located on the body. The bill provides that a generic stick figure, rather than a genderspecific image, will be used to identify the areas in which an anomaly is located. Further, the scanner will not be able to store or transmit images of scans that have been taken of passengers. Aviation security is a serious matter affecting millions of people each year as they travel around this country and overseas. As air travel becomes much more common, with greater passenger numbers and more flights, we need to ensure that we are doing all that we possibly can to protect the lives of the many people who choose to utilise air travel-as well as protecting the aviation industry and the many other industries that rely on its good health.",76
47,Mr GEORGANAS,Unknown," I rise in support of the government's Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012 because we live in a different world to the world that we lived in before September 11, the Bali bombings and the range of other incidents that have taken place. Aviation security is of utmost importance. If we do not have aviation security-if people do not feel confident that they can on a plane and to their arrival point safely and securely-then the whole industry will collapse. I represent the Adelaide Airport which is smack bang in the middle of my electorate of Hindmarsh. When issues arise about security at airports, aviation noise or any of a range of other things, constituents raise these issues with me-and I have already been contacted about this particular new technology, the body scanner that will be placed in airports around Australia. So I have taken an interest in this bill, because know a lot of people will be concerned, and it is our job here to assure them that what this government is doing is in the best interest of aviation safety and for the common good of us all. The central elements of this bill are as follows. The bill will ensure a person at a screening point is taken to consent to any screening procedure, with the exception of a frisk search, unless the person expressly refuses to undergo a particular procedure. It will allow the Aviation Transport Security Regulations 2005 to prescribe the persons that must not pass through a screening point and to list, but not limit, the types of equipment-including body-scanning equipment-that can be used for screening. It will repeal section 95A of the act, which currently allows a person to choose a frisk search over another screening procedure. This will mean that an individual will be unable to select the type of technology they are screened by, noting that allowances will be made where there is a physical or medical reason that would prevent screening by a certain screening technology. I do not believe that the content of this bill is controversial-the opposition are saying that they will be supporting the billalthough you might think it was, given some of the messages the opposition is putting out get in the debate today. Nobody would dispute the need for security on our domestic and international aircraft. As I said earlier, safety is absolutely paramount; we all want to feel safe when we get on an aeroplane to go from point A to point B, whether we are travelling regionally, interstate or internationally. The aviation industry changed forever on 11 September 2001. One of the reasons this bill has come to fruition today in this chamber is that on 25 December 2009, a passenger attempted to I bomb Northwest Airlines flight 253 en route from Amsterdam to Detroit. This particular bomber successfully smuggled some sort of explosive device through security in his underpants; had he been successful, it could have been tragic. The device which was concealed inside the passenger's underwear contained no metallic components; it could not be picked up by the normal scanners that we go through. It is very serious that these sorts of devices can get onto aeroplanes and cause enormous damage-to passengers and to those on the ground-destroy our aviation industry and highlight the terrorist's program or whatever they are planning. It is so important that this bill is not controversial. Nobody would dispute that we need that security, and that is what this bill does. In response to the events on 25 December, when the Christmas Day passenger attempted to bomb Northwest Airlines, the government announced on 9 February, 2010, a package of measures to strengthen Australia's aviation security. It is very important that this bill is not controversial. It is important that we have confidence in our airlines and their safety, and that we can get from point A to point B feeling safe knowing that we have done all that can possibly be done to ensure that we have a secure flight. Nobody would dispute that fact. We know we have had people like this Christmas Day suicide bomber all around the world. Even here in Australia there have been people who have sought to do others harm. It is a very sad thing but it will continue to happen. Thankfully, we have not come to the point where such plans have materialised and been successful here on our soil, or in the air, but I do not believe we should assume a policy of optimism because it has never happened. As our primary means of defence against these harmful acts we need to have good security; that is a given. The only questions go to the detail of, for example, what passengers may take on board, either on their person or in their on luggage, and the means by which people are checked. Both the shoe bomber and the underwear bomber were able to get on those planes without being detected. Many of us in airports get frustrated at the removal of our shoes, belts and watches, and at the loss of nail files and the occasional item from dutyfree. A constituent recently contacted me because he lost a bottle of wine at a gate at an overseas terminal. But these are security measures that cannot be taken lightly, and I would rather know that these things are taking place, that I am secure on a plane, than know that people are being let on board without proper security checks. By and large we have all learned to live with that. All of us-especially all of us in this parliament-fly regularly, and we have seen the changes over the years, but we accept them and we live with them. By and large we get on with it, and put up with the limitations of what we can and cannot take onto a flight, because safety is paramount. When you weigh up the two, I and most Australians would rather feel safe. This bill is about the screening process and the process that passengers will have to go through. I would expect that most of the provisions of the bill would pass the common-sense test. Again, we need to ensure the security of aviation and the public. We do not have an optional screening process; people do not elect to be screened nor do they choose their methods of screening. That would be quite unreasonable. We have the means and the obligation to employ the best and most suitable screening technologies and processes that we can. It is these screening technologies and processes that should be applied wherever possible. Hence, we are removing the ability to choose frisking over a technological screen. We will proceed with the best process available. carryWhere a person is physically unable to be screened by a deployed technology, we have an alternative process which will be used, as is currently the case. Again, this is just common sense. I have had a couple of constituent queries about one aspect of this bill and airport security generally, especially about the introduction of the new body scanners. I want to take this moment to go over a couple of points that some of my constituents have raised with me and have considered to be of particular interest. The body scanners to which I refer have been in the public eye for almost a year. We had them up here as well, and many of us tested them out here in parliament-I am sure many of my colleagues on both sides of the House tested them out. The minister launched a trial of the body scanners in August last year at Sydney International Airport. More than 4,000 passengers volunteered to be part of the trial and were scanned, many of them taking the time to queue up to volunteer and experience that new technology. From Sydney, the trial moved to Melbourne International Airport September 2011. It was apparent from these trials that this technology is very effective at picking up the presence of any object being carried on passengers-wallets, keys and the like, and anything else you may have on your person. If this technology had been in place on 25 December on that Northwest Airlines flight, this particular person, the underwear bomber, would have been successfully apprehended. It is apparent from all these trials that the technology is very effective and works very well. The other issue raised was the energy waves these particular scanners emit. They use very low-energy waves to detect items, metal and non-metal, under a passenger's clothing. The image shows the location of the item on a generic human representation on a screen. It is a stick figure, a very generic outline. The member for Paterson or someone earlier showed us a copy of that stick figure. You cannot tell who the person is, or whether they are male or female. It does not show the person. There is no portrayal of the person's physical characteristics or the characteristics of any of the clothing they are wearing. The scanners do not invade a person's privacy. Many members here trialled the scanner upstairs or in Sydney or Melbourne and would agree with me. The scanners are safe. More radiation is emitted on an aeroplane flight than from this particular scanner. To put the energy these scanners emit into context, an average mobile phone call emits 10,000 times more radio frequency than these scanners. So for every phone call you make, the emission of energy is 10,000 times more than you would get from this scanner, so you can see that there are no dangers at all to people's health. People should be assured that they are not being X-rayed like in a doctor's surgery or in the old X-raying systems we had many years ago that did perhaps cause problems. The scanning is perfectly safe and not detrimental to a person's health. Nevertheless, there will be people who will be concerned and rightly so. It is always the way with new technology. People are concerned, they are not too sure of the technology and they do not know it too well. It is up to us, as members of parliament and as leaders of our communities, to assure people that there is no danger and no detriment to their health when they are using the scanner. The simple example of a mobile phone emitting 10,000 times the energy of the scanner is something that can put people's minds at rest. We can assure people that the introduction of these new body scanners will serve us well as passengers and as a community and will ensure our safety. I have the Adelaide airport in my electorate. We require airports, as we heard earlier from other members opposite. They are a hub of the community. They ensure our economic stability and bring people and goods in and out, so it is important that the aviation industry thrives to ensure that we can operate effectively around the country. As I said, once these scanners are up and running, no-one will know what the fuss was all about and we will be a safer nation for having implemented them. I commend this bill to the House. Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (13:33): I rise this afternoon to speak on the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012. In my electorate of Solomon we have the Darwin International Airport. My electorate and indeed the Top End of the Northern Territory is the gateway to Asia. The Northern Territory's economy relies heavily on a strong tourism industry, particularly foreign tourism. I accept the Office of Transport Security's assurances that the body scanners are necessary to enhance our national security framework and I also bear in mind that the new technologies like this will increase safety for all travellers. However, I must note the concerns relating to the millimetre-wave body scanners expressed to me by my Solomon constituents. An issue raised with me by some is that there is a possible health risk, particularly for those who are frequent travellers. However, my understanding of the technology is that the scanner emits 10,000 times less radio frequency energy than an average mobile phone call does and also that the scans are within the limits set by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. Further to this, the government and Office of Transport Security have assured the coalition that these machines are indeed safe. Active implanted medical devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators are designed to meet a series of standards which require the devices to be protected from interference from external energy sources such as mobile phones and other electronic equipment. The power levels for the ProVision body scanners are lower than many other sources including mobile phones and, as such, there are no safety concerns. Furthermore, due to the very low power level of the body scanner, it will be unable to detect internal medical devices such as pacemakers and metal hips. Another issue raised with me was that of privacy, particularly from those who believe that the machine projects a nude photo of the person's body. However, section 3(3B) of the bill states that any image produced by a body scanner must produce a gender neutral generic image such that the person is not identifiable and anatomical or physical attributes of the person are not revealed. The image produced by this scan is a generic outline. If the machine detects an anomaly, the scan highlights the general section of the body where the object is concealed. That image cannot be kept or transmitted elsewhere. The bill repeals section 95A of the Aviation Transport Security Act which allows a person to choose an alternative screening method of other screening procedures. This means that a person who is randomly selected to undertake a scan may not choose an alternative method of screening such as a frisk search. If a person selected for a scan refuses, they will be unable to pass through the screening point. This new approach was adopted from the United Kingdom and is based on three primary reasons. Firstly, the security outcome: the scanner is designed to detect items that are by their nature difficult or impossible to detect by other means. The only alternative to the body scanner which may achieve the same outcome would be an extensive and invasive frisk search. The government believes that this would not meet community standards, and we would have to agree. Secondly, the cost effectiveness: the government has invested in the new scanning technology and believes that this expenditure can only be justified by having a compulsory scheme. Finally, the technology type: the department believes the type of technology to be deployed in Australian international airports mitigates health and privacy concerns to such an extent that an optional system is not necessary. Another concern raised with me is that of efficiency and time. The trial at Sydney and Melbourne airports last year saw more than 23,000 scans undertaken over a three-week period and 57 per cent of the passengers were able to proceed immediately. This is a higher rate than with walk-through metal detectors. According to the analysis conducted after the trial, alarms were commonly caused by high boots with buckles, money, hairclips, watches, jewellery, pockets on cargo pants and additional studs or zips on jeans and pants. I am sure my colleagues in the chamber are aware that these are often the things that set off metal walk-through detectors even here in Parliament House. The trial found that the alarm resolution was quicker than with walk-through metal detectors as the scanners indicated the area that had caused the alarm. The Office of Transport Security has advised that, as expected, the time spent in the scanner is longer than that for the walk-through metal detectors. passengers to go through scanners will be chosen on a random basis, like for existing explosives testing. The Office of Transport Security believes that delays at screening points are more likely to be caused by screening for carry-on baggage than by body scans. This was supported by the findings of the trial. A sensitive issue which arose out of the House Committee for Infrastructure and Communications inquiry was the notion that the machine may infringe upon a person's cultural and religious beliefs. However, passengers will not be required to remove any religious items or clothing. I have been informed that the department has engaged with religious groups through the Office of the the Australian Information Commissioner to ensure that the processes are culturally sensitive. It should be noted that individuals will not be selected on the basis of their race, religion or gender. As I said, body scans will be undertaken on a purely random basis. I believe this technology does a lot for protection of the individual traveller but will also do a lot for protection of our image and reputation as a safe tourist destination. As I said earlier, in my home of the Northern Territory tourism is incredibly important to our economy. In 2011, approximately 1.2 million people visited the Northern Territory and spent approximately $1.4 billion. Darwin International Airport has approximately one million passengers walking through its doors each year. The national average for those employed by the tourism industry is around 8.2 per cent of total employment. Tourism in the Northern Territory provides approximately 19,800 jobs for Territorians, which equates to around 17 per cent of the Territory's total employment. Measures like body scanners will uphold Australia's and the Northern Territory's The reputation as a safe place to visit, despite our crocodiles. The world we live in is not the one a lot of us grew up in. In today's climate of international terrorism, measures like body scanners must be taken to ensure the safety of Australians and those visiting us. As the member for Solomon I will not be opposing this bill because I believe we should do everything we can in this parliament to provide safety and uphold Australia's reputation as a safe country for tourism.",81
48,Mr LYONS,Unknown," The Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012 is one that everyone should support. We know that the safety of our aircraft is a vital part of the services that governments and the industry should provide. All members of this parliament believe in the safety of our air services. We are an island nation and air services are a vital method of getting tourists to Australia and, in particular, to my island state of Tasmania and my electorate of Bass. We know that everyone will support this bill. We probably go on too much in this place about safety in speaking about this bill, but the reality is that everyone should endorse it. This is a safe measure and we should be working with technology to get the best method of securing safe aviation. It would be a risk for any attempted bomber to smuggle viable improvised explosives onto an aircraft coming into Australia with a device concealed in a passenger's clothing. So it is really important that we respond to the incident that occurred on 9 February 2010. The government announced a package of measures to strengthen Australia's aviation security and that package included $28.5 million to assist the aviation industry to introduce a range of technologies including body scanners, multiview X-ray machines, bottled liquid scanners and additional explosive trace detection units at international terminals. To allow aviation screening officers to check people who present at an aviation security point, we should be giving them all the powers they need to undertake this vital work. Our body scanners will facilitate safe air travel in this country. We know that the Liberals support this bill because they believe in safe travel in Australia and it is time they got on board to support this legislation.",85
49,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," Order! It being 1.45 pm the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA Petition: Robina Mail Delivery Centre Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (13:45): Today I seek to table a petition on behalf of MCPherson residents, protesting against the closure, at the end of June this year, of the Robina Mail Delivery Centre on Ron Penhaligon Way. The petition read as followsNA NA NA This petition of residents of MCPherson draws to the attention of the House to the announced closure of the Robina Delivery Centre, Queensland We therefore ask the House to: urge the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy to use his power under the Australia Post Act to consult with the Australia Post Board regarding the closure of the Robina Delivery Centre, located in Robina Queensland, on the grounds that: *it is located within a retail precinct where businesses rely on its services; and *it provides postal services to a large number of local businesses and people, particularly senior and elderly citizens. from 300 citizens Petition received. Mrs ANDREWS: The petition has been assessed by the Standing Committee on Petitions as compliant with standing orders. The closure of the mail delivery centre will affect numerous small businesses who rely on the business of local residents and also post office box holders who come to collect and drop off their mail. Residents and post office box holders, including many older Australians, will now have to travel further to pick up large mail and parcels or to collect mail from their post office box. The fact that there are 300 signatories to this petition shows that there is real concern within the community. I also wish to place on record that local newsagent Tony Keilar also facilitated the petition and I thank him for his work and his commitment to keeping the Robina Mail Delivery Centre open. I believe that Australia Post should have more broadly consulted with the local community to ensure that any changes to postal services in the area would not disadvantage local residents and existing small businesses. I call on the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy to take note of the concerns as outlined in the petition and to consult with Australia Post immediately. 13th Croquet World Championship",86
50,Mr ZAPPIA,Unknown," Between 28 April and 6 May this year, the 13th Croquet World Championship was held in Adelaide and hosted by several Adelaide based clubs. Eighty world-ranked players from 24 countries competed. Australia is the largest croquet-playing nation in the world, with some 8,000 players. The Tea Tree Gully Croquet Club in the Makin electorate was selected as one of the host clubs. I am familiar with the Tea Tree Gully Croquet Club, having visited it on several occasions. I can vouch for the professionalism of its management committee, currently led by very hard working locals Peter and Kaye Rostron, the well-kept facilities and the terrific team approach taken by all members to ensure that the club runs well. On 2 May I was able to visit the club and watch a couple of the world championship matches. As I expected, the skills of the players competing lived up to what one might expect in a world championship. As I also expected, the Tea Tree Gully Croquet Club members ensured their club made its contribution towards a successful championship, which I understand was won by Reg Bamford, of South Africa, who defeated Australia's Robert Fletcher in five games. I take this opportunity to congratulate the South Australia Croquet Association for hosting the 2012 world championship. I particularly congratulate the Tea Tree Gully Croquet Club for being selected as a host club and, in so doing, bringing some of the world's best croquet players out to the local community. Wanneroo Horse and Pony Club",87
51,Mr SIMPKINS,Unknown," I take this opportunity to acknowledge the positive contribution that the Wanneroo Horse and Pony Club makes in providing opportunities for young people in the Wanneroo district within the Cowan electorate. Last Sunday I visited their rally and was able to thank current and past committee members for their volunteer efforts. As we know, volunteers allow so many sports, clubs and other organisations in this country to exist. They do not do it for money; they do it because they believe that young people need the opportunities to learn good lessons and values that will make them better citizens and better community members, as well as having a lot of fun. In the case of the Wanneroo Horse and Pony Club, the young members are supported by the volunteers that administer, instruct and assess them. The young riders learn through these volunteers to look after and work with their horses to achieve their goals. There is no room for selfcenteredness; rather, they understand the requirement for responsibility and cooperation. These are good lessons for young people to learn. Therefore I have great faith that the young people in the club will be fine Australians and make contributions to our nation in the years to come. I particularly thank their president Juanita Brewer for the chance to meet the volunteers and hear about the great Wanneroo Horse and Pony Club. I also thank vice-president Nairiee Bager and her daughter Charm for telling me about how the club operates and about Charm's Welsh C pony. I also thank the many volunteers for their great efforts to provide young riders with the opportunities to learn and compete in such a positive environment. Fowler Electorate: Miller Health and Family Day",87
52,Mr HAYES,Unknown," Last week I attended the Miller Health and Family Day in my electorate of Fowler. Information stalls by local service providers allowed parents to speak directly to the providers to get useful information regarding services that are available to them and their families. Children enjoyed a range of activities including a reptile zoo, a jumping castle and face painting. Everybody who attended was also treated to very good musical performances, including an adorable one by the young kids of Miller Cubbyhouse. The day represented a joint effort by Mission Australia, Miller Pathways and the Inspire Church communities. I would like to praise the efforts of Leonie Green, Mission Australia's state manager; a very dedicated manager from Miller Pathways, Magdalena Liso; and Lucy Reggio, project officer with Miller Pathways. In addition to being hard working, Lucy is also a volunteer with many other organisations in my community, assisting individuals and families in need, particularly those families living with a disability. Inspire Church was represented by Pastor great John MCMartin and his team, which greatly assisted in making the day such a success. The day was a great opportunity to celebrate family and to acknowledge the vital role that family plays in our society. Families come in all shapes and sizes with different religious and cultural backgrounds, but they all come with a common interest: to stick together and provide children with love, care and support to help them grow into responsible adults. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing",88
53,Mr BALDWIN,Unknown," There are none so deaf as those who refuse to listen and none so blind who refuse to see. This government has not listened to the community and it has not seen the impact of its carbon tax. Today Kurri Hydro put out a press release referring to the cancellation of work contracts, saying, '344 further jobs to go.' And further: … the long-term viability will be negatively affected by a number of factors including increasing energy costs and the carbon tax. The carbon tax is going to cost the aluminium sector jobs in the Hunter. There are none so blind as the member for Charlton, the Minister for Industry and Innovation-the architect of the carbon tax. And there are none so deaf as the member for Hunter, whose electorate Kurri Hydro resides in, and none so arrogant as those who refuse to act. I am calling on those members in the Hunter to immediately move a motion to suspend the carbon tax, to have an opportunity to save those 344 jobs-and that is not counting the downstream effect that these job losses will incur. The aluminium industry is critically important to the Hunter. The flow-on effect could go through to Tomago Aluminium as well, and that means more job losses. Members opposite do not care about job losses; they care about their carbon tax. I am more interested in the people that I represent. Therefore, the carbon tax should be stopped. (Time expired) Public Health System",88
54,Mr WILKIE,Unknown," The public health system in Tasmania was already struggling with the rising cost of modern health care and the additional costs associated with the ageing population. But add years of poor governance, a small tax base and dreadful health indicators and you have a particularly nasty situation where people are dying unnecessarily. Now compounding this is the state government's decision to try and cut $100 million from the health budget last year and to do so again in the coming financial year. What we are seeing in Tasmania should send shock waves through governments around the country. Yes, there are unique factors in Tasmania-but just about every jurisdiction has unique challenges-meaning that much of Australia's public health system is heading for an inevitable crisis that will only be averted by a federal government taking the system or at least moving to some type of single-funding model. More cash is good, and I am grateful to the federal government for working with me on added assistance right now for the Tasmanian public health system, but that will be just start of the solution for Tasmania or anywhere else. Ultimately real reform is what is needed now. Carbon Pricing",89
55,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown," Never have I seen someone so happy as the member for Paterson as he celebrates the loss of up to 350 jobs at Hydro Aluminium in Kurri Kurri in my electorate, a plant which has been losing literally millions of dollars every for the past few years at least. We have not had a carbon price for the last few years, but they have been losing money. Why have they been losing money? There are three key factors: the very high Australian dollar-it is an export industry; very low prices for aluminium on the global market, on the metals exchange, an issue which is closing smelters right around the globe; and their inability to secure a long-term electricity contract with the guys from his party that run the New South Wales government. So, rather than rejoice in this event, I will be empathising and sympathising with both the firm and its workers and doing all I can to ensure that somehow Hydro might yet have a future-they have talked about mothballing-in the hope of reopening the plant, which would more than likely be in a carbon price environment. I will be working very hard-I have already started working hard-to make sure those retrenched workers have every opportunity for alternative employment. (Time expired) Freemasons Foundation Centre for Men's Health  Opposition Business) (13:55): This September will mark five years since the establishment of the Freemasons Foundation Centre for Men's Health. The centre is based at the University of Adelaide and focuses on the education and research into men's health issues. The centre aims to take a crossdisciplinary approach to research and policymaking, bringing together experts from different fields to encourage collaboration in the interests of men's health. Despite only having been operational for a short time, the centre has a proud record of contribution to men's health education and research. The centre has also been highly effective in raising awareness of men's health in recruiting community leaders to speak out year on men's health issues. The centre has established a board of patrons drawn from business, politics and sporting leaders. I am proud to have served on this board for most of the lifetime of the centre. It has been a privilege to serve under the leadership of Eric Neal, principal patron and chair and former Governor of South Australia. I would also like to pay tribute to Professor Villis Marshall, who recently announced he would be stepping down as a director of the centre. Professor Marshall has provided great leadership in his role as director. His contribution to the success of the centre cannot be overstated. I am proud to be associated with the centre and I hope they will soon add to their achievements of raising $15 million in external funding, publishing more than 100 peer reviewed papers on men's health and administering a number of community health programs, including the highly successful GIRTH program, a community based healthy-living program for men, aimed at improving cardiovascular health. Jenkins, Ms Amanda",89
56,Mr JENKINS,Unknown," In selfindulgence and as a tribute to children of members and senators who have to cope with having a parent in public life, I wish my daughter Amanda a happy 21st birthday for today. As a parliamentarian, I have missed more birthdays of Amanda than I have attended, and she is a great credit to my Michelle who has shouldered the parenting duties. I am very proud of her achievements to this date and I wish her every success and achievement in the future. Sidman, Ms Kay",90
57,Mr MATHESON,Unknown," I would like to pay tribute to a wonderful lady from my electorate, Kay Sidman, who will hold her 12th Biggest Morning Tea event for the Cancer Council tomorrow. So far, Kay has raised more than $193,000 for the cause, making her one of the country's top fundraisers for the Cancer Council. With the help of the Macarthur community, she hopes to crack the $200,000 mark this year. Kay Sir holds a morning tea every year in memory of her sister Jan who died of cancer in 2004. In a recent media interview Kay said that each year she hoped the money she raised 'would help kill this dreaded thing called cancer'. Kay's Biggest Morning Tea draws huge crowds and has grown much bigger than she could ever imagine. This year guests can enjoy massages, aromatherapy, tarot card readings, food, drinks, a chocolate wheel and a fashion parade. I think it is fantastic that one lady can inspire so many people to come along and support her event. This year the Campbelltown Lions Club will fire up the barbecue. Many locals have donated items and vouchers, including one local family who have donated hundreds of dollars in fuel vouchers for the event. Kay Sidman is a great asset to her family and the Macarthur community. Her love for her sister is now helping thousands of Australians who benefit from the work of the all Cancer Council. The money she raises each year brings us one step closer to finding a cure for cancer. I would like to publicly commend Kay for her great work and her commitment to the cause. I join the Macarthur community in being very proud of wife her achievements and I know her sister Jan would be very proud of her efforts too. Friendship for Life Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (13:59): Last Saturday I was pleased to join with the local Turkish and veterans communities in Port Kembla with a wonderful ceremony named Friendship for Life. To mark this occasion, I was joined by the Turkish Consul-General, Ms Celik, and a wreath was laid. The ceremony marks the deep friendship between Australia and the Republic of Turkey. Our nations are forever joined through the bond of blood shed during the terrible Gallipoli campaign of 1915. Each year Australians remember what the ANZACs did in war. Each year Australians travel to Turkey and to the Gallipoli Peninsula to be a part of the ceremony there that marks the remembrance of this terrible sacrifice. When they do, they see the respect that Turkey affords to Australia at the ceremonies of ANZAC Cove, Lone Pine, The Neck and so many others. The principles of Friendship for Life are based on the very moving pledge by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk made to the mothers of ANZAC fallen in 1934. Ataturk was not only a hero in battle; he was a hero and a leader in the peace.",90
58,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," Order! In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Carbon Pricing",91
59,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer her to the announcement today that Hydro Aluminium will close down its Kurri Kurri plant employing 344 people in part because of the impact of a carbon tax on its long-term viability. Given that the carbon tax is already a wrecking ball swinging through the aluminium industry, the coal industry, the steel industry and the aviation industry, will the Prime Minister apologise to the 344 workers whose livelihoods are now imperilled by her broken promise never to have a carbon tax?",91
60,Ms GILLARD,Unknown," To the Leader of the Opposition's question, I am of course always concerned when I hear news of job losses. For the individual workers involved and for their families this is a very difficult time and I certainly feel for them and we will be working to support them. But I also think it is very important that in this place and beyond this placeMr Baldwin interjecting",91
61,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for Paterson!,91
62,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"we are clear as to what the reasons are and what the pressures are on the aluminium industry. I am very conscious of those pressures on the industry that are happening here in Australia and overseas. The reality is that the continuing fallout from the global financial crisis, along with increased global capacity, is putting downward pressure on world aluminium prices. Aluminium prices peaked at $3,300 per tonne but are now approximately $2,000 per tonne-that is US dollars-representing a fall of 40 per cent. This depression in global aluminium prices has resulted in numerous closures around the world of older, less competitive smelters. Hydro Aluminium has consistently identified the strong Australian dollar, low metal prices and current international",91
63,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The Prime Minister will resume her seat. The Leader of the Opposition on a point of order?,91
64,Mr Abbott,Unknown,I asked the Prime Minister about the impact of the carbon tax on this closure and whether she would apologise. She should be directly relevant.,91
65,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Leader of the House on a point of order?,91
66,Mr Albanese,Unknown,"Yes, Madam Deputy Speaker. That is not an opportunity for the Leader of the Opposition to spout rhetoric at the dispatch box. If he has a point of order on relevance, he simply has to say that.",91
67,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The Prime Minister is answering the question. The Prime Minister has the call.,91
68,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"I took the question seriously and presumed that the Leader of the Opposition was actually concerned about these job losses. Obviously these workers are just political fodder to him; the same way that the steelworkers he stood alongside have just been props, because he has not been prepared to support their jobs. I am identifying the factors that Hydro Aluminium has pointed to as relating to the news today about these jobs: the strong Australian dollar, low metal prices and current international economic conditions. Minister Combet has spoken directly to the company today, and they are very clear that their current financial pressures have nothing to do with the carbon price. So the Leader of the Opposition should not come into this place and mislead. He should not do that. Mr Baldwin interjecting",92
69,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for Paterson will resume his seat. A point of order on the question has already been taken. The Prime Minister has the call.,92

71,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for Paterson is warned!,92
72,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"that the key uncertainty facing this company currently is the refusal of the New South Wales government to reach agreement over a long-term electricity supply contract. So, if the Leader of the Opposition is really concerned about these jobs as opposed to his mock political concern, then he may consider getting on the phone and speaking to his Liberal counterpart Premier O'Farrell about that matter. Beyond that, he should not come into this parliament and mislead this place or these workers about the reasons for these job losses.  withdraw that charge. If she wishes to do so, she could move it by substantive motion.",92

74,Ms ONEILL,Unknown, My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister advise the House on outcomes from the NATO-ISAF Chicago summit on Afghanistan?,92
75,Ms GILLARD,Unknown," I have just returned from the NATO-ISAF summit on Afghanistan. I was accompanied by the Minister for Defence. This was a pivotal summit for outlining the future strategy in Afghanistan, building on the transition strategy agreed in Lisbon around two years ago in 2010. We had the opportunity at this summit to be briefed by General Allen on progress in Afghanistan. His brief about that progress accords with what we hear from our Australian Defence Force, and that is that progress is being made and transition is on track as a strategy. The province in which we work, Oruzgan province, will commence its transition in coming months. That is expected to take 12 to 18 months, and at the end of the transition process the bulk of Australian forces will be able to return home. The work of transition is, of course, the work of training, but pressure needs to be maintained on the insurgents. Al-Qaeda has been hit hard, and the momentum of the insurgency has been stalled. At the same time it is appropriate and necessary that there be progress in governance, aid and development. Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries on earth, and Australia has been contributing to its aid and development. Work needs to be done as well on political reconciliation, which needs to be an Afghan led and Afghan owned process. Beyond the days of transition in Oruzgan province and before the end of 2014, when the NATO combat mission will cease, Australia will continue to be engaged in Afghanistan. We will particularly be engaged in training in the Afghan Artillery School and training army officers in a UK led training initiative. We will also be maintaining a role for special forces during that period to deal with counterterrorism work. Beyond 2014, the mission will change. The combat mission will be at an end. But there will be a need, as was discussed at the summit, for the international community to stay engaged with Afghanistan-to stay engaged in training, advice and assistance; to stay engaged in the provision of aid and development moneys. In Chicago I had the opportunity to sign a long-term partnership on those questions with President Karzai and, as I have made clear here and in Chicago, Australia has an open door to a continuing role for special forces, should that be necessary. The summit achieved its outcomes as set and established, and Australians can be assured that the transition strategy in Afghanistan is on track. (Time expired) NA",92
76,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," I would like to inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a delegation from each of the ASEAN member state parliaments. I trust their time in Australia will be very informative. On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to the members of the group. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Carbon Pricing",93
77,Mr HOCKEY,Unknown," My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister confirm that, based on the government's own figures, household expenditure will go up by $9.90 each week due to the carbon tax, yet the government will only provide $10.10 each week in compensation? Given that the government has not got a single predicted figure right in the last five years, does the Prime Minister seriously believe 20c a week is enough margin of error to cover all the unexpected costs of the world's biggest carbon tax?",93
78,Ms GILLARD,Unknown," I would have to say I am a little bit surprised by the shadow Treasurer's question, because the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer have been going around the nation saying that the cost-of-living increases from the carbon price will be 'astronomical'. And then the shadow Treasurer comes in today and actually backs in the figures about cost-ofliving increases-about a $9.90 increase rather than the wild and inaccurate figures that have been used in the Leader of the Opposition's fear campaign. So I thank the shadow Treasurer",93
79,Mr Hockey,Unknown,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am quoting the Prime Minister's own figures back to her, and asking her whether 20c a week is enough to cover all the other costs.",93
80,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. Points of order are not a time for debate.,93
81,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"I thank the shadow Treasurer for bringing to an end the Leader of the Opposition's cost-of-living scare campaign. The next time the Leader of the Opposition says the cost-of-living increases will be 'astronomical', we will remind him of this moment when the shadow Treasurer pulled the rug out from under him. To the shadow Treasurer: the figures that the government has worked on are the figures that have been modelled by Treasury. As electricity price regulators around the nation have made the determinations about the impact of carbon pricing on electricity prices, that modelling has been shown to be right-bang on the money. It has been right in Queensland and right in New South Wales-right in those places where electricity price regulators have actually and made a determination about the impact of carbon pricing. So the shadow Treasurer should know that the Treasury modelling done by the same people that the shadow Treasurer relied on when he was in government has been verified to date. The shadow Treasurer should also acknowledge that, for the lowest income Australian families, we have provided a buffer of more compensation. They will come out better off. That is something that the shadow Treasurer wants to rip away from them. He wants to make them worse off. Millions of Australian families will receive enough compensation for the flow-through impact of carbon pricing. The real risk cost-of-living pressures for these families actually arises from the shadow Treasurer and his $70-billion plan to rip away the services that Australians rely on, his plan take away their tax cuts, his plan to take away their pension increases, his plan to rip away their family payments, his plan to even rip away family payments not at all associated with carbon pricing, and his direct refusal to assist families with the cost of getting the kids to school.",93
82,Mr Hockey,Unknown,How is this related?,94
83,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The Prime Minister will return to the question before the chair.,94
84,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,That is the real set of cost-of-living pressures on Australian families flowing from the reckless policies of the Leader of the Opposition and his friends. (Time expired) Afghanistan,94
85,Mr MELHAM,Unknown," My question is to the Minister for Defence. What are the implications for Australia's sat commitment in Oruzgan province in Afghanistan as a result of the outcomes of the NATO-ISAF leaders summit held in Chicago? Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth-Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (14:12): I thank the member for Banks for his question. Over the weekend and on Monday I accompanied the Prime Minister at the NATO International Security Assistance Force summit in Chicago. In the course of those two days, I had the opportunity of exchanging views with a number of my counterparts, including Secretary of Defense for the United States, Leon Panetta; my United Kingdom colleague to the Philip Hammond; my Canadian colleague Peter MACKay; our New Zealand colleagues, foreign minister Murray MCCully, who was representing John Key, and also the defence to minister, Jonathan Coleman; and of course defence minister Wardak of Afghanistan. As the Prime Minister indicated, the agreement reached in Chicago on the future of Afghanistan and transition is very important. As the Prime Minister has said, we are on track for transition by the end of 2014. The agreement over the weekend also means that, by the middle of next year, by the middle of 2013, the so-called Lisbon milestone will have been met and all of Afghanistan will have commenced transition. The member for Banks asked me what implications this has for Oruzgan. Members might be aware that, shortly before the Chicago summit, President announced the third tranche of transition of provinces and districts in Afghanistan, and Oruzgan province as a whole was included in that tranche. Transition in Oruzgan we expect to occur over a 12to 18-month period, with the transition process to commence in the next couple of months. As to Australian forces, our Mentoring Task Force is making steady and good progress in training and mentoring the 4th Battalion of the Afghan National Army, and our advice continues to be that, in the course of the 12to 18-month period that the Prime Minister and I have referred to, Kandaks of the 4th Brigade as a whole will be able to take lead responsibility for security in Oruzgan province and be operationally viable. Later this month, our Mentoring Task Force 5 will travel to Afghanistan and take over from Mentoring Task Force 4. This will be the first of our task forces to be involved or engaged in the transition process. In Townsville on Saturday before our departure to Chicago, the Prime Minister and I had the opportunity of meeting with members of that task force and being briefed by the Chief of Army and by the commanding officer of Mentoring Task Force 5. Over the weekend, the Prime Minister and I made this important point: the conference was a very good success, but Afghanistan continues to be difficult and dangerous. It is difficult and dangerous for our troops deployed there and as we now commence this current, northern fighting season, I know that the thoughts of all members of the House will be with our forces in Oruzgan and Afghanistan. Carbon Pricing",94
86,Mr TRUSS,Unknown," My question is to the Karzai Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that her $23 a tonne carbon tax will result in a tax of $75,000 a tonne on refrigerant gas, and that this will cost a large meat works an extra $55,000 a year, and a supermarket $17,000 a year; and that the cost of servicing a home refrigerator will be an extra $300? Does the Prime Minister expect those extra costs to be passed on to consumers?",95
87,Ms GILLARD,Unknown," To the question by the Leader of the National Party, I would say that, as usual, what we are seeing is an attempt by the opposition to make wild claims and cause the fear in the Australian community. We have seen it consistently with the claims about astronomical increases in the cost of living. We have seen it consistently with the Leader of the Opposition saying the coal industry would close. We have seen it consistently with the Leader of the Opposition saying Whyalla would be wiped off the map. We have seen it as the Leader of the Opposition has used working people as if they were props in a drama or a play that he was directing-standing next to a steelworker whose job he was not prepared to vote to support, or standing next to a car worker whose job he was not prepared to support. We have seen all of these tricks from the opposition as part of their fear campaign. To the opposition I say this: on 1 July we will see the truth, and the reckless claims of the opposition will crash to the ground at that time. The Leader of the Opposition will then have to explain to the Australian people why he spent month after month after month after month making such wildly inaccurate claims about carbon pricing, whilst doing absolutely no work on the policies that would make a difference to the nation's future.",95
88,Mr Truss,Unknown,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The question is about refrigerant gas and the Prime Minister has not even approached the subject.",96
89,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I will ask the Prime Minister to be relevant to the question before the chair.,96
90,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"The point I was making was, like with the many other wild claims by the opposition, we will see the truth on the 1 July. Education Funding",96
91,Mr OAKESHOTT,Unknown," My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, can you confirm the $5 billion as recommended in the Gonski review is available if required, and that decisions over the coming three months in response to the Gonski review will put long-term national educational and standard-of-living outcomes above any short-term political strategy around the budget?",96
92,Mr Schultz,Unknown,"No, no and no!",96
93,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The member for Hume might be no, no and no in a minute too, if he is not careful. The Prime Minister has the call.",96
94,Ms GILLARD,Unknown," I thank the member for his question and I know that he has a keen interest in the Gonski review reforms. I understand from the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth that both he and the member for Lyne attended a forum at Port Macquarie High School on 3 May, and that there was a very good discussion amongst local community members there about the Gonski recommendations. To the member, can I say this about the way in which we are approaching the Gonski review: what David Gonski and his very eminent review team did was produce a comprehensive report about a new way of approaching school funding including a school resources standard, and loadings on top for things like educational disadvantage and for students with disabilities. They did produce a figure of $5 billion, that is true, but they themselves indicated in their report that that was working with older data, and they also indicated that there were some things that we needed to do for education which were very important reforms for which they did not have the tools to do any modelling. To take one example of that, they indicated that there is no common assessment, or definition, of students with disabilities and so, if-as the Gonski review recommends-we were to put a loading on taken top for students with disabilities, we currently have no national platform or data sets which would enable us to do that. A lot of work is now happening through very collaborative working groups between the federal government, state and territory governments, the Catholic education system and the independent schools. It is only when we see the outcome of that work that we can start to make a set of decisions about how the government will resource school funding. Of course, the government's objective is for the budget to be in surplus and we will hold to that, but we also believe people can judge us on our record about school education. We as a government have almost doubled the amount of money going into school education, because it was so shamefully neglected by the Howard government. Questions of educational disadvantage, for example, were not even considered or debated by the Howard government. We have acted to remedy that and, of course, we will take that set of Labor values into consideration in making the next decisions, following the work being done now on the Gonski review.",96
95,Mr OAKESHOTT,Unknown," Madam Deputy Speaker, I do have a supplementary question. In light of the answer, and to be as clear as possible for the House-and for the many in school uniform in the gallery-will the Prime Minister agree that responding to the Gonski review is the leading issue for the Commonwealth right now, is an issue that she as Prime Minister must lead on, and is the most important issue this 43rd Parliament will deal with?",97
96,Ms GILLARD,Unknown," The member would be aware that there is nothing dearer to my heart than making sure we have the best schools in this nation and that I am very concerned that, as a it? result of a decade of neglect by the Howard government, in international testing we are seeing ourselves starting to slip behind the standards of the world. Mr Simpkins interjecting",97
97,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for Cowan is warned.,97
98,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"But, as the member would also be aware, this government has a series of objectives that are important: bringing the budget to surplus, building the future economy, investing in Australian schools, continuing to invest in health care services and, of course, creating the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We will continue to make the difficult choices in the government's budget to help us reach those objectives while making sure that we bring the budget to surplus. None of this is easy, but if you are clearly guided by your values as to what is important then your set of priorities becomes clear. People know that this government's priorities are about supporting and creating jobs and creating the economy of the future which will bring us more prosperity whilst giving working families the services and support they need-and, of course, great quality schools for their kids to go to are pivotal to the services and support they need and pivotal to our nation's economic future.

99,Mr HUSIC,Unknown," My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation. What have recent price determinations across Australia shown about the projected impact of the carbon price on electricity prices? How does this reality compare with the commentary on electricity prices over the last year, and what is the government doing to assist households with",97
100,Mr COMBET,Unknown,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:24): I thank the member for Chifley for his question. When the government announced its Clean Energy Future package last July, we released comprehensive modelling by Treasury on the impacts of carbon pricing. That modelling showed very clearly that the carbon price would add about 10 per cent to electricity prices, which is around $3.30 a week per household on average-and, of course, the government is delivering assistance to the extent of an average of $10.10 per household per week. Price regulators in different jurisdictions are now confirming Treasury's modelling and showing a lesser impact in some states and territories than the modelling suggested. For example: in New South Wales, IPART, the independent price regulator, has issued a draft determination with a carbon price impact on the average household in New South Wales of $3.27 per week; Western Australia's regulator has found an impact around $2.45 week; in the Northern Territory it is around $2.48 a week; in Tasmania is around $3 a week. All these figures are under the Treasury-modelled cost impact. The government's household assistance package will provide, as I indicated, an average of $10.10 per week per household. It will do this through permanent tax cuts-by trebling the tax-free threshold, which also releases one million taxpayers from having to file a tax return. It will also deliver it through permanent increases in the pension and through payments to many self-funded retirees. It will also deliver it through permanent increases in family tax benefits and many other Commonwealth payments. This is contrary to much of the commentary that we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition. These are the facts: electricity prices bang-on or a bit less than the Treasury modelling as the regulators bring in their determinations and the government is providing comprehensive assistance to households-it will reach nine out of 10 households-yet for the last 12 months the Leader of the Opposition has run around making false claims designed to engender fear that the carbon price will increase electricity prices by 20 per cent, 25 per or 30 per cent. That is specifically what he has claimed-just last week, the Leader of the Opposition went on a hysterical rant claiming that the carbon price will certainly force up electricity prices by 20 per cent. But, now that the facts are coming in, what they will show is that the Leader of the Opposition is nothing but a shallow political con man.",97
101,Mr HUSIC,Unknown," Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. The minister in his response made reference to household assistance. What would that mean for local communities in my area and others across Western Sydney?",98
102,Mr COMBET,Unknown,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:27): I thank the member for Chifley once again. He represents the area where I grew up-Rooty Hill-and I am very proud, having grown up in Western Sydney, that the government is providing very strong assistance to households in Western Sydney. In the seat of Chifley 58,000 taxpayers will receive a tax cut, 19,000 families will receive an increase in payments-that is, family tax benefit payments-and 24,400 pensioners will receive an increase in the pension. In the seat of Parramatta, in Western Sydney, 55,000 taxpayers will receive a tax cut, 43,300 families will receive are family tax benefit increases and 22,100 pensioners will receive an increase in the pension. In the seat of Greenway, in Western Sydney, 55,000 taxpayers will get a tax cut, 13,500 families will receive an increase in family tax benefits and 17,000 pensioners will receive a pension increase. These are the facts: this is a Labor government, and we are introducing an extremely important environmental and cent economic reform in a socially equitable, socially fair manner that looks after the people of Western Sydney, and we are proud to do it. Carbon Pricing",98
103,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown, My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. How does the minister reconcile his statement in a press release that job losses at Kurri Kurri are 'unrelated to the carbon price' with the company's statement issued today which says 'long-term viability will be negatively affected by a number of factors including the carbon tax'? Will the minister please stop misleading this House and explain that contradiction?,98
104,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The last part of his question was out of order.,99
105,Mr COMBET,Unknown,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:29): Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker, because that was very selective quoting indeed by the Leader of the Opposition-something we have become completely accustomed to. As has been made clear by Hydro Aluminium over a considerable period of time, there are a number of factors that are influencing this decision and the financial losses that they are leaveincurring-essentially, the effects of growth in global supply in aluminium, the strong value of the Australian dollar over a period of time, the ongoing effects of the global financial crisis, and in fact nothing less than a 40 per cent depreciationMr Baldwin interjecting",99
106,Mr COMBET,Unknown,in the price of aluminium on the London Metals Exchange. I have met the company-it is in my region-discussed these issues and discussed the pressures on the company. I spoke to a company representative again today in relation to this issue who emphasised to me that the announcement today is not driven by the implications of the carbon price; it is driven by the current pressures leading to the current financial losses that the company is incurring. You should not misrepresent this. Mr Baldwin interjecting,99
107,Mr COMBET,Unknown,"The member for Paterson, before question time, took glee in the pressure that these workers and their families are experiencing. You should be ashamed-you should be ashamed of the position that you articulated, and the Leader of the Opposition should represent the facts.",99
108,Mr Baldwin,Unknown,You wouldn't know fact if it bit you on the backside!,99
109,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for Paterson will leave the chamber under 94(a). The member for Paterson then left the chamber,99
110,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The minister has the call and will return to the question before the chair.,99
111,Mr COMBET,Unknown,"I have concluded my answer, thank you.",99
112,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I seek A government member: It's Madam Deputy Speaker.",99
113,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,to table the statement of the company stating that the viability of this business has been impacted by the carbon tax.,99
114,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," Leave is not granted. I am not precious about what everybody calls me. It is a very difficult situation, so please do not correct someone if they get my title wrong, especially in the middle of question time. I think it is more appropriate we get on with question time. Economy",99
115,Ms PARKE,Unknown, My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on how strongly Australia's economy is performing on the global stage?,99
116,Ms GILLARD,Unknown," I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. I had the opportunity whilst in Chicago at the NATO/ISAF Summit to talk to a number of leaders about circumstances in the global economy and particularly current circumstances in the European economy. I had the opportunity to meet with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the Chancellor of Germany and the newly elected President of France. As members of the House would be aware, concern has been sparked yet again about circumstances in Europe arising from the inconclusive elections in Greece, and Greece is to go to another election. Indeed, that election will be resolved very shortly, before the forthcoming G20 meeting, and I anticipate that, just like the G8 meeting had a discussion about circumstances in the global economy, the G20 meeting will be very focused on the global economy and the circumstances of the eurozone. As Australians watch these reports on their TV screens, it is understandable that people would be concerned. Some of the footage, particularly from Greece, has been particularly startling, with people feeling economic pressures there. The Greek economy has undergone a very sizeable contraction, and circumstances for many of the people of Greece are very dire indeed, with unemployment at simply staggering levels. So it is understandable that Australians watching all of this would be concerned. The Australian economy is not immune from international events, but Australians can be reassured that the Australian economy is in a very different circumstance from economies like Greece , like many others in Europe and even like the United States that people see on their TV screens. The fundamentals of our economy are strong. We have a AAA rating from all three credit agencies for the first time in our nation's history, strong public finances, economic growth, low unemployment and inflation within the Reserve Bank Consequently, that means that Australians can look on the Australian economy with confidence. That does not mean that there are not some pressures in the Australian economy, particularly arising from the strength of the Australian dollar, with the pressures that puts on manufacturing, tourism and other sections of the economy. But Australians can be reassured about the fundamental strengths of our economy and they can also be reassured that this government will always put jobs first, the way we did during the global financial crisis. We will continue to do so. Member for Dobell",99
117,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown," My question is to the Prime Minister. What did the Prime Minister mean when she said, in relation to the member for Dobell, that she thought a line had been crossed?",100
118,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"Lalor-Prime Minister) the (14:35): I dealt with that on the day that I made the announcement about the member for Dobell. I dealt with it on the basis of my view about respect for the parliament. I made it clear then, as I make it clear now, that I do not believe it is appropriate for this parliament to be judge and jury about these matters. Economy",100
119,Mr GEORGANAS,Unknown," My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on the OECD Economic Outlook, released overnight, and what does this say about the government's economic management?",100
120,Mr SWAN,Unknown," I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question, because the OECD Economic Outlook, which was released overnight, puts Australia up in lights as the standout developed band. economy in the global economy. It shows Australia is the standout developed economy if you look at this report. The OECD basically says that the Australian economy is going to grow faster than any other major developed economy, not only this year but next year as well. We have heard nothing positive from the opposition about this today. The Leader of the Opposition has been out and talked about everything that could be negative but nothing that is positive for Australia. This report is a very positive report on the strength of the Australian economy. Our unemployment is low, we have very good public finances, we have a strong investment pipeline and we are growing substantially faster than most other developed OECD economies. We are beginning to see why the rest of the world is waking up to the pro-growth, pro-jobs approach of this government. You can see it written all the way through the OECD report. The correct decision that this government took to support demand, to support Australian employment, to support small business at the height of the global financial crisis is one of the reasons Australia is now so strong compared to other developed economies. If other developed economies had followed our course, they would be in far better shape today. We have a pro-growth, pro-jobs approach which supports all of our people. We know that the opposition at the height of the global financial crisis and the global recession opposed all of those measures which would have sent unemployment through the roof and seen the closure of tens of thousands of small businesses in this country. It is pleasing to see such a strong endorsement from the OECD and, in particular, such a strong endorsement from the OECD which supports coming back to surplus. This is what the OECD has to say: … restoring fiscal leeway while macroeconomic conditions are still favourable, and the terms trade high, is welcome. Too right it is welcome. This is the correct decision for Australia; to support employment, to support growth and to give maximum flexibility to the Reserve Bank to take decisions on interest rates should they decide to do so. It gives us the capacity to put new incentives in the tax system to support small business in terms of loss carryback and to put in place the instant asset write-off which is also going to support investment in small business. There will be 2.7 million businesses eligible to use the instant asset write-off. This is very important for future investment. We on this side of the House understand what must be done to manage our economy. We understand what has to be done to bring the budget back to surplus, unlike those opposite. (Time expired) Member for Dobell  Opposition Business) (14:39): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the statement of the member for Dobell, given on Monday. Does the member for Dobell's statement cause her to change her view that the member for Dobell has failed to meet the standards of conduct and behaviour that she would expect of a member of the Labor caucus? Mr Albanese interjecting",100
121,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, The question is in order and the Prime Minister has the call.,101
122,Ms GILLARD,Unknown," My judgment about the member for Dobell sitting in the Labor caucus has been made and is clear. I have publicly explained it. It was about respect for the parliament. I think as a matter of common sense people would understand that there is a difference between which party rooms members of this of parliament sit in and the question of being entitled to sit in this parliament itself. There is a difference in those things. Clearly sitting in this parliament itself, being here representing an electorate, is a different matter. Obviously there are exceptional circumstances in which someone can be excluded from voting, but people are entitled to vote on behalf of their constituency.",101
123,Mr Andrews,Unknown,What are they?,102
124,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"I am referring for example to the constitutional circumstances. I suggest if the member does not know them he ought to acquaint himself with those circumstances. I have been concerned throughout this matter about the presumption of innocence and prejudgment. I would refer the member for Sturt, who asked the question, to the words which I think are important: 'The irony is that the Leader of the Opposition thinks he should be judge and jury in these matters.' Those words were said by Premier O'Farrell in the New South Wales parliament. Of course, the opposition are full of hypocrisy, not consistency; nothing to do with standards, everything to do with their political interests. (Time expired)  Opposition Business) (14:41): Deputy Speaker, I have a supplementary question. I refer to the Prime Minister's answer in which she described issues to do with being judge and jury. If, as the Prime Minister has said, the parliament should be judge and jury, why won't the Prime Minister invite the member for Dobell back into the caucus?",102
125,Ms GILLARD,Unknown," I refer the member for Sturt to my statement at the time that I announced that the member for Dobell would not participate in Labor caucus and suggest he reads it. He will see when he reads that statement that I was not prejudging the matters being dealt with by Fair Work Australia. I explained my view about respect for the parliament. I continue to believe that it is inappropriate this parliament to prejudge matters which will ultimately be dealt with by the courts. I also note, in terms of the opposition's approach to these matters, that they have one standard when people are members of the Liberal Party or the National Party and a different standard for everyone else. How can they come into this place and claim any consistency, given the matters involving, for example, Senator Fisher from South Australia, now Senator Heffernan and the like? If you are in the Liberal Party everything is apparently okay. That is the standard of the publicity of this opposition. For me, I believe it is important that people have, if they are to be the subject of legal proceedings, their entitlements to their day in court and to put their defence as they choose to do so.  Opposition Business) (14:43): Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to ask a second supplementary question.",102
126,Mr Albanese,Unknown,A second supplementary? of The DEPUTY SPEAKER: The member Madam for Sturt is correct; the previous Speaker had allowed a second supplementary question on previous occasions. The member for Sturt has the call.  Speaker. My question is to the Prime Minister. In her previous answer she said that she was not prejudging the member for Dobell,102
127,Mr Albanese,Unknown,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order, my recollection is that the Leader of the Opposition asked a supplementary before and the Manager of Opposition Business did as well. Ms Julie Bishop: Get with the program!",102
128,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition may get with the for program outside the chamber very shortly if she does not desist from providing ongoing advice to the chair. The member for Sturt has the call.  previous answer she referred to how she was not prejudging the member for Dobell and, therefore, I ask her how it is that the member for Dobell is not fit to sit in the caucus but is fit to sit with the Labor Party in all votes of this House?",102
129,Mr Albanese,Unknown,"Madam Deputy Speaker, a point of order: this is exactly the same as the previous questions that have been asked by the Manager of Opposition Business and it has been fully answered.",103
130,Ms GILLARD,Unknown," I refer the member to my other two answers-that is the explanation; and, on the continuing campaign by the opposition and its hypocrisy, I note that the shadow Treasurer stated for the opposition that they would cheerfully accept the member for Dobell's vote so I do not see the point of this questioning. NA Member for Dobell",103
131,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown," I seek leave to move a motion calling on the Prime Minister to speak immediately for up to 15 minutes to explain the following, amongst other things: whether the Prime Minister has confidence in the Fair Work Australia findings or in the statement given to this House by the member for Dobell, given that they cannot both be right. I seek leave to move that motion now. Leave not granted.",103
132,Mr Albanese,Unknown,"Madam Deputy Speaker, a point of order: given that this matter has now been referred to the Privileges Committee, is it appropriate for the Leader of the Opposition to move a suspension of standing orders-which he does, predictably, every single dayAn opposition member: Why don't you take one?",103
133,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,I have said no to leave-he does it every day. Is it in order for a suspension to be moved?,103
134,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," Having predicted that this may occur today, I refer to page 540 of the House of Representatives Practice: Questions must not refer to proceedings of a committee not reported to the House. However, no exception has been taken to questions merely coinciding in subject matter with current committee inquiries. The following private ruling of President Cormack has equal relevance to the House ... In respect to this issue, questions must not refer to proceedings not reported to the House; however, questions merely coinciding can be debated in the chamber. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",103
135,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown," I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving immediately-That this House calls on the Prime Minister to speak immediately for up to 15 minutes to explain the following: (1) what the Prime Minister meant when she said that a ""line had been crossed"" after months of expressing full confidence in the Member for Dobell; (2) what the Prime Minister meant when she said she was ""disgusted"" by an unnamed MP who had worked for an unnamed union; (3) what the Prime Minister means when she says that the Member for Dobell is entitled to a presumption of innocence even though she's excluded him from the Caucus; and (4) whether the Prime Minister has confidence in the Fair Work Australia findings or in the statement to this Parliament by the Member for Dobell given that they can't both be right. A Labor member of parliament has been found to have misused $500,000 of union members' money",103
136,Mr Albanese,Unknown,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I refer to my previous point of order and seek clarification of your ruling because it is not quite clear to me what that means now that the Leader of the Opposition has actually moved a suspension. Because the government has not been provided with the words that are in that motion to suspend, it is hard for us to make a determination on it.",104
137,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I have not sought to make a ruling. I have gone to the only reference I can find in House of Representatives Practice to the issue and I will advise the Leader of the Opposition not to go too directly to the matters that are currently before the Privileges Committee.,104
138,Mr Albanese,Unknown,"On that basis, Madam Deputy Speaker, in order to get a ruling from you, I raise a point of order: that this resolution is out of order given that this matter is now being considered by the Privileges Committee. It is not in order for us now to debate the substance of issues that are before the Privileges Committee.",104
139,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," everyone's slight indulgence I am now going to talk to the clerk. The clock will stop in this instance. Again I am loath to make a ruling with respect to the issue, and the difficulty before the chair is that there is absolutely no precedent in House of Representatives Practice that I can refer to. But this is a suspension of standing orders and I ask you to deal with the suspension of standing orders and not to traverse the issues that are before the Privileges Committee.",104
140,Mr Albanese,Unknown,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on this issue-the Manager of Opposition Business, when he was asked today why he withdrew a motion from the Notice Paper, indicated in a press conference that that motion was superfluous given that the Privileges Committee was set to look at the matter. An opposition member: This is ridiculous!",104
141,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"This is not ridiculous. It is a very serious matter, and I think everybody in this parliament should treat it with the due respect it deserves.  point of order: it is a very important matter, and I will simply read from House of Representatives Practice: Questions must not refer to proceedings of a committee not reported to the House. However, no exception has been taken",104

We are not dealing with a question. We are dealing with a substantive motion. The substantive motion must be dealt with, and I caution the Leader of the Opposition not to traverse the matters before the Privileges Committee.",104
147,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"Madam Deputy Speaker, as you would expect I am speaking to my motion to suspend standing orders. Standing orders ought to be suspended because the most important business before this House right now ought to be getting a prime ministerial explanation. Who does she believe?

149,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The Leader of the Opposition has the call and will go to the suspension before the chair.,105
150,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"Indeed, and one of the reasons standing orders should be suspended is that it is obvious from the conduct of the Leader of the House that this government is still determined to run a protection racket the member for Dobell.

155,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The Leader of the Opposition has withdrawn and he will continue on the substantive motion before the chair.,105

The Manager of Opposition Business has just given it up because he says it does not matter. It does.  point of order: this is a very important for matter, and I will tell you why. The advice the House has received from the Clerk through me as Manager of Opposition Business is that by referring this matter to the Privileges Committee there was no basis The for restricting debate in the House, and the only matter that could not be traversed was the proceedings of the Privileges Committee itself. This is the subject we are debating; the member for Dobell's veracity, not the proceedings of the Privileges Committee.",105

169,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown," Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a question for you. Given that the tactics employed by the government are shutting down debate on the statement by the member of Dobell, will you undertake to stop the clock when points of order are taken and gag motions are moved, trying to facilitate proper debate in this House and to allow democracy in this parliament to work?",108
170,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," Order! Whilst I think the answer will be no, I will refer the actual question to the Speaker as it is not within my authority to take questions on administration in the chair at this point of time. NA",108
171,Mr WILKIE,Unknown," Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",108
172,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,108
173,Mr WILKIE,Unknown,"Yes, Madam Deputy Speaker.",108
174,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Please proceed.,108
175,Mr WILKIE,Unknown,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I have been misrepresented most grievously. Yesterday in the Tasmanian House of Assembly, the Greens health spokesperson asked Premier Lara Giddings to detail how much of the $340 million I secured for the Royal Hobart Hospital would be deducted from Tasmania's future GST allocation. The Premier is reported as saying $88 million will be clawed back each year for three years, which would amount to a total of $264 million. This figure is a fantasy, apparently concocted by the Tasmanian Labor government to shift blame to me for the dreadful state of the Tasmanian budget, a fantasy perpetuated by the Greens who do not want the hospital to be rebuilt and are prepared to play political games with public health policy.",108
176,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for Denison must go to where he has been misrepresented.,109
177,Mr WILKIE,Unknown,"Madam Deputy Speaker, the fact is that the Commonwealth Grants Commission, not the Premier of Tasmania, is the authority on this matter and in its report this year the commission identified a GST clawback of $59 million. Future figures are unknown although the federal Treasury advises most of the $340 million will be new money.",109
178,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for Denison is now debating the issue.,109
179,Mr WILKIE,Unknown,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. NA Parliament",109
180,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown," I have another question to you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Does the referral of the budget to a committee of this House mean that the parliament cannot debate the budget in this chamber?",109
181,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," I can answer that question and the answer is no. Just to clarify, the reason I am not seeking to make a ruling is that I am not the Speaker. Questions in Writing",109
182,Mr MORRISON,Unknown," In accordance with standing order 105Breplies to unanswered written questions that have been on the Notice Paper for more than 60 days-I ask that you write to the following ministers seeking reasons for the delay in answering questions in writing: to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship about question Nos 872, 887, 888 and 889; to the Minister for Home Affairs and Justice about question Nos 939, 940, 941, 942, 943, 944, 945, 946, 947, 948, 949, 956 and 954; to the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband Communications and the Digital Economy about question Nos 958, 950, 951, 952, 953; and to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport about question No. 955.",109
183,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," I am so impressed that the member for Cook has been so busy. Parliament  Opposition Business) (15:25): Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a question to you. It goes to the answer you gave to the Leader of the Opposition. It is about the question of who can or cannot make rulings in this place.",109
184,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," The Manager of Opposition is right. Anyone in the chair can make a ruling, but given the circumstances of what was happening I was loath to make one as I am not the Speaker. Given the debate that was happening, it would normally be the Speaker who was the occupier of the chair. Any person in the chair has the right and the authority to make a ruling. I just think, given the circumstances I find myself in, I was loath to do it. But I did not rule out of order the question that the opposition put before the chair. Parliament  Opposition Business) (15:26): Madam Deputy Speaker, can I ask a question to clarify? Mr Albanese interjecting interference!",109
185,Mr Albanese,Unknown,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the Speaker of the House of Representatives has made it clear and has enforced that questions such as that will not be asked after question time. That is the view that he has put before this chamber so as to avoid this tit for tat, so we do not have questions I could ask such as: is the budget before the Privileges Committee? That is just as absurd as the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition.",109
186,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," Manager of Opposition Business has an administrative question.  question is: if you are loath to make a ruling and the opposition disagrees with the position you have taken, how can we move dissent in your ruling?",110
187,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I am not obliged to give advisory rulings. There is no obligation for the chair to do it. Parliament House: Security,110
188,Mr SCHULTZ,Unknown," Madam Deputy Speaker, before I ask my question can I compliment the Presiding Officers for the wonderful way in which they have made this place more secure with the new gates that have been operating in the car park for some time now. Having said that, I ask you, as the Acting Speaker, to ask the Speaker whether he can investigate to see how many, if any, staff members are using the members' car park. I have noticed a number of strange people-and I mean strange people-using the car park from time to time.",110
189,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I can reliably inform the member for Hume that numerous people have raised this issue and that I think it is being investigated. Parliamentary Behaviour,110
190,Mr SECKER,Unknown," Madam Deputy Speaker, would it be possible for you or the Speaker. I am not sure which under the present situation-to investigate the possible disorderly behaviour of the member for Eden-Monaro standing in front of the camera when the Leader of the Opposition was at the dispatch box.",110
191,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I can reliably inform the member for Barker that the two screens on the desk have the vision of what goes out at all times. So at all times I can see The if someone is walking in front of the cameras and can recognise whether someone is blocking them. I will refer the question to the Speaker but I can reliably inform the House that I have not seen the vision being cut during this time. That is one of the reasons the cameras have been here. Going back to the Manager of Opposition Business, he has the authority to rule dissent in the chair at any time. NA Presentation",110

193,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, I have received advice from the Chief Opposition Whip that he has nominated Mr Ruddock to be a member of the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests in place of Mr Alexander.,110
194,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:30): I ask leave of the House to move a motion for the appointment of a member to serve on the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests. Leave granted.,111
195,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"I move: That Mr Alexander be discharged from the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests and that, in his place, Mr Ruddock be appointed member of the committee.

196,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown, by leave-I move: That the Parliamentary Counsel and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 be referred to the Federation Chamber for further consideration. Question agreed to. NA NA Government Spending,111
197,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for North Sydney proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The urgent need for the Government to rein in spending in the face of events unfolding in Europe. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",111
198,Mr HOCKEY,Unknown," Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker, and thank you for allowing us to debate this issue, because this is a very important issue which does go to the heart of good governance. You would have thought that other issues such as the debt ceiling a should be properly debated in this place, but the government has closed down that debate just as it has chosen to close down any debate about the member for Dobell's oneBILLS hour, uninterrupted statement to the House. When it comes to an issue such as the government's need to rein in spending there is a simple fact that Australians need to remind themselves of each day. The Labor Party has accumulated the four largest budget deficits in Australian history, totalling $174 billion. At the same time, the Labor Party is today spending $100 billion a year more than the last year of the coalition government just 4½ years ago. One of the reasons why this is a significant number is because it was at that time that the now Treasurer, the member for Lilley, said: If the government pretend that interest rates are low then they do not have to admit that it is their policies that are putting pressure on the rates. What is putting pressure on the rates? What is partially responsible for this? It is the big spending, high taxing government. He went on to accuse the then Treasurer, the member for Higgins, Peter Costello. He said: ... the member for Higgins, a man acutely embarrassed by his record of taking the proceeds of the mining boomGet a load of that! Acutely embarrassed about his record! spending like a drunken sailor and building nothing that lasts for the Australian people. I will tell you what we built. We built a surplus of $20 billion a year. We built a Future Fund, with $70 billion in it. We built a government that was $100 billion a year smaller in expenditure than what Labor is today. We built in an economy that had an unemployment rate with a four in front of it on a permanent basis. We built an economy with strong economic growth. We built an economy that was resilient and was able to withstand the worse of the Asian financial crisis. But when it comes to this government, which picks and chooses its measurements, I would say to you that it is the government's own spending that continues to put pressure on the economy and put pressure on the budget, because, when you set the benchmark of expenditure, you would say to yourself that what the now Treasurer, the member for Lilley, said at the time was 'a big spending government'-$100 billion a year less in expenditure; it represented, at that time, 23.1 per cent of GDP. In 2008-09, the government jumped it to 25.2, then 26 per cent, then 24.7 and then 25.1 per cent. Next year, miraculously, somehow it is going to drop to 23.5-and that is because of the money shuffle that we all know about-and then 23.7, 23.5 and 23.6 per cent. The net outcome of that is that, in no year of all the time of Labor in government, nor in the years that it promises to deliver a future budget, will it ever reach the low levels of expenditure of the last year of the Howard government, which they said was 'a big spending government'-a big spending government that was $100 billion a year smaller in expenditure that this current government. But we know why Labor should not be trusted with money, and it comes back to waste. There is a conga line of example of initiatives, from $900 cheques going to dead people and people living overseas, to pink batts going into homes and causing the homes to be burnt down, to the massively overpriced Building the Education Revolution school halls program, particularly in New South Wales. Even today we hear of new initiatives. This week we found out in Senate estimates that Senator Conroy spent $526,000 on selecting 11 ABC and SBS directors. He spent $50,000 on each directorship, on finding a director. And, in that situation, he appointed a very respectable but long standing Labor icon, Jim Spigelman, as the chairman. So he spent $50,000 going through the parade of trying to identify directors. And then they appointed someone that they were extremely familiar with. On 14 May, Labor allocated $36 million more for carbon tax advertising-and it does not mention the carbon tax. Surely you don't need to be John Singleton to work out that if you are going to spend $36 million on an advertising program you should mention what the product is. That is kind of obvious, isn't it? We do not have to go to the 'Where do you get it?' as-do you remember those as in the 70s? 'Where do you get it?' Where do you get the carbon tax? From the Labor Party. Where do get the carbon tax? From Julia Gillard. Where do you get the carbon tax? You get the carbon tax in your bills. That is a pretty simple ad, and you just got it for free. You didn't have to spend $36 million. But I tell you what-what a great use of taxpayers' money: $36 million to tell people that they are advertising a carbon tax and the ad does not even mention the tax itself! But wait-there's more! The Gillard government is spending $20 million promoting the National Broadband Network, which is a now-$50-billion program that the government thinks people should know about. So, just in case you have not noticed the excavator out the front of your house, they are going to take out as on your TV to tell you that you should be signing up to the National Broadband Network. But there is, of course, more. The one that most Australians would be most angry about is the blow-out of $1.7 billion for Australian taxpayers in the costs of managing the asylum seekers arriving on illegal boats$1.7 billion. This is the latest blow-out. It includes a blow-out of $424 million on this year's figures and it will add a debt cost to taxpayers of an extra $1.1 million a day. So, for so long as you can see, taxpayers are going to have to pay $1.1 million a day just on the interest for the debt that has accumulated because the Labor Party does not know how to control the borders. But, of all the examples they continue to roll out, the ones that are most on people's minds are the ones where better management could deliver a better outcome. Take Labor's digital set top boxes installation programan average of $350 per installation per box. Harvey Norman is offering them for $168, and Gerry Harvey would discount that too; he might give you five years interest free on that as well-might toss that in. The Australian reports now that the average installation cost of the set top boxes has risen to $700 a unit. You could buy the whole TV-you could probably get 52 inches for $700, couldn't you? The Australia Network tender-what a great tender that was! Labor's bungling of the Australia Network tender has cost at least $2 million. It was recommend to the government that Sky News should receive approval to continue with the Australia Network, and then there was an internal struggle-remember that?-between the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and the minister for communications, and they were swapping responsibility departments. The net result was that compensation is now being paid to Sky News for winning the tender but not getting it. And of course there are others. The Australian Research Council is spending millions of dollars on questionable research projects, such as on climate change emotion. I will tell you, there is plenty of emotion in here about that. Here is another one: ancient economic life in Italy. Well, we are watching what is happening overseas quite carefully, and I think contemporary Italy is more interesting than ancient Rome. Other projects include: $578,792 to the University of Western Australia for a study of 'an ignored credit instrument in Florentine economic, social and religious life from 1570 to 1790'Mr Tony Smith: It's the missing piece!",111
199,Mr HOCKEY,Unknown,"That is! How did Niall Ferguson miss that one? There was $197,302 for 'sending and responding to messages about climate change: the role of emotion and morality', and $314,000 for a study to determine if birds are shrinking. Just ring up Inghams! Find out about their chickens. They are getting bigger and bigger. In fact, I remember the late Bing Lee saying to me that the birds at Inghams are getting too large for his freezers when he was selling the freezers at Christmas; the turkeys were too large. And they are spending $314,000 on identifying it. Hang on-there was $145,000 for a study of sleeping snails, to determine 'factors that aid life extension'! There was $210,000 to study the early history of the moon. You can imagine Tim staring out longingly from the window at the Lodge at the moon and thinking, 'You know what, Julie? We should have a good look at that. Why don't we spend $210,000 to work out what happened before Neil Armstrong got between there?'-as if no-one has ever thought about it for years. If it were not taxpayers' money it would be laughable. If they were not the hardearned dollars of so many good, diligent, committed Australians, it would be laughable. But, unfortunately, the Treasurer keeps saying: 'We're doing well; we're living within our means. Let's compare ourselves to some other countries.' Australia's general government expenditure in 2012 was 36.3 per cent of GDP. Let us compare. Switzerland was less: 34.7 per cent of GDP. New Zealand was less: 33 per cent of GDP. Hong Kong, 21.1 per cent; Korea, 21.6 per cent; Singapore, just 17.4per cent. The Treasurer is always keen to compare us to the worse. He is always keen to compare us to the nations that are in deep trouble, as if being ahead of those nations is somehow a great achievement, as if being ahead of those nations somehow lays down the foundations for future growth. But our competition is coming from our region and the Labor Party just does not get it. They mouth the words about it being the Asian century, but they do not understand that the competition for our children, and our grandchildren and beyond, is going to be in our region, in our sphere of influence. They are the people who are highly competitive. We must benchmark our nation against the best, and not the worse. That is what we must do. We must aspire to run faster than anyone else, to do better than anyone else, put in greater effort and to be more productive and more innovative than anyone else. That is the great legacy we can leave our children, not money being spent on reviews into snails, birds drinking or the history of the moon. We need to spend money on our people-our greatest investment-to give them the opportunity to hope for a better life without the dead hand of a Labor government being laid upon their back at every moment. The great legacy of this Labor Party, apart from incompetent and, dare I say it, corrupt government, is the debt it is leaving Australians. That is the pain it is leaving the next generation of Australians.  on a point of order: it is offensive to suggest that this government is corrupt and I ask that the member for North Sydney withdraw.",113
200,Mr HOCKEY,Unknown,"I withdraw. In that case I say to the honourable member: stop running a protection racket for the member for Dobell. Let the parliament debate the issues that go to the integrity of the parliament and let the nation get on with the job of building a better future for our children based on hope, reward and opportunity for effort.",114
201,Mr BRADBURY,Unknown,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (15:47): I am very pleased to be able to contribute to this debate on a matter of public importance relating to the economy and to add just a few facts to the debate-a few facts that were missing from the contribution from the member for North Sydney. Members will note that at no stage during the member for North Sydney's contribution did we hear anything about the OECD economic outlook that was released overnight. It is an important document that provides a snapshot of where the various economies across the globe are placed at this point in time. It is an important document to because it gave a very big tick to the economic management of the Australian economy. In fact, that document reported: Restoring fiscal leeway while macroeconomic conditions are still favourable, and the terms of trade high, is welcome. It gave a big tick to our return-to-surplus strategy and it noted the fact that the Australian economy is the standout performer of all OECD economies. In terms of growth, the Australian economy will grow faster than any of the other advanced economies over the coming two years. In addition to that we have returned our budget to surplus. This is no trivial matter considering what is going on across the globe at the moment. It is worth reflecting on this point. If we have a look at the budget position here in Australia compared to other nations, what we see is that in 2011-12 in Australia we will be delivering a $1.5 billion surplus. That is 0.1 per cent of GDP-a surplus. Let us look at other economies in the OECD. Let us look at the United States. They will still be running deficits; their deficit will be 8.1 per cent of their GDP. The United Kingdom will be running a deficit at eight per cent of their GDP. Japan will be at 10 per cent of their GDP and Canada, another country that is resource rich, will still be in deficit to the tune of about 3.7 cent of GDP.",114
202,Mr Buchholz,Unknown,What about Brazil and Norway?,115
203,Mr BRADBURY,Unknown,"Well, you come in here and quote Brazil and Norway. The reality is that if you compare Australia to comparable economies we are the standout performer. We are growing at a rate that demonstrates that this economy today is seven per cent larger than it was pre-GFC. That is a very significant point to make. It is well worth having a look at what has been happening in other parts of the world. We have been growing 7.3 per cent today on that base pre-GFC. By mid-2014 we would have grown by about 16 per cent on that preGFC level. Look around the world: most of the advanced economies have not even returned their growth levels to the levels that they were at before the GFC. We are seven per cent larger. All of these indicators point to the underlying strength of the Australian economy, but the point that has been bought forward, the question for this MPI, goes to the issue of fiscal restraint and reining in government spending. I think it is important that we make a few points and point out a few facts about government spending under this government compared to government spending under previous governments. With regard to government spending as a percentage of GDP-the member for North Sydney comes in here and plucks out figures. He hits us with a volume figure and he does that to mislead the House. I think even the member for North Sydney realises that in a growing economy, if you maintain spending at the same percentage of the economy, then as the economy grows, overall levels of spending will increase.",115
204,Mr Burke,Unknown,"No, he would not understand that.",115
205,Mr BRADBURY,Unknown,"The minister points per out that perhaps that is too complex. It has troubled the member for North Sydney to come to an appreciation of that. The real figure that we need to look at is expenditure as a percentage of the economy, as a percentage of GDP. In 2012-13, spending as a percentage of GDP will be 23.5 per cent. Across the forward estimates, we will be containing expenditure to below 24 per cent of GDP. That represents the longest sustained period of maintaining expenditure below 24 per cent of GDP at any time since the early 1980s. Compare the record of the HowardCostello government with what we are doing now and what we are proposing to do for the coming four years. They were big spenders. They spent a lot more as a percentage of the economy than what we are doing. Perhaps the best indication of how tight a fiscal operation this government is running is that the opposition has not been able to propose a single savings measure. The Leader of the Opposition came in for his budget in reply speech-not a single savings measure. The shadow Treasurer went to the National Press Club-not a single savings measure. If the government was as bloated as these people would have you believe-if there was so much fat to cut-surely they could come forward with a single measure. Instead of coming forward with spending cuts, all they tell the Australian people is that they will take away some of those revenue sources. It is worth also having a look at the other side of the budgetary equation. It is one thing to look at what you are spending. We have already established that. Look at what we are spending as a percentage of the economy. We are spending less today than at any time through that previous government. Over a sustained period we have not been able to contain expenditure growth to the extent that we are doing now, not since the early 1980s. If you have a look at what is happening on the tax front, we are collecting tax at a lower percentage of GDP today than at any time under the previous government. Tax is 22.1 per cent of GDP. The amount of tax we are collecting is less today than at any time under the previous Howard-Costello governments. That is a fact you do not often hear, but it is a fact. They say that they want to repeal certain revenue sources such as the mining tax. When we first proposed a mining tax they said, 'We're opposed to the mining tax so we're opposed to every single one of the expenditure measures connected to it.' That is what they said. They came in here and they said to the 2.7 million small businesses in Australia, 'You don't deserve a tax cut. We'll vote against a tax cut for you.' instance. And they did vote against tax relief for the 2.7 million small businesses in this country. Fancy that-a Liberal opposition. Menzies would roll in his grave. The party of business-that is what they would like to pretend. They came into this place and they said to 2.7 million small businesses around Australia, 'We're not going to give you tax relief. We'll vote against it.' And they did. When it came to a company tax cut, they said, 'We're against that as well.' They said back then that they were against the expenditure measures that were connected to the mining tax. We went into the budget and said, 'There's no point persisting with this company tax cut until we can secure a consensus in the parliament. We'll work through the business tax working group to deliver a cut to the company tax rate, but we won't keep pushing this one if we can't get the support in the parliament. If the Liberal Party want to stand side by side with the Greens and deny businesses a tax cut then we'll find a better way to spread the benefits of the mining boom.' So we have. We continue to invest in superannuation. I am not sure what the latest is on that side. They came out and said they would support retaining the increases in superannuation, but they have been a bit quiet on that recently. They are still opposed to investing in infrastructure, presumably, even though that money will be spent. On investing in small business tax relief, they came into the parliament and voted against the instant asset write-off. Yet small businesses all around the country will be lining up to take advantage of it from 1 July. When we announced that we would spread the benefits of the mining boom to families right across this country through an increase in family tax benefit part A and a supplementary allowance, they came forward and said they would support it. At least, that is what they said in the first We heard so much about this principled position that they could not support cuts to the company tax rate or the instant asset write-off because they did not support the tax that funded it. Now, all of a sudden, they support the expenditure but do not support the tax. So how are they going to pay for it? They have a $70 billion black hole and it just keeps getting bigger. The announcement you could remotely describe as having any substance in the Leader of the Opposition's budget in reply speech was a spending measure. He did not have a price tag but it was a spending measure. The $70 billion crater-he is out there with his shovel digging it-is getting bigger and bigger. The capacity to dig craters of this nature could only add to our efforts as far as fielding the mining boom and extracting more resources in parts of this country. This is a government that is low taxing22.1 per cent of GDP-lower than at any time under the previous government. This is a government that, when it comes to expenditure as a percentage of GDP, will be containing expenditure over a sustained period at lower levels than in the early 1980s. On both fronts we are lower taxing and lower spending than the previous government. The member for North Sydney came in here today and had the hide to start lecturing this government about expenditure and where expenditure cuts should be made. If it is that easy a job he should be able to come forward and announce one or two expenditure items that he thinks need to be made. Have a look at what this government has already done. We have already achieved, in this budget alone, $33.6 billion worth of savings measures. That adds to the savings measures we achieved previously. We have made $100 billion worth of savings measures over the last four years. If you think you can still find additional savings measures, come forward and identify them. You hear those on the other side talk about the precarious nature of the Australian economy. What a load of rubbish! We understand that there are challenges in various parts of this economy, but look at the underlying fundamentals of the economy. We have low unemployment, at 4.9 per cent. We have contained inflation. only We have growth at levels that the rest of the advanced world could only dream of and a record pipeline of investment. We have a strong economy. But we want to spread the benefits of the boom and that is why we have announced a range of measurements in the budget that will ensure the benefits of the boom are being spread. Those opposite want to come in here and lecture people about debt. Our net debt is to peak in 2011-12 at 9.6 per cent of our GDP. They talk about us overburdening the country with debt.",115

208,Mr BRADBURY,Unknown,"The member for Goldstein says that they wasted money. I will tell you what: if it were left up to him, hundreds of thousands of Australians would have been out of a job. We would have gone into recession. Instead, we were one of the only advanced economies in the world to avoid recession. There is no excuse for these people-no excuse for the member for Goldstein. At least the Leader of the Opposition's excuse was that he slept through the debate on the response to the global financial crisis. He did not come in here. At least he can say, 'I didn't vote against the government's package to stimulate the economy.' He can say that. He can put his hand on his heart and say, 'I didn't vote against the stimulus package,' because he did not. He was asleep in his office and did not come in on the most important debate that this parliament has dealt with for half a century. Mr Christensen interjecting",117

210,Mr BRADBURY,Unknown,"This was the most important economic debate that we have dealt with and he was not even here to vote for it because he fell asleep. He slept through it! Whilst the Leader of the Opposition might have slept through the global financial crisis, the rest of the world has not. And we acted to support hundreds of thousands of jobs. Since 2007 we have created three-quarters of a million jobs in this country post GFC. When the GFC hit, 27 million jobs were shed around the world. These are the facts of our government's economic management. We have managed the economy so that it is a strong economy, but now we want to spread the benefits of the boom. We are the only advanced economy that has handed down a budget surplus. All the others are miles back in deficit. We are returning to surplus, and these people, who were high up when it came to spending and higher when it came to taxing, want to come here and lecture us. Australia is a standout performer of all world economies and you should stand up and be proud of that rather than criticise. (Time expired)",118
211,Mr ROBB,Unknown," We have just heard it again. We had this same problem a few days ago. You have to give it to the member for Lindsay, he is the master of spin. He did not refer for one second to the subject of the debate, which is the urgent need for the government to rein in spending in the face of events unfolding in Europe. Former Reserve Bank board member and noted Australian economist Warwick MCKibbin recently declared that the government has put the economy in the eye of a perfect storm.",118

214,Unknown,Unknown,Government members interjecting,118
215,Mr ROBB,Unknown,"They are all having a chuckle on the other side about the fact that this government has put the economy in the eye of a perfect storm. Well, laugh on! This is not a game. No wonder we have a view in the community that this government is such a dysfunctional mob and unable to manage money. That is the view, and you know it. You must be getting it. We are getting it in spadefuls everywhere we go. Professor MCKibbin said: The federal government has bet that a crisis in Europe will not happen during the 2012-13 financial year. Furthermore, David Uren, the respected economics editor of the Australian, observed today: There is no effort to place Australia's prospects into the context of a global malaise that shows no sign of lifting. That is what concerns me about the member for Lindsay; he shows no awareness that there is a global malaise that shows no sign of lifting. Mr Uren went on: Its continuing hold has been seen across the past 10 days, with signs of rapid slowdown in China, renewed crisis in Europe and speculation that the US Federal Reserve will again start printing money to buy its own government's bonds. These observations are confirmed by the views and the confidence levels of Australian business people. If everything that the member for Lindsay said were true-if this economy is going gang busters, if we are better placed than the rest of the world, if households should not be worried about where the next dollar for their mortgage is going to come from or whether there is any threat to their jobs-then you would expect that the confidence levels of the 2.4 million small business people and the hundreds of thousands of bigger businesses across this country would be at some reasonable level. Let us have a look. In March 2010 the NAB business confidence level was measured at 17. In March 2011, last year, it was at 11. In March 2012, just a month or so ago, it was at minus one. There has been a significantMs Rowland interjecting",118
216,Mr ROBB,Unknown,"Members opposite are saying we are talking down the economy. This is facing the facts. This was the subject of the debate. Are you going to get your head out of the sand and look at the dangers that are coming down the line, or which could come down the line? Are you going to restore the resilience that you inherited when you won government? Are you going to restore us to no debt? Are you going to restore the $70 billion of assets? Are you going to restore the confidence of the business sector and households back to what it was? No! Minus one is the reality. You cannot wish it away; is the reality. It has gone down from 17, to 11 and then to minus one. Business people, who make the investments and who take the risks, are the ones who have no confidence. They are not spending any of the money sitting on balance sheets-and there is a lot of money around. They are not investing it. There is a crisis of confidence across the business sector and, outside the resources sector, they are not investing at all. Within the resources sector, we are now seeing again over the last week Access Economics warning that $260 billion of projects being actively considered and at an advanced planning stage may be deferred. That is a quarter of a trillion dollars worth of projects on which the Treasurer stood up here today and proudly declared, 'Job done.' They are not even finalised in terms of investment decisions, and Access Economics assess that these projects may well be deferred. In fact, I went to Perth a couple of weeks ago to talk to a number of senior people within the mining industry. I spent several years working in the mining industry. I got to Perth, and half the people that I went to have a chat with to see what was happening were not there. They were in Africa. All I could hear in Perth was that there are now some 300 Australian mining companies who are actively seeking opportunities in Africa. It is not just Australian mining companies; it is investment dollars. Investment funds by the billions that were coming here out of the United States and other countries are now heading to Africa. Why is that so? What do they say to me when they give me a reason for starting to write down the prospects of mining here in Australia? They say 'sovereign risk'. That is what they say. They say 'the carbon tax' and 'the mining tax'. Again, there is the very smart decision in the budget to double the withholding tax, it which the government had very properly reduced to 7½ per cent, one of the very few measures in the last four or five years that you could commend the government for and that gave any sense to the business community that you knew their circumstances. You have turned around and doubled it, and not only that: you have made it retrospective. So the billions of dollars that were attracted because of that 7½ per cent withholding tax are now going to be thwarted. You will see this dry up. You have sacrificed billions of dollars of potential investment for the sake of $260 million over the next three or four years to try to convey that you have balanced your books, when in fact you have lost billions of dollars of investment on behalf of the Australian community. They talk about the reregulation of the workforce and many more things. All of these things add up to sovereign risk. It is why the business sector are so down in the mouth about their prospects under this government. It is why they endlessly say, 'Can't you bring on an election? For goodness sake bring on an election.' This country is stopping in its tracks because of the uncertainty of this government. It is not only all of these policy decisions; it is the way in which you conduct business between yourselves. It is the way in which you protect, cover and spend weeks of time and distraction over a member who really has disgraced himself and the parliament. Yet you are spending time and effort protecting this person, at the expense of the proper operation of this parliament. People see this and cringe. They are cringing in coffee shops, in shops, in factories and in households all over this country, wondering how much more dysfunctional you lot can become. This is why we need an election, and it is for these reasons that you have not in any sense anticipated some of the danger signs coming. Warwick MCKibbin is not a man known for his dramatic expression or his overstatement of issues. He said that this government has put the economy 'in the eye of the perfect storm'. You have massive spending commitments. You have increased spending by 40 per cent-$100 billion more than four years ago. You cannot explain this; you simply cannot explain it. Let us forget about the stimulus; that was for two years. ",119
217,Mr ROBB,Unknown,"No, let us except the stimulus. I am talking about this year's budget, which has no stimulus money in it, I am told by you. This year's budget is $100 billion more than four years ago. That is a 40 per cent increase. What about a household? What about any of these people in the gallery? If they increased their spending 40 per cent every four years, their households would go broke in no time. This is unrealistic, yet you are spending $100 billion more, and the member for Lindsay stands up here and makes out that you are being fiscally responsible and tough. You are just full of spin. Explain $100 billion at a time when inflation was 13.2 per cent. This government has created structural deficits such that, if the mining income comes back by just a modest amount-20 or 30 per cent-we will dive straight into deficits in excess of $50 billion and debt will ratchet up. It is giving no sense that it understands any of this. People have lost confidence. There is a crisis of confidence. We need an election. We need somebody in these chairs that knows how to manage money.",120
218,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," Before I call the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, can I just request all members of this chamber, when addressing the chair, not to refer to 'you'. Otherwise I will repeatedly pull you up, and your time is limited in the debate. I just give a general warning to everyone: the use of the word 'you' is a reflection on the chair.",120
219,Mr RIPOLL,Unknown," Amongst all the noise and pollution coming from the other side, you could be forgiven if you could not hear the laughter. They do say laughter is the best medicine, and I tell you what: the opposition need all the laughter they can get, because they are a very sick mob if they cannot even accept some of the basic premises and facts of what is happening in our economy, whether you compare us to anyone in the world or to noone in the world. Either way, there are actually some really good things happening in this country and it is time the opposition, like many others, just took note of it and recognised what has happened. What is also true is that, when you run out of your own ideas, you just start attacking the ideas of others. There is not one idea coming from that side. We saw it in the budget response. It was not a budget response; it was just the usual attack that we get in this place. It is just a lot of noise lot of pollution and it brings nothing new to the table. If people are really considering the issue, a matter of public importance has been brought forward here which says the government should rein in spending in the face of current events. If that is the case, where was their case-if that is actually what you are trying to achieve? The opposition comes in here and says, 'Rein in spending.' Where? I was sitting here making notes, hoping for one new idea-maybe we could use it. But there was not one. It was just a sheer, blatant, political attack just to try to gain some advantage. I am not going to use the same rhetoric that was used by my opponents, carrying on about spin and all the rest of it. It would be nice if just once in a while we actually got a contribution in this place, if you are going to raise a matter of public importance, that actually did just that. The fact of the matter is that none of the facts bear out the fanciful half-truths that we get from the other side. There is something, though, that I really do appreciate, and that is the fact that Australians are really hard working, and I am sure the opposition will agree. They may not know that Australians are in fact the hardest working people in the world. It is true. Consistent surveys in recent years have rated Australians as the hardest working people in the world. We are right up there with the best of them. We work many hours and we work productively as well. We are actually an efficient mob. It is because of that and because of what this government is doing that we have managed to get through the global financial crisis, that we have managed to weather the worse storms. I heard before that 'there is a perfect storm coming'. Well, there is a storm coming, but I do not know how perfect it will be or how big the opposition would like and a this storm to be. But on this side, on the government side, on the Labor side, we are doing everything we can to batten down the hatches, and whatever storm might comewe do not know what it might look like or what it might mean-we will work very hard to make sure that whatever happens we have an economy that is resilient to it. One of the best ways to make an economy resilient is to make sure that people still have their jobs. If you look at any economy in the world that is struggling you see that the first thing that goes is people's jobs. If you do not have a job-if you want to go back to the old 'let's go back to basics' stuff-you cannot pay any of your bills. The reality is that we have got people still in work. We worked hard during the global financial crisis to ensure that this economy survived, that Australia would fare the best of any economy. I will make a wager with you. Travel as far as you like and go and ask any treasurer or any finance minister of any other OECD nation or any other nation whether they would like to trade our economy for theirs. They would hack off their own right arm to do that, because they understand the good fundamentals that we have here. That is something that is inescapable. It is just unimaginable for the other side to even contemplate that that might be true, but that is the reality. Every time this government-and I am sure this happens on the other side-talks to people from other countries, global forums, financial forums and finance ministers' meetings they all look to us and say, 'How are you guys doing it? How are you managing to keep your economy so strong?' One of the ways we are doing that is through really responsible fiscal management-and responsible in a whole range of areas. It is not just some glib, simplistic approach which says, 'You just need to do one thing; let's just save more.' I love these sorts of things'Let's just spend less and save more.' What does that actually mean? It must mean something, but they do not tell us what it means. It is a little bit too simplistic If 'save more' means sack people, get rid of people's jobs and shut down industry, then I am not too keen on that. I think there might be a better way. I think we ought to work with industry and try to save people's jobs. I think we ought to keep our economy growing. I think we ought to do something to make sure that people are still working tomorrow as well as the next day. Who are the workers in this country who actually create this economy? It is the small business owners. It is the people who buy a franchise-the people who create a job, who buy their own job and employ their family members or perhaps a friend. There are 500,000 plus franchisees in this country who create an economy, who create work. There are all the tradespeople who go out and work every day, whether they drive a ute, whether they work for someone or whether they work for themselves. We have to keep them working-and we have done that. We have done it in this budget and we have done it in consecutive budgets. We have made sure that when you do spend money-because that is part of growth; spending some money-you spend it in the right areas. Look at the schools and the investment that we have made in really decent infrastructure in schools which will have a legacy for the next 30 years. It keeps giving for 30 years. Look at the school halls, the science labs and the teaching facilities-30 years. I heard the member for North Sydney bleating on about the 'Asian century'. What does that mean to him? According to him, we ought to keep up, we ought to be able to run faster and we ought to be able to do things. I would have thought that if you wanted to run faster you would need to train, and if you are going to train you will need somewhere to train and a training program. You would think that training program might start with our kids in schools. So what did for me. we do? We commissioned Gonski, we invested money, we put bricks and mortar into schools and we actually went for the national curriculum and tried to lift the standard. But apparently that is a waste of money. That is the stuff those opposite talk about when they say they want to save money. You are never going to believe this-because I still do not believe it-but they are going to oppose the schoolkids bonus because, apparently, according to them, parents are not responsible enough to spend money on their own kids' education. That is an insult-but I will skip over that for the moment. If we are to listen to the member for North Sydney, even for a split second, when he says, 'We've got to run faster'-and I agree with him; let's run faster-one might say that he will need to do a lot of training himself if he wants to run faster. If you are going to run faster, sign up to a program and get a trainer-get somebody who might have some knowledge about how you are going to run faster. That is what we are doing. We are putting money into schools, into people, into education-through Gonski and through proper funding. And who is going to benefit from this? Our kids are. I do not believe that any kid in this country should have less opportunity than any other kid in this country no matter where they come from. So when the member for North Sydney talks about the Asian century, for him it is hollow, meaningless echoes off the wall. He is not training. He is not running faster. From what I can see his is running a lot slower-in fact, his walk has become a dawdle. That is what this opposition is represented byformer ministers who are dawdling and have plenty of hollow rhetoric echoing off walls. The member for North Sydney loves to attack programs. And it sounds pretty funny to me-programs investigating researching birds and snails and the moon and all the rest of it. But, under his ideology, you would burn the books and you would get rid of scientists-let's just get rid of all the scientists and all the books!",120
220,Unknown,Unknown,Opposition members interjecting,123
221,Mr RIPOLL,Unknown,"I am sure this bird and snail research was going on when John Howard was Prime Minister, and we did not hear this side say too much about it. The reality is that there is probably a whole heap of research here which relates to something else and is good for this country in some way. The reason that we have science, research, scientists, teachers, professors and universities and we fund them is because it is good for the economy. It is even good for the philistines who sit opposite, the uneducated mob over there, who would actually shut down every school, because that would save money-'Let's just shut down the schools. There's plenty of savings to be made if we have no teachers and plenty of savings to be made if we don't invest in health'! Mr Ian Macfarlane: This is nonsense!",123
222,Mr RIPOLL,Unknown,"You are right-it is nonsense. That is why I am raising itbecause I am trying to make a point. The member for Groom is completely right: it is nonsense. It is nonsense to attack research and science. It is nonsense to attack school funding. It is nonsense not to get behind and support these things. The facts do not bear out the jokes that these guys opposite come up with-and I think the classic one today has to be 'we've got to run faster'. Well, have a look at them. Even with skates they could not keep up! The truth is our economy is strong. It is really strong and it is in good nick-4.9 per cent unemployment; down from 5.1 per cent. Even if you do not believe it, even if you are sceptical about the number, it is the same or methodology and the same data that it has been for 30 years. It is the same data and the same methodology as it was when these guys were in government. Whatever that 4.9 per cent means, it means that unemployment went down and jobs went up. That is all it means. It means more people have got money in their pockets and they can keep the economy strong, because they will spend. They will keep buying. We have done things for small businesses. There is the $6,500 instant tax write-off, there is the $5,500 for the utes; there are things there for the economy to keep growing. It is a strong budget. If you compare it with any economy in the world, we have got inflation under control, we have got debt under control, we have got 9.6 per cent of GDP compared with every other economy on the world. Japan is on 240 per cent. I am proud of the economy we have got. (Time expired)",123
223,Mr CHRISTENSEN,Unknown," If we are the Philistines then I guess I am a bit of a Goliath man, but that was no David performance. That was not even a pebble of a speech. I simply say this: spending is very, very easy. It is so easy that even Labor can do it. What they cannot do is get value for money. And they cannot stop spending the money-even in the wake of four record deficit budgets. Spending is an addiction and, like any addict, this government are in denial. They simply cannot accept that they have got a problem. They try to justify their drunken-sailor approach to spending by comparing themselves with Greece and Spain. If an alcoholic can name someone who drinks more than them, it does not mean they are not an alcoholic. Labor try to justify their spending habit by saying that debt is nothing to worry about. We have been told by the Treasurer that asking to extend the credit card limit by another $50 billion to $300 billion is 'no big deal'. I wonder if the Treasurer's counterpart in the Greek parliament ever described the Greek debt level as 'no big deal'. If this is big deal, how would he describe the debt ceiling when Labor came to government? It was just $75 billion and it was not even needed. But in 2009 the Treasurer increased the debt ceiling to a temporary $200 billion. Remember that? It was going to be temporary. He cited 'special circumstances'. In the last budget he increased it permanently to $250 billion, and now we are told that we are going to be increasing it to $300 billion and it is 'no big deal'.",123
224,Mr Hartsuyker,Unknown,"And he won't need it, he says!",124
225,Mr CHRISTENSEN,Unknown,"Yes, he won't need it, he reckons-just like the last one. How far do Labor have to take it before they take it seriously? This government can try to trivialise their recklessness all they like, it is a bit like Shakira's hips: the numbers do not lie. Real numbers do not, anyway, but the rubbery forecast and the smoke-and-mirrors budget delivered by the Treasurer are a pure work of fiction. The numbers for 2012-13 that we will see in about 16 months from now will tell a darker truth. In 16 months time we will see how much of a big deal the debt limit is-whatever it actually may be by then. The shadow Treasurer delivered an excellent speech at the National Press Club earlier this month. One of the most telling graphics he used gave a visual representation-a very strong pattern of budget surpluses under the coalition. And then you saw this massive decline of budget deficits when Labor had the keys to the cookie jar. It clearly demonstrates that Labor's out-of-control spending has delivered the four biggest budget deficits on record, totalling $174 billion. They are very frightening figures-although I can understand families in my electorate having trouble putting them in perspective, because no families are faced with the same issues every day. They have to watch their spending. And why is it that families have to balance their budgets but the Labor government cannot? Families know that, if you spend more than you earn, you either run out of money or you have to tax the credit card. And speaking of credit cards, can I say how sad it is that this government is so bogged down in the muck and mire surrounding the member for Dobell and, to get out of it and focus on the economy once again, they need to clear the air. Today the Prime Minister failed to do so in question time. When she was asked what line the member for Dobell had crossed, there was absolutely no answer-only some dancing, some line dancing, perhaps, to a country song, probably Johnny Cash: 'Because he's mine, he'll walk the line.' but Going back to the credit cards, families understand that credit card debt has to be paid back. They do not get voted out and let another family come into clean up their financial mess..",124
226,Mr Hartsuyker,Unknown,Unless you're in the HSU!,124
227,Mr CHRISTENSEN,Unknown,"Yes, unless you are in the HSU. Sooner or later, you have to pay it back. If you do not spend within your means, if you do not rein in your spending, if you spend more than you earn, if you keep borrowing money, you end up in a position where it is impossible to pay back.",124
228,Mr Hartsuyker,Unknown,Then you call in the coalition!,125
229,Mr CHRISTENSEN,Unknown,"You call in the coalition at that point. I wonder if this same matter was ever a matter of public importance for the Greek parliament. Clearly a pattern of borrowing more and more money did not work over there. We could ask: are we on the same path? We will not be far behind if we keep posting the biggest budget deficits that this country has ever seen. But turning things around will not be as easy as it sounds, because Labor is spending money in two ways. They are recklessly splashing the cash around in sugar hits that they hope will lift their numbers in the polls and mask the impact of the carbon tax. Speaking about the carbon tax, it is very interesting. It is one of those taxes that is actually costing more than it is collecting, so we are told. I had a look on the Clean Energy Future website and I found an interesting article titled, 'Living green, drinking tea and weaving.' I was looking to see what some of the carbon tax dollars will go to. It said, Saturday, 12 May, Auburn Community Development Network will host another ""enviro tea salon""'. That is actually thanks to support from the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. They are giving them $72,000 to do this. What do they do at these enviro tea salons? This Saturday, participants can take part in a basketweaving workshop. What is the Gillard Labor government doing funding basketweaving to the tune of $72,000? How is basketweaving going to mitigate so-called 'dangerous climate change'? Maybe this is an adaptation thing. They are adapting us to life under the carbon tax. What is perhaps more reckless than this is the fact that they have locked in billions of dollars in spending that will remain even if things in the world go ever so badly. When this government look for the bigger drunk in the room and they compare our economy to other countries, one thing they do not mention is structural deficit. But the economist Henry Ergas did. In an article in the Australian on 7 May this year, he made this comparison: The International Monetary Fund's fiscal update last week highlights how lacklustre the government's efforts have been. Importantly, the IMF concentrates on the structural budget balance, which nets out upswings and downswings and so captures the burden being placed on future taxpayers. This is a good indication of how an economy is really travelling, particularly in uncertain times. Ergas continued: Seventeen advanced economies have materially improved their structural budget balance since the global financial crisis. But not Australia. And six advanced economies will have a structural budget surplus by 2013. But not Australia. If this government wants to talk about the economy and compare us to the rest of the world, then let us do that. But let us compare 'This apples with apples. We are indeed the Lucky Country. We are ideally placed to take advantage of the global resources boom. Australia went into the GFC with an economy that was the envy of the world, with money in the bank. And here we are, after four years of 'hard Labor', posting record deficits. We have extended the credit card in the middle of a boom. If this government is posting record deficits now, what will we see if the economy actually goes into complete meltdown? If this smoke and mirrors budget surplus is so thin it is actually transparent-like the one we have been dished up-despite it being based on a forecast of a bumper 11 per cent increase in tax revenue, it will actually be a real bumper deficit when it sets in. If the thought of what might happen when things go pear-shaped globally is not enough to warrant reining in spending then consider this: even if, by some miracle, the forecast $1.5 billion surplus is actually delivered, what will it do to debt? It is hardly going touch the sides. If Labor managed, by that unlikely miracle, to deliver this long, long series of surpluses, it would actually take Labor 96 years to pay off the debts that accrued in just four years. If the government does not rein in spending and start paying down debt, Australia will continue to spend an extraordinary amount on interest. Interest payments on Labor's debt alone will reach an alarming $8 billion a year. What Labor's recklessness has cost this country is what could have been bought with that money. For example, the National Disability Insurance Scheme could have been brought in. We could have been spending that $8 billion on infrastructure to ensure a stronger economy into the future. We could have been spending that $8 billion on fixing the Bruce Highway right up and down the coast of Queensland, making it safer for motorists and flood-proofing sections of it. Instead, it has been frittered away on pink batts, on overpriced school tuck shopsAn opposition member: On sleeping snails!",125
230,Mr CHRISTENSEN,Unknown,"on sleeping snails and on 'enviro tea workshops' where they are going to be doing basket weaving. What a basket case of a government this is! It cannot manage its debt.  Deputy Speaker Scott, before I start can I commend you on that wonderful tie that you are wearing and its nice maroon colour. And coming from country Queensland I want to point out a mortal sin that was committed by the previous speaker. He misquoted Johnny Cash-and that is reprehensible! This matter of public importance is all about looking at government spending, especially in the face of events unfolding in Europe. We have heard from the member for to North Sydney, the member for Goldstein and the member for Dawson. It is always easy to find fault with some obscure and esoteric component of a multimillion-dollar budget. But when you are talking about a trilliondollar budget it really is just smoke and mirrors to trot out one small amount as an example of what this government is doing wrong. It is funny that I am the third speaker today to quote from the Australian. I hate to do this, but I too am going to quote from that well-known socialist and ALP stooge David Uren. In the first paragraph of his article in today's Australian he says: The Australian economy is tipped to beat Labor's current budget targets-and grow at one of the fastest rates in the OECD A government member: The member for Goldstein did not quote that, did he?  could not find in this article the bit that the member for Goldstein quoted. But I will go back with a fine toothcomb to find it. Uren said: The Paris-based OECD last night endorsed Labor's ""ambitious"" plan to return the budget to surplus. And it said that despite the ""fragile"" state of the international economy, Australia could expect to continue reaping the benefits of the mining boom … Then he gives other quotes that provide the correct economic context for Australia. It is a shame that the other speakers who quoted from the Australian were not prepared to quote from that part. I was actually a bit misled by the MPI raised by the member for North Sydney; I thought he was only going to talk about the events unfolding in Europe. But he did not refer to that at all in his presentation, and nor did the member for Goldstein. Times are tough, we do know that. I have another quote, which I printed off from the Brisbane Times, just to balance the fact that I am quoting from the Australian. It states: The stocks have shed another $15 billion, bringing losses to May to about $100 billion. These are serious, important, tough economic times throughout the world. We have got the dollar going down below 98c. In fact, apart from the yen, all currencies are falling against the US dollar-that is simply a part of the global shift. So these are very tough times. But I was interested to see comments from the World Bank-which are in contrast to the member for North Sydney's motion-saying countries could further loosen monetary and fiscal policies. I quote: Fiscal measures to support consumption, such as targeted tax cuts, social welfare spending and other social expenditures, should be viewed as the first priority. That is the recommendation of the World Bank. Thankfully, we do have a little bit of room to manoeuvre-but not to do some of the fanciful wish list things that the member for Dawson listed in his speech. Floodproofing and paralleling the Bruce Highway from Coolangatta to Cairns was not in their budget announcements. In fact, there were not many monetary measures mentioned in either the budget in reply speech by the Leader of the Opposition or in the member for North Sydney's response at the National Press Club. They really are drifting into magic pudding economics. Just five days ago, Mr Abbott reaffirmed their commitment that there will be lower taxes, less government spending and lower interest rates under the opposition. The stuff that they are able to commit to is just magical! He is able to commit to all of this, as well as scrapping the MRRT and the carbon tax, while still meeting the same emissions targets that this side of the House will meet! The member for Dawson seems to be a bit of a sceptic about harmful pollution.",126
231,Mr Tehan,Unknown,"He liked your basketweaving initiative though!  opposite that you are committed to exactly the same emissions targets that this side is committed to. John Howard committed to them when he was Prime Minister. He was not prepared to ratify Kyoto but he started the measuring process-and, but for the efforts of Queensland farmers, he would not have been able to meet those targets. Still, I remind those opposite that they are committed to exactly the same targets. It is important to point out that taxation as a proportion of GDP is currently 22.1 per cent, which is lower than at any time during the previous Liberal government, and that percentages are what is most important when we are talking about dollars. This is especially so in an expanding economy, though it is slightly different in a contracting economy. The people opposite understand this. We are making life a lot easier for Australians. It is great that we have low cash rates so that a person with a mortgage of $300,000, which is the average, is paying $3,500 less in interest per year. Take the member for Warringah with his, I think, $750,000 mortgage-the one that he forgot to mention on the register of interests. The actual mortgage that is on the register of interestMrs Mirabella: The one that's not real.  interjection from the member for Indi. I am only reading from the headline here; perhaps she could correct the record. It says '$710,000 in Abbott loans not declared'. That is the headline of the article in the paper, but I am sure the member for Indi will explain how it is not an actual mortgage. She understands more about the Leader of the Opposition's finances than I do. I am sure he is thankful that he is paying $8,000 less. Mrs Mirabella: Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the member for Moreton is deliberately being misleading. interjection was relating to the Prime Minister saying people on the North Shore were not real, their families were not their mortgages were not real.",127
232,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," There is no point of order. I remind the member for Moreton that all comments are made through the chair. A couple of times he has directed his comments directly to members opposite. I remind him to keep his comments through the chair.  misunderstood. I took the member for Indi's words literally; but, since she has explained them, I take that on board. Spending as a percentage of GDP is now at 23.5 per cent, which is much better than at any time under the coalition. Incredibly, we have delivered $33.6 billion in savings in this budget, which builds on the $100 billion in savings over the last four budgets. So we are in a great position compared to the rest of the world, and I see great opportunities. This MPI debate is potentially quite provocative in the light of what is going on. People in Australia are a little bit scared, they are feeling a little bit of trepidation. They take their lead from their political leaders-and, at the moment, the Leader of the Opposition and the team opposite are setting a tone. On Insiders on the weekend, they compared the happiness index for Australia with that for Spain, and I was amazed to learn that the Spanish, with 23 per cent unemployment and youth unemployment of nearly 50 per cent, are happier than Australians. We have 4.9 per cent unemployment. I think a lot of the responsibility for the unhappiness of Australians lies with the current political discourse, which is so bitter. The jeremiahs are constantly coming at a time when we should be encouraging people to spend more. My Thankfully, we are encouraging people to go to the shops, to look after their local retailers, and to take advantage of the real and government money circulating in the economy. There will be 4,000 more people in Moreton after 1 July who will no longer have to pay any tax at all. So, by 14 July, when the first pay packet arrives, they will have more money in their hand. Around 45,000 people in Moreton will receive a tax cut of more than $300, and 55,000 people overall will receive a tax cut in Moreton. That money can go into bills, and, by 14 July-Bastille Day-it will be able to go into tills as well. That will be a great boost for my local economy, as will the education refunds and the $69, $250 and $380 for pensioner couples and the $110 for children. All those payments, combined with the Clean Energy advance payments, will be great for the economy. (Time expired)",128
233,Mr RAMSEY,Unknown," It gives me great pleasure to rise in this matter of public importance debate on the urgent need for the government to rein in spending in the face of events unfolding in Europe. It calls on the government to rein in expenditure because of global economic volatility. The world's economy is in a parlous state, and Australia used up its get-out-of-jail-free cards during the GFC. That is the problemwe have placed ourselves in a position now where there is little ammunition left in the locker should hard times return. Every bit of good economic news out of Europe seems destined to be followed by two negative bits of economic news. A couple of months ago, only just before the Greek election-it seems so long ago now-it was a great relief to the world that Europe and Greece agreed on a bailout deal. But the results of the Greek election were inconclusive and Syriza, which is a radical party of the Left, has made big inroads. They opposed the refinancing package offered by the EC, and now the residents of Greece are facing another election. It is quite likely that, as a result of that election, the refinancing plan for Greece will be thrown on the scrap heap and Greece will have to leave the eurozone. In Spain it is almost as bad. Portugal, Italy and Ireland have similar problems. And now France has chosen a similar path by electing a socialist president who has decried the austerity approach and wants to borrow and spend more money and reduce the retirement age. Already their debt-to-GDP ratios are in the mid-80s. I do not commonly quote the former Treasurer of South Australia, Mr Kevin Foley, a man I am sure you know well, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas. He wrote an article, as you would know, in last week's Sunday Mail, in which he says: Now the real fear is a third instalment of European tragedy could wash over the rest of usthe first two he referred to were the two world warsminus the human slaughter but just as devastating in economic and financial terms. The crisis now gripping Europe has enormous consequences for the entire world including Australia. …… … For two years, Germany, France and the IMF have tried to convince debt-laden countries to get their houses in order. France's election of a socialist leader has been alarming development. At any other time. I may have been mildly enthusiastic at President Hollande's win but not now and not with his platform. That is from someone who was the Labor Treasurer of South Australia for over 10 years. He goes on to say that President Hollande was: … elected promising to wind back Budget cuts, to distance France from the hard-line and appropriate German fiscal position and to deal with this nightmare by going for growth i.e. spend more money. France's debt to GDP is 87 per cent. It is almost as broke as Portugal and Spain, which have levels of debt around 100 per cent of GDP. Foley goes on to say: Hollande has no money in the bank so he's going to borrow? Yeah, right. Meanwhile, back here in Canberra, our Treasurer repeatedly tells us Australia is in fine shape and we have nothing to worry about. However, Australians are distinctly uncomfortable and worried about their futures. Since the GFC, government estimates of growth in the economy and growth in tax receipts have been incredibly optimistic. In the budget for 2008-after the GFC-which was tipped to be a contractionary year, they predicted we would have four per cent growth through the remaining out-years of the budget and beyond. At the time, those figures were highly criticised by people on this side of the House and economists around the nation. And they have proven to have been overly optimistic. In that light, the government have failed to take the tough decisions because they have overestimated the world recovery and the recovery in receipts. The record is not pretty. In the final budget that Peter Costello delivered, there was a $19.7 billion surplus. But the following years registered a $17 billion deficit, a $54 billion deficit and then a $47 an billion deficit. This year the deficit is $44 billion, and the year is not finished. Really quite disturbing is the rise in overall government expenditure, which was around the $270 billion mark in the last Costello budget and is now at $376 billion-an increase of more than 40 per cent for the coming budget. The stimulus was meant to be a one-off shot from the government. The stimulus packages that came through were supposed to ramp up and put some money out in the economy and buy some assetsadmittedly, some pretty dodgy assets-and then the money was supposed to be wound back. The stimulus is over but we find the budget now sits at $100 billion more than the last Costello budget. The member for Moreton, just recently on his feet, said that the government had made $100 billion worth of cuts in four years. In fact, their expenditure has not risen by $100 billion in four years, it will rise by $100 billion every year in the budgets from this point. The problem is that Labor members love being the local Father Christmas. They just cannot say no. They are like a bad parent. They love to give out money. The trouble is that it is other people's money, including of future generations. The government tell us they have taken the tough decisions, but in four years they have repeatedly lifted the borrowing ceiling, first from $75 billion to $200 billion to deal with the GFC and then to $250 billion. Now, this year, embedded in the budget papers is a move to shift the borrowing limit to $300 billion, an extra $50 billion-even though the Treasurer tells us we are going to bank a surplus. It leaves you a bit speechless. Yesterday was a red-letter day in this parliament. The member for Longman had another birthday. He was 22 yesterday. We remember well the question he asked in this House. He asked why he should believe that the Labor Party will ever deliver a surplus to this nation when they have never done so in his entire life. He is another year older and they have not done it, again, and it is pretty unlikely to happen in the next 12 months. The lift in the borrowing limit is a clear indication that Wayne Swan has little faith in his budget predictions of a surplus. His attempt to justify the action of the extra $50 billion borrowing limit as 'bumps'-$50 billion bumps!-is simply not believable and is an admission that he has little faith in his budget projections. That is why it is so important that Labor rein in this reckless spending. Even Ken Henry admitted last week on the ABC's 7.30 that the value of the stimulus spending in many cases was poor. He even went on to say that getting value was not the aim of the program-it was just about getting the money out the door. That was the important thing. It did not really matter what it was spent on or how it was spent. That is what I call reckless spending. It is unbelievably reckless-just shovel it out the door and do not care what it is spent on. It is a disgrace. The government is insulting the electorate. that The electors see through the game. They know that eventually they will pick up the bill and they will pick up the interest. This nation will be paying $8 billion a year in interest in the next 12 months-that is, $22 million a day in interest. That is $1, in round figures, for every Australian every day. A dollar a day in interest for every Australian-man, woman and child-and they will still owe the principal. They will still owe the $144 billion this government has racked up on the credit card. There is every possibility that this budget is already shot to pieces. The falls in commodity prices pushed by the Greek debt crisis, the announcement by BHP and Rio that they are reconsidering investment, the escalation of strikes around the Queensland coalfields-there is every chance that this budget is already in trouble and the government needs to reposition its spending program.",128
234,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, Order! The discussion is now concluded. NA Government Response to the Review of Military Compensation Arrangements,131
235,Mr SNOWDON,Unknown,"Lingiari-Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (16:53): by leave-The purpose of this statement is to advise the House of the government's response to the Review of Military Compensation Arrangements, as announced in the federal budget. The review The Military Rehabilitation Compensation Act 2004-the MRCA-was introduced on 1 July 2004 and provides rehabilitation and compensation coverage for injuries, diseases and deaths caused by all types of military service after that date. In the lead-up to the 2007 election, we undertook to conduct a review of the MRCA. The review commenced in mid-2009, at which time the MRCA had been in operation for five years. Broad terms of reference were established to ensure all aspects were captured in the review including how the legislation has been administered. In the 2010 election, we committed to 'taking all appropriate action in response to the review to ensure services and support for veterans and serving members evolve with their needs'. The response announced in the budget takes account of the views gained from considerable consultation during the conduct of the review and following the release of the report. Fifty-two submissions from individuals, ex-service organisations and organisations were considered by the Review Steering Committee. Members of the steering committee visited 12 ADF bases to hear the views of more than 400 current ADF members. More than 100 members of the public and veteran community attended eight separate meetings at venues near the bases visited. A further 48 submissions, from individuals, ex-service organisations and other organisations, providing feedback on the report were considered. The response represents the government's strong commitment to ensuring appropriate legislation is in place to meet the needs of our men and women in uniform. The report The steering committee delivered its comprehensive report to me in February 2011. In March 2011, I released the report and publicly and called for feedback from the veteran and defence communities to ensure their views had been understood and considered. The report concluded that the objectives of the MRCA are sound. It also confirmed that the unique nature of military service justified rehabilitation and compensation arrangements specific to the needs of the military. However, not unexpectedly given the relative complexity and period of operation of the MRCA, the review found opportunities for improvements. It made 108 recommendations ranging from retaining the status quo, support for current initiatives, clarification of policy, further work and monitoring, through to administrative and legislative changes. The government response The government has allocated a net $17.4 million over four years to respond to the review. This comprises $39.6 million of additional expenditure, partly offset by estimated savings for the government of other $22.2 million over four years generated by the initiative to issue repatriation health cards to certain beneficiaries with Defence related claims under the Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988-SRCA. Outcomes Of the 108 recommendations, the government is implementing 96. The 96 comprise: 94 recommendations accepted, either in full, or with modification or enhancement, and two replaced by favourable outcomes. The government deferred three recommendations for further consideration and the remaining nine recommendations were rejected. Of the nine rejected, four were presented as alternatives in the report, and the other five were rejected for various reasons, including concerns raised by ex-service organisations. Of the 96 recommendations to be implemented, that is those accepted or replaced with favourable outcomes:  53 will result in improvements;  21 require future monitoring and/or further review work; and  22 will retain the status quo. Main initiatives The major elements of the government's response are:  changing the methodology used to calculate permanent impairment compensation across multiple acts. This important measure will address the unintended outcome of the current methodology for calculating permanent impairment compensation under the MRCA where the person has previously received compensation under the VEA and/or SRCA. Currently, the compensation paid for a condition accepted under the MRCA may be lower than expected for the level of impairment associated with that condition. The new methodology will remedy this in the majority of cases and will be applied both prospectively and retrospectively at a Safety, cost of $33.7 million over four years. This will include revisiting all calculations involving this methodology made since 1 July 2004.  from December 2013, the government will extend access to the White Card for treatment for beneficiaries with Defence related claims under the SRCA who have long-term treatment needs. This initiative will create consistency in the way that all former members of the ADF, with conditions accepted under one of the acts administered by DVA, can access medical treatment for chronic conditions. This initiative is expected to generate estimated savings of $22.2 million over four years. The Department of Veterans' Affairs will be consulting with key health professionals and their representative organisations on the implementation detail of this initiative:  the third key initiative will provide earlier permanent impairment compensation, for those with multiple conditions, through payment of compensation based on stabilisation of each condition. This will ensure compensation is not delayed in the situation where all a person's accepted conditions have not yet been stabilised.  The government is also increasing flexibility for future wholly-dependent partners in the way they receive compensation following the death of an ADF member or former member, by allowing them to choose a partial lumpsum payment. Currently, wholly-dependent partners have a one-time choice between receiving ongoing periodic payments or converting all of it to a lump sum. This initiative allows future recipients to make a one-time choice between periodic payments for life, or converting 25 per cent, 50 per cent, 75 per cent or 100 per cent to an age-based lump sum-thus allowing them to better match their income to their needs.  The government has also agreed to a one time increase in the rate of pension payable to eligible dependent children under the MRCA following the death of an ADF member or former member. This will realign the payment with a similar payment made under the SRCA.  Finally, the government is increasing the amount of compensation that may be paid for financial or legal advice for those persons who have choices to make about the form of their benefits under the MRCA. It is important that those type of compensation have access to appropriate advice and this increase in compensation acknowledges that there have been changes in the way the financial industry charges for advice since the commencement of the MRCA in 2004. Work is already underway to begin implementation of these recommendations, and following system and legislative changes and other preparatory work, the bulk of the recommendations will be implemented from 1 July 2013. Over 20 of the accepted recommendations require changes to legislation. The changes to the MRCA will ensure the needs of our men and women in uniform, including those serving in operations today, will have the support they need into the future. Conclusion I would like to thank the members of the steering committee for their comprehensive report on military compensation arrangements with a focus on those with service after 1 July 2004. I would also like to thank the veteran and defence communities for their contributions to the review which were important in helping to shape the future of the military rehabilitation and compensation system. I encourage you all to read the report, as it contains valuable explanations of the military compensation system. I commend to you the government's response to the Review of Military Compensation Arrangements, the full details of which can be found on the Department of Veterans' Affairs website. I present a copy of the government's response to the Review Of Military Compensation Arrangements. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Fadden to speak eligible for this for nine minutes. Leave granted.",131
236,Mr SNOWDON,Unknown,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Fadden speaking in reply to the minister's statement for a period not exceeding nine minutes. Question agreed to.,133
237,Mr ROBERT,Unknown," I thank the minister for his statement to the House. The coalition welcomes the government's response to the Campbell Review of Military Compensation Arrangements. The government has accepted 96 of the 108 recommendations of the review and in response has detailed a $17.4 million package of assistance to veterans and their families. The Campbell review considered the coalition's Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004, or MRCA. The act was developed by the previous coalition government and in particular by former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Danna Vale, who determined that this legislation would ensure the best possible outcome for veterans. The new act combined elements of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 to provide a modern compensation scheme for veterans and members of the Australian Defence Force. The MRCA came about in response to the Tanzer review and the tragic Black Hawk accident at the High Range training area near Townsville in 1996. That accident focused our attention on the deficiencies of the military compensation system as it was then constructed. The act has generally worked well save for the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission's decision to refuse to adopt the option of multiple offsetting formulas as allowed by the act. It was therefore prudent to consider the legislation and its operation to ensure it meets the expectations of the veteran and ex-service community. At the 2007 election Labor committed to a review and in 2009 announced that a review would be conducted by the Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, Mr Ian Campbell PSM. Mr Campbell's review team comprised representatives from departments of defence, Treasury, finance and education, and employment and workplace relations. A sixth representative  Sutherland, was also selected. It is fair that, after some pressure from the coalition, the report was finally concluded in early 2011 and was released for comment from the veteran and ex-service community. That public consultation period concluded at the end of June last year. Despite commitments to address 'no-cost' initiatives before last Christmas the minister's own deadline unfortunately lapsed, though the government has now responded to the entire report as part of this year's budget. The coalition has long pressed for the compensation-offsetting methodology to be addressed. The act gives the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission the power to adopt multiple compensation-offsetting formulas, an option which the commission had not previously taken. The new arrangements will provide two calculation methods enabling the best possible outcome to be achieved where a veteran has multiple accepted conditions under one or more acts. This change will be important to ensure that veterans receive adequate compensation for their accepted conditions. Importantly, it recognises the previous differences in the compensation methodology calculation under different acts to ensure that a veteran receives proper compensation for their service-related that injuries. As the minister quite rightly said during his ministerial statement, it is about reflecting the unique nature of military service. The coalition cautiously welcomes the adoption of the white card system for veterans with entitlements under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. The adoption of the white card system does the not come without some risk attached, though. The government admitted in February that no consultation with providers had been undertaken in relation to this recommendation. The coalition will therefore to say seek further information from the government to make sure no veteran is left worse off as a result of this change. It is a step in the right direction but, as noted by departmental representatives in Senate estimates this year, it relies on the goodwill of providers to be implemented. That it is being implemented without consultation is slightly concerning. The MRCA is a complex piece of legislation. Decisions taken by veterans in relation to their compensation can have significant life-long impacts, and the move to provide additional financial support to veterans and their families when making decisions about compensation is a welcome step. Whilst the government will provide further financial assistance in this area, it disappointing that the government is continuing to cut $1 million from the BEST program. BEST, for the benefit of the House, is the Building Excellence in Support and Training program, and was established by the previous coalition government to assist largely-volunteer veteran and ex-service people and organisations to provide pension and compensation claims assistance to veterans. As a result of these cuts in the BEST program, veterans' welfare and service centres across Australia are being forced scale down or even close their operations. It is my view and the coalition's view that this will hurt the next generation of veterans seeking help and assistance with gaining their proper entitlements under law from the Australian government. Unfortunately, this is not the only area where the government is letting our veteran community down-a community that, as the minister said in his own statement, involves and has shown a unique nature of service through its service. Labor continues to oppose the fair indexation for DFRDB and DFRB superannuants. Labor unfortunately opposed the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Amendment Indexation) Bill 2010 put forward by Senator Ronaldson in the Senate. We believe that the fair indexation bill we put forward, which indexes defence pensions in the same way as the age pension, represents fair, just and equitable indexation. We believe it represents a fair go to veterans. The minister is known as a decent minister, and I call on the him to join with the coalition to see that these veterans get a fair go: Minister, they deserve it. The veteran community will welcome the somewhat delayed response by the government to the Campbell review, and will welcome in many ways the minister's statements here this afternoon. We will consider the enabling is legislation when it is introduced, and I know the shadow minister is looking forward to examining the government's response in greater detail during Senate estimates next Tuesday night. I thank the minister for his statement to the House and look forward to some positive outcomes from the work that the minister's department has done. NA Parliamentary Counsel and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 Report from Federation Chamber Bill returned from Federation Chamber without amendment; certified copy of bill presented. Ordered that this bill be considered immediately. Bill agreed to. Third Reading",133
238,Mr RIPOLL,Unknown, by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. (Fair Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,135
239,Mr NEVILLE,Unknown," I rise today to speak to this bill, which in some respects is not particularly important but in other respects is quite important. This Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012 will have implications for a lot of us, especially those who travel overseas in the future. Perhaps in time it may have implications for domestic travel, although that is not the intention at present. We have had brought home to us very vividly in the last couple of days, with the death of the alleged bomber at Lockerbie, what an explosion on an aircraft can do and what dreadful mayhem it can create in the loss of life and property when a plane comes out of the sky. It is just horrendous, the and destruction that can ensue. We saw this also with the aircraft going into the World Trade Centre and crashing into the Pentagon in the 9/11 circumstances. There have been other instances across the world, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, where aircraft have been blown up, and that has been going on right back to the Second World War. But with the fragile peace in the Middle East and the number of terrorists who are abroad at present, it is a time when we must be ever vigilant. In addition to those horrific circumstances like Lockerbie and 9/11, we have also had some near misses where people have come onto aircraft with shoes full of explosives. The incident that, more than any other, triggered this bill was a flight on Christmas Day 2009 from Amsterdam to Detroit on Northwest Airlines flight 253, where one passenger had part of the explosive cocktail in his underwear; a frightening circumstance that he would blow himself and everyone else on the plane to bits. Luckily, he did not get the opportunity to trigger that dreadful cocktail. The point was that the product he was carrying on him was not detectable through a metal scanner. Indeed, whether you have a powder or a gel, if it is a form of explosive cocktail then it needs to be detected. This set the minds of the world's security people on edge and we have now come up with new forms of scanners. The Australian government, through this legislation, will introduce scanning initially to our international airports. The coalition does not oppose the bill and we accept in a bipartisan spirit that the enhancement of national security is a duty for all of us. However, we recognise there are people with genuine concerns-some about health and some about privacy. These concerns led to the government conducting an inquiry through the Standing Committee death on Infrastructure and Communications, of which I am the deputy chair, and were addressed. It was a very interesting inquirynot a particularly long one, but certainly a very interesting one. The first concern was the health aspect. This new form of scanner is different from the metal scanner we are all used to at airports where you walk through and lights are triggered at your feet, legs, hips, waist and upper body and a signal goes off that you do not have metal on you. As I said, if you had a powder or a gel, it probably would not be detected. With the new scanners, you go into a tiny cylindrical room about the size of a telephone box and two masts with antennas on them revolve around you for a period of just two seconds. They transmit a signal that is returned to the antenna and it forms a 3D image. As it comes off your body surface or the surface of any other things you might be carrying, this triggers different light patterns on a generic picture. From that, you can tell whether people have got dangerous materials on them. One issue that occurred to me before we even got to these new scanners is that my wife has got a hardened plastic knife at home-not that I fear my wife with a knife; I do not-for cutting vegetables. It is incredibly sharp and it is as long as a normal carving knife. I have often wondered whether it would be detectable if someone had one of those down the leg of their pants or under their skirt. But these hardened plastic knives would certainly be detectable under this type of operation. We had one of these scanners in Parliament House, up on the first floor, and members of the committee, ministerial staff and others were allowed to see this thing and experience it. I went into the scanner and I took off certain items of metal and left other ones on. It certainly picked up all these bits of metal I was carrying. In fact, I thought I had emptied my left pocket and there was a 10c piece in it. That 10c piece came up on the image loud and clear. In the words of Oliver Goldsmith's poem 'fools, who came to scoff, remained to pray'. There is no doubt that this technology will detect not only metal but other objects, and that makes security when we travel in aircraft that much better for all of us. The other worry lots of people had was about privacy. I think people are entitled to privacy. When you go through one of these walk-through metal scanners, the only other way they can check whether you are carrying some other product is to either strip search or, rather intrusively, frisk you. No-one likes that. People quite rightly object. When the idea of something that could, so to speak, look right through you came on the market, a lot of people had a certain reluctance to participate. They were diffident about it. Probably one of the reasons for that was that an earlier model-not of this exact same technology but of similar technologyallowed anatomical differences in the male and female body to be seen on the screen. A lot of people took objection to that, and perhaps rightly so. Even though the people who were doing the screening were to be in a booth, that did cause some problems. But this new model that we saw here in Parliament House makes a generic figure. There are no anatomical distinctions between these figures. They are not exactly stick figures-they are more bulky than that-but there is no differentiation between male and female, for example. The upper torso, lower torso, legs, arms and head are quite clearly evident, but only to that extent. As the signal comes back from the antenna it is converted into a 3D image and superimposed upon this generic figure which is roughly the size of the person who has gone through the scanning machine. And let me tell you that every bit of metal on you shows up, and I am sure that every bit of plastic or powder or gel that does not come from the normal reaction to your body will also show up on that screen. I think people need to accept that. Some people said they wanted to have an opt-out provision and to be frisked. I do not think that is necessary. There is no intrusion into people's personal privacy in the strict sense of the word. I think we are going to follow the UK system, where if you are asked to go through the scanner and you do not then you do not go into the secure area of the airport, plain and simple-no fights, no tantrums, you just do not get in. As I said earlier, some people are concerned about the irradiation factor. We called in and took evidence from a whole range of people and agencies such as ARPANSA, the Department of Health and Ageing, the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the radiation regulators in the states and territories. Between them, they issued a health and safety information sheet which said: There is no evidence to suggest that millimetrewave body scanners, or other devices in this frequency and at the power density used by scanners, are a health risk for the travelling public or the operators. I think that is a pretty reasonable assessment of it. This will enhance safety at Australian airports for people travelling overseas, initially. I personally would not mind if it were extended to domestic flights, but that not the intention at this stage. I think we cannot be too vigilant about things like this. All these added moves make our lives safer, make our travel more secure and remove anxieties. We have all seen what happens on an aircraft when a gas bottle explodessomething as innocent as that-and the damage that caused to the aircraft. Just imagine if it had been a proper explosive device and what that might have done to that aircraft. We should never put ourselves in that position. We should not suborn ourselves to people who carry explosives in their shoes or in their underwear. We should remove all those people from world travel so that intercourse between the nations of the world can continue freely and without any intrusion that might impact on our safety. The committee unanimously supported the recommendation made following its inquiry, and that recommendation was that the legislation should be endorsed. I, for one, strongly endorse the legislation. Mrs ELLIOT (RichmondParliamentary Secretary for Trade) (17:26): I am very pleased to be speaking on this bill before the House today, the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012, which will amend the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004. I thank the previous speaker, the member for Hinkler, for his contribution and the bipartisan support for this very important bill to improve our aviation security. I acknowledge the points he made in relation to his concerns and the concerns shared by all of us in the House about making sure we increase our aviation security measures. The amendments contained in this bill will support the upcoming introduction of body scanners at Australian international airports. The use of body scanners is required to ensure that Australian travellers, crew and is everyone involved with aircraft travel are afforded the highest level of protection against aviation terrorism. This is a very important and major step in ensuring the safety of all people travelling through our international airports for whatever reason, for tourism, for trade. We are seeing a massive increase in international air travel and this is a very important step to meet the increased security needs within the aviation environment. The introduction of these body scanners will bring Australia into line with countries such as the USA, Canada, the UK and the Netherlands, so it is very important that we are making this improvement. Many speakers have talked about why such an improvement is necessary. It is vitally important when we look at tackling aviation terrorism and the threat it brings. As we know, terrorism has become the defining issue of the first decade of the 21st century, with the 9-11 aeroplane attacks acknowledged as the most destructive, horrific terrorist attacks in history. Since that time Australia's aviation security regime has been significantly strengthened. However, the aviation sector must remain vigilant against the threat of any potential terrorist attack and that is why improvements such as this measure are vitally important. Many speakers have talked about the situation in 2009 where a passenger on a US flight between Amsterdam and Detroit concealed an explosive device in his underwear and passed through aviation security screening with that device undetected on his person. This event highlighted the vulnerability in global aviation security screening practices, including in Australia. It certainly made many countries aware of the need for increased security. In response to this incident, the government announced a package of measures to strengthen Australia's aviation security. So, accepting that the aviation security environment has significantly evolved in the last decade and will continue to do so, the bill before the House today continues the government's commitment to ensuring that Australian airports are afforded the highest level of protection against the threat of aviation terrorism. The bill will also provide flexibility for future governments to introduce new screening tools as technologies improve, ensuring that technologies will be used to achieve the maximum security outcome whilst also acknowledging and making sure that there is minimal impact on passenger movements as much as possible to have that balance right. We obviously have to be very mindful of making sure that we keep our security commitment at a very strong level and ensuring as best we can the free flow of passengers through our international terminals. I think that the majority of people do acknowledge the importance of having increased security measures and appreciate how absolutely vital they are in today's environment. The bill states that a person has consented to any screening procedure at the screening point and must receive clearance in order to board an aircraft or to enter an area of a security controlled airport. Secondly, it provides for the Aviation Transport Security Regulations 2005 to deal with any person that must not pass through a screening point. Thirdly, it lists, but does not limit, the of equipment that may be used for security screening purposes. This includes metal detection, explosive trace detection and active millimetre-wave body scanning equipment. If a body scanner is used for the screening of a person, the image must only be a generic body, gender-neutral, and must not identify that person. Fourthly, the bill repeals section 95A of the act. Very importantly, the bill is compatible with the human rights and freedoms recognised or declared in the international instruments listed in section 3 of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011. As I stated earlier and as many other speakers have spoken about, passenger screening is a critical component of any aviation security system operating internationally today. Section 41 of the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 provides the legislative framework requiring a person to be screened when boarding an aircraft or entering an area or zone within a security controlled airport. Screening is conducted by authorised screening officers who inspect individuals and their property to deter and prevent the carriage of prohibited items and weapons that are considered to be a threat to an aircraft. Screening can entail using X-ray machines, walk-through and hand-held metal detection devices and random and continuous explosive-trace detection devices on passengers and carry-on bags and physical searches as required. The bill will enable the removal of section 95A of the act, meaning that an individual will no longer be able to choose a frisk search over another screening procedure, so it is very important that we have that removal and that change there. In order to ensure the travelling public is safe, the prohibited items that Australian aviation screening seeks to identify has types evolved from simply attempting to detect metallic weapons to a newer environment that presents a range of sophisticated threats that our screening regime must be capable of detecting. Unfortunately, where we have people finding new and advanced ways to attempt to get these items onto our aircraft we do have to make sure that our security systems are evolving as well to be able to detect them at a much greater rate. This is where the use of body scanning technologies can play a very significant role in Australia's aviation security regime. Body scanners have the ability to detect and pinpoint the location of both metallic and non-metallic items concealed within or underneath a person's clothing. Indeed, body scanners offer the greatest chance of detection, as existing screening technology used in Australia is incapable of detecting many of the new-generation threats. There is currently no alternative method of passenger screening available today that can really deliver an equivalent security outcome to a body scanner. That is why it is very important that we do have that in place. We are also very mindful and aware of an individual's privacy. We have carefully considered the introduction of body scanners and the impact on the travelling public's privacy and we are committed to the introduction of body scanners that have a range of privacy enhancements. We understand how important that is. The automatic threat recognition technology is one of the most important of these. This technology displays areas of concern on a generic human representation which is the same for all passengers. It is very important that the point be made clear that it is the same. The technology removes the need for a human operator to look at raw or detailed images and therefore maintains the privacy and modesty of all individuals. In addition, body scanners introduced in Australia will not be capable of storing or transmitting any information or data. There has also been extensive consultation to ensure that body scanners meet health and safety requirements. The ProVision millimetrewave body scanner will be introduced, being the only one that currently meets the government's requirements. Also it is important to note that the introduction of body scanners will not interfere with the rights of people to wear traditional, religious or cultural attire. As I said before, when it comes to scanning there are no defining characteristics and the operator is not given any raw images but, rather, stick figures that represent only a male or a female image. It is very important that we are of that. Body screening will also protect a passenger's modesty. Full body frisking-if we look at the comparison-can include a full and thorough search of the entire body and may even require the removal of some clothing. When you look at that differentiation, it is unlikely that a passenger selected for screening would opt for a full body frisk rather than body screening. The government does understand that some screening technologies, including body scanners, may not be suitable for all individuals due to special circumstancesfor example, in light of an individual's disabilities or other medical conditions. We are very much aware of that. Individuals who cannot undergo certain screening procedures due to physical or medical conditions will be screened by alternative methods suited to their circumstances, and it is very important that we address all those privacy concerns that have been raised. It is important that we take this added step in terms of body scanners to ensure the safety and security of our international airports, particularly when we look at the massive rise in international air travel and what it means for our country in tourism and trade and how it is such a strong economic driver. But at the same time we have to be very mindful of ensuring that we have very strict and very thorough security regimes in place. I think most travellers appreciate and understand the necessity of having such levels of security, the reasons they need increased and why having body scanners is so vitally important. When we look at the role of international airports we can see how important they are as economic drivers. I certainly see that in my electorate on the North Coast of New South Wales. Indeed, we have the Gold Coast airport, which crosses Commonwealth land between Queensland and New South Wales. It is an expanding airport and, in terms of being an economic driver for northern New South Wales and also for South-East Queensland, it is vitally important. We have seen an increase in international travel with visitors coming to all parts of our region and, of course, that brings massive economic benefits, not just the increases in jobs at the airport itself but in the surrounding areas in tourism and retail. So I certainly understand first hand importance of international air travel and also the role that airports play within our communities. From my background in policing, I have a strong understanding and appreciation of the need for enhanced security systems, particularly in environments where we have to be always very vigilant. Looking at the terrorist activities in the past, we need always very concerned that we are acting in the best interests of all people who are travelling through our international airports and providing the highest amount of protection that we possibly can. That is why this government is very committed to making sure that we do have body scanners at our international airports. We want to make sure that we have a very robust and effective aviation security screening regime and that is why we are introducing this commend the bill to the House.",135
240,Mr MCCORMACK,Unknown," The tragic events of 11 September 2001 to be changed the world forever. After 9/11 questions were understandably asked about and criticism levelled at the effectiveness of security at the time. All 19 hijackers from the Islamist militant group al-Qaeda involved in those dreadful suicide attacks against America and against freedom using four hijacked passenger jets were able to pass existing checkpoints and board the aircraft. Since the attacks, in which 2,996 lives were lost and 6,000 people were injured, security at many airports worldwide has been considerably strengthened. The legislation before the House, the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012, implements several amendments to facilitate the introduction of body scanners at international airports in Australia. It would be reasonable to say there are a lot of people who are uncomfortable the with some of what this bill proposes, even though all would agree with the tenet of the legislation and what it proposes to achieve or, rather, what it aims to avoid. No-one in their right mind wants a repeat of 9/11 and those awful images burned into the conscience of a bereaved world. To do all we can to ensure such an act of mass murder does not happen again will require some to be inconvenience, some level of unwanted intrusion. Body scanning screening security will bother those subjected to it. It will put people out. It will aggravate and annoy them, even infuriate some. But this must be done for the greater good of a society in which people expect to be able to board planes without fear of bad and mad terrorists perpetrating their wickedness on the world. In the bill's amendments, section 41A is bill. I inserted. It assumes consent for any screening procedure, except for a frisk search, at a screening point unless the person expressly refuses consent. Section 44 is amended to allow the Aviation Transport Security Regulations 2005 to handle people unable to pass through a screening point. Sections 44(3), 44(3A) and 44(3B) are inserted to list but not restrict the types equipment which can be used for screening and specify that where body scanning equipment is used the image generated must be gender-neutral and non-identifiable. That is of the utmost importance for people and their privacy. The amendments repeal section 95A, which allows a person to choose a frisk search over another screening procedure. Why has all of this become necessary? On Christmas Day 2009, a 23-year-old Nigerian Islamist, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, attempted to detonate plastic explosives sewn to his underwear on Northwest Airlines flight NW253 from Amsterdam to Detroit. There were 290 passengers onboardinnocent people for whom the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, who claimed to have organised the attack and supplied the would be bomber with the improvised explosive device, had absolutely no regard. Abdulmutallab had successfully concealed the bomb in his underwear through security screening in Yemen and Amsterdam. It went undetected because it did not contain metallic elements. The potentially deadly bomb failed to detonate, instead catching and making popping noises, at which point Abdulmutallab was tackled, restrained and handcuffed while the pilot safely landed the plane. In response to what could have been a shocking tragedy, the United States increased the installation and use of fullbody scanners in many of its major airports. The scanners are designed to be able to detect bombs under clothing, and 11 airports, including O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, began to receive the machines in March 2010. Here in Australia, the government announced a package of measures to heighten aviation security on 9 February 2010. This announcement committed $200 of million for new security technologies, increased policing at airports, improved security procedures and bolstered international cooperation. The package included $28.5 million for optimal technologies, including body scanners. The introduction of body scanners is supported by the Department of Infrastructure and Transport's Office of Transport Security. This technology is already used in Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications tabled its report about this bill on 9 May 2012, recommending unanimously that this legislation be passed. A Senate inquiry is underway and scheduled to report next Wednesday. Non-metallic explosives still pose a very real and deadly threat to safe air travel as shown by the fact that earlier this month an upgraded version of the underwear bomb was seized by the Central Intelligence Agency. Unfortunately, there are people in this world whose hatred for the Western way of life, fuelled by religious and ethnic intolerance, puts them on a suicidal path of fire mass destruction. These people must be stopped. They must be locked away. If installing body scanners at international airports in Australia means limiting the risk of terrorism then that is a positive measure, a good thing. Too many families-too many Australian parents-today mourn loved ones lost because of terrorism. Young Riverina men David Mavroudis, Clint Thompson and Shane Walsh Till were among 88 Australians killed in the Bali bombing on 12 October 2002. Shane was a mate of mine. This was not a plane hijacking or in-flight bomb attack but nevertheless an act of barbarism which stuck at the heart of our peace-loving way of life. It was a grim reminder of how vigilant we must be in our homeland security to do whatever we can to minimise the threat of such appalling occurrences taking place here or on outbound planes. The only body scanner which fulfils the government's requirements is the L-3 Communications ProVision millimetre-wave body scanner. Passengers to go through scanners will be selected on a random basis, as is the case for existing explosives testing. I know the member for Hume has expressed reservations about the safety of the equipment for people who, like him, have pacemakers and defibrillators. My coalition colleague appreciates the necessity of this legislation; however, he is also right to question whether the actual scanning could be in any way harmful to someone carrying heart-saving technology. Due to the extremely low power level of the scanner, it will not be able to detect internal medical insertions such as pacemakers or metal hips. The scanner uses a weak beam of radio waves transmitted at the person being scanned from two rotating masts inside the device. The exposure from the being in the scanner for 1.5 to 2.5 seconds is said to be less than what you would experience routinely during a flight and with 10,000 times less radio frequency energy than an average mobile telephone call. Energy reflected by the body or any other object on the body is received by the machine and analysed by the device's software. If an anomaly is detected, a small box indicating its location is superimposed on a generic human image which is displayed for closer inspection by screening staff. The machines are not capable of storing or transmitting any information or data. The scanning will be culturally sensitive in that passengers will not be required to remove any religious items or clothing. Being held up at an airport for a safety test is usually a hassle and invariably it occurs whenever you have the least amount of time to get to the boarding gate. But for safety's sake it is a necessary incursion in our modern life and if it helps to detect one-just one-person attempting to wreak havoc, then it is well worth the effort. I commend the bill to the House.",141
241,Mr CHESTER,Unknown," I join the debate in relation to the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012. It is with great disappointment that I stand here tonight to participate in this debate, because I think it is very sad that we are forced in this day and age to take these steps. I think it is a very sad reflection on the world we live in and the threats that are posed to international air travellers in particular. But I do acknowledge the expert advice that has been presented during this debate and the recommendations from security officials relied on through the department that this is a necessary step and I acknowledge that the coalition will not be opposing this legislation. I must confess when I first heard about body scanners my own predisposition was to be negative towards them. My fear was that it would be just another intrusion upon people's rights to privacy and to their rights to go about the quiet enjoyment of their own lives, and it would be another significant cost to air travellers. So I did have significant reservations when I first heard about these body scanners. The coalition does acknowledge that there are some concerns within the community about body scanners. I participated in the committee's inquiry into the body scanner technology and I must say that, having viewed the scanners and participated in that inquiry, most of the concerns I had were allayed. And I do note some of the previous speakers went through in some detail about some of those issues. The first thing that I was perhaps satisfied with when it came to the issue of the body scanners was this issue of personal privacy in the fact that the legislation and the demonstration that many members took the opportunity to participate in really did allay my initial concerns in relation to privacy. The images which are displayed are not of an anatomical nature-people distinguish between men or women or the size of a person or any other features by looking at those images. I am reassured by that and the legislation does provide for the fact that the images cannot be displayed and they cannot be transferred. So we are not going to have this situation where, as one of the previous speakers remarked-it may have been the member for MCEwen-some of these images are then going to be popping up at a later point in time in websites or in some other place around the world. I think that is a very good thing and I am reassured by that aspect of the legislation. Section 44(3B) states that image produced by a body scanner must be a gender-neutral, generic image such that the person is not identifiable and no anatomical or physical attributes of that person are revealed. I think that we can all take heart from that and the fact that this bill has been well drafted regard. We have all seen the images I believe of the body scanner image. It is just a stick figure but it does allow for the person operating the equipment to quickly identify any areas of concern, and that is one of the best aspects of it. For anyone who actually had the opportunity to use the scanner, the scanner was able to detect things-unusual objects-very quickly, and then it was easily resolved. The person operating the equipment can very easily go to the place on the person's body and resolve the issue very quickly, unlike with metal scanners where you often see people walking through multiple times, taking off belts, boots, watches and everything else they might have forgotten to take off, and it takes far longer period to resolve the issue. So I was reassured by that. It will be a quick and efficient method of resolving any security concerns. Previous speakers also referred to an issue that I have been lobbied on by some people cannot in the community who have some reservations with the body scanner technology in relation to health issues. I believe the Leader of the Nationals covered off on this issue particular well in his speech and I do not intend to go through it all again. There is no evidence to suggest that the body scanner technology does pose a health risk for individuals using them. In fact, one of the interesting things about the technology, particularly for people who may have had surgical implants, is that the body scan technology may be a preferred way of going through security checkpoints. It is less intrusive than having to explain the metal pin or whatever other medical device they might have for their various conditions. In some ways it enhances privacy for people. I take comfort from the background information that indicates the scanner emits 10,000 times less radiofrequency energy than in that an average mobile phone call. So the machines themselves do meet the public health and safety tests that should be applied in these circumstances. Having participated in the inquiry and having seen the machines in action, I am reassured that they will provide a worthwhile service in our security regime at our international airports. I have no argument with the need to use modern technology wherever possible to improve security. Unfortunately, the people who would do us harm are always looking for ways to go about their evil work. Giving passengers peace of mind is a very important aspect of this legislation. Also, it reflects the huge challenge we face to stay one step ahead of those who would seek to do us harm. I will speak a little more broadly on the aviation industry and some of the security measures more generally in the time that is available to me. I will also reflect on some comments made previously by the shadow minister for tourism in his contribution. He referred to some of the additional concerns for aviation and the tourism industry arising from the budget and there are some issues there that I think the government needs to take onboard. I refer particularly to the Tourism and Transport Forum. They put out a statement on 9 May, after the budget, that was headed: 'The devil is in the detail.' I do not intend to go through every aspect of the contribution by the Air Transport and Tourism Forum; but, when we are talking about legislation here today which will add costs to the Australian tourism industry, there are some very real challenges facing it. It is important that, whether we call them charges, levies, fees or whatever, these new costs all add up to being a tax on tourism. They act as a barrier when it comes to attracting international visitors to our shores. We have a situation where a high Australian dollar is making it difficult for the tourism industry in a very price-sensitive market. It counterintuitive for us as a nation to be spending marketing dollars in an attempt to attract international tourists to our shores then making ourselves less attractive or providing extra costs to the visiting tourists. I acknowledge that one of the important aspects of this bill is that it helps promote Australia as a safe tourism destination. The body scanner technology will be of benefit to the industry where it applies to international flights. Increasing passenger movement charges and requirements for partial recovery of airport policing costs through the Australian police all effectively add up to another tax on tourism at a time when the tourism industry and the aviation sector, more generally, is facing some significant challenges. I urge the government to recognise this. It is the same for regional aviation. I recently had the opportunity to meet with some senior staff members from Regional Express-or the Rex airline, as it is more commonly known. They are concerned that some of the combined impacts of government decisions and other changes in the regulatory environment are contributing to a $6 million hit per year on their bottom line. That is a significant cost. I acknowledge that Rex is a profitable business. They have been doing a good job and they are thriving in regional communities. But the government is making it harder at the moment. The minister needs to think very seriously about some of the decisions that are having an impact on the regional aviation sector. The fact that the combined impacts of these threats are threatening the future viability of their industry is something the minister needs to take onboard. Among those threats is the carbon tax. It will have a direct impact on regional aviation. There is no shielding for regional air services and it will is result in a direct price impact for travellers, which obviously makes it less attractive for them to use our regional airline services. The and other point that was made very strongly to me is in relation to the en route scheme and is one that has been abandoned by this government. It will lead to a faster decline in regional air services and make it less likely for them to open up new areas of service throughout regional Australia. At a time when we should be supporting the regional aviation industry to open up new routes and drive regional development, we are unfortunately making it harder for it. Another concern facing the regional aviation sector and perhaps relevant to this bill today in terms of body scanner technology is that there are some very serious issues associated with the additional security screening requirements in regional settings. I know we all take public health and safety very seriously, but it is so important that security measures are risk based, and they should be proportionate to the costs and benefits involved. I will provide the House with an update on a particularly positive story about the Australian aviation sector. It relates to some news from a company called GippsAero in my electorate of Gippsland. It is a Mahindra Aerospace company and is based at the Latrobe Valley airfield in Traralgon. As far as I am aware, GippsAero is the only manufacturer of commercial aircraft in Australia. It has successfully completed the first flight of its new aircraft, the GA10. aircraft is the first single turboprop designed and developed in Australia. It is a 10-seat multirole aircraft based on the very successful GA8 Airvan, which many people know of in the aviation sector and fondly call 'the ute of the sky'. They have been a very successful company in Gippsland. In fact, they have sold more than 200 units throughout the world. We are very proud of the company and what it has been able to achieve during some fairly difficult times. They have come through the global financial crisis with a different management acknowledge that-but they have been very successful and an important employer in the Gippsland region. The CEO of GippsAero, Dr Terry Miles, announced this week: The GA10 will bring an entry level turboprop utility aircraft to the market place enabling operators to make the not inconsiderable step of moving from piston to turboprop power. The projected low purchase price and low operating costs of the GA10, coupled with its great versatility, will offer operators a commercially viable multi role turbo prop aircraft. It is not my role to run advertising for GippsAero but I am very proud of the company. I congratulate them on the work they are doing. They are doing an extraordinarily good job. They have manufactured and sold in excess of 200 aircraft that fly in 34 countries around the world, including in the US, Australia, Europe and Asia. It is a terrific little regional business that we hope to expand greatly in the future. On those expansion plans, there are real opportunities for governments at all levels to partner with GippsAero and the Latrobe Regional Airport in the opportunities to develop a real aviation niche in Traralgon. Right now, we have a commitment on the This table from Latrobe City of $500,000 and the state government has committed $1.5 million. And just today the state government added another $1.2 million to its commitment to the upgrade of the airport, bringing it to $3.2 million. This is on the table and available for use for the upgrade of Latrobe Regional Airport. However, the challenge now is that we need to secure funding under the Regional Development Australia Fund. I am optimistic, and I know the Gippsland board of Regional Development Australia is very positive about the project plan for the Latrobe Valley. A lot model-I of government ministers have come to the Latrobe Valley and talked a lot about ways they would like to help my community adjust to the impact of the carbon tax, but it remains to be seen whether the government is going to put money on the table-and when I say the government, I am referring to the federal government. So supporting an upgrade of Latrobe Regional Airport would be a very good start, and I urge the relevant ministers to take note of the commitments that are already on the table: firstly, the Latrobe city's $500,000 commitment; and now with the state government adding a further $1.2 million today to the $1.5 million that they have already committed. I congratulate those levels of government and I look forward to the expansion of Latrobe Regional Airport, which will enable the local aircraft manufacturer, GippsAero, to expand its operations to meet the growing business needs of my community. I would like to encourage the federal government to have a very close look at this particular project; I know it is being actively considered by the government at the moment. Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore, I appreciate your indulgence; I did stray a little bit from the body scanner technology but I think it was important to raise a couple of other regional aviation issues, particularly as they apply to my electorate of Gippsland, and to mention some of the opportunities that exist in regional aviation throughout Australia. There is a very good opportunity for this government, or future governments, to work with the regional aviation sector. As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, coming from a regional seat, the tyranny of distance can make it difficult for us to expand our opportunities-particularly for young people growing up in regional communities-but, if we can continue to support regional aviation, we can help to drive regional development opportunities. I would like to see this and future governments work closely with the regional aviation sector for the benefit of the entire nation.",143
242,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, I thank the member for his contribution. I note that a bigger indulgence in his favour today was him playing for New South Wales in the State ofMr Chester interjecting,147
243,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I beg your pardon; that is okay then. We will return to the bill.,147
244,Mr SIMPKINS,Unknown," I appreciate the opportunity tonight to make some comments on the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012. When visit schools and talk to children in the Cowan electorate about government and parliament-whether they are in primary school or high school-I am very clear on this matter. I say to the children: the one thing that is always clear is that both sides of politics believe in making this country the best place it can be, but the difference between them-the Labor side and the Liberal-National side-is how we get to that place. I can say that about the major parties; I am not so sure about the fringe party. This is one of those bills where we are as one. This is one of those bills where we believe that more needs to be done. We welcome the fact that this bill is coming through. I certainly endorse the technology and I endorse the bill. In recent days we have heard that the only person found guilty of and sentenced for the Lockerbie terrorist attack, the attack that brought down the Pan Am 747 over Scotland so many years ago, has recently passed away-and good riddance, might I say. The involvement of the then Libyan regime in that matter is, I think, strongly suspected and believed by most people. The reality iswhether it is in the past, like major terrorist attacks like that one; in the more recent past; or when we look forward to the future-that there are people out there who wish to create havoc. They wish to murder and kill innocent people. As a result of that, governments around the world need to work together and come up with these sorts of laws, and make use of technology which is going to increase the likelihood of detection and safeguard the people. There is nothing more tragic in the world than to see those-particularly the innocents, the women and the children-who have nothing to do with politics and who have nothing to do with the issues that so many terrorist groups espouse around the world get caught up, get killed, maimed or terrified in the crossfire of the evil and brutal ways of such groups. When I was in the Australian Federal Police many years ago, back in 1986 and 1987, the security arrangements at the airports at that time were good, but they were only up to the technology at the time. We have seen that technology move on. That technology, as I said before, is required to deal with not only the conventional and the usual threats that might be out there, the weapons of various kinds and the explosive devices, but also the latest technology, such as the underwear bomb and the new generation of underwear bomb that was recently discovered by the US secret services. What we need is a further increase in security to match up to the threats that currently face the world. Australians are used to running their carry-on baggage through the X-ray machines and stepping through the X-ray machines and, more recently, the random checks of explosive trace devices that we have at the airports. All of us who travel regularly, from Perth and from other places, are subject to that I think I have had about a hundred explosive trace detection testsand Australians accept that. I do not wish to run down the privacy concerns but, ultimately, everybody who hops on a plane wants to be safe and they are prepared to forgo a little bit of convenience to make sure that their journey is not going to be stopped by a terrorist attack or by people up to no good with weapons or explosives. So there is no doubt that there are some privacy concerns. You only need look on the internet at Google images of the body-scanning machines we are talking about today to see sensationalist pictures of somebody appearing in a-let us say-anatomically correct way. Of course people are concerned about that, so it is heartening and completely appropriate that within this bill the regulations are completely defined. It is absolutely the case that the use of only gender-neutral, generic images of the body are absolutely locked into the bill and that the legislation looks at and addresses the fact that improvements in technology will see further generations of these sorts of machines coming through. One of the images I have seen from these such as body scanning machines was of the minister-in all his clothed glory, luckily. He went through one of those machines. A number of us also got to test out the machines ourselves, and that was a very good way of making sure that we as parliamentarians were better informed. I was given the opportunity to put myself through one of these machines and, because I had already emptied my pockets, nothing came up. I was heartened by that, but then I remembered that in my office I had a small plastic covered device which I had been given several years before during a sciencemeets-parliament event and that one part of the device could be pulled off to reveal a very sharp knife. I was thinking, 'I will go and find that in my office, and I will come back and slide it down one of my socks and work out whether this machine is as good as it could be.' There was no doubt-as soon as image came up, there in yellow the machine described exactly where the knife was hidden on my person. So I became a very clear and absolute fan of this technology. I had seen one of these machines in Los Angeles a couple of years before, soon after the last election. A member of my family was asked to go through one of the machines, and I was of the view that perhaps a little bit more could be seen than just the non-anatomically correct image. But I am greatly heartened by the fact that such privacy concerns are covered within the legislation. The machines cannot record images, and a fuller stick figure is all that going to come up on the images. Through personal experience, I have no doubt that these machines are very good and that they do detect what needs to be detected. There have also been concerns-although none have been raised with me personally within the electorate of Cowan-that these machines will expose a person to increased electromagnetic radiation. But this is also dealt with in the legislation. The scanner will emit 10,000 times less radiofrequency energy than an average mobile phone telephone call. I think that fact really addresses the key issues that have been covered by a lot of the commentary on these body scanning machines. I turn now to address concerns about cultural and religious profiling. I have watched very carefully the existing explosive trace detection regime that takes place at our airports, because with my federal police background I am quite interested in aviation security, and, as a frequent flyer, I am very interested in aviation security. I have observed the people who are picked up during the X-ray walk-throughs to be called forward for the explosive trace detection procedure, and it does seem to be very random. It does not appear that people are targeted for any sort of racial, cultural or religious reason. In conclusion I say that I think that what we have here in Australia is pretty good so far and that this bill and this technology will improve what we already have. As I said before, there have been some great tragedies in history and, as we know, there has never been a single survivor of an explosion on board an aircraft. We want to make sure that the best security regimes possible are in place and that the Australian public and visitors to our country are as safe as possible. All the concerns about implanted medical is devices, about medical objects, about privacy and about the targeting of particular groups are addressed in the bill. We have a good background in this country in making sure that security measures are applied fairly and appropriately, and I have great confidence that aviation security will only be improved by this bill and by this technology. I welcome the passage of the bill, and I look forward to seeing body-scanning devices used widely throughout the nation's airports.",147
245,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (18:14): I thank all those who participated in such a constructive way during the debate on the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill 2012. The introduction of security screening technology is an important step in further strengthening the security of the nation's aviation industry. The attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines flight 253 in December 2009 and the recently disrupted plot to bomb a US-bound aircraft using a non-metal improvised explosive device highlight the need for robust aviation security screening systems that are capable of detecting nonmetallic threats to commercial passenger aircraft. The introduction of body scanners will ensure that travellers departing Australia are afforded the highest level of protection against aviation terrorism. My department has consulted extensively with other government agencies, community stakeholders and industry to ensure that all health and privacy issues associated with the introduction of this technology have been fully explored. As a result of these discussions, the government has put in place a number of measures to protect the privacy and health of travellers. Firstly, it is a requirement that body scanners used for aviation security screening in Australia must use non-ionising millimetre wave-technology. X-ray technology will not be allowed. Secondly, to protect the privacy of the travelling public, any image produced by a body scanner must only be a generic or stick figure image that is gender neutral and from which the person cannot be identified. In addition, the body scanner must not store any image of the person that is produced by the equipment or any personal information about the person. This bill will ensure that body scanners are used in such a way that achieves both an optimal security outcome and a minimal impact on passenger facilitation. The passage of this bill will help to ensure the safety of the 13 million people that depart from Australia's international airports each year. I thank once again all members who participated in the debate and I thank the House for the support of this important legislation, which I commend to the House. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",149
246,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (18:16): I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill and I move the government amendment as circulated: (1) Schedule 1, item 3, page 4 (after line 3), after subsection 44(3B), insert: (3C) If body scanning equipment is to be used for the screening of a person, the equipment must not store or transmit: (a) an image of the person that is produced by the equipment; or (b) personal information (within the meaning of the Privacy Act 1988) about the person.",150
247,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"In speaking to the legislation amendment that I have moved, I move this amendment in response to the matters that were raised by the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I am proposing an amendment to the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Screening) Bill to include a provision requiring that any current or future body scanner used for aviation security screening at Australian airports not store or transmit any image or personal information about the person being screened. This was always the intention of the government. The Senate committee has asked that the bill be amended to include a very explicit provision in the legislation, and that is why this amendment has been moved. The amendment will strengthen the privacy safeguards already contained in the bill and give the travelling public further assurance that their privacy is being protected, without affecting the security outcome that will be achieved through the introduction of body scanners. The amendment confirms the government's absolute commitment to ensuring that it achieves the right balance between privacy and security at our airports. I commend this bill, as amended, to the House.",150
248,Mr HUNT,Unknown," We have many issues with many of the things done and said by the Leader of the House; on this occasion, we thank him for adopting the amendments and proposals put forward to protect the privacy of information as presented by the coalition through the Senate report.

249,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (18:19): by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time.,151
250,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"I do thank the opposition for their support for the legislation and indeed for the amendment that arose out of the Senate inquiry. It is important, and I think a precondition to successful outcomes, that issues of security be bipartisan-that they not be conducted in a political fashion. The government has attempted to ensure that there has been as much community consultation as possible. Indeed, even in this House, we ensured that one of the body scanners was made available for all members and senators, and indeed all members of the media and others who work in this House, to use so they could see in practice the way that these body scanners would work. Often with these issues it is far easier to raise concerns than to look at the reality of how things will work in practice. I thank the House and I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development) Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",151
251,Mr HUNT,Unknown," In relation to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development) Bill 2012, the opposition is delighted to provide its support, although we wish to make one significant amendment. Let me begin by putting this bill in context before examining the bill, the committee and the issues in relation to water and farmers' rights over their own land. The starting point is that there are two great issues in relation to coal seam gas. The first, the subject of this bill, is an environmental issue in relation to the protection of our water resources against the sorts of outcomes which we have seen from bad practices in some of the West Coast and Central West areas of the United States, the sorts of practices which may inadvertently lead to the depletion of aquifers or the poisoning of certain subterranean water bodies. That is a deep, real, legitimate, prime concern. We do not play dice with our underground water resources, our aquifers, the resources of the Murray-Darling Basin or the Great Artesian Basin; we simply do not take risks on that front. I will come back to that later. What this bill does not do-and I think it is very important to acknowledge this-is address the issue of farmers' access to and control over their own land. One of the most significant issues surrounding coal seam gas is that farmers feel they are losing control of their land. Of course there has been a royalties regime, of course there has been a right of access in contemporary Australian history in relation to minerals and other forms of energy, but there is a new challenge. This House would be derelict in its duty if it did not acknowledge the issue that coal-seam gas poses for farmers and their land. This bill does not deal with this issue, although my own view is that the right thing, the decent thing, the honourable thing would be for the gas companies to unilaterally agree on a moratorium on exploration or exploitation of resources unless there is consent from the landholder. That is a personal view and something that should be decided on at the level of each state, because the states have control over the land. It is something which the federal parliament can or should be doing, because we fundamentally believe in the rights of state governments to control their critical resources. But similarly, we think that responsible companies can and should make that agreement. Not everybody will be in accord with this view, but I have personally spoken with many of the players in the industry, the vast majority of whom have indicated strong in-principle support for this notion of a voluntary moratorium unless there is consent. Let's consider these resources, but let's recognise that the best way to deal with legitimate community and individual anxiety is to recognise that control, and the best people to do that are the key players in key companies who need to agree across the board that they will adopt a moratorium unless there is voluntarily given consent for either exploration or exploitation. That is the general principle. Given the presence in the chamber of the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, I repeat that it is my view and not a formal policy position that perhaps could be achieved on a bipartisan basis-that is, an agreement with the key exploration and exploitation companies in relation to coal seam gas where they impose upon themselves a voluntary moratorium on exploitation or exploration on individual plots of land unless there is consent. I respectfully say to Minister Burke that there is a strong readiness across the gas community to adopt this standard. I do not hold out that it is universal, but I do believe that good leadership can help bring this about by including the premiers of New South Wales and Queensland and leaders at the Commonwealth level. We would be happy to play our part. We do not seek to impose this standard, but we do think that there is a window of opportunity to bring it not to pass. I note that many of the critical players in the industry have recognised the legitimate community concern about farmers' land rights and they are looking at this standard. Perhaps over the coming months a voluntary agreement can be brought to pass. I turn to the bill which establishes the independent expert scientific committee on coal seam gas and large coal mining development. We agree with the purpose, because it is about providing adequate information as a precursor to understanding the impacts of coal seam gas on water resources. In order to do that, it establishes a scientific committee. In particular the key functions of the committee are, firstly, to advise on research priorities and, secondly, to advise on bioregional assessments, of which we are supportive, in areas of high potential impact from coal seam gas and to provide advice to the Commonwealth environment minister on priority assessment areas. Thirdly, to advise on research and bioregional assessments commissioned by the minister. Fourthly, to publish options on improving the consistency of research in this area. And, fifthly, to provide the Commonwealth minister and the relevant state or territory ministers with expert scientific advice on particular coal seam gas or large coal mining proposals that may have a significant impact on water resources. It also has a more general plenary power to advise as and when circumstances arise. The background to this is relatively clear. The technology to extract the gas from coal seams has been in existence for a long period. It has been through a transformative process over the last 15 years and the economics have changed in such a way that we now have a legitimate chance of providing significant revenue for Australia, revenue for rural communities and an additional competitively priced form of energy, whether it is for domestic use or export production. The industry is growing substantially. In Queensland alone the expectation, on the best available advice we have, is for 18,000 jobs and around $850 million in royalties per year. At a federal government level there is also income and company tax. But none of this is acceptable if it comes at the price of destruction of our fundamental water resources. Water is king-let us be absolutely clear on that. The standard we set is that we will not play dice with, risk or put on the table the safety or sanctity of our aquifers, the Great Artesian Basin or our subterranean water resources. That is a principle on which I believe there clear bipartisan agreement. To deal with this the committee is established as a precursor to other critical developments. It is a step toward providing comprehensive mapping of all of those areas which are likely to be the subject of consideration. Against that background, we are supportive of the bill; but we do have one proposed amendment. We are not going to hold a gun to the head of the government on this-we are dealing in good faith; but we ask the government to consider our amendment and approve it. The amendment will be moved by the member for Groom, Ian Macfarlane, who has a close personal connection with this issue not just as a Queenslander but as somebody who represents an area of Australia, in and around Toowoomba and the Darling Downs, which may well be subject to significant further proposals. It is his deep personal concern (a) about water resources and (b) about the rights of individual farmers which has led to that. The bill currently states that each member of the committee except the chair is to be appointed on the basis that they possess scientific qualifications that the minister considers relevant to the performance of the committee's functions including but not limited to ecology, geology, hydrology, hydrogeology, natural resource management and health. Our proposal, to be moved by the member for Groom, is that the committee's fundamental reason for being is to advise on scientific issues and therefore the bill should require that a majority of the members have advanced qualifications and expertise in the three key fields of geology, hydrogeology or hydrology. It is not a fundamental change. It is about providing more grunt and credibility to this committee. My request is that the government accept this proposal. We are willing to talk about any variations. This is is not an ambit claim; it is a legitimate proposal for improvement. We are committed to the notion of protecting water resources as a fundamental and, therefore, this can make a contribution. Then there is the question of access to the land, which was the subject of my earlier points. Farmers' rights are as critical as protection of aquifers, subterranean water and Great Artesian Basin resources. While this bill is not about farmers' rights, it is about the establishment of a committee to provide scientific advice. We believe that we need to work with the farming community, and I personally believe that the standard of voluntary consent should be what the industry settles upon for exploration and exploitation of these resources. That is a personal view-but I think there is an opportunity for the minister. We have met with coal seam gas companies and other companies considering entering this field and put it squarely to them that this is the standard which we think should be adopted. At this time there is a window of opportunity and I would commend that to the government and to the minister at the table. Having said that, this is a good bill. It is a good step forward. We commend it to the House and we are delighted to support it.",151
252,Mr NEUMANN,Unknown," I speak in support of this piece of legislation, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development) Bill 2012. My community, Ipswich, was built on coal mining. At one stage we had about 30 coal mines in Ipswich. Ipswich has also been the scene of some of the worse tragedies in Queensland with many deaths as result of the coal mining industry, including at Box Flat in the early 1970s where many men were killed. If you look at the crest of Ipswich will see 'Be confident when doing right' in Latin, but you will also see symbols of the coal mining industry. Coalmining has been a particularly important industry in Ipswich. Thousands of men, and some women as well, have worked in the industry, which is developing Ipswich and providing funds and employment for the local community. If you go to the heritage centre at Redbank Plains you will see the wonderful work done by the CFMEU to restore and remember Ipswich's coal mining history. There is still coal mining in the Ipswich and West Moreton region. There are two active New Hope coal mines near Rosewood, a rural township near Ipswich; Jeebropilly is one and New Oakleigh the other. They provide employment. When I first became a federal member there was some talk that all coal mines in Ipswich would be closed but in fact there has been an expansion of coal mining in the Ipswich and West Moreton region. If you look at any of the newspapers from around South-East Queensland-like the Fassifern Guardian, the Kilcoy Sentinel or the Gatton Star or the Toowoomba Chronicle in places like the Scenic Rim area, the Lockyer Valley, the rural parts of Ipswich, the Brisbane valley, the Kilcoy shire, or the Toowoomba and Darling Downs areas-you will see letters to the editor, press releases from politicians, and comments made by councillors and chambers of commerce. This is a very big issue. Coalmining and the coal seam gas industry is a controversial issue. I do not always agree with the member for Flinders, but his comment in relation to water is accurate. It is extremely important that we make sure we have a good, adequate and clean water supply not just for industry and agriculture but also for the consumersthe men and women, the mums and dads-in you these rural areas like Boonah, Gatton, Fernvale and Lowood, and major provincial cities in Queensland, like Toowoomba and Ipswich. In the last state election in Queensland we heard a lot of controversial statements and claims. We saw the new LNP government and the now Premier make a play for every side of the street on this particular issue, saying one thing to farmers and another to industry. When the Prime Minister was in Ipswich some time ago this issue was raised with her, and it is certainly an issue that been raised with me. There is great controversy around mining explorations and mining licences in and around Ipswich and Ebenezer, as well as Mount Mort, Mount Walker and other areas. I am aware of this as a local member, I am aware of this from my childhood and I am aware of this from my time working and living in Ipswich. This legislation goes towards addressing some of the community's concerns in relation to coal seam gas and large coal mining developments. To put it in its context, the community concerns could be expressed like this: there was talk some months ago around the upper part of the Brisbane Valley, where there are 900 people on the electoral roll in the rural township of Toogoolawah. In fact, about a quarter of the township came out one very cold and bitter night to talk about coal mining, the possibility of coal mining in the Brisbane Valley and its proximity to the Wivenhoe and Somerset dams. They expressed strong community concern and objection. I notice the Somerset Regional Council has also expressed its objection to large coal mining developments in and around the Brisbane Valley. Certainly, with its emphasis on tourism and agriculture, and its proximity to the water supply for Brisbane and Ipswich, large coal mining developments are not appropriate in the Brisbane Valley region. We have listened to what communities have said in South-East Queensland and elsewhere, and we are looking at introducing a new science based framework to provide some certainty for these communities, protecting the long-term health of our water supplies, making sure that the best scientific analysis and evidence can be given, and advice offered, to governments. I applaud the Prime Minister for announcing in November 2011 that the new independent expert scientific committee will be established in has relation to these issues. This will take some of the heat out of the issue-not all of it, of course, but some of it-and will make sure that people can rely on expert advice. They are concerned about the impact on water resources. They are concerned about what might happen in their region to biodiversity, conservation, the environment and protected species. They are concerned about all of these issues. This bill creates a new division under part 19 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, establishing a new statutory committee with responsibility for: research; advice on bioregional assessments, and on the impact of coal seam gas and large coal mining developments; advice on research and development commissioned by the minister for the environment following consideration of that committee's advice; and providing advice in a number of other areas as well. It provides for information on the comparability and consistency of research. We often have the coal seam gas industry commissioning expert advice and evidence, which is then contradicted by other people. This is about best practice. It is about making sure that we have listened to community concerns. It is about providing, by legislation, the creation of a new committee which will give that advice, making sure that the minister, while being accountable, open and transparent and while listening to local communities, has the best independent expert scientific advice on hand for coal seam gas and large coal mining developments. I think that will in some way assuage the concerns of people in the Ipswich and West Moreton regions. I know it will continue to be an issue. I know some farmers are supportive of these developments while others have tremendous hostility. We have seen a strange marriage of political alliance between the likes of Alan Jones and Bob Katter, and we have seen the Greens also involved in these things. We want to make sure that we can take the heat out of these issues. We want to make sure that the government makes good decisions, and that councils and state governments make good decisions, in relation to planning and development. We want to make sure that the kinds of decisions we make take into consideration the environment, the flora and fauna, the potential economic development of the industries and the employment opportunities. We also want to make sure that these decisions maintain the viability of these communities and the viability of an agricultural industry which, to Queensland, is particularly important. I am aware of this from living in Ipswich and I am aware of this from being a federal member. I commend the legislation to the House and I support it. Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom) (18:43): I rise today to speak on this bill, the substance of which has a significance well beyond this parliament. The bill in question, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development) Bill 2012, is one that formalises the plan to establish an independent expert scientific committee on coal seam gas and large coal mining development. As previous speakers have said, there is a level of community concern in relation to these developments, and I will come back to that in more detail. The role of this committee will be to provide scientific advice to governments on relevant coal seam gas and large coal mining projects, and to commission and fund water resource assessments for priority regions. The committee can advise on research priorities and bioregional assessment in areas of high potential impact, advise on research and bioregional assessment commissioned by the Commonwealth environment minister as a result of the committee's advice, publish options on improving the consistency of research in this area and publish information on developing leading standards in the protection of water resources from the impacts of coal seam gas and large coal developments. Also, the committee can provide the environment minister and relevant state or territory ministers with expert scientific advice on coal seam gas and large coal mining developments that may have a significant impact on water resources and can also provide advice outside the scope under certain circumstances. The coal seam gas industry both in Queensland and in New South Wales has been the subject of a lengthy debate in recent years, some of which has been guided by a genuine desire to balance the specifics of the burgeoning industry with the interests of preexisting industries, most importantly and most commonly agriculture. Unfortunately, some of the debate has been has not been quite so well intentioned and in some cases has been downright misleading and dishonest. The result is that many people who are not directly involved in the CSG industry have only ever heard the negatives about the industry. They do not hear about the jobs that CSG and coal are creating. They do not hear about the regional communities these industries are sustaining. I grew up in a regional community, and it is interesting that in my 14 years in politics, Bruce Scott, the member for Maranoa has been closing in on my boundaries because of a population drift in his electorate. We are now seeing that actually go the other way; his electorate, for the first time in many years, is growing. That is a direct result of the development of the coal seam in the area. We do not hear from the critics of these industries about the export revenue that the coal and coal seam industries are providing. All we hear are claims of division, about farmers who are steamrolled by ruthless mining companies hell-bent on making a profit no matter what the cost. I grew up in this region, I live in this region and I see sides. I was a farmer for longer than I have been a politician. I can assure you that, yes, there are areas of conflict and, yes, there are areas of difference. But in the main there is a resolve in the community to reach a point where these two industries, the agricultural industry and the mining and resource industry, can actually coexist. The reason is they have a shared interest not only in the long-term sustainability of the land-in terms of allowing, where it is possible, resource extraction; they also, more importantly, have a shared interest that that land continues to produce agricultural wealth for our nation. We see that cooperation between the rural industry-and farmers in particular-and the resource industry take place outside the spotlight. As I have noted elsewhere, this issue has been subjected to some of the most disingenuous manipulation that I have ever seen in my many years as a farmer, my fewer years as an agri-politician or my recent years as a politician. I know this area and this industry well. Agriculture is still running deep in my blood and it is in my soul that we do everything we can to ensure that that industry and its people have a future. But at the same time we owe these people, and more particularly their children, the opportunities that may exist in having these industries coexist. One of the pleasing things I see as a result of the so called coal seam boom is that parents are now seeing the opportunity for their children to travel away to university to gain degrees, to become trades people and then to return to their home district and have a future there amongst the family and friends they grew up with. Those ties always run deep. I had the opportunity a few weekends ago to go back to my home district. There is nothing like mixing with the people you both grew up with. Perhaps you do not know them as closely as you used to but there is a feeling of belonging. My district virtually has expired. There are now more people from my district living in Toowoomba than living in the district I grew up in. The one thing that will save districts like Boondooma from that sort of near extinction where the school closes and the community is almost in an idle is if the agricultural industry and the resource industry can coexist and come up with an agreement where the long-term future of agriculture is protected and the opportunities provided by the resource sector are optimised. The regulations surrounding the CSG industry and the coal industry fall primarily in the jurisdiction of our state governments-in these cases, primarily in New South Wales and Queensland. There has, however, always been an element of federal regulation as far as the EPBC Act applies, and recent developments mean there is added pressure on the federal government to expand its oversight role. The coalition believes that anything that further ensures the integrity of the industry and can address the issues of public confidence is a good thing. So we believe there is a role for this assessment panel and for the expertise it brings to this area. We are a little bit cautious that this process may bring an added level of red tape and convolution but we are prepared to give it a shot on the basis that we see the merit in it. We need to work with the state governments, which are at the moment trying to balance the interests of mining and agriculture and ensure that the states' prime farming land is safeguarded for the long term future. Both states are taking their responsibilities seriously and I think we can have faith in the processes both Queensland and New South Wales governments are putting in place. I do expect, however, that the Greensdriven protest movement will continue. The Greens have capitalised on the campaigning opportunities of stirring up anti-CSG and anticoalmining sentiment, and there are legitimate concerns within the farming communities about the long-term impacts of these industries. These concerns need to be and hopefully will be addressed by this committee. We have seen, though, that at times federal red tape with the environment minister basically ties projects up. We have a recent example where the Queensland government has approved the expansion of bauxite mining on Cape York but that whole process has been tied down by the federal minister's unwillingness to make a decision when he has been fed an absolute bucketload of misinformation by the Greens. He wants to go back through that information, and I could bet that that information is going to prove to be untrue. It is a good example of how the green movement uses these sorts of genuine processes to slow everything down to a point where they try and destroy development. The legitimate concerns of the farmers, who are the custodians of productive farming land for generations to come, need to be addressed. And the incorrect claims that are made by those who have no interest in sustainable development also need to be addressed and proven incorrect or correct, one way or the other. That is not to say that there are not parts of rural industry that be deemed off limits. Both the coalition leader and I have said quite clearly that, while it is beyond our immediate power, the preservation of prime agricultural land is of top priority and that the owners of that land should have the right to say no to development on their land. As such, some land will be deemed off limits, but that is a good thing in terms of maintaining productivity in the long-term interests of Australia. This committee gives us a good opportunity to balance the interests of mining and farming sectors, to the benefit of both, and to ensure the harmonisation of the state system so that stakeholders know exactly where they stand. To this end, the coalition supports this bill and provides in principle support for the establishment of the committee, subject to an amendment which I will outline during the detailed reading stage. While the potential economic benefits of these industries are clear, with around 90 per cent of Queensland's gas supplies already coming from CSG operations and with the industry expected to deliver 18,000 jobs and around $850 million in royalties per year in Queensland alone, there is a very significant concern that we get this system to work properly and in a way which not only allows those jobs and that return to the state to take place but also ensures the protection of ground and surface water systems. The establishment of this committee will add, in our opinion, independent expert input to the debate about coal seam gas extraction and export and about coalmine development and the export of coal. The committee is a positive step towards improving public confidence in the environmental integrity of these two industries in particular, and the coalition will not stand in its way. The coalition sees the benefit in this. There is a requirement that we in parliament will ensure that public confidence in the processes is maintained and that, where it can be, it is improved. There is a vast amount of information available in relation to coal seam development and underground water in particular that needs to be collated, verified and put in a form that can be used both for assessing applications to explore and develop but also for disseminating to those farmers who have concerns. They are the custodians of this land for generations to come and they need to have confidence that the information they are getting is correct and can be relied on.  to voice my support for the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seem Gas and Large Coal Mining Development) Bill 2012. This does not happen too often but I would like to commend the member for Groom for his relentlessly sensible comments on this legislation. As a former mining minister and as someone who has always been passionate about both farming and mining, he understands the intersection between these two, at times competing, interests. I hope his voice of reason is the voice that rules those opposite. I can remember not that long ago when the Leader of the Opposition made the commitment to Alan Jones that he would 'lock the gate'-which is actually a change in the property rights of landholders, a change from the idea of the Crown owning minerals. I know the Leader of the Opposition did retreat a little bit from that. Alan Jones particular vested interest on this issue because his home town is now a coalmine and he is quite upset about it. In fact, we have such an unholy alliance on this issue: Alan Jones, the Greens and Bob Katter all together on the same ticket. That shows you how bizarre this can be. But that Alan Jones interview when the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, said that, yes, it would be okay on occasions to lock the gate, showed that-come the moment, come the right goading from someone like Alan Jones-he will say anything and do anything if he thinks it will win him a vote. Nevertheless, I come with a bit of authority on mining, having worked for two mining ministers and for the Queensland Resources Council. The council has seen incredible change in the coal seam gas developments over the last 10 years, from a state government policy from Peter Beattie that some say was developed literally on the back of a napkin. There has been an incredible change in the companies providing energy in Queensland and the companies providing jobs and revenue for the state of Queensland. Obviously there are no coal seam gas developments in my electorate of Moreton, but many of my constituents are very concerned about this issue. Some are very enthusiastic about the legislation we are discussing tonight, because they are concerned about the impacts on farming communities. There are others who do a lot of business with mining and coal seam gas developments, companies such as Hastings Deering, Komatsu and the Bradken foundry, which is one of the world's best makers of specialised mining equipment. This is important legislation and the benefits of coal seam gas and coal mining development are undeniable with job opportunities of up to 18,000 jobs for Queensland and revenue of up to $850 has a million for Queensland that will help much of Australia, Queensland especially, and some communities particularly. Debate interrupted. NA Selection Committee Report",154
253,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," I present the Report No. 52 of the Selection Committee relating to the consideration of committee and delegation business and private members business on Monday, 28 May 2012. NA The DEPUTY SPEAKER Order! I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Olympic Dam",159
254,Mr BRIGGS,Unknown," I rise this evening to talk about an extremely important issue in my home state of South Australia. The House would be aware that some months ago the South Australian parliament in a largely bipartisan move passed legislation to give the green light to the expansion of the Olympic Dam mine at Roxby Downs in South Australia. Most members are aware that the proposed expansion of that site is so exceptional that will be a huge boon for future generations of South Australians. It is the fourth largest copper resource, the largest known deposit of uranium and has rich deposits of silver and gold. The expansion will create one of the world's largest open pit mines. By 2050 the size of the pit will grow to be 4.1 kilometres long, 3.5 kilometres wide and one kilometre deep-basically the square mile of Adelaide. It will take about six years of mining to remove the 350-metre thick layer of overburden and expose the upper surface of the ore body. It will employ some 4,000 to 6,000 additional people and, over the long term, see a doubling of the existing operational workforce to 8,000 people. It is expected that the flow-on effect will create some 15,000 jobs in South Australia. The royalty revenue from the expansion so far averages about $60 million a year from the Olympic Dam project and this is expected to increase four-fold on the completion of the expanded operation. Independent economic analysis of the project's impact on South Australia's economy estimates it will add more than $45 billion to the gross state product over the life of the mine and it is expected that when the (19:00): mine reaches full production, the South Australia's GSP would be an estimated 8.7 per cent higher in annual average terms compared to the business-as-usual case projection. It was largely a bipartisan state parliament decision last year-except for the Greens, of course, who opposed the expansion of the Olympic Dam-and South Australians hope that it will go ahead when the BHP board decides on this sometime later this year. But significant threats have emerged that the BHP board is now considering seriously, which put this project in the near future in it doubt. I think that it is high time that this parliament and particularly the government very quickly addresses those threats to ensure that the benefits of this expansion, so well known particularly for South Australia, can go ahead. Last week Jac Nasser, the chairman of the BHP board, one of Australia's most wellrespected businesspeople, made a comprehensive speech in which he talked about the challenges that the resource sector in Australia now faces. Those on the other side would have you believe that there is no competition in the global resource market, that Australia has it cornered. Of course that is not true. We compete like any other industry and it is a tough competitive market. The chairman of the BHP board last week made it very clear that there are four factors which have changed and which are making it harder for this project to go ahead: high investing and operating costs, making us one of the highest cost economies in the world, soon to be made worse by the biggest carbon tax in the world; cost increases due to the industrial relations environment and in particular union militancy; the uncertainty in relation to taxation laws-and I quote Mr Nasser here: It is the right of governments to set the tax regime but I cannot overstate how the level of uncertainty about Australia's tax system is generating negative investor reaction. And finally, there is global volatility. Three of the four issues are directly the responsibility of this federal government. Mr Nasser went on to make clear that these factors will be considered consideration is given by the board to the $20 billion expansion. He said: We are fortunate to have a diversified portfolio of choices. Given our range of options, if we can't meet our criteria in any one project, product or geography, we will redirect our capital somewhere else or we simply won't invest at all. This is not code; it could not be clearer. It is a real and present danger to this project going ahead. The question has to be asked: why would the government be trying to openly hold back our best performing industry? It is like running Black Caviar at Royal Ascot and putting Fat Albert on as the jockey. Black Caviar would not win, and neither will we win the race for investment. Costs in Australian mining have risen too fast and too far and now investment is at risk. There is no bigger threat than that to the expansion of Olympic Dam. The chairman of Rio Tinto backed those comments up recently in the Australian Financial Review when he said: ... are you worried about your over-exposure to Australia... That's not a good thing, that's a damning testimonyIt certainly is. This government must stop the carbon tax. They must take away the regulation burden of the workplace relations reregulation that they have made. Otherwise it will be on their head if Olympic Dam does not go ahead. (Time expired) National Volunteer Week",160
255,Ms GRIERSON,Unknown," I rise to acknowledge the valuable contribution made by volunteers to the local community in my electorate of Newcastle. We all know that volunteers contribute over 700 million hours and $14.6 billion to the not-for-profit sector each year. These are remarkable statistics of commitment and of value and worth. It is always important, therefore, to take the time to recognise the when importance of volunteering to our communities and to our Australian society. During National Volunteer Week last week, I had the great privilege and pleasure of attending volunteering ceremonies held by local organisations, in particular, the Northern Settlement Services Volunteers Appreciation Morning Tea and the Launch of the 2012 Red Shield Appeal, an appeal that depends on the committed work of many volunteers around the nation. At the Northern Settlements Services it was wonderful to see young African migrants, refugees, being assisted to attain studies and drivers licences, and gain computer skills. This is wonderful work that is helping people who come to this nation with a distinct disadvantage. I am also the patron of the Hunter New England Mental Health Volunteer Service and I am very proud to be associated with the great work done by our local volunteers in that capacity. This organisation has around 80 volunteers across the Hunter-New England area who assist in improving the journey of recovery for those touched by mental illness in our community. While I was unable personally to attend the celebration morning tea during National Volunteer Week, my staff represented me at that event and reported that it was a great showcase of the wonderful things that our mental health volunteers are doing. So I give a big thank you all round. Since we were elected to government in 2007, federal Labor has provided over $425,000 under the FaHCSIA Volunteer Grants Program to over 31 local organisations in Newcastle. Although those grants are small they are very much welcomed by each organisation. This funding has helped to purchase much needed equipment for use by volunteers or to reimburse expenses incurred by volunteers who so generously donate their time to assisting others. For example, $4,500 was provided to Grandparents as Parents, or GAPS, which is a fabulous group operating in my electorate. GAPS provides assistance and support for grandparents and other family members who act as carers for young relatives. The funding was directed to support GAPS in organising events and helping kinship carers to access welfare and advocacy services. A further $4,695 was granted to the Hunter African Communities Council to assist in providing a support network to migrants of Ethiopian descent who have settled in our city of Newcastle. From facilitating participation in local sporting social activities to assisting residents to access support services, this is a volunteer organisation that is truly promoting social inclusion in my electorate. While these funding commitments have had a significant impact and facilitate the wonderful work in our local community, it is also important to encourage and reward volunteering for the enrichment it provides to our social fabric. It is in pursuit of this goal that I recently called once more for nominations for the Newcastle Community Volunteer Awards. Held annually since 2004, those awards are a gesture of recognition and sincere thanks to ordinary people in my electorate who make extraordinary contributions in our community. As a testament to the strength of the volunteering community in Newcastle, I have proudly presented over 530 community volunteer awards to individuals and organisations from all sectors: from providers of aged care and disability services to those involved in education, sport and recreation. The community in Newcastle is richer for the ongoing dedication, commitment and enthusiasm of our volunteers. I am always astounded by the stories behind each and every one of the recipients and also of the way everyone says, 'Oh no, I did not do anything.' Their modesty and humility are quite overwhelming. I would particularly like to acknowledge the work of the Hunter Volunteer Centre, currently under the guidance of manager Tony Ross, in assisting to make the awards ceremony a success, year in and year out. This year the theme for the National Volunteers Week was 'Volunteers-Every One Counts'. This is so true, and I know that all members in this House understand and appreciate the work of volunteers in their and communities. They really do make a difference. They really are special. I look forward to reading the stories that accompany the applications for the 2012 Newcastle Community Volunteer Awards as they start to flow in over the coming weeks. I take this opportunity to encourage anyone who knows of any Novocastrians who do volunteer to get into contact with my office for a nomination form. So do dob in a volunteer and help to recognise the work they selflessly do for others. Longman Electorate: Volunteers WYATT ROY (Longman) (19:11): I acknowledge the member for Newcastle. We all acknowledge the importance of volunteers across our nation. Last week as part of National Volunteers Week, I held the Longman awards to celebrate achievers in the Longman community. On Friday night, 60 individuals were recognised for their work. I would like to take this opportunity to share with the House the stories of the finalists from the Longman awards. A young man from Burpengary Meadows State School single-handedly raised $600 for cancer research as part of this year's Shave for a Cure. This young man, Billy Setter, won the Youth Achievement Award. Billy's remarkable determination and effort is a lesson to all of us. Our other young finalists have also achieved great things-Brooke Tytherleigh in her dancing; Daniel Thompson, Jayden Donald and Kaylee MCKeown in their sports achievements. My region has many talented young athletes including Benjamin Brown, Braden Lockyer, Troy Guenther, Jessica Bayliss and Mitchell De Rossi. One person stood out from the crowd that were nominated for the sports achievement award. That was a young lady by the name of Nicola Crook. Nicola is not only an exceptional team player chosen to play representative softball at the national level but she also plays a valuable role in mentoring the next generation of sports stars by coaching young softball teams. Nicola's willingness to pass on her invaluable skills the kind of positive sport role model that other young sports stars should be able to look up to, and was the basis for her winning the Sports Achievement Award. Another community role model is Howard Walter, winner of the Volunteer Achievement Award. Walter is affectionately known as the mayor of Wamuran for his indefatigable commitment to the Wamuran community. Howard retired in 1999, only to become Treasurer of the Wamuran Sporting Association and to volunteer with Neighbourhood Watch as a 'blockie'. Howard gives freely of his time, expecting nothing in return, and is the epitome of a community achiever. The list of volunteers who were nominated for this year's awards and their many years of service to the community are simply phenomenal. I would like to recognise the efforts of: Kim Barton, Jenny Butler, Fay Cartiridge, Ellen Corrick, Noelene Davis, Betty Farren-Price, Dale Hennessey, Margaret Kelly, Leonie MCGee, Tony Moronejt or 'Top Hat', Janette Norquay, Coral Padget, Heather Phillips, Ken Piva, Cluny Seager, Dawn Sharp, Shirley Styman, Lesley Timmers, Christine Tindall, Jenny Tompkins, Anthony Vohland, Jenny Walters, Nonie Watt and Bette Webb. Longman is home to some of the most dedicated and committed environmental groups in our region. This year's Environmental Achievement Award went to the Wallum Action Group for their endeavour to support revegetation of the region with native plants, but also because of the financial support that the group provides to other local environmental groups through their sale of native plants. Without this financial support, many of the other groups such as one of the other finalists, Bribie and District Wildlife Rescue, could not continue is to do the wonderful things that they do. It is also important to acknowledge the volunteers in these environmental groups who make it all happen, including our environmental award finalists, Alan Kerr, Robbie Thompson and Wal Corney, as well as our ecowarriors, Anna and Connor MCHugh. This year the Longman Awards included a Small Business Achievement category. This was a chance to recognise those local businesses who feel that part of their responsibility is to give back to the community that supports them. Our finalists, Martin Jonkers Motors and the Abbey Museum of Art and Archaeology, both deserve to be recognised for the ways that they quietly give back. So too does Devin's Windscreens, which was awarded Small Business Achievement winner. Devin and his team work with the Queensland department of justice to give at-risk youth second chance, an opportunity to learn new skills and a brighter future. One of the most touching stories was that of Dawn Worley, who was this year's Seniors Achievement Award winner. Dawn has worked tirelessly for the past four to establish Dragons Abreast Bribie Island, group which facilitates dragon boat racing a physical therapy for breast cancer survivors. The paddling involved in dragon boat racing provides important exercise of the muscles, and by establishing this group Dawn has been instrumental in creating a support network for the individuals, families and friends of breast cancer survivors. Dawn has touched the lives of many survivors, helping them through what can only be described as the most difficult challenge of their lives. Dawn is not alone; Doris Thwaite, George Grant, Janet Ross and Margaret Courtney were all also worthy finalists in this category. This year many community groups were put forward to be acknowledged under community group achievements. The Going Cheap Project, the Pinkaboutit team, Global Care Bribie Island, Lions Club of Narangba, Pink Pythons Under 15s and the Wamuran and District Men's Shed are all doing fantastic things for our community. I want take this opportunity to thank my community for the opportunity to humbly represent them. (Time expired) Budget",161
256,Dr LEIGH,Unknown," On 17 April this year the member for North Sydney travelled to London where he gave a speech in which he said that Hong Kong's government debt was 'moderate'. That speech pointed out that Hong Kong's gross government debt was then 34 per cent of GDP. As Simon Howson pointed out to me, a given that Australia's gross government debt will peak at 18 per cent of GDP, the only appropriate word for Australia's debt levels is 'low'. Australia's net debt as a share of GDP will peak at 9.6 per cent of GDP. That is like somebody earning $100,000 and years owing $9,600. This debt was, of course, a taken on in order to save jobs-200,000 of as them, and tens of thousands of small businesses. Late last year, Australian banks were actually concerned that there were too few Australian government bonds in the market for them to meet the Basel III requirements. They were concerned that the Australian government had too little debt, and relative to other major advanced economies that is indeed the case-Australia's debt levels will peak at one-tenth of the average in major advanced economies. But now the coalition appears set to stand against an increase in Australia's debt ceiling, to stand against an increase in Australia's debt limit. I want to use the opportunity tonight to inform the House as to the consequences of this reckless action. Rob Nicholl, head of the Australian Office of Financial Management has told the government: Any uncertainty whatsoever as to the Government's ability to undertake normal debt to management operations would create widespread and potentially serious negative speculation, this in turn creating unfavourable perceptions on the part of the investment community. Mr Nicholl told the government: With increasing scrutiny of, and interest in, the market for CGS, it is critical to maintain a clear and unambiguous signal that debt market operations will not be impeded … We are raising the debt limit for two reasons. The first is that revenues tend to come in later in the year and payments are made throughout the year, so government needs to meet the gap through temporary further issuance in short-term markets. The second is to manage maturity of long-term bonds outstanding. Prior to their maturity, the Australian Office of Financial Management has to accumulate enough money to pay out the long-term bond holders because not enough tax receipts have yet flowed in. So for a little while we have twice the amount of bonds on issue before we pay off the first lot of long-term bonds. While the budget papers show that Commonwealth government securities on issue will be under the existing limit, fluctuations require us to raise the debt cap. This is, of course, sound economic management, as Paul Krugman pointed out during the US fight over the debt: … since debt is the consequence of decisions about taxing and spending, and Congress already makes those taxing and spending-decisions, why require an additional vote on debt? And traditionally the debt limit his been treated as a minor detail. But not so under the wrecking ball approach of those opposite. As Stephen Koukoulas has observed: Think back to what happened mid last year. Congress was going to block a required increase in the US debt ceiling. The US government was going to miss its bills. I don't want to overstate it, but things got pretty ugly... Around 80 per cent of our bond market is held by foreigners. We can't afford to alienate these people by playing silly buggers with the ceiling. The approach that the coalition is taking over the debt limit is an approach that is aimed at convincing investors that Australia is no longer a responsible country. As Mike Konczal of the Roosevelt Institute puts it, the approach of the US Republicans, which is effectively the approach of those opposite, is to come around with baseball bats declaring: 'Nice economy you have here. A real shame if something happened to it'. Raising the debt limit is sensible economic management. Those opposite, including the member for North Sydney, have called for more 30-year bonds. He has spoken overseas about the 'moderate' debt of a country with nearly twice Australia's debt levels, and yet here, as Stephen Koukoulas has said, … the opposition is willing to risk overseas investor confidence in Australia for the sake of a cheap political point. The opposition should stop playing politics with the debt ceiling and start focusing on the national economic interest. Gold Coast: Commonwealth Games 2018 Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (19:21): Many Gold Coast residents and Queenslanders will remember that great day in November last year when we heard that the Gold Coast will host the 2018 Commonwealth Games. The Commonwealth Games offers a fantastic opportunity for the Gold Coast to revitalise both its tourism and construction industries. Both industries in recent years have experienced a downturn, for a variety of reasons, and the Gold Coast unemployment rate is still higher than the national average; therefore, the announcement of the games comes at a time when it is essential that steps are taken to create more jobs on the Gold Coast and create more local wealth for employees and small businesses alike. With this in mind, we need to have an approach for the whole of the Gold Coast not just the northern Gold Coast, to ensure that the benefits created by the games and the period of time before and after the event are spread evenly. Although the northern end of the Gold Coast has a number of the facilities required to effectively host many of the individual events, it does not mean that the southern Gold Coast, where my electorate is based, should be excluded from hosting some of them. Information currently available indicates that the road racing event is to be held in Elanora and Currumbin Valley, with the Rugby Sevens competition to be held at Skilled Park stadium in Robina. However, other events, like the triathlon, can easily held amongst much of the beautiful scenery-including some of our many beaches-that is abundant on the southern Gold Coast. The risk that is taken by centralising many events, including many important facilities such as the athletes' village on the northern end of the Gold Coast, is that the southern economy will not reap the benefits. Small businesses are struggling due to lower expenditure from locals, and tourists and many hospitality operators on the southern Gold Coast are still suffering from low tourist numbers. When major events are being held it provides these businesses with the opportunity to get more customers through the door, due to their proximity to the events. To highlight an example, the Cooly Rocks On festival, the successor to the Wintersun festival, delivers a much-needed injection to the southern Gold Coast economy, with accommodation being booked out and many small businesses in the Coolangatta area attracting many more customers than usual. This means more jobs and more wealth in the local community. Although the games are still nearly six years away, we should be taking advantage of this opportunity right now to promote the whole of the Gold Coast. It is such a great location to live and holiday. Other benefits from hosting events on the southern Gold Coast would come from the construction of improved infrastructure that would be required for the transportation of visitors and facilitation of events. Much of the facilities and infrastructure required to host major sporting events that will be part of the games program is currently located on the northern end of the Gold Coast, with the exception of Skilled Park in Robina. However, there is no reason that, in the six-year period between now and the games, existing infrastructure be cannot be improved. That will allow for more events to be held down on the southern end of the Gold Coast. In the long run, the benefits would mean that southern Gold Coast residents would have better infrastructure at their disposal and could potentially host more major events in the years ahead, generating more local wealth. The Commonwealth Games present the Gold Coast with a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and we need to ensure that all is being done to take advantage of not only the event but also the consequential benefits. It is important that we spread the benefits. We do not want a disproportionate amount of money and resources being spent on the northern end of the Gold Coast while the southern end of the Gold Coast is forgotten. I urge the new Commonwealth Games Board to do what it can to ensure that the southern Gold Coast plays an equal role in the delivery of the games so that all Gold Coast residents can enjoy and benefit from, what I know, will be a fantastic milestone in the Gold Coast's history. Reid Electorate: Railways",164
257,Mr MURPHY,Unknown," The expansion and electrification of railways is one of the more effective means of reducing carbon dioxide emissions and reducing road congestion and the unending road toll. With these advantages in mind, our government has committed $840 million toward the Northern Sydney Freight Corridor project that runs from Strathfield in my electorate to Newcastle. It is a forward-looking plan that will, amongst other benefits, result in more than 200,000 heavy vehicles being taken off the road each year, a reduction in the consumption of expensive, imported diesel fuel by 40 million litres per year and a reduction in annual greenhouse gas emissions of 100,000 tons. In my electorate this project will see a new rail underpass for freight trains at North Strathfield, a new track connected to the existing relief goods loop line at North Strathfield and 2.4 kilometres of new track, and the upgrade of 850 metres of existing track. Under the previous Howard government Australian railways entered a very dark age that, with the exception of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway, saw tracks torn up, services abandoned, freight wagons cut up and, in New South Wales, 60 serviceable electric locomotives scrapped. Responsible governments around the world are implementing measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions-in particular, expanding railway electrification. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, transport produces one-sixth of Australia's carbon dioxide emissions and, due in part to the Howard government's policies of expanding road freight at the expense of railways, emissions from the transport industry were 29 per cent higher in 2008 than in 1990. As we know, the Leader of the Opposition said in his inaugural speech in this place, 'The government's job is not to lay rails, earth and pour concrete,' so no-one should be under any illusion that an Abbott government would ever have undertaken an important initiative like the Northern Sydney Freight Corridor project. Following the oil shocks of the 1970s, engineers in the United States and other countries investigated railway electrification as a means of reducing dependence on oil. They found advantages that include lower running costs and lower maintenance costs of locomotives and multiple units, a higher power-to-weight ratio resulting in fewer locomotives required, faster acceleration, higher practical limit of power and a higher speed limit. Other benefits include quieter operation, independence from interruptions to oil supplies and lower carbon dioxide pollution. Despite these evident benefits the Howard government, in its amalgamation of Australian National Railways and the New South Wales railways' FreightCorp collaborated in scrapping or mothballing 10 type 85 class and 50 type 86 class electric locomotives worth hundreds of millions of dollars that had previously served the New South Wales railways well. Among the consequences of this extraordinary act of vandalism was that freight operators on New South Wales railways, always short of motive power, were forced to import 16 second hand diesel locomotives from Denmark. Numbers of worn out and decrepit diesel locomotives, well past their intended useful life, have been returned to service and can regularly be seen hooked together as multiple units struggling to haul strings of freight cars that were formerly pulled by a single, powerful electric locomotive. The diesel locomotives that now haul freight trains through my electorate produce serious noise and exhaust pollution that directly shift affects many people who live near railway lines where freight trains operate. Worse, as an increasing number of freight trains use the Northern Sydney Freight Corridor, the impact of these locomotives will only intensify unless electric locomotives are recommissioned to replace the decrepit diesels that now pump out toxic emissions and noise into the environment. In concluding, in spite of the best efforts of the Howard government, a significant number of electric locomotives do survive hidden away in various depots and sidings. I have no doubt that many of these clean, quiet and powerful machines could be returned to service to the benefit of those constituents who live alongside rail corridors in my electorate. I will have more to say on this in the near future, because the enemy, time, has beaten me tonight. (Time expired) Friendly Faces Helping Hands",166
258,Mr COULTON,Unknown," One of the most traumatic things that can happen to a family from a regional or country area is to have a sudden illness or injury inflicted on their family. Quite often this involves a very quick trip to a city to a large hospital for treatment. One of the problems when these people get to the city area is that they are in a completely unfamiliar area in unfamiliar surroundings and they are at a loss to know where to go to find the services that they need. One of these people is a constituent of mine, a young lady by the name of Kelly Foran. Kelly Foran has had a series of health issues, not only for herself but also for members of her family-multiple issues that would lay most people low and probably suffering from self-pity. Kelly Foran has built on her own experiences and is working very hard to help others in the position that she found herself in. She has actually formed an organisation called Friendly Faces Helping Hands. This is a multifaceted thing-from a website which has been designed to printed information that is placed in doctors surgeries and with a phone backup service. Friendly Faces Helping Hands lists common sense services that people may need to find-for instance, where you can find cheap parking near large metropolitan hospitals, where you can find affordable accommodation, where the social workers are located in the hospital, where you can buy nappies after hours and how you can get there by public transport; a whole range of things that if you find yourself on a very quick trip to an unfamiliar area you just do not know. Kelly has been running this pretty well on her own with some donations from family, friends and community members. She has grown this to a situation now where she has information on the larger hospitals in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. She has helped countless people with what she is doing. Kelly does this from the little community of Maules Creek, which is out from Narrabri in north-west New South Wales. Last week I raised with the health minister what Kelly has been doing. There are government websites to help people who are in this position but they mainly deal with government services. There is nothing comparable to what Friendly Faces Helping Hand does and the broader, more practical, common sense approach that it takes. So on Kelly's behalf I made a request to the health minister for some financial assistance so that Kelly can grow Friendly Faces Helping Hands into a more sustainable-type unit and so she does not have to eat into her own personal savings in order for this service to continue and be expanded, I believe, to a nation-wide website that can help people all across Australia. I am hopeful that the health minister will look upon this favourably. She certainly gave me a great hearing when I spoke to her last week. As I know from personal experience, to have to travel to a larger city hospital, quite often under rushed circumstances, can be very difficult. (Time expired) Public Education Day Calwell Electorate: Broadmeadows Jobs and Skills Expo",168
259,Ms VAMVAKINOU,Unknown," Before I begin, I just want the House to note that today is Public Education Day. I would like to wish all of the public schools in my electorate a very happy Public Education Day and also to welcome the Australian Education Union, who are here with us in parliament this week, and to congratulate them on their unwavering dedication to promoting the cause of public education in Australia. Last Wednesday I attended a Jobs and Skills Expo in my electorate, along with the Minister for Human Services, Senator Kim Carr, and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relation, Mr Bill Shorten. This is a wonderful initiative implemented by this government as part of our commitment to helping people find employment by linking job seekers with prospective employers. Also, it gives young job seekers and even school students the opportunity to get to know what kinds of job prospects, as well as training opportunities, are available to them. Looking for a job or deciding on a career option can be very daunting for people, especially young people, so a jobs expo provides a one-stop shop. The one in my electorate was, I think, about the 50th such jobs expo that has taken place around the country. I welcomed the minister-who is here, doing a great job. The jobs expo generated a very high level of interest, with many constituents coming into my office to ask for information days before the event actually took place. Its importance lies in the opportunity that it gives job seekers to submit resumes and to speak directly to employers as well as training organisations. Put simply, the expo is a big jobs and skills marketplace where job seekers of all ages and skill levels are connected with a number of employers, employment service providers, recruitment agencies and registered training organisations. Of course, all this happens under one roof and in one day. In fact, some of our local participants described it as a case of job seekers being able to do as much as six weeks worth of job searching in one day at the expo. While unemployment rates in some regions across Australia have improved, there is more work to be done in many places, including in Melbourne's northern and western suburbs. When one takes into account that about 940,000 people live in the north-western suburbs of Melbourne, a jobs expo goes a long way in encouraging people to seek employment and better their qualifications. The Broadmeadows expo allowed constituents the opportunity to take advantage of more than 960 job prospects on offer, encouraged more than 1,300 resumes to be submitted and allowed the 85 exhibitors to directly interact with prospective employees. The exhibitors told me that as a result of the expo as many as 441 job seekers would be placed in jobs. It is important to get the message out that it is never too late to reskill or engage in the workforce, and the expo was a vehicle that helped many people in my electorate to take the first step. To further encourage participation, exhibiting at the expo was free. As a result, it attracted the attention of a range of employers, including some of the big employers, and I would like to mention them here this evening: BAE Systems, which is a major supplier to the Australian Defence Force; Grocon, Australia's largest privately owned development and construction company, which has-as you would know, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke-built the iconic structures of the Rialto Towers in Melbourne; Bowens Timber and Building Supplies; Bunnings; the Trade Institute of Victoria; Victoria Police; and, of course, Woolworths. At the jobs expo, a further very important announcement was made: that up to 800 families would receive computers thanks to a partnership between the Australian government and WorkVentures. Senator Kim Carr made the announcement on the day, and the partnership entails the Department of Human Services supplying laptops to the not-for-profit organisation WorkVentures. These laptops are refurbished and sold at a discount price to people from low socio-economic backgrounds. partnership is a win for everyone. It will help people who are at risk of social exclusion as a result of not having the benefits of technology. I want to thank the chief executive officer of WorkVentures, Mr Arsenio Alegre, who is thoroughly and utterly committed to being involved in this project. He believes that everyone should have access to the benefits of technology and no-one should be disadvantaged as a result of their socio-economic status. North West Rail Link",169
260,Mr HAWKE,Unknown," I rise tonight to condemn the recent decision by Infrastructure Australia to advise the government to reject a request from the New South Wales government to fund the North West rail line. I want to make it clear from the beginning that this is against the express advice of the New South Wales government, the facts available on Sydney infrastructure in recent years and the quality of applications that have been made. In fact, this casts a bad light on the government's new policy of having a national infrastructure body to determine priorities according to need, not according to political priorities. It is a fact, of course, that this Labor government has not spent a single dollar on funding for infrastructure in metropolitan Sydney-not a single dollar. We are all aware of the debacle of the funding for a study for a metro line, only for it to have to be handed back by a state Labor government incompetent to administer anything. However, that should not penalise an entire city for all time. The north-west is well regarded as one of Sydney's and the nation's fastest growing regions. This rail network that the state government is planning for will improve congestion and take about 40,000 passengers down the North West rail line from the Western, Richmond and Northern lines, This easing overcrowding for commuters in those areas of Sydney. It will support about 16,000 jobs and inject $25 billion into the state's economy. It is regarded as the single largest tunnel rail project in Australia's history. I have spoken to the New South Wales state government and looked at what the record of this has been. I want to record for the House in the strongest possible terms that the Premier, Barry O'Farrell, met with the federal Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the member for Grayndler, and informed him of the New South Wales government's determination to deliver the North West rail line as a priority. The Premier, Barry O'Farrell, has written to the transport minister asking that he join the New South Wales government and find a way for the Commonwealth to help fund the North West rail line. The Premier has met with the Prime Minister to outline how the North West rail line is a priority for New South Wales and metropolitan Sydney. The very Premier has written to the Prime Minister requesting that she directly fund the North West rail line. Despite this unquestionable need for the rail link and despite the clear position of the New South Wales government, this government has allocated funding to an Epping to Parramatta rail line. It is now well established, of course, that this proposal was a last-minute promise by the Labor government in the lead-up to the 2010 election. This pre-election offer was made just 10 days prior to the last consultation and with no submission before the federal government to Infrastructure Australia. The New South Wales government, in contrast, submitted a 2,200page environmental impact statement which included all the benefits this North West rail line project will bring to the community, and it was told that not enough work had been put into this 2,200-page submission. Contrast that with the New South Wales Labor government submitting five pages of information to the federal government seeking funding for a scoping study on the Parramatta to Epping rail line. Well, lo and behold, this government, with a five-page submission, got $2.1 billion in the 2010-11 mid-year economic forecasts from 2014 onwards; yet a 2,200 page submission with an EIS has been knocked back by this federal government and Infrastructure Australia. The hypocrisy is absolutely astounding. Given that Labor has built no infrastructure in metropolitan Sydney for the last four years, this playing politics with rail lines in the nation's biggest city has to come to an end. I also want to record tonight that we have a break in the clouds on the horizon. The member for Greenway, Michelle Rowland, has come forward and said that she opposes Infrastructure Australia's decision to revise against the funding for the North West rail line. I will quote from page 3 of the Rouse Hill Times of 9 May: ""There is no argument it has to be built"" she said. ""It will be regardless. It is Barry's holy grail, which I fully support."" Clearly, the member for Greenway sees the North West rail line as a vital piece of rail infrastructure that will service not just her own electorate but also my electorate and the people of north-west Sydney and provide the best bang for the buck in the Sydney election, without metropolitan area. That is why I am going to be calling upon this House and the government to allocate the $2.1 billion that is in the mid-year economic forecasts of 2010-11 for the 2014 year for the Parramatta to Epping rail line to be reallocated to the New South Wales government to make their determination about what is the most important rail priority. Given the member for Greenway's comments, I am going to be asking her to join me in this call, ensuring that both of our electorates are well looked after and this money is well allocated on the right projects based on transport priorities and not political circumstance. Sydney is sick of rail line politics. It was 16 years under a previous Labor state administration. We now have a federal Infrastructure Australia body. We now have the ability to ensure that this most important rail line project in metropolitan Sydney and in the country is well funded, built on time and enhances our transport situation in a congested city. Australian Public Service",170
261,Ms BRODTMANN,Unknown," I rise once again to defend the Australian Public Service against continued attacks from several fronts. For the past two decades, and now as the federal member for Canberra, I have been an advocate for a strong and stable Public Service here in the ACT. Canberra is built on the Public Service, and much of our private sector is interlinked with it. Without the APS, I believe Canberra as we know it would simply cease to exist. But too often we hear nothing but disdain towards our Public Service and our public servants. I was dismayed to see the front page of today's Canberra Times, which quoted a new report from Roy Morgan calling for our Public Service to be decentralised and departments moved to the bush. This is something mining magnate Gina Rinehartfriend of those opposite-and the Leader of the Opposition have also endorsed. The report suggests Canberra should be ashamed of its low unemployment rate and embarrassed by its ability to attract the and brightest-the most highly educated in the country. 'It's like Disneyland,' says Roy Morgan chief executive Michele Levine. I have heard Canberra called a lot of things, but Disneyland ain't one of them. The notion that our public servants here in Canberra do not understand what it is like for people living in regional Australia is absolutely ludicrous. Firstly, Canberra is located in a regional area. It is located in the capital region. Secondly, Canberra services around 30 per cent of the region in education, health and a range of other services. There are over 22,500 non-ACT residents travelling to the ACT each day for work, and they are from the region. Many people here have come from regional areas, to make a difference to those regional areas. When I was at the ANU most of the people I studied with were from Goulburn, Yass and around the region. So I take heart in the Prime Minister's recent comment, 'I commit to Canberra remaining the heart of the Australian Public Service the primary location of government departments and agencies.' Canberra can be sure that under Labor, our Public Service will stay strong. What I would like to know: is which departments should be moved to the bush, as suggested, and when? Would those opposite like to put forward a policy for once, and state which departments they would like to shift to the north of Australia? Maybe they can ask Gina Rinehart what she thinks? Canberra is the home of our Public Service, but it is also a working city with a vibrant community. Moving whole departments out of Canberra would have significant ramifications. Unemployment would go up, the private sector would suffer and the housing market would collapse. This is more of the same lack of best understanding about how Canberra works that we get from those opposite. Too often all we hear from those opposite is nonsense about 'waste' and the need to audit and axe our Public Service. There is no understanding of the important work our Public Service does. Those opposite simply do not appreciate the role played by the APS in upholding, promoting and serving our democracy. The APS is itself an institution of Australia's democratic system of government. So, in keeping the Public Service strong, we are ensuring democracy stays strong as well. That is the difference between Labor and the coalition when it comes to our Public Service. Those opposite do not see the Public Service as vital to Australian government. We on this side want to make the Public Service the most efficient and effective in the world. Since 2011, we have actively pursued efficiencies in the Public Service-and we have runs on the board, with over $10 billion in efficiencies realised since we came to and government. While the approach of those opposite is to run around saying they will 'end the waste' and abolish whole departments, our approach is focused on improving efficiency-not cutting jobs. Our approach is about stability; their approach is just lazy. And I absolutely reject their view that our focus on efficiency and taking staffing levels back to what they were in 2009-10 is in any way worse than their outrageous plan to slash 12,000 jobs across the board. I mean, can we really believe they will stop at 12,000 jobs? I condemn their plans to make 12,000 public servants redundant should they come to office. Their plan is ill-conceived, based on no clear evidence and totally ignorant of the way our Public Service works. It is a plan that will hurt Canberra's private sector and cause irreversible damage to our region's economy. (Time expired) Tertiary Education",171
262,Mr JENKINS,Unknown," The Leader of the Opposition's misappropriation of Ben Chifley's 'light on the hill' speech was a most audacious action, even by the Leader of the Opposition's standards. When we think about the rich history of the Australian Labor Party, we have nothing but pride. In looking at Chifley's speech, given at the ALP conference in 1949, it is instructive to read the following: No Labour Minister or leader ever has an easy job. The urgency that rests behind the Labour movement, pushing it on to do things, to create new conditions, to reorganise the economy of country, always means that the people who work within the Labour movement, people who lead, can never have an easy job. The job of the evangelist is never easy. Tonight I want to reflect on Labor's proud record on tertiary education. I am of a generation that benefited from the decision of the Whitlam government to dispense with tertiary education fees. As it transpired, it would not have affected me because I was lucky enough to earn a Commonwealth scholarship. But for many of my peers, in our final years of secondary education the thought of whether or not we could afford university was paramount, so the Whitlam government's actions were enabling for very many people to make a transition. As things developed, there was still concern about the inadequacy of the way in which people from low socio-economic backgrounds could attain a tertiary place. Moving forward to the Hawke era and the creation of HECS, I was from a tradition within the Labor Party and the Labor movement that opposed HECS. I had the problem, though, that the minister for tertiary education at the time, John Dawkins, had a strong belief that introducing a HECS program would inject more money into tertiary education. It was electorates like Scullin that would see the benefit, because we had low participation rates. The outcomes are a bit chequered, I think, as a result of HECS payments. Move forward to 2009 and a new Labor government: a Labor government driven by the same values, that wants to see kids from low socio-economic backgrounds able to have access to tertiary education. If we look at La Trobe University in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, we see a 35 per cent increase in students from low SES backgrounds-from 1,200 to 1,700-in the 2009 final figures of enrolments to the third round in 2012. Those the sorts of figures make me very proud. If we look at the university that serves the western suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria University, we see a similar increase: 28 per cent, from 1,000 to 1,300. These are the things that we should dwell upon. These are the things that, in all the mire of perception, bad things and chaos, this government has been able to achieve. These are things that are truly Labor in their values, that come from the vision of Chifley and continue through the Whitlam era, through the Hawke era and now, in the Rudd-Gillard era. We have stayed true to trying to make opportunities for the people that we are entrusted with serving. In conclusion, I thank the member for Gippsland for yielding to me in this adjournment debate. Petition: Supply of PBS Medicines Petition: Digital Television Reception in Boolarra and District Petition: Princes Highway Gippsland Region Petition: Latrobe Regional Hospital",173
263,Mr CHESTER,Unknown," In the spirit of the member for Scullin's speech, I am quite ready to stand shoulder to shoulder with him when it comes to the issue of higher education achievement for people from low socio-economic groups, particularly those from regional areas. We do have a lot more work to do in that regard, and I am sure the government realises there are many challenges ahead for us in relation to raising the participation rates for students from regional communities. I appreciate the opportunity to speak tonight. I will be tabling four petitionswhich I understand is a bit unusual-that have all been found to be in order by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions. Two of them have been raised in smaller form in the past, so it is a chance to make sure that the people who signed these petitions have the opportunity to see them tabled in the House tonight. As a member of the Standing Committee on Petitions, I congratulate the secretariat and all the other members of the committee for conducting themselves in a very professional manner on that committee. I think it is an important role we play in the people of Australia the opportunity to directly petition the House and to have their issues raised in this most important of places. The first petition relates to the supply of PBS medicines. Specifically it relates to the timely and efficient delivery of those medicines. It is a huge petition. There are more than 13,000 signatures on it, and this is on top of the petition with 50,000 signatures that I tabled last November. There was significant concern regarding the distribution system for PBS medicines, and it helped draw attention to a very important issue at that time. I have been reassured by the companies involved that their delivery performance has improved significantly since the matter was first brought to the attention of the House. I am confident that we are moving in the right direction in relation to that, and I congratulate the petitioners for bringing it to the attention of the House. The next petition comes from the community of Boolarra, and it is a somewhat smaller petition but a very significant petition for the 92 residents who signed it. It relates to issues associated with switchover to digital TV. The Boolarra community is one of the first areas that was switched over. There were many assurances given to the community in relation to the switchover from digital to analog, but the expectations of that community have not been met. The services are continuously interrupted. I have made representations to the minister, and his office has been very forthcoming in trying to come up with some solutions to work with the community but, unfortunately, we have not really resolved the concerns of the Boolarra and district residents. It looks like there is going to be considerable expense to many residents to try to overcome their issues. The communication issues associated with the digital TV rollout have not been giving resolved in those areas, where the topographic conditions are sometimes very difficult to overcome. The third petition relates to the Princes Highway east of Sale and the need for additional funding to ensure that one of the most notorious stretches of road in Victoria is properly maintained in the future. It actually relates specifically to the need to include that section of road on the national road network. It is something I have raised before in the House and I will continue to work with the minister in that regard. The final petition relates to the La Trobe Regional Hospital. More than 2,100 people have signed that petition calling on the federal government to work with the state government in a major overhaul of services for La Trobe Regional Hospital. It is an issue I have raised many times. I have discussed it with the relevant ministers and I am looking forward in the future to achieving an outcome on behalf of all the people of Gippsland. Supply of PBS Medicines The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of pharmacy customers draws the following to the attention of the House: The Federal Government established a Community Service Obligation (CSO) to ensure that all Australians have timely access to the PBS medicines they require, regardless of the cost of the medicines, or where they live. Under exclusive PBS supply arrangements established by pharmaceutical manufacturers, eligible CSO Distributors are excluded from supplying PBS medicines within 24 hours under the CSO and pharmacists have their supply options for PBS medicines reduced to a single supplier. We therefore ask the House to take immediate action and introduce an amendment to the National Health Act 1953 that prohibits exclusive supply of PBS medicines by manufacturers and suppliers to community pharmacies. from 13,672 citizens. Petition received. Digital Television Reception in Boolarra and District The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of citizens of Boolarra, Victoria, Australia draws to the attention of the House: the ongoing difficulties with Digital Television reception in Boolarra and surrounding district. Interruptions and ""No Signal"" messages can number many dozens of times during a day. Our area was first to be switched over to Digital Television reception, and despite the assurances given at Town Meetings regarding our Repeater tower by the authorities, the service provided has continuously been interrupted. Individual complaints have met with no satisfactory answers or solutions to the problems experienced. Recent discussions with the service provider also indicate that the functionality/directionality of the previous tower has been reduced, although there was no mention of this in the extensive consultation we had prior to the new transmitter being installed. We therefore ask the House to: Investigate the viability and operation of the Repeater Tower, and improve the transmission of the Digital Television signal so that it is constant and reliable and provides an equivalent service to the previous transmitter, whether by provision of a new Repeater tower or equipment, or alternately, aerials for all residents to receive transmission from Mount lassie at no cost to citizens. from 92 citizens Petition received. Princes Highway Gippsland Region The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of citizens of Australia who travel in the Gippsland region, draws to the attention of the House the inadequate condition of the Princes Highway between Sale and the New South Wales border. In particular we note:  Accident rates that indicate the Princes Highway in Gippsland is one of the state's most dangerous roads. From April 1, 2004 to March 31, 2009, there were 314 crashes reported on the Princes Highway east with 497 people injured and 28 people killed;  Insufficient overtaking lanes;  Concerns over the poor road surface, lack of shoulders and inadequate rest areas;  An RACV assessment of highways in Gippsland found that most sections of road were an unacceptable standard for a national highway. We therefore ask the House to support the adding of the Princes Highway east of Sale to the National Road Network to give it access to Federal Government funding. from 362 citizens Petition received. Latrobe Regional Hospital The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the urgent need for Federal Government investment at Latrobe Regional Hospital (LRH). Gippsland some of the poorest health outcomes in Victoria and demand at LRH is expected to increase due to an ageing population locally and growth predictions in the region of 13 per cent over the next 10 years. Despite the fantastic efforts of staff, facilities at LRH fall well below existing standards and are not adequate to meet the needs of the local community. We therefore ask the House of Representatives to recognise the importance of Latrobe Regional Hospital's application for $65 million through the Federal Government's Health and Hospitals Fund and support the establishment of new and improved health facilities for Gippsland and Latrobe Valley residents. from 2,175 citizens Petition received.

The main issue with these appropriation announced by the Treasurer are inexact. The manufactured surplus out of thin air. As many they have completely cooked the books and called the fudge-it budget. I ask the government: revealed in the budget estimates? Why has billion-plus cost of the National Broadband accounted for the $10 billion they plan to funding for the many billions of dollars they of truly cracking down on spending, have estimates, which will in turn increase The only way the Treasurer has been able omitting the accurate operational costs of into the 2011-12 year-the 'back to school' government-which would cancel the Treasurer's Similarly, if as Mr Swan claims this is to claim-why did the Gillard government announce from $250 billion to $300 billion, a debt ceiling four years ago?

I would like to look first at what the budget issue at the moment in the electorate of get more money from federal, state and local has been a road infrastructure deficit now address that deficit. what did this budget do cut from $6.2 billion in 2011-12 to $2.6 billion is a key infrastructure demand-something which deliver its goods and services to export functions coherently and increases productivity, important area?

They will take a long time to work person in Australia. That is a great thing. the tax disincentive for the very lowest income It will certainly impact very positively on Deakin who do part-time work, who do not have in the future a whole lot better, as it will for I commend these bills-but not the second to support the amendment to the motion that time. It is an incredibly important amendment in how the nation's finances are handled. We I would like to spend some time talking uncertainty, especially with the uncertainty of not, and we have ongoing political turmoil, with about how austerity measures should be dealt budget an economic plan-some vision, some that, in particular, the Treasurer knew got was no such statement, no such vision, no no plan, more debt and continued on the path did for my electorate of Wannon. The No. 1 Wannon-it has been for some time-is how we can governments into our road infrastructure. There for some years, and we need to get funding to to help in that regard? Sadly, road funding will be in 2012-13. That is a $3.6 billion shortfall. It will drive productivity and help this nation markets to make sure that our domestic economy and what has the government done in this We see that impact more specifically when funded. The Western Highway will not get the to it each year for the next four years. Instead there have been some environmental planning does not mean that the Treasurer should cook to deliver his surplus and then puts extra achieve his wafer-thin surplus. It demonstrates books when it comes to delivering his surplus, matter of fact, if history dictates anything, with the blow-out in the deficit in the last almost impossible that the Treasurer can hang he has announced for the coming financial year. On that point, we also need to ask-and goes to the heart of: if the Treasurer is determined asking for an extra $50 billion credit limit to asking for that borrowing limit to be raised from pass the common sense test. It does not pass going to deliver a surplus, why then would you this little increase in our credit card limit'? just does not stack up, and I think we all know ability to deliver a budget which will achieve of vision for this country. We also see, despite the predicted growth cent. Last year's budget promised 500,000 expects to miss its target by 300,000 jobs. So cynical. We have a commitment to achieving already, one year later, that target is going to believe the Treasurer when he says that we It makes it extremely hard to believe. The other thing which makes the budget fairly raises a level of mistrust, with how it has achieve-is that we are assured that the carbon course, but the carbon price-will only impact it then goes on to explain what assistance would the price increases from the tax that will price, whichever way we want to define it. So to raise a level of cynicism. It really has credibility whatsoever. Assistance to cope with within the budget yet the overarching statement 500 big emitters. If there is a message that comes out of some advice to the Treasurer, it is that you Otherwise, people are going to grow more achieve. I think that has been clearly established. it comes to how the Western Highway will be full amount of funding that had been promised the books have been cooked. I understand that issues which have led to some delays, but that the books so he delivers less funding next year funding in the outlying two years to help him quite clearly that the Treasurer has cooked the and we are highly unlikely to see it. As a we are definitely not going to see it. As we saw budget, which totalled over $20 billion, it seems on to this wafer-thin, $1.5 billion surplus which this is what the amendment we are debating today to deliver his wafer-slim surplus, why is he be placed on the nation's credit card? Why is he $250 billion to $300 billion? It just does not the pub test. If you are telling people you are be also saying, 'Oh, we need to sneak through And this 'little increase' is $50 billion. Something what does not stack up. It is the Treasurer's what it sets out to do and which shows any sort rates, that unemployment is set to rise to 5.5 per new jobs over two years, but the government now once again it is hard not to be just a little bit 500,000 new jobs in the last budget and yet to be missed by 300,000 jobs.

Yet, at the same time, be offered to families to help them cope with not speak its name, the carbon tax-or the carbon once again there is an inconsistency which has to make one wonder whether this Treasurer has any the carbon price to families is clearly laid out is that the carbon tax will only impact on the this budget, and if I could very humbly provide need to get a consistency in your messaging. and more cynical about what you are trying to We have a budget where the government is saying, 'This is what we are saying, but this is not fit with what the results or the outcomes because at this time, more than at any time, financial crisis, we needed a clear economic showed the way forward for this nation.

I prefer One of the ideas that have been put to me is a to holiday at home. Costs would be which helps. Profits would be made as a and that helps to offset the cost. development and contribution are not in is industrial terrorism. While most Australians underpinned by mining, Labor and the Greens Julia Gillard and the Greens have undermined They undermine the resources sector with the with the carbon tax. They have undermined green tape. We saw with the Abbot Point multiand dreams of so many North Queenslanders, stalled it for 17 months, with the application minister's desk.

It is for these extreme environmental groups and are not in the best interests of the Australian and does something so completely different. It invest in renewables. If that is the case, why is backing a national ethanol mandate? They want to be seen to be adopting coalition policy like technology. A national ethanol mandate would in the Burdekin and also the operating plant we less than 50 per cent of the oil that it consumes, and dependency on exports is expected to the retention of the ethanol excise rebate, the demand.

I was at Blaxland Explorers Day only to me where I was working to express their carbon tax. Seniors, young families, young couples the rising cost of living and the lack of support this budget. What is clear is that the Treasurer for the larger cost and impact of this budget and businesses and every aspect of the Australian by the token handouts provided by the government the cost of living.

This year the government set to reach an alarming $8 billion over the next This money would be better spent on providing protecting our borders, supporting defence the National Disability Insurance Scheme and demonstrates no plan to build a stronger I am genuinely concerned about the impact that specifically the impact on the people who work, live and endeavour to build a recently, and throughout the day people came up concerns about this budget and this unnecessary and single parents are all concerned about and services provided to local communities by believes that the government can compensate the carbon tax that is set to hit families, small economy. No-one will be spared, especially not to compensate for a dramatic increase in the budget allocated to Blue Mountains City While this may seem like a large sum of money sufficient. I recall in 2007 when a local road, This road is 3½ kilometres long. The That was $700,000 to repair 3.4 kilometres. by the Blue Mountains City Council. It is allocated to the Blue Mountains City Council for Council and Hawkesbury City Council are both set from the Treasurer's budget.

Julia Gillard's carbon tax will mean these charges, raise their council rates, cut services will mean more pain for Australians at the city councils within this budget now that direct result of the carbon tax? This means councils local services such as libraries, parks, youth make up such an important part of our communities they will have to make these sacrifices to pay this tax. The first priority of a coalition government the cost-of-living pressures which are soaring have regarding the rising costs of living I stimulate tourism. The tourism industry is economy for both Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains. gross domestic product was $73.3 billion or In Australia, tourism directly and indirectly cent of total Australian employment-and this stressed, this budget delivered by the Treasurer $8 million. Not only has the Labor government provide adequate carbon tax compensation for the Tourism and Transport Forum submission to lose 6,400 jobs and a cut of 10 per cent plan to secure the jobs of those in the tourism stimulate tourism growth, particularly for Hawkesbury where tourism operators Another important component of the economies Hawkesbury regions is the contribution made across the electorate.

The coalition will also support small compulsory employee superannuation contributions their contribution in one payment directly coalition have always supported small business vital part of our economy. The desperate attempt by the Gillard Labor comes at a heavy price for the Australian Defence from the 2012-13 budget, making a total of $17 A review commissioned by the council predicted per year in 2013 to 2014 based on current threshold until 2033-34.

Where is the compensation for local they have to accommodate these price hikes as a will have less money to allocate to vital services, the arts and cultural initiatives. These and it is a disaster for local councils that would be to abolish this carbon tax and reduce under Labor.
