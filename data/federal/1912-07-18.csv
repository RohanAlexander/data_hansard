Mr Mahon presented a petition from the adult white residents of Port Moresby, praying the House to so amend clause 286 of the Navigation Bill as to exempt the Territory of Papua from the operation of the Act. Petition received and read. Mr Mahon presented similar petitions from adult white residents of Yule Island, Woodlark Island, Samarai, and Lakekamu gold-field. Motion (by Mr Mahon) proposed - That the petition be printed.",14
1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Unles s an honourable member intends to take action on a petition, it is not customary to have it printed.",14
2,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I propose to have the petition referred to the Committee on the Navigation Bill. The moving for the printing of petitions has been repeatedly done by private members. I have a distinct recollection of several cases.,14
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Standing order 91 saysNo member shall move that a Petition be printed, unless he intends to take action upon it and informs the House thereof, and that such action will be taken within fourteen days. I understand that the honourable member intends to take action in connection with the petition, and as the same form of words has been adopted in each case it will not be necessary to print the petition more than once.",14
4,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"If only one petition is to be printed, all the names attached to the separate copies of it should be printed with it.",14
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The names of the persons signing the petition will not be printed, or only one or two of them, but there will be a statement of the total number of signatures.",14
6,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Is it not usual to submit a question of this kind to the Printing Committee, to ascertain whether it is necessary to incur the expense of printing. The honourable member might leave the matter to the Committee, from whose members he will get justice.",14
7,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"It is the practice to have all petitions printed, that rule being laid down some time ago after an animated discussion in this Chamber. The signatures are not necessarily printed, but the prayer is printed, with a few of the signatures, and a statement of the total number of signatures.",14
8,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The Printing Committee may not meet for some time, and as the Navigation Bill to which the petition refers is now before the House, it is necessary to have the petition printed as soon as possible. Question resolved in the affirmative. PRINTING COMMITTEE'S REPORT. Report (No. 1) presented by Sir John QUICK, read by the Clerk, and adopted. NA MILLS.",14
9,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"I desire to draw the attention of the Minister representing the Minister of Defence to the following paragraph appearing in this morning's issue of the Argus, in respect to which I propose to ask him a question: HOBART, Wednesday - The Hydro Electric Coy., which is to get power from the Great Lake, has made an offer to the Hobart City Council to supply electric power for the tramways, which the Council is about to purchase, at f d . per unit up to 476-horse power, and i d . per unit for all above. This offer is for a ten years' contract, and may be renewed for ten years at the flat rate of a halfpenny. . . . I desire to ask whether the Minister of Defence, before deciding where the Commonwealth Woollen Mills shall be located, will obtain a quotation from this company for the supply of power, and compare it with the cost of supplying power at other suggested sites.",14
10,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,There is not the slightest doubt but that the Minister will make a comparison of costs before he decides where the woollen mills shall be situated.,14
11,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"I wish to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether Mr Smail, the Government expert, hasfinishedhis investigations so far as the selection of a site for the proposed woollen mills is concerned, or whether he is going to pay a visit to other centres in Australia before submitting his report.",14
12,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"I understand that Mr Smail has finished his inspection of the various suggested sites throughout the Commonwealth, and is now preparing his report for submission to the Minister.",14
13,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"I desire to know from the Minister representing the Minister of Defence why it is that Mr Smail, the woollen expert, visited certain places and omitted to visit others which are eminently suited for a woollen factory, before he drew up his report?",15
14,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,I am quite unable to say why certain towns were not visited.,15
15,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"On what basis did the expert act? He is a stranger here, I understand.",15
16,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"I am unable to say why the expert did not visit certain towns. A large number of towns were visited in the different States, and honourable members knew that the expert was making an inspection. Some honourable members took the trouble to write suggesting that certain places should be visited, and municipal and shire councils and other institutions made similar representations, all of which were met by the Minister. I have no doubt that the report of the expert will disclose the situation.",15
17,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,The expert never went near one of the finest sites in Australia.,15
18,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"I understand the Minister representing the Minister of Defence to say that the expert has completed his inquiries, and I should like the honourable gentleman to ascertain whether the Minister of Defence has received representations from the central district of Queensland, where the best wool is grown, to the effect that Mr Smail might be allowed to visit that part of the country before finally deciding on the site.",15
19,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,I shall submit the question to the Minister of Defence. LIMITATION OF SPEECHES. DISSENT FROM SPEAKER'S RULING.,15
20,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"Last'night , Mr Speaker, I gave notice of my intention to move that a certain ruling given by you be disagreed with. Later on, I expressed a desire to withdraw that motion, but the House refused to allow me to do so. I understood that the motion would come before the House today, and I should like to ask why it does not appear on the notice-paper.",15
21,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"It was my intention as soon as the questions to Ministers had been dealt with to state that the proper course to pursue in regard to a motion of the character referred to is to place it at the head of the notice-paper. Unfortunately, the motion was placed not at the head of the notice-paper, but second in order, under the heading of "" Government Business."" As soon as the questions have been dealt with, I shall ask the House to agree to the motion being placed first in the order of business in order that it may be dealt with at once.",15
22,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"Has the Prime Minister yet made any arrangement, or what arrangement does he propose to make, in relation to the Navigation Bill and the new standing order passed last night. Reasons were submitted why that measure and another should not be subject to the new conditions.",15
23,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"No consideration has been given to the matter as yet, but there are reasons, it appears to me, why both of the measures referred to might very well be discussed apart from the new standing order. There is no intention on the part of the Government to embarrass honourable members in any way by the operation of this or any other standing order. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE. TENDERS FOR SUPPLY OF MATERIALPROSECUTION OF CADETS.  to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, without notice, whether he has seen in the daily press that contracts, for plant required in the excavation of works at Westernport have been granted to a German firm of importers. If so, can he tell the House if there is any good and substantial reason why the contracts should not be granted to Australian firms, or (2> failing that, to British firms; and (3) will' the Minister take steps to see that the policy of the Government, so well maintained in the past, to give preference where possible to Australian manufacturers, is strictly adhered to?",15
24,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"The particulars in regard to the tender to which the honourable member refers are practically as follow :Tenders were invited for the supply of three different items. Three firms tendered, two for the supply of all the items required, and one, representing an English firm, for only one item, and for less than one-fifth of the total required. In respect of that item, the tender sent in on behalf of the English firm was about 15 per cent, higher than was the tender accepted. I r addition to that, the representatives of the English firm were unable to supply the material in less than nine weeks, while the successful tenderer was able to supply it at once. The question of time was of importance, as well as the question of cost, and therefore the lowest tender was accepted.",15
25,Mr ANSTEY,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether the Minister of Defence is aware (1) that a contract was given to a German firm; (2) that the specifications were of such a character that only a German firm could comply with them; and (3) whether he thinks it is a proper policy for this country to practically disarm itself against invasion by assisting the industrial operations of a nation from which it is called upon to protect itself.,16
26,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"In reply to the trebleheaded question submitted by the honourable member; I have no doubt that the Minister was aware of what he was doing when he accepted the tender. In the second place, the specifications were not of such a character that only a German firm could tender for the supply of the material required, as is shown by the fact that a local company, representing a British firm, actually tendered for the supply of portion of the requisite material. That, I think, is a very effective reply to the inference contained in the question put by the honourable member. The question of time was a very important consideration; and the fact that certain representatives of firms have the material in Australia ready to supply at a moment's notice is, I think, a sufficient answer to the inference that we are obtaining goods from Germany.",16
27,Mr ANSTEY,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence if he will cause inquiries to be made, in order to discover whether or not the officer who drew up the specifications in question was conversant with the character of the material which the representatives of the German firm had on hand, and drew up the specifications in order to suit the requirements of that firm?",16
28,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,I deprecate the inference to be drawn from the honourable member's question; and have no doubt that any information required by honourable members on either side of the House will be supplied by my colleague.,16
29,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"Will the Minister representing the Minister of Defence kindly inform the House of the character of the materials or items for which the representatives of the British firm to which he has referred could not tender, and in respect of which the representatives of the German firm alone could submit a tender ?",16
30,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"I am sorry if any remarks that I have made conveyed the inference that a British firm could not, and that a German firm alone could, tender for the supply of the material. The facts are that the representatives of the British firm in question did not- I do not know whether they could or could not-tende r for the supply of the whole of the material, while representatives of a German firm did. The items required were as follow :1. 3,000 yards, 14 lbs., 24-inch gauge track. 2. Twelve sets, 14 lbs., 34-inch points and crossings. 3. Fifty trucks, 1 cubic yard capacity. The representatives of the British firm tendered for item No. 1 only, and no tenders were received from an Australian, or the representatives of a British, firm in respect of items 2 and 3. The honourable member will see that all three items are closely related.  to know whether the Minister will take steps to see that what I understand to be the policy of the Government- a policy which has been so well maintained in the pastto give preference where possible to Australian manufacturers, is strictly adhered to in the future ?",16
31,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"I can assure the honourable member that this question will be brought under the notice of the Minister of Defence. At the same time, I can assure him that everything possible will be done in the direction suggested; indeed, in many directions already, marked preference has been shown to Australian manufacturers, and, next, to British manufacturers.",16
32,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether he will take into consideration the heavy fines being imposed on parents of cadets, with a view to seeing whether the officers prosecuting on behalf of the Department can be instructed to suggest to the magistrate to inflict merely nominal fines, or give a caution, for first offences?",16
33,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,I shall submit the question to the Minister of Defence for his consideration.,16
34,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister of Defence been called to certain prosecutions of cadets in New South Wales, and to the course taken by the magistrates in dismissing the case rather than, in their opinion, inflict great hardship by imposing the punishment provided ?",16
35,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"I have no information of any particular case. The power is in the hands of the civil magistrates to discriminate, in accordance with the evidence produced.",17
36,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"I should like know from the Treasurer when we may pect to have the Budget Speech, which he, last session, promised to be delivered as soon as the House met this year?",17
37,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"The right honourable land might be put? gentleman is, I think, in error in saying that I promised the Budget Speech as soon as the House met. I said that I hoped to deliver the speech in July, and I still tertain that hope. LIGHTHOUSES : COAST INSPECTION.",17
38,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"I should like to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs when it is proposed that Commander Brewis, the lighthouse expert, shall visit the western coast of Victoria?",17
39,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALT H WOOLLEN,"At present the expert is engaged in Western Australia and South Australia, and, as soon as he has finished there, it is his intention to inspect of Victoria. NA ELECTORS .",17
40,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,I desire to ask the Minister of Home Affairs what progress is being made with the compulsory enrolment of electors ? I do not notice that any prosecutions have taken place; and I should like to know whether we are to infer from that that everv one is complying with the Act.,17
41,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"When electors refuse to enroll, a second notice is served upon them, and they are again urged not to put themselves to any cost. Nearly all those written to comply, but there are a few in regard to whom I am afraid we shall have to have a Christian investigation. POST-OFFICE. VICTORIA PARK,",17
42,Sir JOHNFORREST,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"I should like to know from the Minister of Home Affairs why it is that the erection of a post-office at Victoria Park, near Perth, for which £[1,500 was provided on the Estimates, has not been begun. I am informed that not even the land has yet been acquired.",17
43,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"I shall let the honourable member know during the afternoon. COMMONWEALTH OFFICES, LONDON.",17
44,Mr BAMFORD,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"I desire to ask the Minister of External Affairs whether the model of the squat, disproportioned buildBUDGET. ing for Commonwealth offices in London to now being exhibited in the Queen's exHall is the design approved by the Government, and, if so, does he consider the erection of a building of this character on so valuable a site the best use to which such",17
45,Mr THOMAS,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"The design referred to has practically been accepted. The building is as high as it is possible to make it enunder the regulations of the London County Council, and it consists of five, and not two, stories. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT.

46,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"the Postthe coast master-General, upon notice I. When will the contract time for the Fremantle Wireless Station expire? 2. What was the amount of the original contract, and what will the station cost when completed ? 3. What is the cause of the delay in opening this station? 4. When will it be opeped?",17
47,Mr FRAZER,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The contract time expired on 22nd May, 1912. 2. The amount of the. original contract wns for ^4,150, plus an addition of ^2,000 on account of an alteration in the position of the station, but the payment of this latter amount is subject to arbitration; the total cost of the station, together with buildings, officers' quarters, & c , when completed, wil l probably approximate ^'16,000 to j£i8,ooo. 3. This Department has not yet been informed that the station is completed. PERTH. 4. As soon as the station has complied with the technical conditions of the contract.",17
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Whether the present practice of sending notices to addressees that parcels and papers are waiting to be called for at post offices cannot be improved on, as it is found by most persons often to be both inconvenient to call for the article as well as irksome to carry it home? 2. Whether the present practice does not result in a large accumulation of unclaimed parcels and papers? 3. What was the practice before Federation, in the States, and now in London? 4. Whether an arrangement cannot be established more convenient to the people?",17
49,Mr FRAZER,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The notice is only issued in cases where the number of parcels does not warrant the expense of special delivery at the place of address, and where the special delivery is not warranted the issue of notices seems to be the best way of meeting the convenience of the public. The question of extending the limit within which parcels are delivered is now under consideration as the result of a conference of inspectors recently held. 2. Not so far as I am aware. 3. The practice in the States prior to Federation, so far as the issue of notices is concerned, was the same as it is now, but the limit within which parcels are delivered has been considerably increased under the Commonwealth. I am not aware of the practice in vogue in this respect in London, but in any case the conditions in London are entirely different from those in the Commonwealth. 4. See answer to No. i .",18
50,Mr WEBSTER,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Whether the accountant (Mr Triggs) is able to furnish this House with the promised report showing the true nnancial position of the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic branches respectively? 2. Will the Minister supply members with a copy of such report before the Budget statement is made?",18
51,Mr FRAZER,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1 and 2. The Chief Accountant advises he considers it improbable that a report showing the financial position of postal, telegraphic and telephonic branches for the nnancial year 1911-12 will be submitted. I am prepared to show the honourable gentleman the reasons in detail advanced by the Chief Accountant for holding this opinion.",18
52,Mr WEBSTER,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Whether he is aware that the forage allowance to postmen is inadequate to cover the feeding, shoeing, and housing of their horses? 2. Will he look into the matter with a view to relieving these men of this demand made upon their earnings?",18
53,Mr FRAZER,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Representations have been made by letter carriers in one of the States that the allowance referred to is inadequate, and inquiries are being made in the matter. 2. When the inquiries are complete the matter will receive careful copsideration.",18
54,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"asked the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Under what circumstances has it been recently decided to charge a "" late fee "" on letters posted in letter-boxes situated at or in connection with certain railway st-Uions in Victoria? 2. Is such "" late f e e "" to be collected in respect of letters posted on railway lines where there are no travelling post-office vans? 3. Will the Minister delay the proposed change of practice and give the question further consideration?",18
55,Mr FRAZER,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Under regulations in force in Victoria prior to Federation late fees were charged on letters posted in letter-boxes at railway stations and on trains. In other States late fees are charged on letters posted in letter-boxes at railway stations or on trains. Recently, attention was drawn by the Postal authorities in Victoria to this, and the matter having been referred to a Conference of Senior Inspectors, a recommendation was made that the practice in Victoria be made to conform to that in the other States. This practice, I may say, is in force in all the principal countries in the world. 2. Yes, but at places where there is no post office or receiving office no late fee is charged if the correspondence posted at the railway station there is endorsed to show the place at which it was posted. 3. The Constitution prevents the sanctioning of different arrangements in this respect in Victoria from those which apply in the other States. NORTHERN TERRITORY LEASES.  External Affairs, upon notice I. Whether it is true that under section 20 of the Northern Territory Crown Lands Ordinance No. 3 of 1912 a perpetual lease will be granted for pastoral lands? 2. In case of resumption, will such lessees be entitled to be paid compensation for any depreciation in the value of lease by reason of such resumption, in addition to payment for any improvements put on the lease by the lessee? 3. On whnt basis would the lessee be compensated for the unexpired portion of a perpetual pastoral lease? 4. Does the Ordinance referred to provide for the surrender of existing pastoral leases, including those held under 42 years' lease? 5. If so, in what way will the Commonwealth benefit by the surrender of such 42 years' leases ?",18
56,Mr THOMAS,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. Yes. Part III . of the Ordinance providesthat all leases, except miscellaneous leases, shall be in perpetuity, but subject to periodical reapprnisement of rents. 2. The lessee of lands resumed for any purpose shall be entitled to receive compensation for («) the value of improvements on the resumed area which are his property; [6) the depreciation in the value of the lease consequent on the resumption, but the amount ot"" increased value, by reason of the resumption or construction of public works, shall be set off against any compensation for depreciation. 3. The methods of calculating compensation are to be prescribed by regulation; such regulations have not yet been issued. They are to be considered shortly by the Classification Board. It is, however, provided by the Ordinance that no compensation shall be paid for increased value of lands in consequence of resumption or proposed public works. 4. Yes, if the Classification Board approves. 5. By obtaining uniformity of conditions of tenure; by the reduction of excessive areas; by the right to reappraisement of rents; by greater facilities for resumption.",18
57,Mr DEAKIN,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,What are the miscellaneous leases ?,19
58,Mr THOMAS,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"Minin g leases, and, in fact, anything outside of town lots and pastoral or agricultural leases. LAND TAX ASSESSMENTS : JOINT the",19
59,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"the Treasurer, get it. upon notice I. What was the first rule or practice observed by the Land Tax Commissioner in the assessment of the joint owners of lahd under section 38 ? 2. What is the present rule or practice observed in administering the same section?",19
60,Mr FISHER,COMPULSORY ENROLMENT OF,"The Secretary to the ment Land Tax Commissioner has furnished the following information: It is assumed that Sir John Quick desires to be informed as to the first and present rules in the assessment, under section 38, of the joint occupiers or joint users of land. The first rule was to assess as joint owners only those persons who were registered as joint owners or joint tenants or tenants in common, or who had contracted in any of those capacities to purchase land, and thereby had come within the taxable limits. The present rule is the above, with the addition that where a number of persons who - own land in severalty form a partnership to jointly use all or any of the land so owned, and the deed of partnership expresses that such land is to form a partnership asset, the partnership is jointly assessed on the land. In regard to joint owners of land who partition the land between tliem, and obtain titles - in severalty to different sections of the land formerly jointly owned, and who continue to jointly occupy or use the land, such persons were orginally and are still assessed as joint owners of the' land by virtue of the provisions - of section 42 of the Act. In regard to the joint occupancy or _ joint working of land in cases where there is no joint ownership of it, the Department at first did not look upon such cases as joint ownerships assessable under section 38. Subsequently, the Department was advised that where joint occupiers or joint users of land pooled the revenue from the land and distributed it amongst the interested parties in proportion to their lands, such persons were joint owners within the definition of "" owner'' in section 3 of the Act. The Department acted in accordance with this rule, but advice received at a later date indicated' that such assessments were incorrect, and the present rule mentioned above was adopted. NA ACT.",19

63,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Capricornia) [3.11] - I move That Mr Speaker's ruling that the amend of the honourable member for Grey is in order be disagreed to, on the ground that said amendment is the same in substance as the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gwydir and defeated on the voices. It is a little difficult, a day after the fair, to be enthusiastic about a motion of this kind. Our Standing Orders, though clear enough, are generally construed in the light of precedent, and the discussion of this motion may therefore do good, and need not engender ill-feeling. Yesterday, on a motion by the honourable member for Franklin affirming the desirability of limiting speeches, the honourable member for Gwydir moved an amendment which, it seems to me now, was not quite in order. The motion affirmed the desirability of altering the Standing Orders, but the amendment, while it provided for the addition of certain words, was really in the nature of a separate motion altering * the Standing Orders, and, as such, should not have been moved except upon notice. The amendment is very clear and comprehensive, embodying, as it did, a standing order of the New Zealand Parliament which lays down definite limitations for speeches in the House and in Committee. The debate on the amendment lasted for a considerable time, several honourable members addressing themselves to it, and the amendment was then negatived on the voices.",19
64,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member is getting away from the terms of his motion.,19
65,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am moving that motion because I understood you to rule that the amendment of the honourable member for Grey was in order, a ruling with which I disagree on the ground stated in the motion. I was reminding the House that the amendment of the honourable member for Gwydir, to add certain words, was comprehensive in character, and was negatived on the voice?. It was completely swept off the board. The proposal that a standing order should be forthwith made limiting the speeches of honourable members was rejected on the voices, not a single honourable member, when the question was put, raising his voice in favour of the proposal. I take it that the amendment of the honourable member for Wimmera, which followed, was also not quite in order, though it was put and negatived. But the fact that it was not ruled out of order does not make the amendment of the honourable member for Grey in order. In my Opinion, the honourable member for Grey should have intimated, when the amendment of the honourable member for Gwydir was before the House, that he desired to amend it. The amendment of the honourable member for Gwydir was a proposal to add to the motion of the honourable member for Franklin the following wordsNo member shall speak for more than halfan-hour at a time in any debate in the House, except in the debate on the Address-in-Reply, or in a debate on a motion of "" No Confidence,"" Or in moving the second reading of a Bill , or on the debate on the Appropriation Bill or On the Financial Statement in Committee, when ti member shall be at liberty to speak for one hour. In Committee of the House no member shall speak for more than ten minutes at any One time, or more than four times on any one question before the Committee : Provided that this rule shall not apply in Committee to a member in charge of a Bill, Or to a Minister when delivering the Financial Statement, or, in regard to the number of his speeches, to a Minister in charge of a Class of the Estimates in Committee of Supply. That proposal having been defeated, the honourable member for Grey proposed to add these wordsNo member shall speak for more than one hour and five minutes at a time in any debate in the House, except in the debate on the Address-in-Reply, or in a debate on a motion of "" No Confidence,"" or in moving the second reading of a Bill , or on the debate on. the Appropriation Bill or on the Financial Statement in Committee, when a member shall be at liberty to speak for one hour and thirty-five minutes. In Committee of the House no member shall speak for more than fifteen minutes at any one lime, or more than four times on any one question before the Committee : Provided that this rule shall not apply in Committee to a member in charge of a Bill , or to a Minister when delivering the Financial Statement, or, in regard to the number of his speeches, to a Minister in charge of a Class of the Estimates in Committee of Supply. There are 150 words in the amendment of the honourable member for Gwydir, and 157 in that of the honourable member for Grey, of which 148 are common to both.",20
66,Mr SCULLIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,A comma may affect the meaning of a sentence.,20
67,Mr HIGGS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member for Grey altered the amendment of the honourable member for Gwydir only by substituting for the words ""half-an-hour"" the words ""one hour and five minutes,"" and for the words "" one hour "" the words ""one hour and thirty-five minutes,"" and for the word "" ten "" the word "" fifteen."" Under standing order 125 no question or amendment may be proposed which is the same in substance as any question which during the same session has been resolved in the affirmative or negative. I wish, therefore, to emphasize the statement that the proper time for the honourable member for Grey to propose his alterations of the amendment of the honourable member for Gwydir was when that amendment was before the House. My motion can be discussed quite dispassionately. Its subject matter may not seem of importance now, but if the ruling be allowed to stand, it may happen later, when a proposal substantially the same as another already decided in the affirmative or negative is made,, and the standing order is sought to be applied, that the point may be taken that precedent is against the standing; order, inasmuch as the honourable member for Grey was allowed to move an amendment the same in substance as another just negatived. That would, perhaps, cause confusion, and lead to delayin the transaction of public business  3 22 logical conclusion from the'argument of the honourable member for Capricornia is that no motion is in order if a certain number of words in it are common to another motion already dealt with. He dwelt upon, the fact that in the amendment of the honourable member for Gwydir there were 150 words, and in my amendment 157 words, and a large number common to both. I would point out to him that when we weredealing with the Tariff a frequent form of amendment was to add "" and on and after ""' dates which were mentioned, the ratesof duty should differ from those previously proposed. If his argument is a good. one, and the point had been taken then, all those amendments would have been out of order because the words "" and on and a f t e r "" were common to all the amendments, as was also in many cases the date. 1 submit that my proposal differed widely from that of the honourable member for Gwydir. According to the honourable member for Capricornia, there would have been no substantial difference had the limitation of time which I proposed been two hours longer than that of the honourable member for Gwydir. As a matter of fact, in the case in which the honourable member for Gwydir proposed the limitation of half-an-hour, I proposed the limitation of one hour and five minutes, the very considerable difference of thirty-five minutes, and in the case in which he proposed a limitation of half-an-hour, I proposed a limitation of thirty-five minutes. I proposed, in one case, more than a 50 per cent, increase in the limitation proposed by the honourable member for Gwydir. I therefore submit that the contention raised by the honourable member for Capricornia must fail.",20

71,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member is now proceeding to state something to which I shall not be able to reply.,21
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Are you'going to reply to the debate, Mr Speaker? understood that you were not going to give a ruling in regard to this matter, but that the House was really judging a ruling given by you last night.",21
73,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member is quite right, but he must confine him.self to the question before the Chair.",21
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I submit that - there is no difference in substance between the amendment moved by the honourable .member for Gwydir and rejected by the .House, and that proposed by the honourable member for Grey. There is a mere variation in point of time. The original proposition was that there should be a limitation of debate in this House, and while I may not discuss the question of relevancy it certainly has an incidental bearing on the question of substance. VVe cannot well dissociate the two. It seems to me that all the variations subsequently proposed were in reality not variations in substance. The honourable member for Grey, in rising to propose his amendment, said, "" I think this is a way of getting out of the difficulty,"" clearly indicating that his proposal was not one of substance, if I may so call it, but only a subterfuge to get round your ruling.",21
75,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member must not attribute unworthy motives to an honourable member.,21
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am not doing so. I hope that the word "" subterfuge"" is not an offensive political term. A desire to get round your ruling, Mr Speaker, was evidently in the honourable member's mind His opening statement shows what his intention was in proposing a mere variation of five minutes in the time limit proposed by the honourable member for Wimmera.",21
77,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member is now discussing a matter that has already been dealt with by the House; he is really raising the question of the amendment that was moved by the honourable member for Cook. That question has already been settled, and cannot now be raised. The only two amendments before the House at this stage are those moved by the honourable member for Gwydir and the honourable member for Grey. I cannot allow any discussion of my rulings on matters which are not now before the House.",21
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am inclined to think, Mr Speaker, that you are right. But, after all, the argument as to substanI tiality applies to the whole of the amendments that were proposed. If it applies, as I certainly think it does, to the one which you will not permit me to discuss, it must apply equally to the others. The whole question at issue was whether there was to be a limitation of speeches or not. That question was really decided on the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Wimmera. In rejecting that amendment the House decided that there should be no limitation of debate in the Plouse, so that there could be no substance in any further proposal for imposing a limit to the length of speeches in the House itself I submit that on that ground alone your ruling was wrong, and I regret very much that my honourable friends opposite have not more respect for the terminology of substance."" our Standing Orders than to disfigure them in the wav they have done.",21

80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I bow to the right honourable member's superior opinion.,22
81,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Eve n I may express opinion different from that given by the honourable member. He also urged the amendment moved by the honourable now engaged. member for Wimmera, and negatived on the voices, raised the question of whether or not there should be any limitation of debate in the House. I beg to differ fro the honourable member. It was a question, not of whether there should be any limishould tation, but whether there should be the particular limitation set forth in amendment, to debates in the House. That particular proposal was rejected on voices. The question that had to be considered was what degree of limitation, if any, should be imposed, and I think, Mr. Speaker, that your ruling was correct. It be allowed a speaker was for you, sir, to determine whether or not the amendment submitted by the honphraseology. orable member for Grey was frivolous. If difference of it was a material amendment, as I think it was, your ruling must be unassailable. I would follow otherwise that if an amendhave ment were submitted so badly drafted as to be unfit to be placed in the Standing Orders, it would be necessary for the House to make several amendments to put it into shape, although it would take times as long to do that as it would defeat the amendment, and to submit an entirely new proposition which would meet the wishes of the House. Even the case against your ruling, Mr Speaker, were stronger than it is, that obvious circumstances fallacy in the honourable member for Capricornia's argument would remain. do not think honourable members are likely to srffer on account of your ruling, and I hold that it ought to stand. Mr Bruce SMITH ' (Parkes) [3.38]. - The chief use of this post-mortem examination of what we did last night is that it will allow the House to determine what is the meaning of the term "" in Standing order 125 declares that an amendment cannot be received if in substance it is the same as a question The only difference between the two amendments under consideration was a slight one made in the period of time which was to be allowed. You held, Mr Speaker, that as there was a slight difference in the time allowance proposed, the amendment moved the honourable member for Grey was in sugsubstance different from that which had It is very necessary that we should know what is the real meaning of the phrase "" in substance "" as used in the standing order. We are still working an under that standing order, and at any time it may give rise to a discussion far that more important than that in which we are If your ruling, that a slight alteration such as that made last night by the honourable member for Grey in the previous proposal constitutes a dif0 m ference in substance is to stand, then the attention of the Standing Orders Committee sooner or Tarer be directed to the matter in order that the term, used in the standthe ing order in question may be made more definite. What are the facts? The hon the orable member for Grey in his amendment merely altered the period of time which the previous amendment proposed should The two amendments are practically the same in There is no virtue in a fiva or ten minutes. Any honourable member could have moved t an additional minute; and the process could been carried on ad infinitum, without any power on your part, sir, to stop it . You, Mr Speaker, may imagine you have some power, but I should like to hear you state what the power is. I hold that there ten is no parallel between this case and that to of dealing with the Tariff. It may be said that in dealing with the Tariff, where an attempt to impose a certain duty fails, if another attempt can be made to impose a slightly larger duty. But there are special in regard to a T a r if f; and the case is not at all like the case we have I under consideration. The phrase "" in substance,"" in its ordinary sense, means "" substantially "" ; and I submit that the amendment of the honourable member for Grey was substantially the same as that which had been moved by another honourable member and negatived. It is, opinion, making fools of the House to allow honourable member after honourable member to move, over and over again, identically the same proposal, with the exception of some infinitesimal alteration in time. You, Mr Speaker, might say that there was a substantial alteration, but you cannot lay down any rule in regard to that. You cannot say, "" I will allow the amendment if it means a difference of five minutes."" If five minutes will make an amendment different substantially, then so will one minute; and we could have gone through a period of one hour or two hours with sixty amendments. We are on the horns of a dilemma. If you, sir, are right, the members of the Standing Orders Committee ought to consider whether the phrase "" in substance"" should not be altered, so as to make it perfectly clear that what is substantially the same proposal shall not be put to the House again. A great deal of our time last night was not only occupied, but wasted, because, over and over again, we discussed the general principle underlying the problem, because one amendment was said to be different in substance from the other. I hope that the House, with all respect to your decisions, will see the absurdity of a ruling of this kind, and take steps either to alter the ruling by reversing your decision, or by intimating to the Committee that something should be done to give a more-accurate definition to the phrase "" in substance."" Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [3.44] - When your decision, sir, was given, it seemed to some of us wholly inconsistent with the ruling you had just immediately before laid down. The House, or a considerable section of the House, under the impression that your first ruling really amounted to a declaration that no time limitation could be included, on account of the proposal of the honourable member for Wimmera having been defeated. Immediately afterwards, when another amendment was moved, it seemed to us perfectly consistent with that view that you should rule it out of order. Where the inconsistency appeared was when, immediately after that decision in regard to the honourable member for Cook's amendment, you ruled that the amendment of the honourable member for Grey was not substantially the same as the amendment previously negatived.",22
82,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member must not discuss the ruling given on in my the amendment moved by the honourable member for Cook. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It seems almost impossible to discuss a ruling without discussing the events which led up to it, in order to show where the inconsistency lies. Since, however, you hold that I must not discuss that point, I shall refer to standing order 125 as it isNo question or amendment shall be proposed which is the same in substance as any question which durin<r the same session has been resolved in the affirmative or negative. You, Mr Speaker, gave a double-barrelled decision. You said that the amend- ment of the honourable member for Grey was "" in substance ""- not the same, but was different from the amendment which had been negatived; then, in addition, you said that the second part of the amendment opened up entirely new ground.",23
83,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member is now discussing a different proposal altogether from that before us. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I am discussing the* amendment of the honourable member for Grey, which is the subject of this motion of dissent.",23
84,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member is discussing the ruling given in relation to the amendment of the honourable member for Cook. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Not at all; I am referring to your own words, Mr Speaker, when you declared that the amendment of the honourable member for Grey was different from an amendment previously negatived. Your first ground was that the first part of the amendment of the honourable member for Grey was, in substance, different, and the second ground was that the second part of the honourable was- member for Grey's amendment was entirely different from the one which had preceded it. I leave the second ground aside, and I am now dealing with the first. At what point would the amendment have been substantially the same as any amendment which had been previously negatived? If , instead of the honourable member for Grey proposing to add five minutes to the term previously dealt with",23
85,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I point out that there was a difference in time of thirty-five minutes. Mr W, ELLIOT JOHNSON - At any rate, there was only five minutes' difference made by the amendment of the honourable member for Grey.",23

90,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Wentworth) [3.52] - I move That, in the opinion of this 'House(1) Any system of bonus or rebate of canal dues to American shipping using the Panama Canal would be detrimental to the interests of Australia. (2) That the above resolution be transmitted to the Senate for its concurrence. Until quite recently it was the general opinion among persons who had not taken the trouble to acquaint themselves with the facts, that the Panama Canal was almost purely a matter of United States concern. As a matter of strict fact, the history of the construction of, or proposals to construct, a canal across the Isthmus of Panama, goes back for several centuries. The first person who ever proposed anything of the kind was a Portuguese, Galvao, away back in the sixteenth century. He wrote a book advocating the construction of a canal joining the two oceans at interests of the world. that point. Then, after a couple of centuries, we hear of this project next at the close of the eighteenth century, when Spain, under the Prime Ministership of Godoy, proposed to start surveys to trace a desirable trans-Isthmian route; but the revolutionary troubles in Europe, together with the Franco-Spanish war, prevented the survey materializing. In 1S30, a number of concession hunters sought concessions from the Republican authorities who governed that part of the American continent, and eventually a Dutch company got one for the construction of the canal. That concession lapsed, as did several others subsequently granted to French, American, and Belgian syndicates. In 1876, and between that year and 1894, the construction of this canal became essentially a French proposition. In 1876 a French Canal Association was formed, with the great De Lesseps at its head. An International Congress was called at Paris to consider the best BILL. means of doing the work; and from that Congress a Panama Canal Company eventuated. That Panama Company failed to float the project on the first occasion; but a year or two later it was floated with a capital of no less than £120,000,000- a sum far larger than has been .found necessary for the construction of the canal under American auspices. Owing to bad management and extravagance, a vast amount of that money was wasted, and the company eventually went into liquidation. A new French company was formed to take over the assets of the old company, bat, at this juncture, French enterprise met with American opposition. Eventually, the new French company sold out its rights to the United States Government for the sum of ,£8,000,000 sterling. The interest of the United States in this matter dates back in reality to 1846, when America made with the State of New Granada-no w called Colombia- a treaty to enable America to get transportation facilities across the Isthmus of Panama, in order to conduct, on more favourable terms, her war against Mexico. Under that treaty, the United States guaranteed the sovereignty of the State of New Granada over the Isthmus of Panama. It is interesting to remember, in passing, that that sovereignty was itself violated by the United States only a short time ago, when the control of the Isthmus was given to a small republic. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That was in the",24
91,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"It may be; but it is interesting to note that the obligation of the United States in this particular to the State of New Granada was not honoured. In 1850, the United Kingdom and the United States of America entered into the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, whereby it was undertaken that neither Government would ever obtain or maintain exclusive control of any canal joining the Atlantic with the Pacific, nor erect fortifications controlling it. In 1869, President Grant, although that treaty was still in existence, recommended to Congress the construction of a canal under the sole control of the United States- a direct breach of the treaty obligation of the United States as then existing. In the 'nineties, again, President MCKinley appointed a Commission to inquire into the best route tor a canal under the control, management, and ownership of the United States. In one case, therefore, we have the United States breaking faith very possibly in the interests of the world, with the State of New Granada, and in the other, we have two Presidents recommending Congress to take a course diametrically in opposition to the treaty obligations of the United States to the Mother Country, l n 1901, a report was sent in by the Commission appointed by President MCKinley, favouring the Panama route, and in 1902 the Spooner Act bought out the old French concessionaires eventually for £8.000,000 sterling. In 1901, the Hay-Pauncefote treaty, superseding the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, was signed between the United States and the Mother Country. In this it is undertaken as between the United States and Great Britain that, "" the canal shall be free and open to the vessels of all nations, including ships of war, on terms of entire equality, so that there shall be no discrimination against any such nation, or its citizens, or its subjects, in respect of the conditions or charges of traffic or otherwise. Such conditions and charges of traffic shall be just and reasonable."" VVe have seen the way the United States broke faith with Colombia-it is regrettable, but we must remember these things-and we have seen the way two Presidents of the United States tried to ignore the ClaytonBulwer treaty. VVe now find that, although in 1901, only a few years ago, we signed, sealed, and delivered a definite treaty with the United States, not merely for the benefit of British shipping, but for the benefit of the world, there is a proposal before the American Congress which, I am glad to see for the honour of the American people, is not supported by some of their biggest men.",25
92,Mr FENTON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Is it not likely to be postponed ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is postponed.,25
93,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Has the Minister any official information to that effect ? The fact remains that a proposal is before Congress which is very seriously regarded in America. It is being worked up for the benefit of one great interest Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Shipping Ring.,25
94,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The Shipping Ring, as the honourable member graphically puts it. That proposal which is now being worked up is to break faith with us; but it has certainly not been received in the United States with unanimity, to judge, for example, by the cable news of a couple of days ago. In the cablegrams of the 16th of this month, the following was attributed to the Washington correspondent of the TimesThe debate on the Panama Bill may start at any time, when Senator Elihu Root will fight for absolute equality in the treatment of shipping. Much depends on the interpretation of the spirit of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty, with the view of determining how far it perpetuates the sense of the Clayton-Bulwer convention. Hence the fact that Colonel John Hay's successor in the State department is on Great Britain's side is of great significance. On the other hand, the opposition is active and ingenious. Meanwhile there is growing talk of arbitration on the subject. I quote that to show that the American people are not unanimously behind the ingenious device of the Shipping Ring to break American treaty obligations in this regard. It is impossible to discover officially in Australia-and this is infinitely to be regretted-exactl y in what respect America proposes to break the obligations of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty. AU we know is that some breach is contemplated. Our officers have no information to hand, although the matter vitally affects the interests of the Australian people.",25
95,Mr FENTON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Mr Root agrees, then, that that treaty should be maintained?",25
96,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Yes . I have quoted him to indicate that some big minds in the United States recognise that the reputation of Americans as a treaty-observing people is of more importance to them than are the narrow interests of their Shipping Ring. Press reports say that the proposal is to glace a charge of 6s. a ton on British and other foreign shipping using the Panama Canal, and to allow American shipping to use the canal free. I find another suggestion made by the Manchester Guardian, and quoted in the Australian press on the ist of this month, as follows- Although scrupulous Americans will the last-named policyTo give a direct rebate of canal dues to American shipping using the canalas a discreditable evasion of an international obligation, it seems to us that rebates are less injurious to foreigners than a direct exemption, inasmuch as the subsidies payable wil l come from the American Treasury, and be a burden to the American taxpayer, and not to foreign shipping and commerce. When all is said and done, however, a bonus that comes from the American Treasury comes from identically the same source as that into which the revenues from the canal will themselves go. If the revenues are big, the bonus can afford to be big. If the revenues are small, the bonus must be small, and the American people, who are essentially business-like will, if they agree to evade their direct word as pledged in the Hay-Pauncefote treaty, undoubtedly make the canal pay for the bonus to their shipping, whether it is given direct from the Treasury or not, by putting up the dues to foreign shipping using the canal. Consequently, in effect and substance, the two propositions amount to identically the same thing. Now, what does 6s. a our shipping mean to us? about half the tonnage that will use the Panama Canal will, I think, be British, since a great deal larger proportion than half using the Suez Canal is British. It will mean, therefore, that we shall have to carry the baby for the American Shipping Ring. The canal dues paid by our shipping will be 6s. per ton, whereas if everybody were on the same basis our rates could not be more than 4s. a ton, and would probably be somewhere in the vicinity of 3s. a ton. The ference between 3s. and 6s. a ton may seem to some a small question, but what does it. mean in the light of the Suez Canal dues? The Prime Minister, who, I very much regret, did not long ago realise the importance to Australia of this Panama Canal question",25
97,Mr FENTON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The British Government were a little slow in that regard.,26
98,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I am not in a position to know about the British Government; but I shall be very sorry to hear it if it is true. I do know, however, that the conversion of our Prime Minister to the importance of this subject is very recent. On the other hand, our Prime Minister realized at the last Imperial Conference denounce the importance, to Australia of keeping down the Suez Canal dues. In his opening address at the Conference, reported in the Conference reports of 23rd May of last year, I find the followingI hope I shall not be travelling beyond the subjects which call for observation today if I earnestly appeal to the President to take some strong steps to remedy a grave abuse affecting the commerce of the Empire and other countries; I allude to the exorbitant charges made upon shipping using the Suez Canal. Again, on the 19th June of last year, he is reported at page 426 of the same document to have saidSince 1896 the Commonwealth Government have made repeated and continuous representations to His Majesty's Government to endeavour to get a reduction of the charges made on shipping using the Suez Canal, and reductions have been made in recent years : In 1903, 50 centimes, amounting to sd.; in 1906, 75 centimes, amounting to 7^d.; and in .1911 (the other day), 50 centimes, amounting to 5d. The present rate is 7 francs 25 centimes, or equal to 6s. per ton - that is to say, the rate proposed for foreign shipping using the Panama Canal 1 Now this charge of 6s. a ton bears heavily on the Australian people. In the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's annual report, it is stated that ton on the company paid in Suez Canal dues the Roughly, sum of £ 3 4 4 , 9 9 2 for the year ended September, 1911. The pay of the commanders, officers, and crews of all the company's fleet for the same year totalled £ 3 4 6 , 5 0 3, so that it cost almost as much to send the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's ships through the Suez Canal as to pay all the commanders, officers, and crews on the company's vessels for the year 1",26
99,Mr FENTON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That is 6s. a ton on all Australian produce. dif- Mr KELLY - Y'es ; it should be remembered that it is Australian produce that will have to pay these dues, as the honourable member very pithily phrases it, if it is carried through the Panama Canal; but before I go on to show the importance of the matter to Australian production, I should like to call the attention of honourable members to a shipping paper called Fairflay. In its issue of 13th June, 1912, a few of the companies using the Suez Canal are quoted. It is shown that the Peninsular Steam Navigation Company send 1,205,500 of tonnage through the canal every year; the Ellerman lines, 1,158,200; Alfred Holt and Company, 1,002,800; Hansa Deutsche Dampfschiff-fahrts Gesellschaft, 847,600; Messageries Maritimes, 603,400; Norddeutscher Lloyd, 595,200; HamburgAmerica Line, 593,900; and Cayzer, Irvine, and Company (Clan line), 478,700. Other companies are enumerated, and the grand total of shipping using the Suez Canal is, according to latest returns, 16,581,000 tons in the course of the year. A great deal of this trade is Australian. For instance, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company is charged £93,600 for the service of its purely Australian steamers going through the canal. The Orient Steam-ship Company, for a slightly larger fleet, would pay about £100,000. Let honourable members think of all the other shipping going through the canal from Australia to the Old World, alf paying these dues, and all passing them on to the Australian producer who sends his goods by them. The value of the Panama Canal to Australia is twofold, strategic and commercial. As to the former, it must be remembered that Australia's danger today lies in what used to be regarded as her main safetythat is, in her isolation. Our remoteness from Old World centres, which we used to consider our safeguard, we now realise is our menace. The opening of the Panama. Canal will remove our isolation, and will bring the war centre of the Pacific very much nearer to the Mother Country, where lie the reserves of our national strength, than it would be by any other route that would be open to our people in time of war. False comparisons are made between the Suez and the Panama routes when it is forgotten that in time of war the Cape route would probably be the only existing route available from Great Britain to the East; and the distance by that route to the possible scene of operations in the Northern Pacific would be much greater than by the Panama route. The Panama Canal will be of strategic importance, too, in permitting of the free passing from the east to the west of America of the constantly growing American war fleet, and of the Canadian Unit. I shall not labour' this point; it is enough to make it clear that, in UT. Kelly. regard to both strategy and commerce, the opening of the Panama Canal will effect and Oriental a geographical revolution. The distance from New York to Melbourne via the Panama Canal will be 10,000 miles, and by the Suez Canal it is 12,790 miles; the distances to. Sydney being respectively 9,800 and 13,300 miles; and to Wellington, New Zealand, 8,500, and 14,230 miles. From Plymouth to the east coast of Australia the distance is practically the same by both routes, though the Suez route is slightly the shorter; but, as I have just pointed out, that route in war time could probably not be used. From Plymouth the distance to Melbourne by the Panama route will be 12,500 miles, and by the Suez route 10,675 miles; to Sydney, 12,400 and 11,200 miles respectively; and to Wellington, 11,000 and 12,100 miles respectively. Australia, on the opening of the Panama Canal, will no longer be at the end of a string, as it were, of shipping; she will be midway in a trade route round the world connecting its most important centres. _ At present few tourists, comparatively speaking, visit the Commonwealth. The tourist traffic of the world is a vast one, but we in Australia, knowing little or nothing of it, are ready to laugh at its value. If tourists visiting Australia, instead of having to come and return by the same route, were able to come here in comfortable steamers and return along a different route, which would show them new places, this country would cease to lie in a backwater of the world's tourist traffic, and a voyage round the world vid Australia would be one of the most popular tourist trips. What this would mean to our producers is this : A big tourist traffic would mean the employment of more steamers, which, in addition to carrying passengers, would provide accommodation for frozen produce, and their competition for freight would give our produce cheaper rates. Let me show how important is the trade in refrigerated produce even at the present time. In 1906, 174,782,000 lbs. of butter and cheese were sent from Australia, and in 1910 210,000,000 lbs. The value of what I may call the lesser lines of refrigerated or cold produce-pork , bacon, ham, and lard-exporte d in 1906 was £ 8 7 , 0 0 0 ; and, in 1910, nearly £137,000. The frozen beef exportation was valued in 1906 at £434,000, and in 1910 at £ i , i 7 9 > ' 0 0 0 the exportation of frozen mutton for those years being worth respectively £ 1 , 0 9 5 , 0 0 0 and £2,161,000. In addition, there are many other productions whose export would be encouraged by an increase in the accommodation offered by vessels of the kind I am referring to, and the vast increase which has taken place under normal .conditions shows the importance of endeavouring to provide for and to encourage still further development. The opening of the Panama Canal under fair conditions will immeasurably increase facilities fdr exportation. In addition to the trade between Australia and Europe, it must be remembered that for years money was lavished in steamship subsidies for the establishment of trade with Canada.",26
100,Mr FINLAYSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The subsidy was discontinued two years ago this month.,28
101,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I was under the impression that it had been recently recommenced. It was discontinued because the trade did not increase as was anticipated. Western Canada has had little opportunitv to develop, because there is practically no sea communication with Eastern Canada; but when the Panama Canal i opened, the sea communication between Eastern and Western Canada will be 7,000 miles shorter than it is now by the Cape Horn route. This will mean cheaper sea freights than the rail freights on the Canadian-Pacific line, and an immense development of the resources of Western Canada. When these resources have been more fully developed, our trade - with our sister Dominion across the Pacific will increase rapidly. But the advantage of which I speak will be lost if the rates - charged on British vessels passing through the Panama Canal are made higher than those charged on American vessels. British vessels are put to a disadvantage, the development of Western Canada will not receive the fillip I anticipate. trade with Canada is, of course, very small contrasted with that with Great Britain and Europe, but it is a gradually increasing one. During the years 1887 to 1891 it averaged only £ 5 0 3 ; between 1892 and 1896 it averaged £ 1 2 , 0 0 0 ; between 1897 and 1901, £ 7 7 . 0 0 0 ; and between 1902 and 19°$, £172,000. At this juncture we are faced with a «lesire on the part of certain narrow interests in America to disregard the treaty obligations of that country towards Great Britain. In making our protest against their proposal to charge differential rates, we should be careful as to the language used, though our tone should be firm, and where our rights are disregarded we should say so unequivocally. At the same time, we ought to bear in mind the fact that we hope for a constant increase in the friendliness that is beginning to be displayed- I use the word "" be g in n in g "" advisedly-betwee n the United States and the Mother Country. I trust that that friendliness will continue to increase, for the benefit of the whole world. It led America only a few years ago to make what are called arbitration proposals to the world at large. Those proposals were taken up by Sir Edward Grey in a speech that he delivered in the House of Commons, to which I had the honour of listening last year. It is not a year since we signed an arbitration treaty with the United States. If this Panama Tolls question comes to the pass to which I hope it will never come, and do not believe it will, if British communities stand up to their interests in this matter, and firmly and respectfully put their case before the American Government, what further step will be necessary ? I think that if the Hague Convention is of any value whatsoever, it should be applicable to a case like s this. American opinion seems to be afraid that if the matter should go before the Hague Convention, all the nations represented there will say that the British contention is the right one, because it suits them best. If that be all we can expect from these International Arbitration Courts, then I cannot help thinking that the phrase which was Hbellously applied to that peaceful nationality from which' I have the honour to have sprung - I refer to those who come from the Emerald Islewould more fittingly have been applied to the nations of the world- "" Fighting like If divils for conciliation, and hating each other for the love of God."" That seems to describe the state of international relationOur ships at the present time-ever y one appealing' for universal peace, and every one afraid to trust the sense of peace and justice of other peoples throughout the world.",28
102,Mr FENTON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Surely that does not apply to the relationships between Great Britain and the United States?,28
103,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I think it does, for we are undoubtedly ""fightin g like divils"" for conciliation in our respective countries. Sir Edward Grey made a speech in the House of Commons in favour of conciliation, which, although scouted in some Conservative quarters, received the endorsement of the people. . President T a f t sent "" Arbitration "" messages to Congress which received the cordial endorsement of every section of public opinion in the United States. And yet, despite all this, at the very first test of the value of the international arbitration principle, we find that America seems to be afraid to trust its case to the Hague tribunal, because, forsooth, the British case is the case of the shipping of the world ! It is very much to the honour of the British Government that that is so. I think it is very much to our interest that we should continue to press for our rights under the treaty of eleven years ago- a treaty which gave rights not only to us, but to the shipping of the world in general. In this particular case, the Prime Minister might do well to consider the desirableness of joint action with New Zealand, if , unhappily, the time should arise for us to retaliate against any neglect of our rights by the great American people. I hope the time will never come, but, should ever the occasion arise, we can best secure effective action by working in common with the sister Dominion of New Zealand. The United States is starting a new line of steamers to Australia. The sugar interest of California is, I think, behind it, and I believe that line will trade between America, New Zealand, and Sydney. Australia, by herself, can do nothing in this matter, but Australia plus New Zealand can shut out the trade of the sister Dominions from that new line of steamers just as effectively as America shuts off from Australian companies the trade between Hawaii and San Francisco.",28
104,Mr TUDOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,They consider that part of their coastal trade.,29
105,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"We might, with equal reason, consider trade between Australia and New Zealand to be part of the coastal trade of the British Empire. In international affairs, it would amount to the same thing. I do not think that Hawaii is at present a component State of the United States, and it is situated just as far, if not further, from the American coast-line as New Zealand is from Australia. We must consider common action for the defence of the undoubted rights of Australasia if our rights should be overlooked. I hope that they will not be. I trust that the action of the Prime Minister, although it was taken much too late, and taken only after this matter was pointedly brought to his attention by a member of the Opposition, will be successful. I do hope that now that the Commonwealth has lodged its protest, the people of Australia will show that they are behind the Government, and that this House will unanimously endorse this resolution, which cannot but strengthen the Prime Minister's hand, and be of value to the interests of Australian producers and the Australian Commonwealth.",29
106,Mr TUDOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [4.31] - The Prime Minister desired to speak to this motion, but he is temporarily absent from the chamber. I propose to move the adjournment of the debate.",29
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I am prepared to speak.,29
108,Mr TUDOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If that is so, I shall not move that the debate be adjourned.",29
109,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Parramatta) [4.32] - I thought that the Minister of Trade and Customs was prepared to speak on behalf of the Government, and to intimate its views respecting a matter that undoubtedly affects very seriously the producing interests of Australia. The honourable member for Wentworth has'referred to this question from the point of view of its effect upon our large staple exports, such, for instance, as wool and meat. It has an equally important bearing, however, on ether Australian interests, as, for example, the production of fruit , and the finding of markets for it abroad, and particularly in the great continent of America. One of our greatest requirements at the present time, so far as citrus fruits are concerned, is the opening up of oversea markets.",29
110,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,F o r all fruits.,29
111,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"And more particularly for citrus fruits, which will not carry to distant parts of the world quite so readily as the apples of my honourable friend's State will do. That is a very delicate and serious problem, and all our fruit growers are trying to overcome it . We have now opened up the possibility of a market much nearer than other markets abroad, and the guestion now before us, therefore, is of the greatest possible interest to the citrus fruit-growers, not only in my own electorate, but in other parts of New South Wales, as well as in Queensland, South Australia, and other parts of the Commonwealth. It is of the utmost importance that no undue bar should be placed in the way of the development of our trade under the new conditions about to be inaugurated. From that point of view, Australia, is interested in this matter of the Panama Canal dues, perhaps equally with any other country. That, of course, it putting the question on what is, perhaps, its most elementary, though none the less important, ground. But, after all, we have to live, and to live by the products of our soil for many a year to come throughout the length and breadth of this country; so that anything that affects the commercial side of these proposalsand the proposals recently made in Congress affect every man here who is dependent for his livelihood upon the soil which he cultivates-is of the greatest importance to Australia. Our handicaps are already sufficiently severe. Our great trouble is cheap carriage over the waterways of the world. In the export of our wheat, for instance, we labour under a serious handicap, compared with those great granaries that are developing in Siberia, Canada, and elsewhere Wheat is carried across the Atlantic from Canada for, I think, about 2d. per bushel, whereas it costs us abbut 7d. per bushel to send our wheat to the Old Country. That is a very serious handicap, more especially when the price of wheat in the London market falls, as it has done many a time, to 3s. per bushel. We are overcoming this handicap by cheap railway freights and other means; but it is still sufficiently serious to make us very wide awake whenever we see a possible opening for a more direct route to the world's markets, and more particularly to the markets of the great United States of America. America will very soon, so far as we can see, cease to export her own products. She is going to be more and more a great consumer of Australian products, and I believe that we must look to that country in the future for a tremendous outlet for all the products that we are able to send there. I hope to see steadily developing between the two countries a trade in f r u it and other produce. am the more interested in this matter because of the part I took years ago in fostering trade relationships between Canada and Australia. When Postmaster-General in New South Wales, I tried to carry along the mail service between Sydney and Vancouver for the whole four years that I remained in ofiice. That service did not pay us. As a mail service it was not of much practical value; but year by year, for sentimental, as well as commercial reasons, we paid a large subsidy to the line of steamers in question, notwithstanding that that service was always inadequate for the work that it set out to do. I re[38] ' member how, in the old days, Mr Huddart, who is now in his grave, and who was r one of the staunchest and bravest men that Australia has produced, lost his whole fortune in trying to develop trade alonji this line. He was one of the pioneers of Australia, and sunk all that he had made here in trying to foster trade relations between Canada and Australia. No doubt commercial instincts prompted him to embark on the enterprise, but it turned out to be a very unprofitable speculation. It was immensely profitable, however, for the Empire at large, and I believe that his enterprise assisted many of the developments we have seen in later days. There are in Australia today men seeking their own interests year by year, and at the same time building, better than they know, into the fabric of Empire those things which make for its stability, its success, and its prosperity. There are similar pioneers at the present time in our Pacific Islands. They are working for themselves, but in conducting their own commercial enterprises they are, in reality, doing an immense service to the State. Amongst those who have rendered this service must be numbered the late Mr James Huddart, who spent the whole of his fortune in trying to develop means of communication between Canada and Australia. I am glad, and always shall be, that I was enabled to help him in a legitimate way in that enterprise. The mail service to which I refer was continued until two years ago, when it ceased, and - I think it is almost a pity that it did. It is worth continuing, even if it does not pay, and does not show any adequate return for the money we expend. I believe these enterprises must pay in the end; they pay indirectly in a thousand ways, although we I may not see a balance struck on the right side of the commercial ledger. I hear today from the honourable member for Wentworth that this line has been reinstated by the present Government.",29
112,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I certainly think that some time ago there were proposals for its reinstatement.,30
113,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I know the matter was under discussion a little while ago, but nothing came of it. ",30
114,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It ceased two years ago.,30
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I hope that the service will be reinstated very shortly with better prospects. However, I shall not unduly criticise the Government in this respect. They regarded this as a commercial venture, and, as such, it was not a paying one; but I believe that the possibilities ahead of us in the opening of this canal, and the collateral tradewbich will be developed, will soon make it a commercially profitable undertaking.",30
116,Mr TUDOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Every one of the vessels have since come on to Australia.,31
117,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The amount of trade is still insignificant, though I believe it will develop very largely as a result of the opening of the canal. Any project to provide waterways, for our produce we ought to foster, even if it cost us money; we cannot spend too much in facilitating transport.",31
118,Mr FENTON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Otherwise , what is the use of stimulating production here?",31
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Quite so. We have a virgin country of many acres and few men; and we must for many years have a tremendous quantity of surplus produce to export. This is a rare heritage that many nations envy us. Until the time comes when we can consume our own products we must, as for our very life's blood, look to markets oversea. Therefore, I am glad to see this project developing in the way it is; and sorry, indeed, that the American nation is taking such a stand with regard to the imposition of differential rates. -' Mr .MCWILLIAMS - It is only bluff; those rates will not be imposed.",31
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I am inclined to think that there is a good deal of bluff about the proposal.,31
121,Mr ARCHIBALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Muc h of it is due to the Presidential election ,31
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I dare say that has a great deal to do with the matter. At any rate, we may be glad that a great American-perhap s one of the greatest men in the world today, Mr Elihu Root, is on our side; and with him there must be a tremendous body of American opinion in favour of doing away with the proposed restriction, and of keeping the pact, made years ago, on the faith of which this canal has been constructed with practically no cavil of any sort by any of the nations. We may look hopefully to that body of opinion in America which is recognising the obligations to the world at large of this trusteeship of a great waterway_j and we may expect to see fair treatment all round. I do not know whether the honourable member for Wentworth said anything as to the strategic position of this canal; but, again, I. welcome this work from that point of view. With all the possibilities of danger it opens up, it does permit the American Fleet to come nearer to us; and I shall keep on believing that this is for our benefit, and not to our detriment. The nearer we can get to these great engines of war that America has constructed already, and must construct in the future, the better for us. I believe that, in the long run, blood will tell; and from that point of view we may be glad that geographical boundaries are being removed, thus permitting the nations to come closer together. Of course, there are peculiar perils attending the transposition of affairs which will inevitably result from the opening of this means of communication; but I think the advantages to Australia outweigh the disadvantages. We ought to be glad, not only from the point of view of the development of our trade,, but because we are coming closer to the great nation which has so much in common with us. In the final clash of arms which may some day come, we shall be nearer to friendly guns than we should be if this waterway had not been constructed. I feel very warmly on this question from the view-point of our producers, because there is no question that concerns them more nearly. We are, as I say, getting closer to a race which sprang from our own, and which I believe retains its ideals, and is destined to share in whatever triumphs await the race.",31
123,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.46] - The motion is in keeping with the attitude of the honourable member for Wentworth during last session, and in the interval. There is nothing to object to in the proposal; whether it is necessary or not is another matter.",31
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"It is friendly, anyhow.",31
125,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Yes . The honourable member for Wentworth may be acquainted with the cablegram which was sent by this Government to the Secretary for the Colonies on the 3rd May, 1912, as followsSecretary of State for the Colonies, London. Government of the Commonwealth of Australia would be glad if you would furnish by telegram all available information .as to the present position of matters in the TJnited States Congress in respect to proposed charges on vessels using the Panama Canal. .Government presumes that His Majesty's Government has made protest against adoption of suggested exemption of vessels owned in the United States as being in contravention of Hay-Pauncefote Treaty 1901, and Government of the Commonwealth of Australia desires to associate itself with such protest, inasmuch as action on the lines suggested by United States would be regarded with great disfavour throughout Commonwealth. This is not a matter that calls for debate. I have no official correspondence giving the information we have sought, but I have another channel of communication to which I am not permitted to make any reference here. I am clearly of opinion that this is a pure question of treaty rights as between the United States and Great Britain. The cabled information regarding the action of ' the United States Senate seems to indicate that the matter will be held up pending the negotiations that will take place between two perfectly friendly nations. I have no doubt in my own mind that an amicable arrangement between Great Britain and the United States will be arrived at before this great water-way is open. The Commonwealth Government are just as conscious as any one can be of the importance of this new water-way of commerce between Australia, the South Pacific, and other parts of the world, and also of the necessity, probably, of obtaining some rights over the islands which intervene between this great country and the new water-way. I do not think it is necessary to discuss the question any further, in view of the position of affairs at the present time. All we need say is that we strongly favour the motion, especially as the treaty makes the position of Great Britain and ourselves quite clear. VVe protest, in a friendly way, against the privileges given to United States shipping by the decision of the Senate, but we hope, before long, that the matter will be settled by negotiation between the two great nations that alone have power to negotiate in the matter. All we can do as a Dominion of the British Empire is to ask the Government of the United Kingdom, as we have done, to make our representations in association with their own, and to suggest a friendly determination on the lines of equity - and justice that will bear fruit, not only now, but in the future, to the benefit of both peoples and both countries.",31
126,Mr FINLAYSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If it be convenient, I suggest that the debate be adjourned.",32
127,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Has the Prime Minister any objection to the motion being carried now,32

131,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"As the motion has not been moved, it lapses. NA AUSTRALIA.",32
132,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Franklin) [4.54]. - I move That a Koyal Commission, consisting of members of this House, be appointed to inquire into and report upon the most prompt and effective methods of developing the natural resources of the tropical portions of Australia, and of establishing therein a permanent population. Ever since I have been in the House I have held the belief that a Royal Commission of members of the House is the very best tribunal to elicit the facts of a case; and the settlement of the Northern Territory is the most vitally important subject with which this Federal Parliament has to deal at the present time. I was one who, to the utmost of my ability, opposed the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the South Australian Government for the surrender of the Territory under the terms of the contract. But this Parliament having accepted the agreement, t it behoves every one of us to make the best of the bargain; and the only means by which we can save the people of the country from an enormous Joss is by effectively settling the tropical parts with, or, at least, giving the first chance to, British people. The history of the Territory shows that the ? means we are now adopting are not the best to secure the result we all desire. Two years ago I spent many weeks in studying the history of the Northern Territory from its first settlement at Melville Island; but I have no wish to repeat that history now. The system we are adopting now is the one that failed in the establishment of Melville Island, Port Essington, Raffles Bay, and two or three other settlements, and, lastly, Port Darwin. In settle the northern parts of the Territory from the tropical area-that is, the malarial area and the tick area-w e have spent over £ 3 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and we have about 1.000 white persons there today-a n expenditure, roughly, of £ 3 , 5 0 0 per head, yet the Government are now adopting precisely the same system that has failed in every experiment that has been made. Notice has also been given of a Government proposal to construct a railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine River, but before we rush headlong into an expenditure on railway construction there, the Government and their experts ought to know a great deal more about the country than they clo. The interesting bulletins supplied by the officers recently sent up there are all tentative. There is not one of the officers who does not say that the time at his disposal has not allowed him to do this or examine that. To commence rail- by those costly errors. way construction there now from the north, as the Government are proposing, with the information to hand, is simply taking a leap in the dark.",32
133,Mr ROBERTS,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,What is being undertaken - is the permanent survey; there is no construction.,33
134,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"There can be no object in making a permanent survey if the railway is not to be constructed in the event of the survey proving acceptable. Much as I opposed the terms of the contract which compels the Commonwealth to construct the railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, I hold strongly that on the day that we agreed to that contract with South Australia, the Federal Parliament became in honour bound to fulfil its terms to the letter. One of my chief reasons for protesting against taking over the Terc ritory was that the terms of the contract were unfair to the Commonwealth, because it compelled us to build that line. Parliament in its wisdom having passed the Act, there is nothing to be done but to complete the work. That we are in honour bound to do. This is the first railway that we should construct, because I believe its construction is one of the terms of the contract under which South Australia surrendered the Northern Territory. The necessity for some such Commission as I am proposing is shown by the procedure that is now being adopted. The Government are repeating precisely the same policy that has already ended in disaster. In 1875 ^ e same policy was adopted. trying to When wages for miners here were about 7s. 6d. a day, they were taken to the north, with free passages, and paid £ 4 ios. per week, with precisely the same result as the Government are getting on the farm they are now establishing there. We must find out first the capabilities of the Territory, and every step taken by the Government should be a step in the direction of a complete and concrete policy. The patchwork policy of appointing a large* number of highly-paid officials there, and starting the survey of a railway before we know what the country there is like, or where it will lead us, is simply repeating the fatal errors of the past. I do not intend to reflect upon those who carried"" out that policy in the old days. They believed they were doing the right thing, or they would not have done it, but this Parliament will not be doing its duty to those who elected it if it does not profit If a Commission were appointed of men from both sides of the House who have taken an interest in this subject, I believe they could secure the necessary information to enable them to bring up a report showing the mistakes of the past as beacons, and giving all the information possible as to the future. The Government could then bring down a complete policy to be carried out step by step as the finances of the country warrant, and as the settlement of the Territory progresses. I am confident that the policy we are now proposing will result in a very costly failure, and, more serious still, once more throw back the settlement of the Northern Territory for \'ears. Australia has been in possession of the Northern Territory for nearly a century. The settlement in Melville Island began practically about the same time as those in Sydney and Hobart; but whereas in all other parts of Australia there has been progress, and there is prosperity, and money has been But, spent to good advantage, the Northern Territory alone has stood out as one of the most disastrous failures of British settlement in any part of the world. We should never repeat those blunders now, just when the Commonwealth has backed the Territory to the extent of £ 3 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0, as we did by taking over the indebtedness from .South Australia. It is our duty now to set to work to make the Territory a profitable going concern. I believe that could the done if this House took the matter thoroughly in hand, and adopted a common-sense system of settlement. The only system of settlement which I believe will ever be successful there is some form of community settlement. We do not even iknow whether we are proceeding now from the right end or not. . Men of good authority say there is really good country in the southern portions of the Territory. If that is so, the better policy would perhaps be to proceed northwards with a line from Oodnadatta and settle the Territory from that direction. There is no evidence before the Government or the House to warrant us in plunging headlong into the railway construction project which the Government have put forward. These cockspur railways will not be a success.",33
135,Mr MATHEWS,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,It is not a cockspur that is suggested; it is the route that is eventually to be followed.,34
136,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Is that the policy of the Government? Are they starting - out on the construction of a railway to the Katherine River with the intention of - casting the overland line from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta to one side, and running the main line through Queensland? If that is the Government's intention, let them say so.",34
137,Mr WISE,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,The route to the Katherine River will be part of the Oodnadatta route also.,34
138,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Then the House should know it. Personally, I want to see a white population, a British population, - settled in the Territory. To make another blunder now in the settlement of the Territory would be fatal to our chance of securing a white population there for very many years to come. It' comes as a slap in the face to a man going north to learn that during the last ten or twelve years the white population north of Cairns, including Northern Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Northern Western Australia, has decreased by from 25 to 30 per - cent. In the very part of Australia where we cannot afford to lose our white population, we are losing it every year, every month, and every day. A patchwork policy - such as is now being proposed-plantin g a few men in the Territory with the incentive - of 25 per cent, increase in their wagesw ill not increase the population of Northern Australia. The matter must be taken in hand as part of a fixed solid policy; and before the House commits itself to any expenditure in that direction, the fullest and most complete inquiry should be made into the whole circumstances. The information gained by a Commission such as I propose would not be confined to the report that they would present to the House. The members would return to this chamber with full and complete knowledge of the subject, and give us the benefit of their advice and experience. I hope this matter will be taken up seriously by honourable members, with a recognition of the enormous responsibilities that are devolving upon us, because a very awkward question has been raised within the last few years. When Germany occupied a portion of West Africa that was really under the Portuguese flag, and Portugal protested to the Powers, Germany's answer was that Portugal was not effectually occupying the territory; and the reply held good. What answer could Australia give today to any nation that claimed that we were not effectually occupying the northern portions of Australia? Three hundred and thirty-five million acres of land in the Northern Territory alone with a white population of 1,000 on it ! We could not even pretend that we were effectually occupying the Northern Territory, and I believe that, sooner or later, some nation will ask Australia that awkward question. It behoves us to see that when we advocate a White Australia, we are not advocating an empty Australia, so far as concerns one half of out area. The appointment of a Commission such as I am advocating would, I am sure, bring the question of effectually settling the northern portions of Australia within the range of practical politics. It has not been so since I have been a member of the House, nor has it been so for the last century, so far as the Northern Territory is concerned. In respect to its want of population, the Northern Territory does not differ from one-third of Western Australia and the Gulf country of Queensland. It is our duty to determine a proper policy for the development of these uninhabited areas, and, as the Government seems to lie repeating the fatal mistakes which cost South Australia £3,500,000 in the settlement of a few hundreds of white persons, we should insist on more information being obtained, so that we may be able to determine the right course to pursue.",34
139,Mr RYRIE,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"North Sydney) [5.13]-The honourable member for Franklin was quite justified in moving this motion. The thern Territory, it may be populated for us appointment of a Royal Commsision would largely assist us in determining how to about populating the enormous tracts of uninhabited country in the north of Ausas tralia. As the mover rightly pointed out, this is a problem which we must make every effort to solve. The world will not long look on and allow the northern parts Australia to remain practically empty. I we do not make an effort to populate them, we shall be called to account sooner or later. The investigation of a Commission velopment are inadequate. would do much to suggest a means to the end we seek. It seems to be thought some that, because the Government wish to give the new Administrator of the Northern Territory as free a hand as possible, the carrying of the motion would mean an inAdministrator, terference with his administration; but, my view, it is the duty of this Parliament to formulate a policy for the development of the Northern Territory, leaving its administration with the Administrator. The proposed Commission would collect infornot mation which, I believe, would make it clear that railway communication must be estabmind regarding the proposal. lished between the southern and northern I am not satisfied with the methods adopted parts of Australia. To my mind, such communication is essential to the solving the difficulty with which we are confronted; certainly, without railway communication the settlement of the Northern Territory will answer to my criticism. be impossible. A Commission would ascerwealth tain what route the railway should follow. I am aware that there is a compact between the Commonwealth and the South Australian Government requiring the construction of line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, and do not wish that compact to be broken; the but it does not prevent us from making some other line first, and I think that investigaportion. tion would prove that the first line of munication should go from Bourke along Australia the Queensland border to Tobermorey.

One member of the Commission, we are told, is to possess a knowledge iland matters, while the others will be iperienced in port and harbour work. My idea is that we should proceed to develop :the Northern Territory by starting in :more temperate latitudes, and gradually work northwards until we reach the tropical and semi-tropical parts of Ausmore tralia. I am very anxious that something shall be done to develop the Territory, - that instead of showing, as it does, a - deficit, it will soon be converted into 'highly profitable asset of the Commonvinced wealth. Very little is being done at isent to bring about that happy result. 'Various officers have been appointed to public positions in the Territory, and time - will tell whether or not they are qualified - for the posts they hold. But unless active - steps be taken to develop the Territory, rshall find every year, when the Budget ---delivered, that its working continues to :show a heavy loss.

Like the honourable - member for North Sydney, I believe that if we pursue a vigorous policy of railway --construction, settlement will rapidly follow. There is no occasion for a Commission to ifbe appointed to inquire into the question railway construction. We already have in our records the details of a survey that was made in 1886, as well as a statement showing all the difficulties of the country to be crititraversed between Oodnadatta and the Barklay tablelands. Estimates have also prepared as to the cost of the construcGoverntion of permanent way, bridges, and so forth, so that no further inquiry is necessary in that regard. In urging that development must first take place in the more rultemperate parts of the Territory, and keep gradually spread into the sub-tropical and t tropical districts, it may be thought that I on am influenced by the fact that I am a rewe presentative of South Australia, but I am confident that time will prove the correctBy making a start from the south in the construction of a'railway, we should considerably reduce its cost. We should in that way effect a saving of at least one-third of the cost, inashave much as it would not be necessary to carry and the workmen and the material required over long sea voyages to the point at which a of start had to be made. Men setting to work exupon such an undertaking in the southern part of the Territory would find the climate as good as it is in Adelaide, or any other the city in Australia. Then, again, it seems to me that the sons of our old pioneers who have not been able to secure land in the settled parts of Australia would be prepared to take up areas in the more temso perate parts of the Northern Territory., heavy Settlement so started would gradually dea velop in a northerly direction. I am conthat just as sheep and cattle-farming prematerially assisted in the development of other parts of Australia in the pioneering fill days, so those industries will help to develop the Northern Territory, and will be followed later on by closer settlement. Sheep and cattle would gravitate naturally we from the southern districts towards the is northern districts, whereas, if developmental work were started in the north, stock would have to be carried over a costly route and dumped down into tick-infested areas. would thus serve to carry the conintagion into parts of the Territory where no",36
145,Mr SPEAKER,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Does the honourable member think that the proposed Royal Commission would inquire into that matter?  naturally inquire into the facilities offering for the carrying of stock, and also take into of consideration the most suitable point at which to enter upon the construction of extensive developmental works. It would cost much more to build a railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, if a start were made from the north, than it would do if operations were commenced in the south. If we let a contract tomorrow for the construction of that line, the contractor would, I am sure, commence operations in the south. He would take into consideration the cost of conveying labour to the scene of operations, and also the facilities offering for taining relays and for the supply of material and rolling-stock. From an economic stand-point, it seems to me that it is possible to begin the developing of the Northern Territory only in the southern and more temperate parts of the country. The, proposed Commission would take into consideration the best means of opening up the country to young fellows of the class to whom I have referred, and of supplying them with stock. This Parliament has undoubtedly cast upon it a very great responsibility, which, sooner or later, must be faced. It is useless to try to stave it off, either by the appointment of a Royal Commission or in any other way. The situation must be faced, and there is ample evidence that we should be justified in undertaking a great public works policy in the Territory. There are many other matters to which I should like to refer, but in view of your ruling, Mr Speaker, I am unable to do so. I approach the consideration of this question with a perfectly open mind, but, viewing the matter even from the sordid stand-point of pounds, shillings, and pence, it must be recognised that the greater the delay in dealing with the problem that confronts us, the more difficult and costly will be its solution. We are not going to accomplish that which we all desire merely by spending a few pounds here and there, by making a chance survey, or even by appointing a Royal Commission. We can develop the Territory only by means of a vigorous public works policy, which should embrace i . proposal for the construction of the railway from the south to the north. v I am sure it would prove profitable to have spur lines connecting the other parts of the Commonwealth with that great trunk line. There is only one line to develop the Northern Territory, and that is a through line; and when I speak of "" one line,"" I do not say whether that line should go so many miles east or so many miles west, but I refer to a through trunk line traversing the greater part of the area. Such a line should  cover the temperate portions, and from therethe tropical parts could be gradually developed. I am debarred from referring: to past policies, and shall have to takeanother opportunity to do so. I repeat, that I have an open mind; I shall not commit myself either for or against the proposal until I have further information;. but I shall use whatever influence I have on every possible occasion in this House ob- to insure the adoption of a progressive policy.",36
146,Mr SAMPSON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Wimmera) [5.41] - The honourable member for Franklin is to be commended for proposing to deal with what has been described as the greatest problem amongst those we have to faceBut whether a Royal Commission is the best means is a question on which there isnecessarily great difference of opinion. I am inclined to think that the appointment of a Royal Commission would mean a delay of, possibly, two or three years beforewe could hope for the introduction of a broad and comprehensive policy. But there are certain directions in which investigations is very necessary, and which should be followed without delay. The honourable member for Grey pointed out that one of the great duties of this Parliament is toinitiate a public works policy; and with, this view I am in thorough accord. Thereshould be appointed a permanent Committee, charged with the important responsibility of recommending the construction of public works connected with railways, water conservation, experimental stations for tropical agriculture, and with the engineering ability which should undoubtedly be represented, irrigation works. Such a Committee is necessary, not for the purpose of drawing up one report for this Parliament to deal with, but successive reportson public works, as these are deemed to be required. These reports presented to the House from time to time would give honourable members definite information and; data, on which to vote the necessary money. Before we can lay down the foundationsof settlement it will be necessary to expend millions of money in the constructions of public works; and we ought certainly to have some such guidance as I have suggested. There is another direction irr which a non-parliamentary expert Commission would be extremely useful. I mean* a Commission to investigate and report on the hygienic conditions of the Territory. If I remember aright, a very able report was presented to the South Australian Government by a medical man of that Stats, Dr Ramsay Smith. That gentleman took .the trouble to investigate the statistics for Ihe northern part of tropical Australia, and ihe showed that the death rate in the white :population compared rather favourably with - the death rate in the southern parts of the - Commonwealth. This would seem to show that, with proper care, it is possible to establish a white population in the north. We know, however, that we have not reached anything like definite conclusions Hn this regard. The Government have, T 'believe, established stations in the northern part of Queensland for the investigation of malaria and other diseases common to tropical countries; and, though reports - have been presented from time to time, :they are, in my opinion, altogether inade»quate. A Commission of medical men .should be appointed for the purpose of traversing the whole of the northern parts - of Australia and presenting to this Parliament comprehensive reports dealing with - jthe hygienic aspects of the problem, and with the precautions necessary for the preservation of human life and health. J . W. Barrett, of Melbourne, has paid .a good deal of attention to this question, - and has contributed to the Argus much valuable information, to which, I think, - the Government might pay some regard. Mr RICHARD FOSTER. - Dr Strangman, - of Port Darwin, has studied these questions all over the world.",37
147,Mr SAMPSON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"That is so. It has foeen shown that in Asiatic countries, such as the Malay States, investigation and experiment in the hospitals have had the - effect of reducing the death-rate by at .least one-half.",38
148,Mr GROOM,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Is not Dr Breinl investigating the question?,38
149,Mr SAMPSON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Yes , and we have -.had some very valuable reports from him. But this is a question which should be - dealt with much more comprehensively. At Port Darwin, very largely through the - efforts of Dr Strangman, malaria has heen - reduced almost to a minimum. is a case reported by a resident of the - town, and this shows how, by strict at-tention to diet and other precautions, it is possible to almost stamp out diseases which were formerly regarded as inevitable in - such latitudes. The same doctor told me that most of the malarial cases came from '-the back-blocks where the mosquitoes are very numerous; and it may be necessary to *take stringent measures to deal with the pest which is held to be largely responsible for the disease. Diet and other conditions of health have to be closely observed, because those who allow their systems to get low easily become a prey, not only to malaria, but to many other diseases.",38
150,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,The mosquito will carry the disease irrespective of the state of the health of the subject.,38
151,Mr SAMPSON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Dr Strangman tells me that people who do not take a proper diet, and otherwise neglect themselves, are the most likely to be attacked by malaria. The problem ought not to be attacked in the piecemeal or limited fashion we have hitherto seen. An expert Commission of medical men should traverse - the country and report as to how far it is possible for the Government to intervene as a Board of Health, so as to make that part of Australia reasonably safe for the settlement of white people. I do not favour the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the whole question of the development of the natural resources of the northern parts of Australia; that is a duty Dr which should be undertaken by the Government by means of a policy. I believe valuable and speedy work could be done in the two directions I have indicated. First, I suggest a Standing Public Works Committee from which we could have almost immediate results, and, secondly, a small expert Commission to investigate diseases, not only in the Northern Territory, but throughout the whole of the tropical portions of Australia. The duty rests with the Commonwealth to show the world that in the tropical portions of the continent it is possible to establish progressive settlement by the same type of people as are to be found in the southern States. If the Government give attention to the two points I have raised fhey will be able to do much for the development of this country. *",38
152,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Hindmarsh) [5.54]. - I regret that a motion of this character has been introduced. Owing to your deRarely cision, Mr Speaker, it is very difficult to say anything of value about the Northern Territory. All that we can doj if I may so venture to describe it, is to indulge in a sort of nibbling at a very important question. The honourable member for Wimmera seems to be in favour of spending money with a vengeance. No doubt, we shall have to spend a great deal of money in the development of the Northern Territory, but I see no necessity to fit out expeditions for the purpose of wasting, money as quickly as it can be wasted. The honourable member is not in favour of a Royal Commission, but of some sort of Commission of experts, one of the primary objects of which would be to chase mosquitoes all over the Northern Territory. Mr: SAMPSON - That is treating question in a flippant way. ' Mr ARCHIBALD - That is what it amounts to, anyhow. We might add to the scope of the inquiry the life habits of 'the white ant, but in any case it would certainly cost a great deal of money, and I do not know that the people of Australia would be any the better off for the information obtained, although I suppose we should have the satisfaction of telling our constituents that we had taken some interest in the Northern Territory. There is any amount of information about the Northern Territory in the various blue books of South Australia, and if the House so desires, it can instruct the Government to have a great many of the papers on the subject reprinted. By this means we should obtain some very valuable information. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Some of is very highly coloured.",38
153,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Assuming , for the sake of argument, that some of it is, it is not all of that description. The honourable member for Wimmera referred to the report of Dr Ramsay Smith, an excellent and able medical man in South Australia. He is one of the ablest men in the medical profession today, but the medical union, unfortunately, considered that he did a bit of "" black-legging,"" and he got into pretty hot water on that account. They have tried for years, in season and out of season, to disparage him in every way, but by ability and force of character he has risen superior to all # attacks. He bears testimony, to the healthiness of the Northern Territory, and he is eminently fitted to express an opinion. He is familiar with the East, and with Africa, and well acquainted with the opinions of men of equal calibre in other parts of the world. From what we know, there is no necessity for us, when starting to develop the Territory, to go to a lot of expense in ^ connection with medical matters. If it were proved to be necessary, I should not object to the appointment of one or two men as a Commission' to inquire into the conditions of the whole of the tropical portions of Australia., but I do not think there is anything to warrant it at. the present time. I hope the House, will not appoint, the proposed CommissionCommissions should never be formed unlessthere is a very strong reason for them. It is the business of the Government of the day to furnish this Parliament with inforthe mation on all important matters that come before it.",39
154,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,It would be another picnic.,39
155,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I have been onseveral South Australian Commissions, and never found them very great picnics. Theday of picnic Commissions is long past, if it ever existed to the extent that we are told. We are now in the final session of this Parliament, so that if the Commission was appointed its members would have no opportunity to tackle their work this year. Early, next year honourable members will probably devote their energies to making their "" calling, and election sure."" In the circumstances, would it not be a farce to appoint such a Commission now ? It would also be a piece of presumption on our part in the last session of this. Parliament. We. might well leave the matter it to the new Parliament. If a strong case for the appointment of a Commission could be made out in the first session of the new Parliament, it might complete its labours before that Parliament expired, but the honourable member has not made out at all a strong case for action by this Parliament. I have always understood that tropical agriculture does not pay in comparison with the agriculture that can be carried on in the south of Australia. There is not the same money in it, and it generally requires a good deal of capital toundertake it. With the exception of thetea plantations of Ceylon, I doubt whether there is to be found in tropical agriculture any proposition of a paying character to be compared with the wheat and wool industries of Australia. The successful prosecution of tropical agriculture is one of the most difficult problems that Australia has to faceWhat information could the proposed Commission obtain in the Northern Territory abouc tropical agriculture? Here, again,, the Government might come to our assistance. The recognised policy of Australia today is to keep this a white man's country, and not to have anything to do with coloured labour. By what method, then, are we going to develop tropical production? That question may be answered by making an inquiry into the most up-to-date - machinery employed in the world for the purpose. In some tropical countries, is grown in the same primitive way as ^followed 3,000 years ago, but in the Southern States of America it is now being an immense sum of money. .grown in large quantities in a payable t>y a system of machinery.

It relates to the Prahran Post Office and the negotiations that have been going on between various Departments of the Commonwealth and the council of the city of Prahran for the erection of a new building. These negotiations were opened up as far back as 15th June, 1909. On that date the Prahran City Council wrote to me, as the representative of the district, drawing attention to the need for a new post office, and pointing out the great increase in business that had taken place and the limited accommodation available. June, 1909, the honourable member for Bendigo, who was then Postmaster-General, wrote to me stating that if the Prahran City Council submitted an offer of £ 5 , 0 0 0 for the surrender of the lease-that being the amount paid by the Government for the lease of the postal premises attached to the Town HaU buildings-suc h an offer would be considered. On 7th July following, the Prahran City Council wrote to the Postmaster-General offering £ 5 , 0 0 0 for the surrender of the lease and the right to resume possession of the premises, and also pointing My ex- out the necessity for a new post-office.

We saw a man being sweated there, and a number of people trying to do business in a building in which the accommodation was altogether inadequate. honourable member said that he thoroughly approved of the action taken by his predecessor, and that he would have a new building erected as soon as possible. matter was then referred to the Department of Home Affairs, and in January, 1911, the present Minister of Home Affairs condemned the building as being perfectly useless for the purposes of a. post-office, and joined with me in a tour of the neighbourhood in search of a suitable site. On the following day I left Australia for England, and the honourable gentleman told me as I was leaving that when I came back I would see a splendid postal building in the city of Prahran. turned, and found that no new building had been erected. What actually happened? On 2ist March, 1911, the council waited on the Minister of Home Affairs to urge the carrying out of the agreement for the surrender of the lease on payment of the sum of £ 5 , 0 0 0 . The Minister informed them that the Postmaster-General had nothing to do with that matter beyond intimating to the Department of Home Affairs that the premises were unsuitable for the requirements of the post-office. That statement was made after the honourable gentleman had verbally confirmed the action of two Postmasters-General. He went on to say, in reply to the deputation, that he had inspected the premises, and had valued them at £ 1 2 , 0 0 0, or £ 4 5 0 per annum. He was of opinion that the re-transfer should not be made. The office was, in his opinion, most centrally situated. £ 5 0 0 the postmaster could be removed to other quarters, and sufficient accommodation provided in the present premises for the performance of postal duties. Finally, the Minister directed Colonel Owen to inspect several sites in the vicinity of the post-office next day. I do not wish to go further into the matter, more than to say that negotiations went on in one way or another until the other day, the 12th July, when the Minister of Home Affairs wrote to me stating that, as it had been decided to utilize the Prahran Post Office building for the purposes of a Commonwealth Bank, it was not now proposed to proceed further with the negotiations for its disposal. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Rea d the proon posal I made to the council.",42
169,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I shall do so if the Postmaster-General. the Minister thinks it important. On the pointed, 21st March, 1911, the Minister said he was not going on with the agreement, which The had been hanging fire, although it had been made with the council of Prahran on the 2ist July, 1909.",43
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Does the honourable The member suggest that one Minister breaks the promise of another Minister?,43
171,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Absolutely . On the 22iid-March, 1911, Colonel Owen inspected the sites and informed the mayor that, as the Chapel-street property was too dear, he considered a site in High-street, west of Chapel-street, the most convenient. On 5th August, 1911, the council wrote to the Postmaster-General forwarding the draft surrender of the lease, and stating I re- that the council was ready to pay the £ 5 , 0 0 0 at any time on the execution of the surrender. Honourable members will observe fhat nothing was done for a whole month, for it was not until 5th September that a reply was received from the Post-'"" master-General stating that, before the transfer could be effected, it was necessary to obtain the consent of the Governor General under sections 63 and 64 of the Lands Acquisition Act 1906, and that the matter liad been referred to the L'epartment 'of Home Affairs. Even then the Postmaster General of the day, the present Minister of External Affairs, stuck to his guns like a man, and said he had made a bargain which would be kept. On 8th September, 1911, I wrote stating that Mr O'Malley had promised to visit Prahran that day with a view to inspecting a site for the new post-office. On 13th September I wrote For stating that the Minister had been unable to inspect the site on the 8th, owing to an all-night sitting of Parliament, but that he had definitely promised to do so next day. On 19th September a letter was received saying that the Minister of Home Affairs would inspect two sites on the Friday, and that he would be in a position to make an offer to the council. That, it will be observed, was after the business had been closed. On 8th March, 191 z, some months later, the Minister of Home Affairs wrote to the council stating that the Commonwealth was prepared to accept £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 for its interest in the property. On 27th March the council replied that it was not prepared to contribute the sum demanded in view of the arrangement made in 1909 for the acquisition of the property payment of the sum of £ 5 , 0 0 0 , the acceptance of which offer was approved by The council out that it was still prepared to pay £5,000, and asked the Minister of Home Affairs to reconsider his offer. On 9th May the Minister of Home Affairs replied that the offer of £5,000 could not be entertained, and on 12th he coolly wrote me a letter to say that, as it had been decided to utilize the Prahran Post Office building for the purposes of a Commonwealth Bank, it was not now proposed to proceed further with the negotiations for its disposal.",43
172,Mr SAMPSON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,What about the new post-office ?,44
173,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Apparentl y the convenience of this great neighbourhood is not to be studied at all ; and I should like honourable members to know the position of this great district in regard to post-office accommodation. The small portion of the council building in question has a frontage of only 30 feet to Chapel-street with a depth of 150 feet on the ground floor and 70 feet on the top floor. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That represents over £10,000 for land alone.",44
174,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I do not wish to discuss the question of the value, but the question of a bargain which had been made. We must, however, recollect that this property, according to the deed of grant, must be used for no other purposes except those of a post-office. If it be sold, it must be to some one acquiring the post-office. The original sum paid by the State Government to the council of Prahran for this portion of the ground and the building on it was £5,000. That was in 1879, when the population was 19,000, as compared with the present population of 46,000 served by the same post-office. The accommodation, needless to say, is altogether inadequate. The honourable member for Bendigo, when Postmaster-General, visited the post-office, and said it was one of the most outrageously inadequate in Victoria. In this opinion he was supported by his successor, the present Minister of External Affairs; and the Minister of Home Affairs, when he visited the place, said the same thing. however, are comparatively minor points. The business done in the parcels-post branch by the distributing warehouses thereabouts is so enormous that the railway authorities at Prahran have had to extend their goods sheds. It is absurd to suppose that such a business can be conducted in a post-office erected on an area such as I have described; and I may say that the top floor cannot be extended without shutting out the light to the town hall. Under the circumstances, it is perfectly preposterous to talk of conducting a bank on the ^ premises. A very fair bargain was made between the State (Government and the council of Prahran in 1879. Of course, I may point out that the council got the land free, and that, therefore, a charge of £5,000 was reasonable.",44
175,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"The council' desired the £5,000 to help in the erection of the town hall ",44
176,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Quite so. What usually happens is that a council, having got the land free, erects a building at a cost of £40,000 or £50,000; and in this case the council decided to dispose of a portion for £5.000 to the State Government .for postal work. When the Commonwealth was instituted the post-office was transferred at the same charge of £5,000. I may say that the condemnation of the building was supported by the Secretary to the Department, Sir Robert Scott,, and the Deputy Postmaster-General, Mr. Bright. That bargain at £5,000 was endorsed by the present Minister of Home Affairs; but, on n t h January, because he thought he had the council in a hole, and could make a bit of a deal",44
177,Mr DEAKIN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,But these are two public bodies.,44
178,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Quite so. Of course, if this land and buildings were sold for a public house, or for a haberdashery establishment, more than £5,000 might be obtained; but for the Commonwealth purposes I do not see that it is worth any more than £5,000.",44
179,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I thought it was sold at less than £5,000.",44
180,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"The figure was -.€4.647Mi. FAIRBAIRN - I was not aware of that. A bargain with a private citizen is one thing, and a bargain with a big municipality is another-the people, as it were, are dealing with the people. It might be These, said that it is a case of the people of Australia dealing with the people of Prahran ; but we must look at all the circumstances. When an honourable bargain is made by one Minister, and confirmed by his successor in another Government, I really think it ought to be binding; or otherwise the people will be misled. A man's word ought to be as good as his bond; and in the present case the bond is actually in writing. Could anything be more binding than the letter of 21st July, 1911?",44
181,Mr FENTON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,-Is the Postmaster-General or the Minister of Home Affairs the contracting party?,45
182,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Of course, if honourable members are going to shelter themselves",45
183,Mr FENTON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"It is not a matter of sheltering, but a plain question.",45
184,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I cannot say what went on between the Minister of Home Affairs and the Postmaster-General, but I ask the honourable member whether he would not feel very much aggrieved, if afterwards some other Minister said, "" It is no bargain at all? "" The proper Minister confirmed the matter verbally to me. In January, 1911, I went out with the Minister Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - If member of a firm did that it would be held to be binding.",45
185,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"If I had a partner and I came to an honourable understanding with a man I should expect my partner to follow it out. If he did not I should look upon him as dishonourable. For two years the Prahran Council have been allowed to live in a fool's paradise believing that the Government would in honour carry out the bargain. I know what the trouble is. The Minister of Home Affairs plumes himself on being a great man of business. wants to hold himself up before the people in that character, but in this country honour comes before business, whatever may be the practice in other parts of the world. We are not going to sell the honour of this country for a paltry £ 2 , 0 0 0 or £ 3 , 0 0 0 , even if we could get it . The man in the street here approves of honourable dealing. I speak warmly on this matter, because I feel warmly, and if the affair is not gone on with, as the Government of the day undertook to go on with it, a dishonourable thing will have been done, and an irreparable injury will be inflicted. If this sort of thing is to happen, whom can we trust? We may next have a Minister negotiating a great loan and trying to get out of paying it because of some technical flaw. The Minister may get some paltry advantage for a time, but if the work of this country is done in this way an irretrievable injury will be done to our credit and fair name. I should like to hear what the Ministeihas to say on this matter. It is a question of fair dealing, but, of course, the Minister will trump up ,the excuse that a 37 feet frontage in Chapel-street is worth a lot of money. Is it worth a lot of money as a post-office ? This place can be used only as a post-office. If it was possible to use it in any other way the land might be of greater value. This is a transaction between a council, representing a great body of the people, and the Commonwealth Parliament, representing the whole of the people of Australia. I recognise that the people's purse must be carefully guarded, but their honour must be still more carefully guarded.",45
186,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,The matter should be determined apart from value.,45
187,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I do not think the question of values will come very greatly into it . It is a question of the fair word of the Government of Australia. I am sure that is the way that honourable members will look at it, and I hope they will insist a responsible on this bargain, fairly and squarely made over two years ago, being fairly and squarely carried out.",45
188,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Bendigo) [8.15]. - I am sorry the Minister, whose action has been criticised, has not seen fit to offer some explanation of his attitude.",45
189,Mr KELLY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Perhaps he has none to make.,45
190,Mr FRAZER,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,The Minister can speak only once.,45
191,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I rise to supplement and support the views placed before He the House by the honourable member for Fawkner. The honourable member has said that the question involved is whether there is to be a violation of a fair deal between the Postal Department and the Municipal Council of Prahran. There is another important question involved, and that is, whether the Post and Telegraph Department is to be managed by the Postmaster General or by another Department. It appears that there has been an attempt on the part of the Minister of Home Affairs to interfere with the management of the post office in a matter of policy and administration, which was approved of by myself when Postmaster-General, and which was also approved of by my immediate successor, the honourable member for Barrier. I have not been able to discover any reasonable ground for the action of the Minister of Home Affairs. The negotiations for the surrender of the lease of the Prahran Post Office appear to have begun under the administration of my predecessor, who again was the honourable member for Barrier. So far back as March, 1909, there is a memorandum under the hand of the Secretary of the Home Affairs Department, giving the history of the matter. He shows that a portion of the Prahran Town Hall was taken over on lease by the Government of Victoria in 1897 for the purposes of a post-office. The Government of Victoria advanced £5,000 to the City Council of Prahran to make alterations and provide the accommodation necessary to create and establish a post-office there. That was the consideration for the lease, but so far as I am able to gather the lease was exclusively for the purposes of a post-office. It was not a general lease for any purpose to which the premises might be devotee^ such as a public-house or a bank. It was a perpetual lease, at a peppercorn rental, granted by the City Council of Prahran to the Government of Victoria in consideration of the payment of £5,000 by the Government to the council. That might have been a very good arrangement at the time, and the accommodation might have been sufficient, but as time went on Prahran grew and expanded, and its population and postal requirements increased. In March, 1909, it became evident that it was necessary to make a complete alteration in the postal arrangements of the suburb. The accommodation at the Town Hall, under the lease, was found to be utterly inadequate, and, worse of all, the premises were not capable of the necessary expansion, because of the limited and circumscribed area of the Town Hall buildings. It was then suggested that the lease should be surrendered back to the council, and a new site secured in another and equally convenient position. On 6th May a report was presented to the Postmaster-General by the senior inspector, stating that the present premises at Prahran were unsuitable, and that, sooner - or later, another site would have to be secured. Steps, he added,"" should be taken to secure another more suitable site or building to meet the likely extension of the business. Shortly after I came into office there were placed before me these reports and the record of the value of the investment made by the Government of Victoria. I had .also before me the official report - of the valuation of this property made by Colonel Miller under the transferred properties provision of the Constitution. Colonel Miller valued this asset, which came over to the Commonwealth on Federation, at £4,647. That was the amount which the Commonwealth undertook to provide for the Government of Victoria, in respect of the lease and the accommodation connected with it. The matter having been fully considered by the Deputy Postmaster-General in Melbourne, and by Sir Robert Scott, the Secretary of the Central Postal Administration, all the officers of the Department concurred in recommending me as follows :Recommended : That if a firm offer of ^5,000 is submitted by the Municipal Council for the premises used by the Department in connection with the Town Hall, Prahran, the offer will be considered. (Sgd.) ROBERT SCOTT. I endorsed this "" Approved, J.Q., 16th June."" The council was then invited to make the offer, and on the 7th July they did so. On 21st July the official letter was written which has been read to-night, saying that the offer had been approved of, subject to reference to the Home Affairs Department, and also subject to the condition that the premises were to be retained possession of until another site, or other accommodation, was secured. Consequently, it was substantially subject to the last mentioned condition only. Now, with reference to the control of the Home Affairs Department over these matters, it was not very clearly defined when I came into office what was the real extent of the control or supervision exercised by the Home Affairs Department over postal works. I was informed by my departmental advisers that the Postmaster-General had complete control. In fact, it was a matter of law. The Post and Telegraph Act provides that the management of the Postal Department and of postal properties is vested in the Postmaster-General. Under that Act it necessarily follows that a deal such as this was-the surrender or transfer of property of this kind-come s within the jurisdiction of any Postmaster General who might be in office. Therefore the offer, and the acceptance ratified by me as Postmaster-General, were within the four corners of the Post and Telegraph Act. Afr. PAGE - Why did not you complete the bargain?",45
192,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"-It was completed; but it was referred, under the practice that has grown up, to the Home Affairs Department to enter into other negotiations for the transfer or resumption of the property by the State Government. I understand that, for convenience, the practice has been this: that public works, such as the erection of post-offices, have been vested in the Home Affairs Department, but the Minister of Home Affairs has no voice whatever in the selection of the sites for the buildings. .",46
193,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"H as he . Sir JOHN QUICK - I never recognised that he had when I was Postmaster General, nor was I ever so informed. What the Postmaster-General did was to select the site of a post-office, and then refer it to the Home Affairs Department, as the constructing Department, to negotiate for buying the site and erecting the building. The securing of the site and the erection of the building were delegated by the practice of the Department to the Home Affairs Department, because the Postmaster-General's Department has not officers to carry out the construction of such buildings, but all matters connected with the provision of telegraphs and telephones are left exclusively to the Postmaster General, without reference to the Minister of Home Affairs. The preliminary to securing another site would be the surrender of the present site. The Department of - Home Affairs commenced negotiations with the Government of Victoria for the retransfer of the site to the State. was written by the honourable member for Ballarat, when Prime Minister, asking the Premier of Victoria whether his Government would take back this asset, wiping it off the list of transferred properties; in other words, whether it would release the Commonwealth from further liability in regard to it. I understand that the reply was that the Government would take back the property, because in a letter dated 27 th October, the honourable member, addressing the then Premier of Victoria, said that steps would be taken "" to give effect to the retransfer to your State of the property in question as soon as new premises have been erected."" When the last Government left office there was a contract to that effect, subject to the condition that another site should first be secured. The Government of Victoria had agreed to take back the property, releasing the Commonwealth from any liability under the Constitution. Any loss would have been borne by the Government of Victoria, but it was satisfied with the transaction. It did not wish to make a profit, and did not make a claim for unearned increment or increased value. do not see how there could be an increase in value. The premises were leased by the Victorian Postal Department from the City Council of Prahran for postal purposes, and the Commonwealth could not, under the lease, use the property for the carrying out of banking business or any business other not? than postal business. The lease was for a specific purpose, and the Postmaster General could not sell it or make a profit, out of it. Under our arrangement, the City Council of Prahran was to regain possession on paying £ 5 , 0 0 0 , the sum spent on the building by the Government of Victoria. It could not be said that the value of that, building had increased. If anything, it had decreased. The Minister of HomeAffairs is under a misapprehension if hethinks that this is a negotiable security, or a marketable property which can be sold to the highest bidder. No doubt, if the property could be sold for a shop or businesspremises, it would have a greater value than £ 5 , 0 0 0, but under the terms of the leaseit must be devoted to postal purposesUnder the contract the City Council of Prahran could prevent any other use of it , obtaining, if necessary, an injunction against such other use. Therefore, the statement that the property is worth £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 is irrelevant. The property has A letter no such value to the Commonwealth. The reports of the officers of the Postmaster General show that the accommodation cannot be extended sufficiently to meet the requirements of the postal business, and that an expenditure of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 would not provide suitable and commodious premises. Sir Robert Scott, Mr Oxenham, Mr Bright, and the Chief Inspector have all reported to that effect, it being held that money would be wasted in altering the premises in the attempt to meet existing requirements. The action of the present Minister of Home Affairs amounts to an attempt to take from the Postmaster-General the control of his. Department, which should not be tolerated. There are many objections to the arrangement which has resulted in the present deadlock. It is often very inconvenient for the Postmaster-General to have to be in constant communication with another Department. The two Departments should be independent, or, at least, it should not bepossible for the Minister of one Department to veto the action of the Minister of"" the other Department. I am glad to learnto-day that the late Postmaster-General apI proved of my action, and would have seen, that it was carried into effect, and the position of the Minister of Home Affairs is deeply to be regretted. I attribute the position to a misunderstanding. The Government of Victoria, which is primarily interested, and is entitled to receive any profit if there is a profit to be made, acquiesced in the scheme promulgated by met.",47
194,Mr FENTON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Maribyrnong) [8.33] ""The honourable member for Fawkner has made out a good case, and the interference of the representative of another division may-, seem unjustifiable; but I wish to point out that there arose in my division a position very much like that under discussion. officers of the Postmaster-General had condemned the North Melbourne Post Office as Altogether unsuitable, and had stated that no expenditure could make it convenient for the carrying out of postal and savings bank - business. The present Minister of Home Affairs, however, looked at the matter from - a truly national stand-point; that is, he - studied the interests of the Commonwealth.",48
195,Mr WH IRVINE,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Does looking at a :matter from a truly national stand-point justify the repudiation of a public engagement ?,48
196,Mr FENTON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"The honourable member - can give notice of his question. man I do not approve of legal cross-examination. In an important suburb like North Melbourne, the erection of a new post-office would have cost £ 1 2 , 0 0 0 or £ 1 4 , 0 0 0 ; but, owing to the intervention - the Minister of Home Affairs, the old office, with some alterations and additions, was, 'by the expenditure of £ 2 , 5 0 0, made quite -.suitable for the business which has to be transacted there, although it had been de-clared by the postal officials to .unsuitable.",48
197,Mr DEAKIN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,So it was.,48
198,Mr FENTON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,We have now one of - the finest post-offices in the area.,48

200,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,I bought addiof tional ground.,48
201,Mr FENTON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I do not believe in the interference of one Department with another, but for some years past it has been recognised that in the purchasing of property and the arranging of transfers the last man to affixhis signature and to give his - consent to any transaction must be the Minister of Home Affairs. that the post-office under discussion is situated in what has been termed the finest business thoroughfare in the world. The Commonwealth Government has the right to occupy the building for 960 years, and Ministers would be neglectful of the public interest if they did not retain the property, and refuse to part with it for a mere bagatelle. Had the Minister of Home Affairs acceded to the request made to him, the members of the Opposition would have been most severe in their criticism.",48
202,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,There has been repudiation.,48
203,Mr FENTON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"The Minister of Home The Affairs had the interests of the Commonwealth at heart in preventing a mistake from being made. I would not excuse repudiation, but the Postmaster-General cannot make contracts for the transfer of properties.",48
204,Mr ATKINSON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,What is the honourable member's authority for that statement?,48
205,Mr FENTON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I do not go to the array of lawyers before me to ascertain the legal position, but I know that I am right. Were I purchasing a property from the Commonwealth, I should not feel satisfied until I had obtained the signature of the Minister of Home Affairs to the inAs a laystrument of transfer. In the case of the North Melbourne post-office the Minister of Home Affairs saved the country at least £ 8 , 0 0 0 . The pnsta.l officials do not understand everything; it is in the Department of of Home Affairs that we have officers who know the value of property, though one of those officers considerably undervalued the Prahran post-office in stating the value at £4,600.",48
206,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,That was the be altogether value twelve years ago.,48
207,Mr FENTON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,I understand that the Minister of Home Affairs wished to make what he considered a reasonable deal with metropolitan the Prahran City Council.,48
208,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,An honourable,48

211,Mr FENTON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,The last Postmaster General was ready to endorse the action of his predecessor in disposing of the property.,48
212,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"He accepted the offer. I understand . Mr Fenton - The Postmaster General has little to do with the purchase or transfer of post-office sites. It is not until the Department of Home Affairs has inspected a site, and its officials have declared it to be suitable, that it is purchased.",48
213,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,The Home Affairs Department cannot purchase a post-office site without the concurrence of the Postmaster-General.,48
214,Mr FRAZER,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"The Postal Department indicates the site that is desired, and the Minister of Home Affairs conducts the negotiations for its acquisition",49
215,Mr FENTON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"If the Postmaster General's interjection is correct, the Department is putting the cart before the horse. The inspector usually sent out to make an inspection on behalf of the Postmaster General's Department is a man who has held office as a postmaster. It seems to me that instead of any communication being sent by the Postal Department to those who are inclined to dispose of a site, asking what they are prepared to take for it, a list of suggested sites should be submitted to the Department of Home Affairs, which should be called upon to select the most suitable for the purpose. But to send on such a matter to the Department of Home Affairs, after negotiations have been practically completed by the Postal Department, is to put the cart before the horse. Mr R°ING O ' MALLEY - I do not do that kind of business.",49

221,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,The member is not doing himself any credit tonight. He is a repudiator.,49
222,Mr FENTON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I am not. That is a very unfair remark to make. I said provided that no contract had been entered into between the Department of Home Affairs and the Prahran City Council, the officials of that Department had a right to step in. That is my point, and a contract is not a contract unless signed and sealed by the Minister of Home Affairs.",49
223,Mr ATKINSON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"That would mean that the Postmaster-General in this case was a mere rubber stamp. - Mr Fenton - Certainl y not. I understand that the State became owner of some of the postal buildings attached totown halls about the metropolis, by reason> of the fact that they contributed to the cost of erection of those municipal buildings upon the understanding that they should have the right to use part of the premises for postal purposes. Such postal premises have been handed over by the States to the Commonwealth, and having regard to the remarkable savings that have been made in my own electorate, I think it would be distinctly unfair to throw away a good Commonwealth property in the manner now suggested. To part with this splendid site for a mere bagatelle, would be to disregard the true interests of the Commonwealth.",49
224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Parramatta) [8.45] - The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has propounded a rePro- markable doctrine. , It is the doctrine that unless a contract is signed and sealed the Government may repudiate every word of it . No other honourable member would lay down such a proposition, and one had better look out when he is dealing with a Minister who believes in that kind of business. Here we have the case of two Ministers in the same Cabinet: the one repudiating the public undertaking of the other. The parallel the is that of a firm, one member of which gives his word and completes a bond as far as it can be completed on behalf of the firm, with the exception of the formalities, while another member of the firm later on steps in and repudiates the undertaking given by his partner. No honourable course, the man would think of doing such, a thing. A firm that acted in that way would suffer immensely in its reputation. This incident is but a side-light on the method of government to which we are subjected. Under the Caucus system of selecting honourable Ministers, one Minister may do anything he cares to do, irrespective of that which another does. Whatever differences these Ministers may have between themselves they ought to settle in Cabinet, and not try to degrade each other in their relations with the public outside. If I were Postmaster-General in the Cabinet, and were treated as the present Postmaster-General has been in this case, either the Minister of Home Affairs would have to retire from the Ministry or I should do so.  able member leaving a Cabinet in such circumstances.",49
225,Mr FENTON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"The honourable member has swallowed enough of his principles, or he would not be sitting where he is today.",50
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,I require that insulting observation to be withdrawn.,50
227,Mr SPEAKER,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"1 was engaged at the moment, and did not hear the remark to which exception is taken. If the honourable member for Maribyrnong has made any remark that is insulting, he must at once withdraw it .",50
228,Mr FENTON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Before I left the chamber, Mr Speaker, the honourable member made a rather offensive remark about myself.",50
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,I did not.,50
230,Mr FENTON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,What I said was that the honourable member would not be sitting where he is unless he had swallowed a lot of his principles. Surely that is not offensive?,50
231,Mr SPEAKER,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"If the honourable member for Parramatta thinks that the remark is offensive, I am sure that the honourable member will withdraw it .",50
232,Mr FENTON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"If it injures the feelings of the honourable member, then I shall unreservedly withdraw it .",50
233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Yes , after repeating the statement. The honourable member should not talk about other people's principles. I had proposed to refer to another postal grievance, but shall refrain from doing so, since I understand that the honourable member for Flinders desires to discuss the question of the Prahran Post Office.",50
234,Mr WH IRVINE,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Flinders) [8.50]. - The question raised by the honourable member for Fawkner raises issues of far greater importance than the mere question of the locality of the Prahran post-office or the value of a certain piece of land. It really raises the question of how far, under our present system of government, an Administration is bound by the public engagements entered into by its predecessors. I observe that the Minister of Home Affairs, against whom this attack is mainly directed, and who has not uttered a single word by way of explanation, has left the chamber, while other Ministers, including the Prime Minister himself, purport to be engaged in other business.",50
235,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,I am right here.,50
236,Mr WH IRVINE,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I am glad that the Minister is now present, and I should like also to have the attention of the Prime Minister. Two questions are involved. First of all, we have to consider how far a Government is or is not bound by the public engagements deliberately entered into by its predecessor; and, secondly, how far a Government, and every member of that Government, are bound by the deliberate action of one of their members with regard to matters within his own Department. This is a matter that does not concern one side of the House more than another, for a time may come when parties will be differently distributed in this House. There are certain broad principles which, so far as I know, have always been f o l lowed under our existing traditions of responsible government, and which, it seems to me, are directly pertinent to this issue. Section 85 of the Constitution provides that when a Department of the Public Service of a State is transferred to the Commonwealthy all the property of the State ""of any kind used exclusively in connection with that Department, shall become vested in the Commonwealth. This particular piece of land, which was at the time in question held uncler perpetual leasehold tenure by the Postal Department of Victoria, became ipso facto, by virtue of the Constitution, transferred to the Commonwealth, and that piece of land, from the moment of transfer, became, and remained* under the control of the Postmaster-General.",50
237,Mr ROBERTS,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Does the honourable member allege that the Constitution provides that property shall be transferred to the care of a particular Department?,50
238,Mr WH IRVINE,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"No ; but I say that the Constitution provides, recognising the invariable British practice, which has been followed, I think, in all the States, that the property which is necessary for the conduct of the Postal or any other Department, shall remain under the control, of course, of the Governor in Council, but of the Governor in Council acting primarily under the advice of the Minister responsible for that particular Department. Under the Constitution Executive Departments were vested in various Ministers, and the personprimarily responsible for the control of the land, which, by the Constitution, became vested in the Commonwealth for the Postmaster-General's Department, is the Postmaster-General, and not the M i nister of Home Affairs. Where thePostmaster-General requires to obtain new property, or to erect a new building, it may be very convenient to remit the whole matter to the Department of Home Affairs, and I believe that that procedure has frequently been pursued. Here, however, we have an engagement actually made by the Government which preceded the present Ministry, and we find that engagement embodied in an offer and an acceptance of - that offer. The offer was made by a public body, the Prahran City Council, on 7 th July, 1909. It was an offer of £5/000 to the Postmaster-General, in consideration of the surrender of a lease and. the right to resume possession of premises. I desire to direct the special attention of honourable members to the letter sent in reply to that offer, because, if there was a public engagement, it must turn upon the actual terms of that letterWith leference to the letter recently presented to you from the Town Clerk of Prahran, Victoria, offering, on behalf of the Prahran City Council, the sum bf ^5,000 for the right to resume possession of the Post and Telegraph office and quarters attached to the Town Hall buildings, Prahran, and for the cancellation of the lease dated 8th September, 1879, between the Mayor, Councillors, and Citizens of Prahran and Her Majesty the Queen, I have --the honour, by directionThat is by direction of the Postmaster General ; that cannot be disputedto inform you that the Postmaster-General has approved of the acceptance of that offer, and the matter is being referred to the Department' - of Home AffairsFor what? Let us see what the letter means. Why is it referred to the Department of Home Affairs? Is it for the .purpose of enabling the Minister of Home Affairs to consider whether the offer shall be accepted? Nothing of the kind, be-cause the offer is expressly accepted by letter under the authority of the Postmaster-General, and it is referred to the Minister of Home Affairs "" for the necessary action."" Mr KING O'MALLEY - Well , ceeded his power.",50
239,Mr WH IRVINE,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"The letter concludesI am to add that the premises in question - cannot, of course, be vacated until other provision has been made for the requirements of the Department. Reading that as a business communication between man and man, it is susceptible of only one meaning-that the Postmaster-General, having the authority to accept the - offer, did thereby accept it, but informed - the council that they could not have occupation until further provision had been made. I do not say that there cannot be circumstances under which a Government may find it necessary not to carry out the solemn engagements of their predecessors. If a Government comes to the conclusion that there has been fraud, malpractice, and wrong, they may take the responsibility of repudiating an engagement, but if they do so, they must do it at once. In the present case, not one word of repudiation was heard from the Minister of Home Affairs, the Postmaster-General, the Prime Minister, or any member of the present Government, until nearly a year after they came into office.",51
240,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,The acceptance was confirmed by the present Minister of External Affairs.,51
241,Mr WH IRVINE,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"That confirmation was verbal, and may possibly be explained. If a Government desire, for any of the reasons I have suggested, to repudiate a deliberate engagement of their predecessors, they should do so promptly. The present Government came into power in April or May, 1910, and not one word in repudiation of the engagement on which the council had been induced to act and to rest was heard until the 21st March, 1911, or about eleven months later, the acceptance of the offer standing all that time recorded in the correspondence of the Postmaster-General. The Minister of Home Affairs, in reply to a deputation, coolly said that he had found the land to be worth more than £5,000.  member for Bendigo, during his term of office of twelve months, not ratify the agreement ?",51
242,Mr WH IRVINE,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"The answer is very simple. The offer was absolutely accepted, but it was not to come into effect until a suitable , alternative position for the post-office could be obtained, and to he exobtain such a site must take some time in a place like Prahran. There is a difference between delay in carrying out the engagement because a suitable site could not be obtained, and repudiation by a succeeding Government because it is deemed that the land is worth, not £5,000, but, it may be, £12,000 or £15,000. I strenuously urge on honourable members on both sides that this matter involves a principle of vastly greater importance to this House and the whole community than any question relating to the post-office at Prahran or the merits of the particular land in dispute. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin Minister of Home Affairs) [ 9 . 0 ] - I do not feel a bit disgruntled at the declaration of my honourable friends on the Opposition benches, because I know they feel that they ought to put forward the best case possible under the circumstances; it is what I should do myself were I in their place. But, as a matter.of fact, nothing that we as a Government can do will satisfy them; no matter whom we appoint, or what the ability of those appointed may be, it is wrong, simply and solely because we are responsible.",51
243,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Kee p the bargain; that will satisfy us.,52
244,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I hope my honourable friend will not get excited ; absolute equality to all. and privilege to none should be the rule in this case. hold that it is a reflection on the Minister of Home Affairs to say that he is merely a sort of animated rubber stamp; but that is the position in which he is placed by honourable members opposite, including the honourable member for Flinders.",52
245,Mr WH IRVINE,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,I say that a bargain entered into by a Minister on behalf of the Government ought to be observed.,52
246,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"If the Minister of Home Affairs has simply to accept any purchases which may be made by any Minister, then he ought to be abolished as a fifth wheel to the coach. appear that the Government are asked to retain all the bad properties and dispose of the - good properties at low figures. I do not charge any one; I believe the late Postmaster-General was absolutely honest, and thought he was doing the correct thing, just as I believe that honourable members who are attacking me are absolutely honest. But I do not think that those honourable members are business men, and, believing that, it is my duty to put them right.",52
247,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I could buy and sell you a hundred times easily ! Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member inherited from hisfather, but what I have I made myself. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Does Minister think it fair to say that honourable members on this side are not business men ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - There has been a lot of talk on that side to the effect that members of the Government are not business men. Thispiece of land isat the corner of Greville-street and Chapelstreet, between the Big Store and Read's large establishment. Chapel-street is the Broadway of Australia today. Mr W. H . IRVTNE - What has that to do with the breaking of the promise?",52
248,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"The honourable member should not get excited. He has got his "" little bit "" in . I went with the honourable member for Fawkner to look at the "" show,"" and I confessed at once that I did not know the conditions under which this post-office existed. I understood from my friend that everything was satisfactory and lovely; and that all I had to do was to go ancl get a piece of ground for a new post-office. As a dutiful Minister, with business instincts, I made in quiries, and found that I would have to 1 P 7 ;£ -5 a 2 0 0 f ° r an ordinary piece of ground in a side street. When I asked' I Mr Murdoch, the architect, what would be the cost of a building suitable for a post office, in an advanced and progressive city like Prahran, he told me that it would D e £ , 1 > ° or £ 8 , 0 0 0 . O0 The honourable member for Fawkner has told the House that I said everything would be done; but that was only under conditions. I found that thirty-three years ago the Victoriar* Government paid £ 5 , 0 0 0 for this post office, and that there is now 963 years of a>. 999 years' lease to run. I thought to myself that the Minister of Home Affairs could not make such a bargain. It would Mr FAIRBAIRN - And so the honourable gentleman repudiated it .",52
249,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I said to myself that those men who wanted such terms must be living in the land of dreams; but, at the same time, I was prepared to make sacrifices. The officials in the Department of Home Affairs valued the property at £ 1 2 , 0 0 0 , but I valued it at a much higher figure. In my opinion, this property is worth £ 1 5 , 0 0 0 ; and I would give £ 1 0 , 0 0 0. cash for it to-night. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Goo d gracious ! Has the honourable Minister got: £10,000?",52
250,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Let us talk, business. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - We cannot the talk like that.",52
251,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I can. We are asked to build a post-office to cost £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 , and to sacrifice £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 on thisland and building, thus making a present of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 to the municipality of Prahran. Would the Zeehan miners, diggingout of the. deep mines, the wealth of Australia, desire me, as a trustee for all Australia, to present £20,000 of their money to the Prahran Council? Would the Opposition, even with their want of business capacity in many things, be prepared to do that?",52
252,Mr ATKINSON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"But this bargain was concluded. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Supposin g that, tomorrow, this Government agreed lo transfer the Melbourne post-office for jQ 10,000, would a succeeding Minister of Home Affairs be justified in carrying out that bargain if he had not signed the agreement ?",53
253,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"If he did, he ought to be put in a lunatic asylum. Mr KING O'MALLEY gracious to say that of the Opposition; but I think it all the same. I have no i l feeling; I am always glad when the Oplusion. position attack me, because then I I am right. There is no necessity Opposition unless they attack, and we for no quarter, and will give none.",53

Mr KING O'MALLEY - Le t the honshould orable member come down to the Departpaid ment, and compare what it is now with what it was under my predecessor.

255,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,The honourable member has not yet touched the point as - to whether there was a bargain or not. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I hold that the Postmaster-General was labouring - under a multiplicity of delusions when he usurped the functions of the Minister Home Affairs.,53
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Does not the Minthem ister think that he should correct these - things in Caucus, and not repudiate another Minister's arrangements in public? Mr KING ' O'MALLEY - There is only one man, and that is the Minister of Home Affairs, to decide these matters. If I am not the Minister of Home Affairs, let them get me out; but so long as I am there I am running the show. Let no one doubt it. I am a judge of values; I know the; values of land and of houses in this country; and are a few clerks in a post-office to go down, select a property, and tell me, the Minister of Home Affairs, to buy it? Do honourable members think that if they were capable of knowing the value of those properties they would be working in a post office at low salaries ?",53
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"That is precisely the honourable member's position today in I am too the selection of sites. Mr KING O'MALLEY - My honorl - able friend is labouring under another deOnly lately, in Western Australia, know we secured for £166,400 properties for for an which the owners asked £254,000, and ask vvhich are bringing in close on £12,000 a year. Let us make a square deal, and do not let us feel that, as trustees of the public, we have made deals of which we be ashamed privately. I could have for the property at the corner of Spencer and Bourke streets £37,500 if I had followed ideas that were put before whole me; but I bought it for £26,000, and saved this country £11,500. Never while I am Minister of Home Affairs will I pay for properties for the people of Australia price that I would not pay if buying for myself privately.",53
258,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Do you think that you are the only honest man? Mr KING O'MALLEY - No ; my honourable friends are all honest, but they are not business men. They have had no financial experience. They have been in office, sysbut they have never had any power, because their officials have run them; and I suppose when they go back again, if ever l l they do, it will be the same. This is a Ministry who advocate government of the people, by the people for the people. This is the first real people's Government Australia has ever had.",53
259,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I hope the people's Government will keep their bargains. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We shall alof ways do so. To try to meet the Prahran City Council I told them. I would sell this place for what it would cost us to build another post-office for them in Prahran; but they were not prepared to take the offer. Mr Miller, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, had a look at this place, and agreed with me that it is a beautiful site. There would always have been plenty of room if the postmaster, living on land worth £ 3 0 0 a foot, had hired a house somewhere else. would give us 1,500 square feet more. In a few years everything will be running * all right. So long as I am in the Department I am going to be Minister of Home Affairs, and no Postmaster-General or any one else will come in and run me as a rubber stamp.",53
260,Mr ATKINSON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Wilmot) [9.15] - I should have been glad to hear the Minister of Home Affairs explain by what authority he stepped in and refused to complete a bargain that was supposed to have been practically concluded twelve months before. Although the Commonwealth may have agreed to part with this property under its proper value, as a matter of fact, in all ordinary and honest dealing it was parted with when the Postmaster-General agreed to sell it . An offer was made for it , the Postmaster-General accepted. business was held over until a suitable site for a post-office could be obtained in Prahran, or, otherwise, as far as I can gather from the debate, the property would have been settled for there and then. Another Postmaster-General took office and endorsed what his predecessor had done. A year or so elapsed, and another Minister belonging to the same Government stepped in and told the council that the acceptance of the offer by the Government did not hold good. In what position does that place the Prahran City Council?",54
261,Mr WH IRVINE,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,And without any suggestion of repudiation in the meantime.,54
262,Mr ATKINSON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"The council were not informed that the Government did not intend to complete the business in the way they thought it was going to be completed. In fact, nothing was done to give them any suspicion that matters were not going on all right, and then a Minister in another Department overrides all that the Minister in control of the Postal Department has done. I believe we have in the Minister of Home Affairs a good judge of values, but he has failed to show us tonight where he derived his authority set all that had been done by other Ministers two years before. I have a grievance of my own regarding the expert who was brought to Australia to select site for Government woollen mills. Mr. Smail, the expert in question, came to Tasthat mania, and I noticed by the press that he was to inspect sites at Launceston and Hobart. I came to the conclusion that it was of no use to try to get into communication with him, because he would only tell me That that he could not go anywhere else. However, a council in Tasmania approached the Minister of Defence, and Mr Smail. made visits to other places. Then I was approached by people from other spots in Tasmania, who thought that they had ideal sites for woollen mills. I placed myself in communication with the Minister of Defence, and received a letter from his Department that Mr Smail was going to make a. second visit.to Tasmania, and that I would be duly apprised of it. I put myself in touch with various public bodies in Tasmania, with a view to finding out what sites it was desired that the expert should inspect, but Mr Smail did not arrive. I wrote again to the Defence Department, and received a reply that Mr Smail was in Western Australia, but that I should be duly informed when he was coming to Taswhich mania. I now find that he is not going to The visit any more places in Australia, but is preparing his report. It is about time that some proper system was established in matters of this kind. Whom did the Defence Department interview in the first place to find out where to send Mr Smail ? Surely, in a matter of this kind, the Government should make every effort, in the interests of the whole country, to find the best site possible, but the present Government did not take the trouble to find out where they should send the expert, and I am sure that, in some of the States, he was never within 50 miles of the best sites. Last session we heard of a proposal to establish a Naval College in Australia. The Victorian press said that Geelong was to be the site, and then we learned that the Government were sending an officer all round the continent to decide where the College should be established. According to the Melbourne press, the Government had their minds made up all the time to establish it at Geelong. If so, why did they send an expert around the country, spending the people's money, ostensibly to select a site?",54
263,Mr CANN,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"They said, first, that Burto uprineer Point was to be selected.",54
264,Mr ATKINSON,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I do not say that little the Government stated that Geelong was to be selected, but the Melbourne press evia dently knew something. It is about time that the public were given some guarantee the greatest care will be taken to select the best places for objects of this kind. I was rather anxious with regard to a motion which was on the notice-paper today, but - which was not moved by the honourable member responsible for it. It was a motion for a return showing the amount paid to Ministers of the Crown for travelling allowances during the recess, and, tail, the amounts paid to each Minister. During the last State election in Tasmania I heard statements made, and read in the press, that the Prime Minister had come to Tasmania, and was drawing -£2 a day for careering round the country in the for a return. Government motor car. I never heard anybody specifically deny, it, and I was not aware of the facts myself. I was desirous of seeing the return, in order to make self acquainted with the facts.

I wish to say that the motion just referred to was not moved by me because, before it was called on, the Prime Minister intimated that he wished to see me, and when I went to see him he showed me the State motion, with an amendment which he desired me to make. I did not feel disposed to move the motion amended as he suggested. on In addition, he showed me a* number of figures and extracts, and led me to believe that they would be placed on the table, so I did not think that there was any need infor moving at all in the matter. I believed that the information would be made available to every honourable member, and I hope the Prime Minister will make it available, as he led me to believe that he would.",55
278,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Melbourne) [9.32] This being grievance day, I purpose to under the notice of the House a complaint which is not aimed at any party, but if I can fix the blame on a Department certain things which have occurred I shall be doing a public duty. I hope that the House will help me to get rid of a state of affairs that is a disgraceful stigma upon our escutcheon. I wish to refer to the treatment of the recent small-pox case a steamer coming from the north, and I regret that there is again a similar case now in quarantine in Sydney. With a view to putting the matter before honourable members, I wrote to the Minister asking what diseases are quarantinable, and with his usual courtesy he replied that they are smallpox, plague, cholera, yellow fever, typhus fever, and leprosy. To ascertain the number of deaths from these diseases within the Commonwealth, I consulted the Statistician, who told me that in the five-year period, 1907-1911, six persons died from small-pox, seventy-five from plague, none from Asiatic cholera, yellow fever, or typhus, and forty-nine from leprosy. The Minister has power to declare by proclamation any other disease to be quarantinable, and among other diseases the deaths numbered in the same period, from scarlet fever and scarlatina, 256, and from measles, 633. A vessel recently entered Port Phillip which was rotten with measles, but had her 500 odd immigrants been allowed to land, they, being poor, would have taken up their residence in the homes of the poor, and spread this terrible disease throughout die community. No figures are available regarding the deaths from dengue, but the deaths from beri-beri in the two years 1910, 1911, numbered 126, while those from influenza numbered 2,587, and from typhoid 3,097. I bave no hesitation in saying that Sydney today stands in an inferno of danger. According to the sworn evidence of one of the finest medical men who was in the service of that State, but is now in the service of the Commonwealth, not 1 per cent, of the citizens of Sydney is protected from small-pox by proper vaccination. What, then, is to be thought of the action of the Commonwealth Department in bringing a case of small-pox a distance of 1,800 miles to quarantine it close to the largest centre of population in Australia? What can any common-sense man think of the head of a Department who advised that to be done ? A woman who had been a bride for scarcely twelve niondis was stricken with small-pox after a vessel coming south had left Thursday Island, and when it called at Townsville the doctor there would have been willing to take her on shore, as honourable members who were with me on board can testify. But, instead of that being allowed, the sufferer was compelled to travel 1,800 miles further to Sydney without a woman's kind face near her, and without a human being to attend her except a Japanese boy, who bravely volunteered. Had we had severe weather, or had a storm blown over the waters, that woman's life might have been sacrificed.",55
279,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Does the honourable member say that the doctor at Townsville wanted the patient to be landed there?,56
280,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"It is my opinion that he would have been only too willing to take her; I understood that from him. What occurred would not have happened had the Queensland Government been administering the quarantine law within the borders of that State. The captain of the steamer said to me, "" There is a stewardess on board, but the Japanese Government does not empower me to order her to attend to the patient. I am sure that ' if I wished her to do so she would, from kindness to me."" I was then placed in the terrible position of having to advise what should be done, and I said to the captain, "" If you had a daughter, would you like her to attend to a case of this terrible disfiguring disease without experience or knowledge of nursing?"" His reply was, "" No , I would'not."" I said, "" That is my answer."" Why could; not a nurse have been put on board at Townsville? Would the head of the Quarantine Department like his wife or daughter to be treated as this woman wastreated? The Minister, in the kindness of his heart I know, would not. like any woman to be so treated. Members who were on the steamer were indignant at what w»as done, and when we got to the Quarantine Station at North Head I sent a telegram to the Minister. I have here a photograph showing, the boat leaving the steamer with the patient, and I ask professional men whether the proper method was followed for taking from the steamer a patient suffering from this dangerous disease? The photograph speaks for itself. The only man I met who took proper antiseptic precautions was the ship's doctor. Our Department seemed ashamed of its Australian lymph. If it was not, why did it give us New Zealand, lymph, and American lymph from Manila?' The officials at the Quarantine Station, Sydney, were decidedly attentive, and, after consulting the first and second-class passengers and my colleagues on the Commission, I addressed to the Minister of Trade and' Customs the following telegramA l l officials courteously attentive. Do youconsider steerage passengers also Japanese and) Chinese human beings? If so, telegraph orders for hot baths and butter attention. The Minister's answer to that telegram wasGlad learn quarantine service attentive. Understand usual available accommodations being utilized for steerage passengers, Japanese and Chinese. Suggested new accommodation! will improve matters. Hot baths aTe available where oflicer in charge considers necessary or advisable, but general hot-bathing not practicable t ill proposed new works carried out. That was not true. I replied to the Minister by telegraph, as followsliegret Departmental statement not true. Twelve good steam baths here. Saloon passengers only need four. Please act quickly for humanity's sake. The saloon passengers, to their honour be it said, were willing to malee shift with only four hot baths, in order that passengers in other classes might have an opportunity to enjoy a bath. Why should the Government differentiate between the treatment of people who are kept under control in quarantine by no wish of their own? Is not a steerage passenger as good a citizen as a saloon passenger ? When the Quarantine Department was under the control of the State, the honourable member for Coolgardie and his wife and children were ordered out of a room in a quarantine station because they were second-class passengers. In our case, passengers in the third class were not allowed to roam all over the quarantine grounds, as first-class passengers were. Then, again, third-class passengers .could have baths, provided that the superintendent thought it advisable or necessary, but they were otherwise to use baths, or basins, 30 inches long, 22 inches wide, and 16 inches deep. Passengers had to use * a compartment in which fifty-two of these baths were placed, and where hot and cold water was provided for washing clothes. As for the Chinese and Japanese, they might have a bath in these small receptacles if they desired to do so. There were women folk, and good women folk, too, in the steerage, and one of them took charge of the baths reserved for the saloon passengers, and used them. In reply to the further message which I sent to the Minister of Trade and Customs, I received the following telegramUnderstand separate hot shower baths able to and being used by passengers in whom you are interested. Am writing. The reading of which caused considerable merriment among the saloon passengers. To that I sent the following replyWe consider your informant, not only in-accurate, but idiotic. As a matter of fact, there is not one hot shower bath in the whole establishment. Later on I received from the Minister of Trade and Customs a courteous letter, based, apparently, on the same erroneous Dr Maloney. information. Small-pox is either not as dangerous as it is generally considered to be, or Sydney has been most fortunate in escaping an epidemic, having regard to the way in which small-pox cases are sent into quarantine in close proximity to that city.",56
281,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Is it that the climate is against the thriving of the disease?,57
282,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I do not think that is the explanation. If a rich man and a poor man were knocked down by a motor car in a Melbourne street, and sent to a public hospital, each man having sustained a broken leg, would th6 doctors at that hospital treat them differently? Certainly not. If two men were convicted at the same time of a certain crime, one being a wealthy and the other a poor man, would they be treated differently when they were sent to gaol ? We know that they would not. That being so, when men are sent into quarantine by force of the power of the State and for the benefit of the whole community, there should be no differentiation in their treatment. I have nothing to say as to the food supply while we were in quarantine. The shipping company was compelled to provide for the passengers while they were in quarantine. That is the law; but I think it would be only fair for the Government, in such cases, to bear half the cost, and to see that the food supply is good.",57
283,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Some say that the whole expense should be borne by the shipping companies.,57
284,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"There is a good deal of force in the argument that if the whole cost were borne by the Government, shipping companies would be less careful than they are to avoid the risk of taking on board one of their vessels an infectious case. Those who have had any experience, however, know very well that no shipping company would willingly take on board on one of its vessels a suspicious case, for by doing so it might involve itself in much exavailpense and trouble. While the steam-ship Empire was between Port Darwin and Thursday Island, a case of small-pox occurred on board, and we were informed that the patient died at sea, although the head of the Quarantine Department assures me that he did not. We had sworn evidence that the patient died before the vessel reached Thursday Island, and that the vessel was ordered to proceed in quarantine to Sydney, a distance of something like 3,596 miles from Port Darwin. Among those on board were ninety-one Malays, who were intended for the pearl-shelling in-dustry at Thursday Island, but, who, because of the outbreak of small-pox on board, were, with the other passengers, carried on to Sydney and landed at the quarantine station at North Head. Malays apparently had in their system the germs of a dangerous disease called beriberi, which must have remained latent whilst they were in the colder climate of New South Wales, because, although the time of incubation had long since passed, they developed the disease on their return to Thursday Island. The Deputy Superintendent of Quarantine, at Sydney, informed the Pearling Commission that he had never seen a finer lot of men, and that they were very clean; while the Sub-collector of Customs at Thursday Island informed us that he was told by the man in charge of the party that they were specially picked for the pearl-shelling industry. Whether the sickness which broke out amongst them was due to their sojourn at the quarantine station, Sydney, where the climate is much colder than it is up north, I do not know, but the fact remains that these unfortunates paid a most appalling death penalty. As this is a very severe indictment upon the Department's method of carrying on business, I propose to quote the evidence given before the Commission by Mr Booker, Sub-collector of Customs at Thursday Island. He saidHere is a copy of a return I have prepared showing what became of these men :On the 10th November, i g n , 91 Koepang Malays arrived at Thursday Island per s.s. Eastern, and were distributed as under:Bowden and Mackenzie, 34; since dead, 4; departed, 10. Wyben Pearling Fleet, 29; since dead, 7; departed, 20. Morey and Coy., 14; since dead, departed, 6. Cleveland and Hayne, 14; since dead, 2; departed, 6. Of the 91, 17 have died, 42 have left the Commonwealth, and 1 is an inmate of the hospital. These men arrived in quarantine on n t h October, 1911, and quarantine was raised on 20th October, but they were detained for some time later, and ultimately landed at Thursday Island on 10th November. Mr. Booker stated, in answer to a further question, that he thought that the forty-two who had left the Commonwealth were all in a dying condition.",57
285,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Did he suggest that their illness was due to their stay at the Sydney Quarantine Station?,58
286,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Le t me quote further from the evidence given by Mr Booker- Mr May, secretary of the Pearl Shelters Association, has advanced a rather interesting theory as to the cause of the outbreak. He states that the ninety-one men who came here, The with one or two exceptions, had never previously been out of their own country. Owing to the outbreak of snSall-pox, they were carried on to Sydney, and at times it was very cold down there. Mr May says that he saw the men being examined in Sydney by doctors who wore heavy overcoats, and he thinks the Malays suffered severely from the cold on the voyage clown to Sydney and back.",58
287,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Wearin g heavy overcoats in Sydney in the month of October ! Surely that is unusual.,58
288,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"That was the sworn evidence given before the Commission, and I would remind the honourable gentleman that there are spells of cold weather in Sydney, even during the month of October. In any event, Sydney weather conditions, at that time of the year, are cold, as compared with the hot weather of the tropics. Mr Booker went on to state that Mr May informed him thatThey were continually shivering, and he believes that their trip into the more temperate regions had much to do with the exceedingly high death-rate amongst them. In answer to the questionThen you think that the establishment of a quarantine station here would largely obviate the recurrence of such an outbreak? he repliedTo a great extent; because in similar circumstances the men would not be asked to go down into those latitudes. We had evidence at the quarantine station, Sydney, that these men who evidently felt the cold very severely, had dungaree clothing served out to them. Fancy such clothing being served out to these children of 4 ; the tropics who ought to have been kept in the tropics. They were detained at the quarantine station some time after the quarantine had been raised.",58
289,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,That was not our fault.,58
290,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"And it was not the fault of the men. In regard to the case of small-pox which occurred on the Yamata Maru, I , with several friends on board, drafted a telegram for transmission to the Minister of Trade and Customs from Townsville, asking whether he desired that the unfortunate lady thus attacked should be required to _ undertake a long voyage unaccompanied by a nurse, in order to go' into quarantine at Sydney; but an order having been given that the vessel should proceed to Sydney, in quarantine, that order had to be at once complied with, and we could not wait to send the message and receive a reply. I was told by a gentleman who had been in quarantine when the Department was under the control of the State, that a vessel arrived at Thursday Island with a case of small-pox on board; that the patient was landed, and that the vessel was allowed, to proceed on her voyage down south, but that telegrams were sent to the officials at Townsville, directing that steps should be taken to provide for the reception of any new case that might have occurred. If no other fresh case occurred the ship could then haul up in Brisbane. What caused the ship to be brought right down the coast? Sucha proceeding cannot be the fault of the officers in Townsville in every case. That officer was not at Thursday Island when this case was there; and therefore I cannot see that, under all the circumstances, he can be held responsible. The water used for the bath is what is known as peat water, and is very dark, though. I do not know that it is dangerous. But why, in Heaven's name, there should be baths, and human .beings not allowed to use them, I cannot understand. Dr Norris may sneer, but I tell him that it does not become him.",58
291,Mr SPEAKER,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,The honourable member must not make remarks of that kind.,59
292,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I have a great regard for Dr Norris, but when I see him sneering",59
293,Mr SPEAKER,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,I remind the honourable member that he must not take the course that he is now taking.,59
294,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Is anybody permitted to sneer at an honourable member when-he is speaking?,59
295,Mr SPEAKER,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,I am not responsible for what may be done in the galleries.,59
296,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"But Dr Norris is behind your chair, sir.",59
297,Mr SPEAKER,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,I point out to the honourable member that being behind my chair is equivalent to being outside the chamber. I do not think it right for the honourable member to take his present course.,59
298,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I regard t h incident as rather a serious one. However, I hope that Sydney will not permit the practice of bringing dangerous cases into that big centre of population. As to the baths, if £ 2 0 was, as I understand, cient to supply those already there, £ 1 0 0 would provide enough for all those people who, not entirely for their own benefit, but more for the benefit of the community r are retained in quarantine. All should betreated as citizens on equal terms. Onecannot blame the shipping companies if they wish to make a saving on the food; supplies, but I think the Commonwealth might share the expense. We were told that if we went on shore we should beprovided with a nice hot bath, and that, while we were having it our garments would be disinfected and restored. The next morning, however, we were told that we had better have another bath, as it might not be very pleasant on shore; but I refused to have a second bath, contending that there was no chance of contagion, from the clothes in my grip-sack, which had' just come out of my box. There werebaths for the saloon passengers, but none for the third-class passengers or the Chinese and Japanese on board. Perhaps the Department do not think that these people are human beings.",59
299,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"What baths there are have been supplied by the Commonwealth, because there was none under State control.",59
300,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,I hope the Minister is not going to defend what was done.,59
301,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,I shall defend some of the action taken.,59
302,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Surely the Minister does not say that human beings under the circumstances should not receive proper treatment ?,59
303,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,1 do not say that; the honourable member need not get excited.,59
304,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"On shore there were no proper reception arrangements, though I think that if the passengers had gone in groups of twelve, they could all have had advantage of the hot baths, which I observed could be raised to a temperature of 120 deg. in three and a half minutes. I desire to pay my meed of praise to certainr lowly-paid officers who fill posts where the danger is greatest. If the honourable member thinks I am in any way exaggerating, I can only say that, should another similar case arise, I shall be quite willing to go with him into quarantine, and prove to him that there is ample room, for reform. If e any one could feel delight in quarantine it would be at that glorious spot on the North Head; but it seems to me to be a. great source of danger. There is evidence that patients have held conversations suffi- with people in Manly, and that hands have been shaken. The Commonwealth ought to see that the first point of attack away from the large centres of population is the place to land suffering patients. I make no attack on the Minister, but I do .attack the Departmental officers who gave wrong information and replies unworthy of - their intelligence, learning, and position. If the people of Australia are wise they will insist that the present disgraceful ditions shall be altered.",59
305,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Franklin) [10.3]. --There is not one statement of the honourable member for Melbourne that is not absolutely correct, nor one picture overdrawn.",60
306,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Has the honourable member read the regulations?,60
307,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I differ with the honourable member for Melbourne in regard to the responsibility. I do not hold the head of the Department, but the Minister,' responsible.",60
308,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,I am prepared to take all responsibility.,60
309,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Then the Minister is taking a responsibility of the extent of which he has not the slightest conception. The quarantine arrangements on the coast of Australia are a disgrace to the Department and to the Minister.,60
310,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I tried to improve the arrangements in Tasmania, and provide a good quarantine station, but was blocked.",60
311,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"The Minister tried to improve the arrangements in Tasmania by doing exactly what is done in Sydney-carryin g infection right into the heart of the city. However, I am glad to say that I was one who assisted in blocking the project. The people of Sydney run a terrible risk of an outbreak of small-pox so long as the station is where it is, and under existing conditions. Small-pox patients are conveyed right along the coast and taken into Sydney Harbor. A boat runs daily from Sydney to the quarantine station, and passengers and crews having mixed together, the former go into quarantine, while the latter return to Sydney. If that is not a risk, I do not know what is. The p'atient in the case under discussion was a young Australian lady who had been to the East with her husband, and had contracted the disease at Hong Kong. At Thursday Island the disease had not developed to such an extent that the medical men could be satisfied as to its nature.",60
312,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,The woman was walking about at Thursday Island.,60
313,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Quite so; and the medical officer was not prepared to say that it was a case of small-pox. But before we reached Townsville both the medical officer of the ship and the honourable member for Melbourne pronounced it to be a case of small-pox, and this was borne out by the medical officer at Townsville, who regarded it as rather a serious case. The con- honourable member for Melbourne asked the medical officer why the patient could not be taken ashore at Townsville, as he understood there was a quarantine station at Magnetic Island. The doctor informed us that, though there was a quarantine station there, it was not furnished. On being asked how long it would take to furnish an apartment for one patient, the doctor, who naturally did not wish to enter into a discussion about his Department, said to the honourable member for Melbourne, "" For any information I must refer you to Melbourne ; but my instructions are that you are to proceed to Sydney."" This patient, was carried 1,000 or 1,200 miles along the coast with 250 passengers and crew, and no one to attend her but a Japanese boy, who volunteered his services. That a small-pox patient should be carried such a distance along our coast is a disgrace to the Australian Parliament and the Department, and a disgrace to the Minister, who must take full and complete responsibility.",60
314,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Did the medical officer say that he had received orders from Melbourne that the patient should be brought on?,60
315,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I do not desire to set one officer of the Department against another, but he told us that his instructions were to send the ship on to Sydneythat he had no authority to land the patient at Magnetic Island. If small-pox is the contagious and deadly disease we believe it to be, there is practically. nothing to prevent it spreading into Sydney any day.  Australia for small-pox to live.",60
316,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I know that when the small-pox broke out in Launceston, and got a start, it cost money and life, and caused much misery, before it was stamped out. If small-pox got a real start in a congested city like Sydney, God knows what the result would be ! It is far too serious a risk for us to contemplate without taking precautions to prevent it. Let me inform honourable members of one beautiful arrangement. The honourable member for Melbourne has described what the water at North Head is like. Would honourable members believe that there is a reservoir there containing what is called peaty water; it is a dark supply. The regular water supply is brought across from the mainland. But the pure supply is turned into the reserthat she will live."" voir containing the undrinkable water. By taking it a quarter of a mile further the whole quarantine station could be supplied with pure water from Sydney. But, instead of that, the drinkable water which quarantined persons have to use is that which is caught from the roofs of the quarantine station. That is one of the little disadvantages that one would have thought the slightest common-sense would have obviated. I do not want to create a scare, or to hit the Department too hard, but the honourable member for Melbourne having shown me the telegrams which he received from the Minister, I must say that they were ludicrously incorrect. There was no bathing accommodation for the second-class passengers, and none for the crew until two days before we left, when, through pressure exerted by the honourable member for Melbourne, those persons were permitted to bathe in the few baths that had been reserved for the saloon passengers. The saloon passengers volunteered to use the baths within certain hours in order that they might be used by the crew and the secondclass passengers during the remainder of the day. Hot bathing is absolutely essential at such a station, because hot baths are a good preventative of disease. During the whole of the time those patients were there, with the exception of two days before we left, not one of them had a good bath. The only accommodation for them was a little square basin about 30 inches by 15 inches and a few inches deep, in which they could stand up and sponge themselves. Sydney is every day exposed to serious danger as long as the quarantine station remains in its present position. other serious fact is that the ship was pelled to carry a small-pox patient 1,200 miles along the coast, at the imminent risk of the disease spreading throughout the ship. That condition is not creditable to us, and ought not to continue for a day. I hope that the Minister will take immediate action, and will not regard this as a frivolous attack upon the Department. What I am saying does not pertain to party or anything of that kind, but represents absolute evidence of men who were there, and saw what occurred. I will quote in conclusion a remark made by the Japanese doctor to me. I asked him if he thought his patient would recover. He said, "" Pray Mr MCWilliams. to your God"" that we shall have fine weather, because if it is rough after we leave the Barrier, I think it is improbable Fortunately for us, and for the patient, the weather happened to be exceedingly fine after we cleared the Barrier, and the passenger suffered no ill-effects. I should add that the thanks of every person in quarantine are due to the Japanese medical officer of the ship, who did everything possible, not only for the sick, but for those who had been vaccinated. Let me ask the Minister this in conclusion: Suppose that as the result of rough weather that patient had died. Would he have assumed the responsibility for that occurrence in the same lighthearted spirit as he now exhibits ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [10.14] - The honourable member for Melbourne has been perfectly justified in bringing forward this matter, because it really affects the health of the whole of Australia. Unless some steps are taken to bring prominently before Ministers and the public the danger of infection to which, we are exposed from quarantinable diseases, and especially from small-pox, I am afraid that something serious may occur. We must remember that small-pox is at present raging in the East, and that ships are constantly trading backwards and forwards between this country and ports where this disease is prevalent. In regard to the administration of the Quarantine Department, there is no doubt whatever that there is room for a great deal of improvement. Some of the arrangeinents in connection with the Department were absolutely farcical. For instance, while we were in quarantine, I read in the newspapers that instructions had been sent out to Thursday An- Island for the local Government steamer com- to hunt out a number of Japanese divers who had arrived by the ship and landed there. In the meantime they had proceeded in various vessels to the different pearling stations in Torres Straits. I believe the steamer succeeded in collecting all these divers, and landing them at Thursday Island. The peculiar feature of that proceeding lies in the fact that not one of those Japanese divers was anywhere near the the region of contagion on board the ship. They never came in contact with the lady who afterwards developed small-p^x. They were in a different quarter of the vessel altogether, and the fact that a head wind was blowing all the time secured them still further immunity from disease. Immediject, ately they landed they dispersed to various term. places; there was no population with whom they could come in contact except natives, position. and these were on the pearling vessels which the divers were allocated. while that proceeding was gone through, there were many residents of Thursday Isof precaution. land who spent a long time on board the vaccinated. ship in the immediate vicinity , of the lady who developed small-pox, who talked with her, and spent much time in her company. Not only that, but the lady herself went ashore, visited the establishments of several merchants, and came in contact with many persons. All these contacts were allowed every twelve months. to go at large; no steps were taken to antine them, but the precautions I have ferred to were taken to secure a number Japanese divers, who had come on board as passengers, in another part of the ship, who certainly were by no stretch of the imagination to be regarded as actual contacts, in the same way as were the European residents of Thursday Island. The honorselves able member for Melbourne will remember that we received a very insulting telegram from a publican who resides on Thursday Island, and who had spent about two hours there was no risk. on board the ship in the immediate neighwith bourhood of the unfortunate passenger who subsequently developed the disease. No take steps were taken to isolate him or any the local residents who came on board the ship. I think that nearly the whole of principal residents on the island were on ship for about two hours before she sailed, moving about, some talking with the lady who developed the disease, as not well as with the passengers who were in mediate contact with her. But not a step was taken to isolate any one of those persons. These proceedings certainly strike any ordinary person as being extremely cical and loose. If it was necessary isolate-and I do not say that it was notas a matter of precaution the Japanese divers and put them in quarantine, then whole of these people on the island who were actual contacts ought have been put in quarantine for the proper really needed. period. Another matter struck me as being extremely ludicrous. We had among the passengers the pilot who brought the ship down, and another lady passenger- I fancy that there were three altogether, but I not sure-wh o were allowed to leave the Quarantine Station before the other passenmessages gers, because the lymph hadnot taken. They were regarded as being immune, subcome.

317,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Thre e months before. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I did not hear that, but I heard that they had been vaccinated many times, and also that they had been vaccinated, under the law of Japan, What happened ? quarWhen apparently the lymph would not take rewith these men, after they had spent some of time in quarantine they were ordered to be re-vaccinated, and to remain in quarantine and for the whole term prescribed by the regulations, whilst the lady passenger to whom I have referred and the pilot were allowed to mix freely with the people ashore, and to break their quarantine, only reporting them for a certain number of days. These things must surely strike any ordinary person as being farcical. Either there was a risk with these European passengers, or If there was no risk the European passengers and the European pilot, there was still less risk, I should it, in the circumstances, with the Japaof nese crew. I do not, of course, profess to speak with professional knowledge, and must the defer to the superior knowledge of those the who are better acquainted with all the features of this disease. But nobody could help, and certainly the passengers could refrain from, expressing decided imopinions on our quarantine regulations and single administration when such things were happening. I do not want to suggest that the Minister is altogether responsible at the farpresent time; perhaps he has not been into the Department long enough to have made very many radical alterations, and, no doubt, something in the near future will the be done to improve matters. I am pointing out these things, in order that he may to know in what direction improvement is",62
318,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"How many more years will it be before he begins to move? Mr W. E f c LIOTJOHNSON - It is am nearly time that this work was seriously taken in hand, because we read in the cable that small-pox is very rife in the Asiatic ports from which these vessels We must anticipate that in the near future we shall have ship after ship arriving in Australia, and carrying Another point that we noticed at Townsville was that there was no rapid means of communicating with the Minister. pears that there is no Customs launch, and when we found from the medical officer stationed there that the passenger had to be carried on to Sydney, a number of us went to the captain and asked him if he would detain the ship at Townsville for a couple of hours, in order to enable us to ask the Minister by telegram'if some arrangement might not be made to have the patient transferred to the quarantine station ashore, and temporary provision made for her accommodation, and a nurse supplied, rather than run the risk of infecting the whole of the crew and the passengers, as well as risking the life of the lady herself by carrying her 1,800 miles further, and running the additional risk of carrying contagion to a place like Sydney. After a talk with the doctor, the purser, and the captain, the captain agreed to detain the ship for a couple of hours on his own responsibility, and to fall in with our wish to that extent, but he said that if the answer were delayed over two hours, he must proceed to Sydney in accordance with his instructions. We found, however, that there was no means of communicating with the shore except through the medium of a private launch. The Customs authorities have no . launch there. Consequently, we endeavoured to get a telegram despatched with the aid of a private launch which was conveying a number of excursionists to Island. But we found upon inquiry that this vessel would not return for two and a-half hours, and that probably seven or eight hours would elapse before we could obtain a reply from Melbourne on account of interruptions to telegraphic communication, in addition to which the launch would have to be specially chartered for the purpose. Consequently we had to abandon our proposal to despatch a wire to the Minister, and the ship had to proceed to Sydney. I believe that something is about to be done to remedy the existing condition of affairs. I would remind honourable members that on a previous occasion-I it was in October of last year-I a protest against the steamer Eastern being ordered on to Sydney from Island with a case df small-pox on board. I pointed out to the Minister that such an order was very unfair alike to the patient and the passengers, as well as to the traders Mr W. Elliot Johnson. and merchants who were obliged to submit infection. to inconvenience and loss, because they were unable to obtain delivery of their goods. The Minister promised to consider the It ap- matter with a view to seeing if something could not be done to obviate a repetition of that experience. Apparently, however, it was lost sight of, and the experience was repeated in the case of the steamet Yawala Maru. Tliere were some passengers on board whose destination was Townsville, and others who were bound for Brisbane. These passengers,' as well as the cargo for those ports, were brought down to Sydney and Melbourne, and then had to be taken back. We have no right to subject persons to such inconvenience and monetary loss. In regard to the landing of patients at the quarantine station, Sydney, there is ample scope for improving the existing method. At present a patient, after being landed at the station, has to be carried on a stretcher up a circuitous path to the hospital. For a comparatively small outlay a lift could be provided at the jetty and the patient, and those in attendance upon him, could at once be transferred to the higher land upon which the hospital stands instead of being required to traverse a distance of nearly a quarter of a mile. I hope the Minister will have the arrangements at Thursday Island completed without delay in order that suspicious cases on board ships from the East may be landed and treated there. That work ought to be pushed forward with the utmost speed in view of the probability that Magnetic cases of small-pox upon these vessels will become more frequent in the immediate future. I wish now to deal vvith a matter which is in the Postmaster General's Department. From information vvhich I have received it appears that some time ago certain temporary hands employed in the mechanical construction branch of the Sydney General Post Office passed the necessary examination to entitle them to he placed upon the permanent list. Some of these officers who rendered over twelve months and upwards of two years' service as temporary hands were noted OH the roster as being entitled to certain leave. think This roster was exhibited for some conentered siderable time, and then without any explanation the leave was erased from it . I Thursday think that the Postmaster-General, when computing the leave to which they are entitled, might fairly take into consideration the period which they served as temporary officers, because, although only a smail number are at present affected, a large number is likely to be affected in the near future.",62
319,Mr RYRIE,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"North Sydney) [10.38]. - Tlier e is one important phase connected vvith the quarantine question which has not been touched upon by the previous speakers. It is one of the very greatest interest to myself and to the residents of Manly- 1 refer to the removal of the quarantine station at North Head from the site which it at present occupies. The undertaking may be a big one, but in view of the gravity and importance of the question I am warranted in asking the Minister to initiate the necestralia, sary steps in that connection. I am quite sure that the New South Wales authorities will co-operate with him. I am not quite certain as to what is the position between the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales in regard to that station. I presume that it was taken over with the transferred properties.",64
320,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"In 1909, when Sir Robert Best was Minister of Trade and Customs, an arrangement was arrived at for the transfer of the whole of these quarantine properties.. They were transferred in accordance with the agreement which was concluded with the. Conference of Premiers which accepted the Customs grant by the Commonwealth of 25s.. per capita.",64
321,Mr RYRIE,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I know that the Government of New South Wales will co-operate with the Commonwealth in this matter. They are quite prepared to do their share in any arrangement that may be made for transferring the station to a different site. No other country in the world has a quarantine station in the middle of such a populous centre. The station, which is a magnificent site for a pleasure ground, is really a portion of Manly, which is the most popular pleasure resort in the whole of Australia, and there is nothing between the thousands of people who visit Manly and the small-pox patients, when they are at the station, but a 7-foot fence.",64
322,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Non e of the patients can get anywhere near it.,64
323,Mr RYRIE,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I mean the contacts, the people who are supposed to be carrying the germs of the disease about them. They may move freely about the quarantine area, and it is very easy for any one to get over the fence and mingle with the people outside. I am given to understand that there are in the quarantine area the children of the caretaker and other employees, and that these actually go out to school, and come [391- 2 in again when there are no patients or contacts in quarantine. That is not a desirable state of affairs.",64
324,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I arranged in Victoria that the house should be shifted to the outside, so that the children would be left outside the area when there was a patient inside it .",64
325,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"In any case, the children do not go to school while there is any contagious case in the station. ' Mr RYRIE - I felt that I .was in duty bound to bring this matter up, not only for the sake of my constituents, but in the interests of the whole of the people of Ausbecause an outbreak .of small-pox in Sydney would be a terrible state of affairs. Vaccination is not compulsory there, although it should be, and there would not be enough lymph to go round if people wished to be vaccinated suddenly through a smallpox scare. There would be a serious panic if small-pox broke out in Sydney, and people would flee in all directions, and probably spread the disease throughout Australia. There are plenty of good sites for a quarantine station about Sydney. The northern side of Broken Bay is not populated-it is isolated, and, at the same time, it is not too far away. If that site is not suitable, there are many others. Other honourable members have dealt f u l ly with the question of the management inside the quarantine areas, and many of the instances referred to by them reflect the greatest discredit upon those who are responsible for the administration of the Quarantine Act. I understand that the portmanteaux or trunks of the contacts were not put into the disinfecting room, because it was thought that that would injure them, and that an attendant simply sprinkled a little formalin on one end of them, four-fifths of them not being touched at all by the disinfectant. The thing was an absolute farce. As the Commonwealth Government have taken over the whole business of quarantine, it is their duty to provide means of quarantining a vessel, no matter how many people are aboard it, somewhere in the north of Australia, and not make it necessary to bring it down to Sydney. No matter what it costs, that provision must be made in the interests of the people of Australia.",64
326,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"If the honourable member had been here years ago, he would have seen that I tried to do something in that direction.",64
327,Mr RYRIE,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"I do not doubt it, but that does not absolve the Minister from blame. The fact remains that a vessel cannot be quarantined anywhere north of Sydney if she has any number of people on board. That is not as it should be. The Minister has had two years in which to provide proper quarantine accommodation, and I do not know that he is even now taking any steps towards it .",64
328,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,The honourable member cannot say that I have done nothing.,65
329,Mr RYRIE,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,I do not ; but two years is a fair time in which to expect the Minis-' ter to act.,65
330,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.49] - I v e r that the hour is so late, after the attack which honourable members have considered it necessary to make upon the administration of the Quarantine Department. honourable member for North Sydney may be pardoned, because he does not know, as other honourable members do, that quarantine was practically the last service transferred to the Commonwealth. The transfer took place in 1909, the Act being passed in 1:908, and the States, almost without exception, had starved the Department, knowing that it was to be transferred. I feel sure that, had my predecessor been in my place to-night, he would have made precisely the same statement. We found, when we took the service over, that there was not the accommodation necessary if we were to safeguard the Commonwealth against the introduction of disease. In 1910, when an amount was placed on the Estimates to make all the quarantine stations efficient for any emergency, honourable members on both sides urged that we should hesitate to spend so much money on this service. It was decided that, in order that the Government might be made acquainted with the latest available knowledge on the subject, the Director of Quarantine should go round the world and see what was being done in other countries. We required to know whether it would be necessary to spend very large sums of money on quarantine stations, in order to prevent the introduction of diseases. Dr Norris' report was handed to me before I left for the West, and I took it with me. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Does honourable member not think there should be a steam launch provided at Townsville?",65
331,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"- I can promise honourable members that all the points that have been raised during the debate will be inquired into. Though they have criticised the work of the Department, and have assumed that all orders have been given from Melbourne, I can assure them that if they had taken the trouble to read the regulations and the instructions issued under the Quarantine Act they would have seen that most of their complaints f all to the ground. I have shown the honourable member for Melbourne that the regulations left it in the power of Dr Nesbitt to decide whether the Yawata Maru should be sent on to Sydney or not. I must say, in justice to Dr Nesbitt, however, that he considered the quarantine station at Magnetic Island y much regret unsuitable. It has been allowed to f all into disrepair. The jetty giving access to it has been washed away, and the only way of getting ashore on Magnetic Island is by The running a boat up on to the beach. No member of this House will say that a small-pox patient should be landed at the station in that way. The cable providing telephonic communication between Magnetic Island and the mainland was broken and useless, and"" there was no means of telephonic communication between one place and the other. Before we took over quarantine the Queensland Government had abolished the station at Brisbane. They made use of portion of the land as a lazarette for lepers, and some of it for other purposes. At Thursday Island there is no quarantine station, but there is a lazarette at Friday Island.",65
332,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Is Dr Norris' report on the table?,65
333,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,No ; it has not yet been circulated.,65
334,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,How long is it since it was issued?,65
335,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"It was issued before I went to the West, and I saw the right honourable member there. It is printed, and, I believe, will be available for honourable members soon. Dr Norris believes that we shall be able to put our quarantine service'on a sound footing. But we need to be very careful in the matter. Many people will say that if a quarantine station is to be used on only one day in the year, or even less often, we sliould hesitate to spend very much money upon such stations. The honourable member for North the Sydney is very much interested in that locality now, and I suppose we are all more or less affected by the locality microbe, but I can"" inform the honourable member that the practice of sending vessels in quarantine from the north to Sydney was in operation before the Commonwealth took over the service, because the Queensexperience land Government had abandoned their stanecessity tion. Negotiations have been proceeding with the Government of that State, and we have asked that they shall be brought to some finality, with the object of having a station, established at Brisbane. We to have to spend. propose that the Townsville station shall be, not on Magnetic Island, but on the mainland, - at Cape Pallender. about five north of Townsville. No doubt the smallopinion ? Never! pox case to which reference has been' made put some honourable members to a great deal of inconvenience.",65
336,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,I thank God that I had the the experience.,66
337,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,I can assure honourable members that when I might have enjoyed myself at a picnic near the Melbourne quarantine station I utilized the whole in going over the station with the honourable member for Maribyrnong. - Dr MALONEY - The Minister should there when people are in quarantine.,66
338,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"On e may have a better insight into the working of a quarantine station if he is acquainted with the proviMinister sion made for the care of persons who are quarantine? confined there. On the point raised by the honourable member for North Sydney, I may say that the Director of Quarantine is as full of the milk of kindness as other man, and with respect to the children referred to attending school, he agreed with me that in order that they might be kept at school should a case of small-pox occur, the house was to be removed outside the quarantine area. The wife and family would remain outside, and' the husafter band would be kept strictly inside the area all the time. I do not know what is the practice adopted in New South Wales, at Point Nepean we have had policemen on duty outside the fence during the whole time people remained in quarantine. We propose at Thursday Island to have a suborable station to provide for isolation and obsertheir vation blocks for eight cases, detention accommodation for ten persons, concrete platforms and tent frames for ten persons, an administrative block, water supply, fencing, and so on. I shall, of course, take advantage of the experience of honourable members, but I have by no means been unmindful of the importance of safeguarding the health of the cornmunity. I may inform honourable members that before agreed toI became head of the Quarantine Department I was not a vaccinationist, but my morrow since has convinced me of the of vaccination. From the figures given me I am satisfied that if all Australians were vaccinated it would not be necessary for us to spend one-tenth of the amount on quarantine which, we are likely",66
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,Does the Minister miles mean to say that* he has changed his,66
340,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"If I were like some honourable members. I could name, probably I would not stand up and admit that as result of the education I have received I have heen convinced of the necessity of vaccination. I feel sure that the honourable member. for Melbourne and others could prove its necessity from their recent experience. I did not previously pose as day ananti-vaccinationist, but I have come to believe in the necessity for vaccination. In America it has been the practice not to be allow a single person to land without vaccination. I know that I was vaccinated before I could get to New York. Mr ' W . ELLIOT JOHNSON - Will the explain why the contacts at Thursday Island were not ordered into",66
341,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,It is generally considered that there is more risk of contagion any from Japanese than from white people.,66
342,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,That is not accurate. They are all vaccinated every year.,66
343,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"There was not, when the vessel was at Thursday Island, the slightest suspicion of a case of small-pox. The case did not develop until the second day leaving Thursday Island. The Thursday Island residents were not exposed to any infection. It was, therefore, considered but unnecessary to quarantine them.",66
344,Dr MALONEY,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,That is so.,66
345,Mr TUDOR,DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL,"Whil e I regret that honmembers were placed in quarantine, experience will be beneficial to them and to the Department, whose omcers are anxious to perfect the arrangements made in the interests of the public health.
