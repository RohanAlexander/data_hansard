2,Mr FENTON,MAINTENANCE OF ESSENTIAL,"Has the Prime Minister seen in this morning's Argus one of the pictures of strike scenes in London showing the meftiod of maintaining an essential sorvice, with the explanation, "" Armed guards were posted at threatened points, and often did duty beside union pickets""? Does not, the right honourable gentleman think that the scene represented in the Argus may be a photographic forecast of what will happen under the Constitution Alteration (Essential Services) Bill?",14
3,Mr BRUCE,MAINTENANCE OF ESSENTIAL,"I cannot express an opinion as to. the future. I made perfectly clear my view that none of the things he suggests are likely to occur under the bill to which he refers. I have not seen the picture, but if , in connection with the unfortunate events in Great Britain, it was found necessary in the interests of the nation to employ armed forces i h any way, all of us deplore it. CANBERRA POSTAGE STAMP. Mr ""WEST - I have been requested to ask the Postmaster-General a question with regard to the stamps which I understand it is proposed to have printed in connection with the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra. I understand from some Sydney friends, though I do not know where they got their information, that it is the intention to print portraits of public men on these stamps. I ask the Postmaster-General to delay the printing of these stamps for a little time so that I may have my photograph retaken ?",15

PUBLIC SERVICE: HOUSING .",15
5,Mr CHARLTON,MAINTENANCE OF ESSENTIAL,"the Minister representing the Minister for Home and Territories, upon notice I. Is it a fact that in a booklet recently issued regarding Canberra, public . servants were requested to submit tlieir requirements regarding housing to the - commission not later than the 30th instant? 2. In view of the fact that he stated on Monday last that the Government was appointing a committee to inquire into the alleged excessive cost of houses in Canberra, and that at a later date a statement would be made a*3 to the purchase of officers' homes in Melbourne, will he extend the date until after 30th June, so that public servants may know all the facts before coming to a decision?",15
6,Mr MARR,MAINTENANCE OF ESSENTIAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. The reply to the honourable member's question of the 14th June had reference to the question of an allowance to officers in respect of alleged increased building cos.ts at Canberra, and it is upon this phase of the question that the Prime Minister's reply indicated that a committee was being appointed to report. The question of an extension of the date by which officers have to submit their housing requirements will be discussed witli the chairman of the commission during the next few days, and a further statement will be made as soon as possible thereafter. CHAIRMAN , PUBLIC SERVICE BOARD.",15
7,Mr WEST,MAINTENANCE OF ESSENTIAL,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the Chairman of the Public Service Board has had numerous periods of leave of absence? 2. Is the Chairman of the Public Service Board now on leave; if so, for how long, and for what reason was leave granted?",15
8,Mr BRUCE,MAINTENANCE OF ESSENTIAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l 1. No. Neither the Chairman nor any Comhas thus far availed himself of recreation leave in excess of that allowed to of the Public Service. I would refer honourable member to the particulars supplied by me on the 27th January (Hansard, 376), in answer to a question by the honourable member for Beid. 2. No. The Chairman was absent on recreation leave from the Sth to 12th June, inclusive. AEROPLANES. GIFT BY IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT.",15

12,Dr EARLE PAGE,LANDTAX KND,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The net amount of land tax collected was:-1023-24 , £2,030,127; 1024-25, £2,519,711. 2. The net entertainments tax collected was :-1923-24 , £622,460; 1924-25, £680,586. NA COMPANY.",16
13,Mr MAKIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether the expiration of the agreement between the Amalgamated Wireless Company and the Commonwealth, on 28th March, 1926, of the Bank: has concluded definitely and permanently the business association of the Commonwealth and this company? 2. If not, what further arrangements do the Government propose to make?",16
14,Mr BRUCE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"As I stated yesterday, the operation of the clause of the agreement under which the Commonwealth was liable for the cost of maintenance of existing services for four years ceased on 28th March, 1926. Otherwise the agreement remained in force, and the business associations of the Commonwealth and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited remain unaffected. RURAL CREDITS: COMMONWEALTH BANK .",16
15,Mr A GREEN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"through Mr Fenton) asked the Treasurer, upon notice I. Whether his attention has been called to a paragraph in the press of the 15th instant referring to the following statement mode by such the Minister of Agriculture (Mr Forgan Smith) at Brisbane:"" If the Eural Credits Department of the Commonwealth Bank was not prepared to engage in financing ipool boards on conditions much more practicable than those now insisted upon there was no need for the establishment of the Eural Credits Department, as the business now being done by that branch could have been carried out by the Bank as formerly constituted. . . . No serious effort had been made to make this branch of the Bank useful to the primary producers.""? view of this serious indictment by a responsible Minister of the inefficiency of the Eural Credits Department of the Bank to assist the pool boards, will he take steps to get into touch with the various Ministers of Agriculture of the States at the earliest possible moment, to see if some method cannot be devised whereby the funds of the Bank may be made freely available to assist the various pools of primary producers throughout the Commonwealth ?",16
16,Dr EARLE PAGE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. The Eural Credits Department of the Bank is able to assist {pool boards which can give security over tlieir produce. To my own knowledge, wheat, frozen eggs, dried fruits, wines, and osmiridium are already being financed by the Eural Credits Department. The remarks of the Minister for Agriculture apparently have reference to the Peanut Pool in Queensland. This Pool applied to the Eural Credits Department of the Commonwealth Bank for financial accommodation, and the following letter from the head office of the Bank to the manager in Brisbane may be cited as illustrating the sympathetic attitude "" We are in receipt of your letter of 22nd instant, and note your advices. If the Peanut Pool Board have not got the necessary legal authority to give us a proper charge over the produce they can- not obtain advances from the Eural Credits Department. They should, however, quite realise that this is not due to a defect in the Eural Credits Act, but entirely due to defect in theiT own constitution, which prevents them giving the Bank proper security. As an alternative they could lodge the goods in an independent store, and transfer the store warrants to us, and this would enable them to obtain advances through the Eural Credits Department. If tliey are unable to adopt either of these methods, we would be agreeable to make advances through the General Banking Department under the guarantee of the Queensland Government, though we would ourselves prefer to make the advance through the Rural Credits Department, were the Pool in a position to give us proper security."" It will be seen that any difficulty that may exist in regard to Pools obtaining assistance from the Rural Credits Department is a matter for correction by the State authorities themselves. ELECTRICAL CONDUIT PIPING .  the honourable member for Swan (Mr . Gregory) asked the following question:What quantity and value of electrical conduit piping, Item 152B, Tariff Schedule, has been imported into Australia since the 1st January, 1020?

17,Mr MAER,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Parkes-Honorar y Minister) [ 3 . 1 0 ] - I m o v e That the bill be now read a second time. This measure has been on the notice-paper for a considerable time. Act No. 11 of 1906 had particular relation to the submission to the electors of proposed laws for an alteration of the Constitution. The Commonwealth Electoral Act has been amended on various occasions. In 1922 and 1924 it was altered in respect of postal voting and the declaration form . The bill before the House proposes to bring the Referendum Constitution Alteration Act into line with the Commonwealth Electoral Act. A similar measure was passed through the Senate last Parliament, and remained ou the notice-paper of this chamber u n t i l the prorogation of Parliament. This bill was, in February last, introduced in another chamber and passed, and is now submitted to this House for consideration and approval. As it originally passed the Senate, in addition to co-ordinating the Electoral Act and the Referendum Constitution Alteration [123] Act, clause 3 proposed to make some slight alterations respecting the time allowed for the preparation of pamphlets dealing with the arguments for and against proposed alterations of the Constitution. Unless both Houses of Parliament approved, such pamphlets would not be prepared and submitted to the people, but the Government does not now propose to proceed with that provision. The Government when it introduced this measure last year had no idea of submitting to Parliament, and later to the people, any proposed alteration of the Constitution.",17
18,Mr STEWART,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,That remark is unforIMPORTATIONS. tunate.,17
19,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The bill was introduced some time ago, so honourable members will realise that there was no ulterior motive in the mind of the Government when that provision was inserted in it .",17
20,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,We do not suggest that.,17
21,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The Government feels that if it proceeded with clause 3 it would not give opportunity both inside and outside of Parliament for preparing the case for and against the present referendum proposals. I .propose to move amendments to the bill in committee, when I shall be able to explain each clause fully.",17
22,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Will the Minister explain clause 2?,17
23,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Clause 2 of the bill proposes 'to adopt the provision of the Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1922, giving the right to an elector to approach the electoral officer or the presiding officer when his name does not appear on the certified list of electors, and to record his vote by making a statutory declaration that he is entitled to do so.",17
24,Mr FENTON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Eve n though his name does not appear on the roll?,17
25,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Yes . The second alteration relates to an elector whose name is on the roll, but when he wishes to vote, finds that it has been already ticked off as if he had voted. If he is able to satisfy the presiding officer, after filling in a declaration form affirming that he has not exercised his franchise on that date, ancl that he is entitled to vote, the presiding officer is compelled to allow him! to record a vote. We propose to insert that provision in the bill to make it conform with the Electoral Act. On three occasions proposed alterations of the Constitution have been submitted to the people, apart altogether from the conscription referendum. In the original act it was made compulsory that pamphlets should be printed and issued to the people of Australia. preparation of such pamphlets ' an allowance of nine weeks was made. W it h in two months after the expiration of that period the Chief Electoral Officer was obliged to p r in t and tribute them to the electors throughout Australia. It is now proposed to alter the period of nine weeks to fourteen days. Most of the arguments that can be used for and against any proposed alterations of the Constitution are used in Parliament during the discussion of the measures. I think that honourable members will agree that fourteen days is ample time for the preparation of pamphlets. I said just now that on three occasions referendums have been submitted to the people of Australia. In 1915, three days only were allowed after the passage of the bill for the matter for inclusion in pamphlets to be in the hands of the Chief Electoral Officer'for printing and distribution.",17
26,Mr HUGHES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,In 1915 the proposals that were not p ut to the people.,18
27,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I understand that reasons for and against were printed, complete than they are today. but not circulated. In 1919 the act amended by taking away the right of the opposing parties to submit, in pamphlet form, the case for and against the proposals.",18
28,Mr RODGERS,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The circumstances were quite different.,18
29,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"That does not alter the fact that Parliament consented to amend aeroplane. the law in that way. On two out of three occasions on which the opinion of the people has been sought by means of the referendum the. original provisions act have been departed from . In the circumstances, the Government considers fourteen days is ample time in which to prepare the case for and against the constitutional amendments shortly to be ferred to the people. Honourable members will agree that in debates in this Parliabroadcast his case. ment, or at constitutional conventions, arguments for or against any proposed amendments are adduced, and it should be an easy matter to assemble them embody them in a pamphlet.",18
30,Mr RODGERS,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Suppos e honourable members desire the advantage of consultation with the great organizations in public life?,18
31,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I assume that they have already had that advantage. Most honFor the orable members voice, not only their own views, but also those of the organizations outside this Parliament. Mr STEWART. - The trouble on this occasion is that the outside organizadis- tions are speaking with so many voices.",18
32,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,That is so. The proposal contained in this bill is by no means extraordinary. The arguments advanced in this chamber for and against the suggested amendments of the Constitution,18
33,Mr SCULLIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Coul d not be improved.,18
34,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"At any rate, they were fairly complete, and all that remains to be done is for the leaders of the different schools of thought to assemble those arguments and submit them to the Chief Electoral Officer for printing and distribution. Another amendment to be proposed by the Government relates to the time allowed the .Chief Electoral Officer in which to distribute the pamphlet. Under the existing law the time allowed is two months, but when provision was. put on the statute-book means of transportation the and mail facilities were much less Now, was mail matter can be sent to any part of the Commonwealth in a very brief time.",18
35,Mr HUGHES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,r A telegram can be sent from Melbourne to Sydney in 24 hours. It has been done.,18
36,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"If necessary, pamphlets can be sent into the outback districts by When pamphlets are put into the hands of the electors a month or two months before the referendum is taken, they are very liable to be misof the laid or their contents forgotten.",18
37,Mr RODGERS,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Does the Government that propose to allow the reasons for and against to be 'broadcasted by wireless ?,18
38,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"No doubt, if that refacility is desired the Government will arrange for the leader of each party to The bill provides all that the pamphlet must be in the hands of the electors fourteen days before the vote is taken, and I think that will and allow them ample time to study, the issue they will be asked to decide.",18
39,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Who . is to be authorized to state the case agaiust the proposals ?,19
40,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The Government is in close touch with the members who are opposed to these proposals.,19
41,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,I am sure the Government is not in touch with all members who are opposed to them.,19
42,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The Government understands that the two honourable members who constitute the opposing party have not yet decided who shall be the leader of that party.,19
43,Mr CHARLTON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Hunter) [3.28] Although this is a. small machinery Bill, it has to be read in conjunction with the principal Electoral Act and the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Act and the many acts by whioh those statutes have been amended from, time to time, and it is very difficult for honourable members to grasp the full effect of the bill. They should,have had the assistance of a printed memorandum showing the portions of existing legislation that will be altered by the clauses of this measure. The proposal which the Government is now making is very different from the bill which has come from the Senate, inasmuch as the provision that a pamphlet may not be . printed and circulated. unless both Houses of Parliament so decide is to be eliminated. It is the intention of the Govermnent to move an amendment providing that, .within fourteen days of the passing of the referendum proposals now before the Senate, statements which the parties desire to place before the people shall be forwarded to the electoral officer. That period of time is too short; but I must admit that the amendment is in keeping with the way in which proposals have been rushed through this House. Having protested against the forcing through of the referendum bills, I now have to protest against the inadequate time allowed in this bill for the placing of the argument upon it before the electors. G'overnment has circulated an amendment providing, that the Chief Electoral Officer shall, not less than fourteen days before the day fixed for the taking of the referendum, have the statements of the parties circulated to the electors. How can that be managed in th& short time allowed? It is generally understood that the referendum will be taken towards the end of August.",19
44,Mr BRUCE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The intention of the Government is to hold the referendum as soon as the minimum constitutional period of two months has expired after the passing of the bills through the Parliament.,19
45,Mr CHARLTON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"That means that the vote will be taken about the end of August. The bills may be in the Senate for a fortnight, and a further fortnight has to be allowed for the argument to be stated. The date will then be about the 14th July. The statements pro and con will have to be printed and distributed throughout this vast continent,, and it is doubtful whether that can be done between the middle of July and the end of August. The pamphlet should be in the hands of the electors at least a fortnight before election day. It is of no use wasting public moneyin printing and posting the statements if they do not reach their destination. Mr BAYLEY.:-There will be ample time for the statements to reach 95 per cent, of the people. Mr Charlton.'-Eve n if that be so, we are not justified in compelling the other'5 per cent, to vote in ignorance. If we compel them to vote in ignorance, most of thera will vote "" No . "" In the original act two months was allowed after the statements were made for the' information to be circulated to the electors; It is necessary to give sufficient time for the people to. make themselves acquainted with the proposals. On this occasion the Government will not be assisted by a unanimous press, as it was at the last election. There is already evidence that the leading newspapers are fighting the Government's proposals. The journals that created an atmosphere unfavorable to the Opposition at the election are now creating an atmosphere calculated to defeat the Government's proposals. That is all .the more reasou why we should The proceed slowly, and allow the people proper time for assimilating the facts. I see no reason for depriving the people of reasonable time for consideration.' If the haste is because the right honourable the> Prime Minister wishes to leave shortly for England, it would be better to allow the'submission of this, question to the people to remain until after his return. In that event, we could proceed to consider other legislation until the end of August. In any case, we cannot legislate before next year under the powers which the people are being asked to confer. There is, therefore, no reason why the appeal should not be made next February or March. The weather would then be better than it is in August. No one relishes a campaign at this time of the year, especially when there is no necessity for it. „",19
46,Mr BAYLEY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,This time of the year is suitable in Queensland.,20
47,Mr CHARLTON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"But Queensland is only a part of the Commonwealth. The people should be given ample time to consider the cases submitted by both parties, so that they need not be guided by the newspapers,.which are giving publicity to all the tittle-tattle they can collect on this subject, without regard to whether it comes from interested sources. If they obtain an irresponsible statement about me, or about any other honourable member on this side, they give it ful l publicity, whether it is true or not.",20
48,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,They frequently do not obtain the information from any one; lia; but the first has. they concoct it.,20
49,Mr CHARLTON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"That is true. Age today publishes a statement that denied a few days a.go, and that it must know is untrue. If we do not allow suffidum cient time for the people to ohtain formation from any other source than the newspapers, which have already shown their bias, what will be the fate the referendum? The newspapers will poison the minds of the people. I trike no exception to any newspaper stating its views; but journalism' has sunk to a low ebb when ' tittle tattle is published in an deavour to disrupt this or any other party upon a proposal that is not a party matte' . The press will combine in 1 position to these proposals; there not be any newspapers advocating the affirmative view. It would be better allow sufficient time for our case to presented, as we should then have chance of winning through. I believe that the powers sought under the first bill are absolutely necessary. I have pledged my fullest support to them, I shall honour that pledge, whatever may happen. I shall not fear the influence 'of the newspapers if I am afforded the opportunity of placing arguments before the people in support of the proposals. The Government would act wisely if it reconsidered the matter, and decided to grant further time for the preparation of a strong case. If that is not done, the people will not be able to understand the proposals, and from motives of safety they will vote against them. They must be enlightened. No one is more conservative than the Britisher or the Australian.' He will not act blindly. Before he lends his support to any proposal, he wants to be assured that it is absolutely in his own interest. The case for and against must be allowed to reach the remotest parts of this continent, so that the whole of the people will thoroughly understand the niatters upon which they are being asked to vote",20
50,Mr RODGERS,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Wannon) [3.43] Two different proposals are affected by this bill-on e relating to an amendment of existing powers, and the other to an entirely new power under the Constitution. The latter has never previously been placed before the people of AustraThe argument which was advanced by the Minister in The charge of this bill (Mr Marr) might I . have had some weight if it had been directed to the second and third referenproposals that were placed before the inpeople, because they were practically the same as those which are contained in the first of the measures that we have conof sidered. A full and complete case for and against those proposals was circulated on those occasions. But quite a different position exists in regard to the measure with which we dealt last night, as it breaks entirely fresh ground. A enfurther consideration is that compulsory voting now operates, and a large additional body of electors will be compelled, opnot only to understand the proposals-if will they can-bu t also to vote upon them. Parliament has a big programme to carry to through before August, and those honorbe able members who are opposed to the proa posals will have practically no time in which to prepare their case. The Government is strongly fortified with legal assistance, and it will experience little aud difficulty in having its case fully prepared. Only two honourable members of this House voted against the first bill. has not yet run the gauntlet of the other place; but if our ranks are not strengthened in that quarter, the preparation of the case against its proposals will devolve upon the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) and me. I ask the Leader of the House (Mr Bruce) if he thinks that that is a fair proposition. The Minister in charge of the bill expressed the wish that it should have a speedy passage. That is the desire of the Government in regard to the referendum proposals. A large number of those people who will be compelled to vote upon them will not have the opportunity to thoroughly digest and understand them, and a welter of confusion will arise from the fact that in the campaign, the Government and the Opposition will be in unison in respect toone portion of the proposals, but in disagreement and deadly conflict upon the other. How then can it be expected that a clear and enlightened view of the proposals will be placed before the country? For the first time in the history of Australia, the electors will be compelled to vote upon proposed amendments of the Constitution. According to the Prime Minister, the two bills will not be passed by another plaee before the expiration of a fortnight, and thus only two months will be available for the people to consider them before voting upon them. I do not know of any circumstance that warrants the alteration of the Constitution by a fixed date. The convenience of the Government, or of any honourable member, must be brushed aside, in view of the greater issues that are involved. It is not necessary for me to deal in detail with the atmosphere in whioh these proposals had their birth. We are being asked to make a vital and fundamental change in the Federal pact, yet only a few weeks is to be allowed for the people to arrive at a calm - and deliberate understanding of it. The atmosphere is entirely unfavorable to such an understanding. Has the Prime Minister considered the possibility of paring a constitutional case against the proposals in the limited time that will be available? It will hardly be possible for the various organizations and States that range themselves against these proposals in the country to convene a Federal conference; and the responsibility for that It will rest upon those who support the Government. I strongly protest against the improper haste with which this whole business is being dispatched.",20
51,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Dalley) [3.50] - I support the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) and the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) in objecting to this unnecessary haste. These proposals may have far-reaching results, and affect the welfare of almost every person in the community, and fourteen days is altogether inadequate to prepare the case against them. I suggest to the Government that it should delay the submission of the questions to the people, so that they will be dealt with in an atmosphere of not hysteria, Hut of calm consideration. I hold very strong views on the commerce and industry bill, and I think I speak for a considerable section of the community. My objection to the measure is based on grounds totally differentfrom those of either the honourable member for Wannon or the honourable. member for Swan (Mr Gregory), and in order that the questions may be submitted to the people fairly, I contend that I should be given the opportunity to present my case as well as the honourable member for Wannon and the honourable member for Swan.",21
52,Mr RODGERS,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The honourable member deprived himself of that right by not voting on the bill.,21
53,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,I assure the honourable member that I shall never deprive myself of the right to put my views before the people.,21
54,Mr RODGERS,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Legally , the honourable member has done so.",21
55,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"So far as I know,, there is no law that prevents any party which is opposed to these proposals from presenting its case.",21
56,Mr HUGHES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,There was nothing in the original act.,21
57,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I assure the Governpre- ment that these proposals will be liable to grave suspicion if those opposed to them are denied facilities for stating the ground of their opposition. A ll I ask for is a fair field and no favour. T may not exercise the privilege of statinga case, but I contend that I should have the right to do so. If the Government denies it to niej, or to any honourable members, the clear inference will be that it is afraid of full discussion. Certainly, full and adequate consideration of the matter will be impossible within the limited period of fourteen days.",21
58,Mr HUGHES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"North Sydney) [3.55], - The position created by the agreement between the Leader of the Opposition { Mr Charlton) and the Prime Minister { Mr Bruce) concerning the proposed amendments to our constitutional power over commerce and industry is without precedent. The act which it is now proposed to amend assumed that, when a .constitutional question was to be referred. to the people, there would always' be a party desiring to amend the Constitution, and. on the cither side a party against the proposal. Time brought some changes. On the third occasion on which I had the honour to introduce into this House proposals for the amendment of the Conr stitutibu, the then Leader of the Opposition (Sir Joseph Cook) contented himself with objecting to-, not the subject-matter of the proposed referendum, but the time-it was. during the war-it was to be taken. There were, however, two parties in the House taking up party at^ titudes to the proposals. The present position is very different, and if the - methods well suited to former occasions be persisted in, the. electors will be placed in a most unfortunate situation. A case has now to be made out for and .against the proposed amendments ' to - our constitutional power - over commerce and industry. The reasons given by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) and. the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), who were the only members who voted! against the proposed amendments,, were not those I should give were I required to prepare the case against them. The act provides for the preparation in tabloid form of the - case for and against proposed constitutional amendments for submission to the people, not merely to compress theverbosity of honourable members, but principally to inform the mind of the electors. Now, although the case which the two honourable members, I have mentionedwill prepare be entirely convincing to those to whom it will appeal- I shall not ventureto say whether the number will be large or .small-it will leave a vast number of people in Australia entirely uninformed upon the very points upon which they desire enlightenment. On this question,, the position of the party opposite is no longer that of members of an Opposition; they have become in regard to it membersi of an almost homogeneous Parliament. I am afraid, therefore, that the pamphlet, that is likely to be prepared may not fully represent the views of. those who are. opposed to the proposed amendments . 1 The vast massof the people who voted against the proposed laws for the alteration of the Constitution in 1911,. 1913, and again in 1919, will now be asked,, byreason of the unexpected-and if honourable members please, belated-conversio n of the Government and the party on this side to a policy which. I had long advo^ cated, but without conspicuous success, to come to a decision without having the arguments against the amendments fullystated. ' I can hardly believe that the honourable member for Wannon will entirely cover that ground. Neither he, nor the members of the Labour party, can address themselves to the argument in opposition to that put forward by the party now in favour of the measure. But what we want is an informed public. The electors are now dragged willy-nrify to the poll, and whilst that may be an admirable thing in regard to the election of a Pacliament, it is quite another thing to. drag, a man to the poll to answer a question severely abstract in its nature, and,, it wotild almost appear, beyond the comprehension of some honourable members, in this chamber. The electorscan exercise if needs be their choice between parliar mentary candidates without much coneera for the policies they put forward, but in this case they will be asked to follow an unlighted, and. almost unblazed track through an uncharted morass. To increase their difficulty, they will be told by the Leader of the Opposition'to vote. "" Yes "" in regard to the first bill, E*d to vote "" No "" in regard to the second. They will be told by those who represent organized labour in New South Wales* probably in Queensland,, and possibly alsowill in this State, to vote ""NTo "" in regard to both bills. They will be toldBy the Leader of the Opposition that he voted for one of these? measures, which contains at. l'eaat one proposal to which: he i« utterly opposed- I refer to that for the creation of authorities-becaus e no better course was open to him. How is the elector to thread his way through such a maze? He should at least be given an opportunity to understand these proposals for himself. He will be deafened by conflicting advice from all quarters. Some will say, "" do this,"" others m i l say "" do something else."" There is great force in the statement of the Leader of the Opposition that the people should have more time to study these questions; though it is probable that, in any circumstances, they will follow their leaders. On the first occasion when I liad the honour to introduce in this chamber proposed laws ior the amendment of the Constitution, the Australian Labour party was divided. My friend, Mr Holman, led a phalanx in New South Wales against the proposed amendment, and I led the forces for it.",22
59,Mr FENTON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The Federal Labour party was solid.,23
60,Mr HUGHES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Yes ; but it does not appear to be solid now. On the first occasion there was excuse for doubt and hesitation, because what was proposed was something quite new. We were endeavouring to lead the people to a bourne the very existence of which they then heard of for the first time. On the occasion of the second referendum Labour was for all practical purposes solid, as were, too, its opponents, the then Liberal party. They voted solidly against the proposed constitutional amendment, and the Labour party voted, not quite solidly but reasonably so, for it. On the fringe of both parties, .some Labour backsliders voted against it , and some reformers in the Liberal ranks voted for it. .Now, however, there is a schism of a very serious kind. Had it been possible to delay the introduction of these measures, and allow Labour to determine its position, I think the circumstances that have arisen would not confront us today. We should have had Labour, led by the Leader of the Opposition, against the amendments, and the party on this side for themAs it is, the only light that the people who are to be dragged to the poll can hope to obtain is that to be supplied by the honourable member for Wannon, who is already showing the strain of his responsibility, and the honourable member for Swan, whose spirits triumph over material conditions, and who will, no doubt, illumine the case against the amendments with that humour and brilliance which are the characteristic expressions of his soul. For my part, I do not see how the people can understand what they should do. Sbme one ought to prepare the case against the proposed laws, but there is nobody who can put the case against them as it is viewed by the great mass of unionists outside this chamber. Last night the honourable member - for Richmond (Mr R. Green) spoke of the unionists of Australia .as representing about 10 or 12 per cent, of the population. If they represented only '-so small a percentage, there would be no industrial question in this country at all. I think we might take it for granted that, of every 100 people who pass by, between 47 and 50 are more or less intimately related to what is called the Labour or trade union movement. That has been so since 1910. At the last election, when all the currents of popular feeling were unfavorable, Labour was der feated by only some 10 per cent, of the total votes cast. Therefore, at least 40* per cent, of the people may be assumed to be opposed to the amendments. Yet no one will be able to prepare for them the case against the proposals.",23
61,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The Government should' make an opportunity for them to puttheir case. MrHUGHES - There are still twoparties in respect of this question, but they are not represented in this chamber. It is, of course, delightful to see this House unanimous; but even unanimity has disadvantages. I think that the Government should give an opportunity to the great mass of opinion outside, which may be expected to be hostile to these amendments, to state its case. How that is to be done, I do not presume to indicate, nor do I make any suggestion.",23
62,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,I claim that we have the right. We-refrained from voting for the measures.,23
63,Mr HUGHES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"We must assume that the executive of the Labour movement stands for that movement. Its decision,, whichever way it goes, must be regarded"" as the authoritative decision of the Labour movement in regard to this-, matter. That executive, it appears tome, directly or through any agents it may choose to appoint, either in or out of.' this House, should have an opportunity - of stating its case. If there had been two members of the Labour party here against the proposed amendments, the executive of the Labour movement might have acted through them. Of course, when there is an overwhelming majority, in cluding the leader of the party, prepared to go in a certain direction, other members of it are naturally most reluctant,to oppose the course that is taken.",23
64,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,What we loyalty to the country.,24
65,Mr HUGHES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Part y government is, - as much as anything else, a fact of public l if e . We cannot conduct public affairs without combining in parties, because we cannot exist without some sort of organization which, in its turn, depends upon and promotes united action. is inevitable that individuals at times have to be silent regarding, even to vote against, what would prefer to support. That often happens. Despite that, we know where the people outside to whom I have referred, are on this matter. perfectly certain that nothing on earth will make them vote for this legislation. They should have opportunity of expressing their views. The circumstances that applied at the time of the passing of the original act no longer exist. The circumstances today are unique. The Prime Minister properly took advantage of the offer of the Leader of the Opposition; it would be monstrous had he not done so.",24
66,Mr RODGERS,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The same difficulty presents itself to me. I cannot have recourse to the executive of the great organization that stands behind the Prime Minister.,24
67,Mr HUGHES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I realise that : the Prime Miuister has that advantage. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr . Rodgers), and the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) have opposed the referendum proposals for reasons that they have stated, and they must compose their own differences of opinion.",24
68,Mr RODGERS,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,There are no differences of opinion between us. We are like the Siamese twins on this question.,24
69,Mr HUGHES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The honourable members have every appearance of Siamese twins. The Prime Minister is in an awkward position. We have had five referjendums, three on constitutional proposals, and two on the conscription issue. The people have formed the habit of saying "" No . "" This is most embarrassing; but. it is, nevertheless, a tribute to our stability of character and conservatism. It is upon such qualities that the Empire is built.",24
70,Mr RODGERS,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"May I suggest that we should dispense with the prepared case for and against, and leave the question to the platform ? Both sides would then want is have an equal chance.",24
71,Mr HUGHES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"There is something Machiavellian in that suggestion. I do not know where it will lead us. Certainly pamphlets ought not to be prepared at publio expense setting out the views of one side only. Honourable members on the other side, acting with the best of intenThus it tions, and animated by a desire to serve their country, have held out the olive and branch to the Prime Minister; he has they accepted it , and they are now marching hand in hand with him, although the great bulk of 'the Labour movement is saying not "" Banzai,"" but something very I am different. As the contest develops I do not doubt that there is reserved for them something of that experience of which I an have had more than my share.",24
72,Mr SCTJLLIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Y a r r a ) [4.20] - I agree entirely with the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) that pamphlets setting out only one side of the question should not be printed and distributed at public expense. That is an opinion that will meet with universal approval. One difficulty has not yet been mentioned. Two proposals will be submitted to the people, and, under the bill, the case for and against them will be presented by a majority of those voting on either side. Take the first proposal. Those who voted in its favour were the Government supporters, with two exceptions, and the members of the Labour party. The majority of those who voted in the affirmative will , therefore, be Nationalists, so that on that proposal the Labour view in the affirmative will not be expressed at all.",24
73,Mr MAXWELL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,In this case there seems to be more than two sides to each question.,24
74,Mr SCULLIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The majorit y of those who voted in support of the first bill are Nationalists, and, therefore, only the Nationalist view will be stated in the official pamphlet. Mr HUGHES.'-The honourable memher is wrong. Mr SCTJLLIN"" - The bill readsThe argument in favour of the proposed law, consisting of not more than 2,000 words, and authorized by a majority of those members of both Houses of Parliament who voted for the proposed law. The majority of those in both Houses who voted for this proposed law will be Nationalists.",24
75,Mr RODGERS,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The honourable member is assuming that the two sections supporting the proposal cannot agree upon the terms of the case.,25
76,Mr SCTJLLIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I have not yet reached that stage. Although we. endeavour to lift this subject above it inevitably involves party views. We on this side favour an amendment of the Constitution for reasons that, in many respects, differ from those expressed by the Government.",25
77,Mr MAXWELL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Thos e reasons could be added in the nature of a minority statement.,25
78,Mr SCTJLLIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"That remains to be seen. I am trying to see if something cannot be evolved to overcome the difficulty. There are many reasons for additional powers upon which the majority of honourable members are agreed, but there are many others upon which we entirely disagree. We may agree that Parliament should have the widest powers, and yet disagree when it comes to exercising those powers by legislation. That is obvious. Therefore, an injustice is done if only the Government's view, in the affirmative, is stated in the pamphlet submitted to the people.",25
79,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The same argument applies in the case of those who voted against the proposal. Mr SCTJLLIN' - The views against the proposals will be expressed by a combination of those who voted against them in this House and in another place. It is not a question of arriving at a majority between the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) and the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory).,25
80,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"It is a majority those voting in both Houses. Mr SCTJLLIN"" - It is not a question, as has been stated today, of getting two honourable gentlemen to agree. must agree with others in the Senate who may vote against these proposals. There we have another cross-word puzzle to solve.",25
81,Mr MANN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The opponents of the proposals in the Senate will probably be the La'bour party.,25
82,Mr SCULLIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"We have no grounds to assume that, and we have grounds to assume the opposite. Assuming that the majority of those who vote against the proposal will also be Nationalists, the only view that will be put to the people, as stated in the official pamphlet, will be the affirmative view of"" the Nationalist party, and the negative view of the Nationalist party. The Labour party attitude, for and against, party issues, will not be expressed.",25
83,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,How will the second proposal be affected?,25
84,Mr SCULLIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"There will be a straight-out fight on it. The Labour party is solidly against it. The Opposition will state its case against the proposal, and the Government will state its case in favour of it. It is not worth wasting money printing a ballot-paper in respect of the second proposal. It is mischievous and dangerous, and apt to destroy the value of the first proposal, which, if submitted separately, would have an excellent opportunity of being carried. I regret that the two proposals are being linked together. The big issue that is confronting this Parliament, and on which it iff almost unanimous, is the extension of powers for the permanent use of this Parliament, and yet it is viewed from variouE angles.",25
85,Mr RODGERS,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"If portion of the 1912 act were rescinded, we could dispense with the pamphlet altogether, and leave the explanation of the proposals to platform discussion.",25
86,Mr SCULLIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,That is another question altogether.,25
87,Mr MAXWELL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Are we restricted to 2,000 words?",25
88,Mr SCULLLN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Yes , unless we amend the bill.",25
89,Mr MAXWELL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Why not publish both National party and Labour party views of on the first proposal?,25
90,Mr SCULLIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The time for preparing the pamphlet is limited to two those weeks, which shows the stupidity of They rushing these proposals. Mr RonoEss - We are agreed on that.",25
91,Mr SCTJLLIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The honourable member for Wannon and I quite agreed upon that point. This issue is too big to be hurried. Within five years of the foundation of the Commonwealth, defects in the Constitution were discovered,, and for over twenty years, we have waited for an opportunity to rectify them. A further delay of a. few months will not make much difference. The Prime Minister stated that the Government desires the poll to be taken about the end of August. If the Constitution Alteration Bills posed of by the Senate by the end of this month, and two weeks is allowed for the preparation of the case for and against the proposals, the pamphlets will reach the Chief Electoral Officer by the 14th July, and as they must be in the hands of the electors fourteen days before the vote is taken, only four weeks will be. available for their printing and distribution.",26
92,Mr RODGERS,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"So far as I am cerned, the Government and the Opposition can have the entire pamphlet. The press will suit me better.",26
93,Mr SCTJLLIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I have no doubt that the honourable member and the views he represents will be well served by the newspapers. I do not think that the pamphlet, can be printed and in the hands of the electors by the middle of August. The suggestion of the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) that, the pamphlet should be prepared by agreement is impracticable. Even after the Ministerial party and the Labour party have stated their respective views in. favour of the first referendum proposal the case of those who are opposed to it must be stated. The only votes against that bill in this chamber were recorded by two Ministerialists. view of the Labour organizations has not been stated.",26
94,Mr MAXWELL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,There is no Labour view in opposition to that proposal that Parliament can recognize.,26
95,Mr SCTJLLIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,That is so.,26
96,Mr RODGERS,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Abando n the pamphlet, and leave the propaganda to the platform and the press.",26
97,Mr SOULLLN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,I am afraid that the honourable memberis offering to play with loaded dice; he knows that the press will support him.,26
98,Mr MANU,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,-The provision that the are pamphlet shall reach the electors fourteen days before the vote is taken means that it must be in the hands of the local electoral officer by thatdate. .,26
99,Mr MABE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,NO . The Chief Electoral Officer posts the pamphlet direct to each elector.,26
100,Mr SCULLLN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Sectio n 6A, when amended^ will provide that the case for and against the proposals must be submitted to the Chief Electoral Officer within fourteen days of the passage of the are disproposed law through both Houses. Under the present law the time allowed for consultation and the preparation of matter for the pamphlet is nine weeks, and another two months is allowed for its printing and distribution. Under this : proposal, only one month will be available for printing and distribution.",26
101,Mr BRUCE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"When the case for and against the proposal is presented to the Chief Electoral. Officer, his is the responconsibility of printing and distributing the pamphlet, and he says that he can do that in the time which the proposed amendments will allow.",26
102,Mr SPEAKER,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS," I thought that the debate would be facilitated if I allowed some latitude to honourable members, but it is developing into a committee discussion. It is not in order to discuss at the second reading stage the details of a bill and amendments to. be proposed! in coinmitteei I suggest that honourable members should confine their remarksas far as possible to general principles.",26
103,Mr SCULLIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"You , sir; have stated th& usual practice, but in this instance the only general principle involved is whether or not these pamphlets shall be disThe tributed. T^ere is noprinciple in the bill to examine, except the practicability of its proposals, and the measure of justice they offer to the supporters and opponents of the. referendum proposals. Time is of the essence of the contract, and that is the justification for discussing the details in order to decide whether this measure is worth taking into committee. What has been said emphasizes the unwisdom of prejudicing an important constitutional issue* by undue haste. If a constitutional session is to be held at Canberra next year,, let us deal with ihe whole matter there and then. The further we investigate the Governments proposals now, the greater the muddle in which we'find ourselves.",26
104,Mr BRUCE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External .Affairs) [4.44] - The main point involved in this bill is the desirability or otherwise of issuing a pamphlet setting out the views of those who voted for and against the two proposed constitutional amendments recently dealt with by this House. The statement has been made repeatedly that the referendum proposals are being rushed through. Parliament, and that no reasonable opportunity to study them is being afforded. That argument was disposed of when the House, by passing the two constitutional measures, affirmed the desirability of referring them to the people at once. The suggestion has been made that the taking of the referendum should be delayed until after the constitutional session to be held next year at Canberra. The Government cannot accept that suggestion. It would, be a grave blunder, and the Government would be recreant to its duty, and would violate its election pledges, if it did not proceed at once with the submission to the people of the proposals for dealing with the industrial situation in this country. I ask honourable members to look at the industrial conditions in this country today, and to ask themselves whether, if the Government was not proceeding with the amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and was not seeking additional constitutional powers, there would not be a serious industrial crisis, particularly in the great State of New South Wales. The fact that the Government is about to ask the people for greater constitutional powers has avoided in that State an upheaval that would have had far-reaching effects on the industrial life of this country. The Government stated quite clearly that it intended to have this referendum taken irrespective of any .general constitutional referendum that might be taken after the holding of the constitutional session. Let me .remind honourable members of the difference in time between acting now and deferring .action until after the constitutional session.",27
105,Mr SPEAKER,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The right honourable ihe Prime Minister is discussing matterstrying thai; have already been dealt with by this House. I ask him to confine his remarks to the bill now before the chair.,27
106,Mr BRUCE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"It is necessary to fix the time to be allowed for the preparation and issue of a pamphlet to the electors. The Government says that it is essential that this referendum be taken . at the earliest possible date, so that Ministers may know their industrial powers with as little delay as possible. The matter does not end with the taking of the referendum, whatever may be the decision. If the proposals are accepted by the electors, the Government will have to prepare legislation under the new powers for submission to' the House. Every industry in Australia is vitally affected, and - every possible care should be taken in framing that legislation. As soon as the referendum has been taken, - the 'Government will consult with those persons who can assist it to decide which is the wisest course to pursue. Honourable members opposite will agree that I have shown that I am prepared to discuss these matters with industrial leaders. A considerable period of time must elapse between the acceptance of the proposals by the people and the passing of subsequent legislation. If the electors accept the proposals, the Government will proceed to legislate under the new powers, but, if they reject them, the Government will do its best with the existing powers. In any case, the Government will go forward and do all it can to give effect to the mandate of the electors. As - Boon - as the legislation has been prepared, it will be submitted to this Parliament. Let me contrast that with the delay that will occur if we defer the taking of the referendum until after the constitutional session. At the constitutional session the general revision of the - Constitution will be considered, and the proposals agreed upon will not be submitted to the people until the next general election, which, honourable members know, will not be for a period of three years.",27
107,Mr SPEAKER,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The right honourable the Prime Minister is not discussing the bill before the House. I ask him to confine his remarks to the bill.,27
108,Mr BRUCE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The point I have been to mate is that the proposals should be submitted to the people with the committee stage of the bill. out delay; but there is difficulty in setting up the machinery for their subreferendum, mission. I recognize that difficulty clearly ' as' any honourable member does. Under the law as it stands, a statement of the cases for and against the proposals must be submitted to the electors. The first bill was passed through this House with only two dissentients. The Senate is. numerically weaker than this House, and it is extremely improbable that the number of dissentients there will greater in proportion than it was here. Let us suppose that the majority for the bill in another place will be relatively large as the majority for it here. effect of that will be that majority - of the majority will composed of direct supporters the Government. Although this is not party issue, different views are held by the two bodies of men that compose the majority. The case to be presented the electors is the case prepared by majority of the majority. I agree that it is conceivable that, in presenting the case, the majority will not be entirely in accord.",27
109,Mr GUEGOKY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Why not decide not issue the pamphlet? Mr BRTJOE.^The two who voted against that bill are absolutely unanimous, although discord may be introduced later. In addition to them, a certain number of honourable members abstained from voting. No honourable members sire that one section of this House, which may represent only a section of the comsition munity, shall be able to present its case to the people in a better way than is mitted to other sections. As the country will bear the expense, these consideraagainst tions should be taken into account. It first is impossible to increase the number pamphlets indefinitely. This House can recognize, in regard to any measure, the section that votes for it , and section that votes against it . The vernment brought this bill down because it did uot think it would be fair to prostate ceed uncier an act which provides f o a vote to be taken of the whole Parliawho ment as to whether the pamphlet should be issued. It is within the discretion the House to determine this matter. Whether fourteen days is too long or too short to allow for the preparation of pamphlet, is a question for discussion If, owing to the peculiar circumstances of the it is held' to be unfair that as certain sections of the community should be allowed to state their case at the expense of the Commonwealth, the Government will be prepared to consider a proposal that a pamphlet shall not be issued. The Government invites honourable members to express their opinions. The principle has to be determined before discussing the period to be allowed for the prebe paration and issue of the pamphlet. Mr G. FRANCIS - I notice that the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . as Forde) is in the chamber. We are all The aware that whilst he was travelling upon the the business of the Commonwealth be recently he passed through extreme peril of in an accident in which several persons a lost their lives, and many others were severely injured. W it h the permission of the House, I should like to express the to satisfaction that I am sure every hon the orable member feels at his having come safely through that peril.",28
110,Mr SPEAKER,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Althoug h the honourable member is out of order, I realise that his goodness of heart has prompted to the remarks which he has just made, and which express our feelings.",28
111,Mr FENTON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Maribyrnong ) [5.2] If the Government has decided to issue pamphlets in connection with the referendum proposals, the work should be proceeded with immediately; otherwise there demight be considerable delay in having them distributed. Members of the Oppowill not have any difficulty in defining their attitude towards the referperendum in relation to essential services. They will present a solid phalanx that proposal. But the of the proposals will cause of - difficulty, and if pamphlets are to be issued a spirit of give and take will only have to be manifested. The honourable the member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) and Go the honourable member for Swan (Mr . Gregory) have the right under the act to their case. But there is a very big r section of the people outside this House will not have that right. The honourable, member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) of and, I think, several other honourable members on this side did not care to vote against their leader (Mr Charlton), and a therefore did not vote at all. From the at sentiments that have been expressed by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), I understand that it is not his desire to deprive a considerable section of the community of the opportunity to state their case. He aud those who him will probably wish to the case for the proposals before the people in their own language, whilst we on this side may be anxious to give altogether different reasons for their acceptance. In at least two of the States, possibly in three, a case will be prepared against the referendum, but a big section will not have the opportunity to state their views. I understand that 3,000,000 copies of the pamphlets are to be distributed. That will be a big task.",28
112,Mr THOMPSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Supposin g that a dozen or more honourable members oppose the proposals, each from a different viewpoint, should they all be given the privilege of stating their views ?",29
113,Mr FENTON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"We cannot go to ridiculous extremes. If we are not caref u l there will be a muddle in the way in which the case is presented. If the strict letter of the act is to be adhered to, only the majority which voted for the bill, and the minority which voted against it , will be able to present their case. An opposing party in Victoria is being led by Sir A r t h u r Robinson, and I do not, suppose that it will concern itself about the official statements, because it has sufficient funds to issue its own propaganda. Honourable members of the Country party in this House, with the exception of the honourable member for Swan, will doubtless combine with the Nationalists, whilst the minority section of that party, headed by Mr Allan, the Premier of Victoria, will stand side by side with the Nationalists in the State Parliament. There may be a similar spectacle in every State. W it h so many voices advising the electors, confusion is bound to be created, and there will be such a doubt in the minds of a big bulk of the people that they will vote against the proposals. It would be a common-sense step to postpone the whole matter until it had been properly discussed at a constitutional session. If the honourable member for Swan and the honourable member for Wannon are not likely to avail themselves of . the whole of the space which is allowed to them under the act, could they not permit the balance to be used by that big section whichotherwise will not have an opportunity of stating its case ? If the Government and its supporters persist with these rush tactics they will be ignominiously defeated in the country.",29
114,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Swan) [5.12] - The support Prime Minister referred to the necessity place for haste in the matter, and gave one of the most extraordinary reasons that I have ever heard advanced in this Parliament. He said that it was essential for the referendum proposals to be submitted to the people at the earliest posr sible moment, so that the Government would know the power that it possessed under the Constitution, and the necessary legislation could then be brought down without delay. The carrying of the referendum will not in itself confer power upon the Government; legislation will have to be prepared and passed by this Parliament.",29
115,Mr MAXWEL L,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,That is what the Prime Minister said.,29
116,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Exactly . A few weeks ago the Government had not the slightest idea of bringing forward this legislation.,29
117,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I said in my second-reading speech that the bill was introduced last year. Mr - GREGORY - It was reintroduced subsequent to the opening of this Parliament. We have a federation which gives national powers to the Federal Parliament and sovereign rights to the States. It was entered into freely by the whole of the people of Australia. The Constitution is the foundation of - our liberties; yet we are informed that these proposals must be rushed to the people in order that the Government may have ample time to prepare legislation uuder them. Is it not more important that the people should realise the effect of the alterations that are proposed in the Constitution ? Last night I received one of the greatest surprises that I have ever experienced in my political career. The Attorney-General (Mr Latham) declared that had full trade and commerce powers been asked for in accordance with the wishes of the Opposition, the Commonwealth would have had all the powers that it is seeking under this emergency legislation. I am sure that very few people in the community had the slightest idea that that alteration would give such drastic powers to the Commonwealth. It is essential that the people should have the fullest possible information of these proposed amendments. We should uot be justified in depending entirely upon the advice given' us by the Attorney-General (Mr Latham), but should also seek advice from the most able constitutional lawyers in Australia, and from students of legislation, accountants, and others who may be in a position to advise us.",29
118,Mr MAXWEIX,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"""Why has the honourable member mentioned accountants?",30
119,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I was thinking more of those interested in banking, and in other financial and commercial problems. Valuable information will be available from 9uch men even though they are not legal practitioners. It will remembered that at all of the pre-federation conventions explanations given by men who were not lawyers had a great deal to do with settling the divergent views that were expressed on the subjects under discussion. I do not think that the proposed pamphlet will affect the situation very much. The best means of informing the public mind on these questions is to allow a reasonable time for general discussion. I do not desire, unduly, to delay a vote on them, but I think that it should not be taken for at least three or four months after the bills are passed by both Houses of Parliament. The Prime Minister will not be able to speak on every public platform in Australia. I do not suppose that he even intends to visit - every State during the campaign; but he will have a full opportunity of stating his views through the press. In my opinion, we cannot exercise too much care in considering proposed constitutional alterations, and the unseemly haste with which these bills have been dispatched in this House is discreditable. Ordinary lay members of the House have had no opportunity whatever of satisfying themselves as to the possible effect of the alterations. It would be wise, in my opinion, to retain clause 3 in the bill, for I cannot see how the various parties can adequately state their case in all its aspects in a pamphlet. Both the Nationalist and Labour parties have been disrupted over these question's, although it is true that no honourable member of the Opposition actually voted against the commerce and industry measure.",30
120,Mr MAHOITT,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Some of us did not vote for it, so we are not to be taken as in favour of it.",30
121,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,That need not be so. I should like to know whether it is the intention of the Government to enforce compulsory voting at the referendum?,30
122,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The compulsory voting provisions of the Electoral Act will apply. That is the effect of new clause 9 which I intend to move.,30
123,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I sincerely hope that the Government will reconsider its attitude in that regard, and not enforce compulsory voting. I have a great obbe jection to. people voting who do not take the slightest interest in these matters, and who will not even read newspaper articles on them, for they must record - a blind aud unintelligent vote.",30
124,Mr WEST,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Thos e who do not understand the proposals will undoubtedly vote "" no.""",30
125,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I desire a negative vote, but at the same time. I want an intelligent vote, and if compulsory ""voting is enforced, we shall certainly not get that. The fact that the Prime Minister desires to leave for Great Britain on a certain date, is no justification for 'our rushing this referendum forward. The right honourable gentleman will have opportunities to present his case before 'he leaves for Great Britain. Even if an affirmative vote is given by the people, no - use^ - can be made of the new power until legislation has been passed by this Parliament. I again nrge that more opportunity should be given to the people i o inform their minds on the full effects of these proposals. Mr A. 'GEEEN (Kalgoorlie) [5.27] I consider that the 'Government, by these hasty methods, is endangering the likelihood of an affirmative vote 'on the commerce and industry proposals, in which I am interested. Although I am entirely opposed to the essential service proposals, I do not desire to - see a farce made of any referendum on 'constitutional alterations. With the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), I am of the opinion that it will 'be impossible for us fully to state OUT views to the people in the time the Government proposes to allow us. I do not wish to take advantage of the position in which tihe Prime Minister .j .finds himself. I .know that he wants to attend, the Imperial Conference in Lonby don during October, but I can. see difficulty in him stating his views on these matters before he leaves Australia, of that course has to be considered. and leaving the continuation of the camdoubt paign to his colleagues. He has told quite clearly that, even if the people an affirmative vote on all the proposals submitted to them, nothing, can be done to take advantage of it until next seswealth. sion.

126,Mr WEST,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"There is a constitutional difficulty in the way of delay; these posals must be submitted to the people within two months of the passage of the bill through Parliament. Mr A . GREEN - Eve n two months would be better than the limited the Government proposes to give us. It is ridiculous to think that the people can give an intelligent vote on these matters without having a proper opportunity to this chamber. study them. In the time that is available, it will be impossible to even circupeople late these pamphlets in some parts Australia, let alone give the people opportunity to read and study them. Tney will have to depend upon broadcasting for their information about the proposed constitutional amendments.",31
127,Mr THOMPSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"What parts of the Commonwealth does .the honourable member refer to? Mr A . GREEN - The north-western part of Western Australia, Darwin, and such remote places.",31
128,Mr THOMPSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"There are people there. Mr A . GREEN - There are hundreds of people in those places, it would be a gross injustice to the electors to have the referendum taken before they are given an opportunity to study the proposals. The pamphlets printed by the 21st J u l y ; they will not be available u n t i l the 28th July. They have to be distributed by the 14th August, and the referendum is to take mind. place on the 28th August. Boats leave for the Nor'-West on the 4th August, will not reach Broouae u n t i l the August. It will be impossible, therefore, to a centre to receive their mail. for the pamphlets to be in the hands of electors in the neighbourhood of Broome the 14th August. If it is urged that no the pamphlets can be carried by aeroplane, the practicability of the adoption I very much whether the aerial ser- . us vice of the north-west of Western Ausgive tralia would be able to distribute the number of pamphlets necessary for the electors in that part of the CommonEven if .the aerial post were to used as far as Broome and Derby, it postwould not be possible, within the timo proposed to distribute the pamphlets at Boats leave for Wyndham the 6th August, and will not reach that place before the 1.4th August. The mail service takes two or three weeks to reach the east and west Kimberleys fro m proWyndham, and' it is clear that in the circumstances I have mentioned some, of the electors will not be in possession of the pamphlets before the referendum is taken. I understand that . in the Nor- them Territory people wil l not have the . time right to vote on these proposals. Mir.

GREEN. - I am satisfied that residing in parts of Australia of of which I have knowledge, and in other an remote parts such as districts north of Oodnadatta,, with, which I am not familiar, will be unable to receive the pamphlets before they are called upon, to vote at the referendum. It is regrettable and inequitable to allow so short a time for the distribution of the pamphlets. X should very much like to see the proposed amendments dealing with trade and .commerce carried, but I believe that many people will turn them down,, because of very few lack of information about them.",31

I am claiming merely that the country men should be given the same advantages in deciding a great national question as the towndwellers.  It appears to me that this bill is necessary, if the questions to be submitted at the referendum are to be explained to the people in time for their decision to be registered by the end of August or thereabouts, and so that legislation based upon decision may be prepared for consideration during an early session next year. The opinions held concerning the proposed constitutional amendments may be divided into four sections, and may be sub-divided into eight sections. are those who are in favour of both proposals. There are a few opposed to both. There are those who are in favour of the first proposal, and opposed to the second, and there are a few who are in favour of the second proposal and opposed to the first. These four classes can be subdivided again, because some favour the first proposal for reasons which differ from those for which it is favoured by others. This applies to honourable members on both sides. So far as I can see the only way out of the difficulty of preparing the case for and against the proposals is to appoint two small joint committees consisting of members from both sides in both Houses of the Parliament. The affirmative committee dealing with the first question would not necessarily be the affirmative committee dealing with the second question, because some of those dealing with the first question affirmatively would be opposed to the second question. In this way there would be set out every conceivable argument in favour of,' and in opposition to, both proposals.",31
131,Mr LAZZARINI,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Werriwa)' [5.38] The remarks of the honourable member  used as an argument in support of the contention on this side that a longer time should be given for the preparation of the proposed pamphlets. I do not see how the case for either side can be properly prepared in fourteen days - This House has been discussing the questions involved for days, and I think that very few honourable members have yet a clear idea of what the whole business means. The bill makes provision for compulsory voting at the referendum. I have no objection to compulsory voting, bui if it is to be applied to the referendum, we should not stampede the people into giving their decision. They should be given ample time to understand the proposed amendments. The Prime Minister left some doubt in the minds of honourable members as to what will happen in connection with the compilation of the pamphlets. I am not satisfied that the Government will adopt a method which will that lead to the questions being put clearly to the people. I really had no intention to speak on this measure, and I rose only because I desire to reply to a statement made by the Prime Minister when speaking of the time necessary for the comThere pilation of the pamphlets. He said that any one considering the position in New South Wales would come to the conclusion that if these proposals had not been made by the Government, serious industrial trouble would have arisen there, or the existing trouble would have been extended. In all seriousness, I ask the Prime Minister whether he is so unsophisticated as to believe, or to try to induce members of this House to believe, that the mere introduction of proposals for alterations of the Constitution-on e of which will not be carried-wa s sufficient to' stampede people into doing something that they did not want to do. The right honourable gentleman's statement was absurd. The Government has stood idly by and permitted negotiations for the settlement of difficulties in New South Wales to be undertaken by the State . Government, and yet the Prime Minister, when those difficulties are almost settled, says that the introduction of. these measures prevented trouble in that State. He has said that he is prepared to discuss matters with industrial organizations. . I have been present on one or two occasions when he has done so, and those who have called upon him have come away cold, realizing that he is not prepared to do anything from their point of view. Where is the necessity for rushing the referendum ? I am satisfied that the Go* vernment does not intend tb legislate on the basis of the decisions of the people at the referendum before the Prime Minister returns from his visit to England. It appears to me that it is the purpose of the Government to create an atmosphere in the electorate that will be one of doubt and uncertainty. It looks as if they desire their own proposals to be defeated. There have been a number of anti-Labour Prime Ministers in the Commonwealth, but so far as I know the present holder of the office is the only one who has been prepared to use industrial unrest to his own advantage. The 44-hour working week difficulty is settled in New South Wales, and the other difficulty that arose there is very nearly settled. The statements of the Prime Minister this afternoon will not hasten that settlement, though they might de-* lay it . I have no intention of permitting the right honourable gentleman to get away with those statements unchallenged. He has not the least authority for taking credit to himself in the way he did. If the difficulty in New South Wales is settled, it will be by the efforts of the Labour Government of that State, and in spite of the refusal of the Commonwealth Government to do anything whatever to bring about a settlement.",32
132,Mr WEST,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Sydney) [5.45] - This bill was passed by the Senate in February last, being discussed by that chamber because it had nothing else to do at the time. There was then not the slightest impression abroad that this legislation was urgently required. At that time, and for a long time afterwards, there was no suggestion of the proposed alteration of the Constitution. Various bills are being rushed through the House to enable the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) to attend the Imperial Conference to be held in England this year. It would be far better if he stayed at home, to try to solve some of our own problems instead of posing as the dictator of Imperial policy. I assure the Prime Minister that the British statesmen know their own business better than we do. The original act provides that, when a proposed alteration of the Constitution is to be submitted to the people, the argument for and against it shall be prepared in pamphlet for m within a period of nine weeks. The bill proposes to curtail that period to fourteen days, and provides that, within two months of placing the pamphlet in the hands of the electoral officer, it shall be ' printed and distributed among the electors. This provision is mischievous, because it restricts the opportunities of giving information to the people in respect of a proposed alteration of the Constitution. Paragraph (3) of clause 3 readsNotwithstanding anything contained in .this section, a pamphlet containing arguments relating to a proposed law shall not he printed and posted in accordance with this section unless, within one week after the passage of the proposed law through both Houses, those Houses decide by resolution that the pamphlet shall be so printed and posted. Under that provision the Government would have power to prevent the distribution of pamphlets.",33
133,Mr LATHAM,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"That has been provided for in the amendment which has been circulated among honourable members. It will be seen that it confers on any individual member of the House the right to move a motion, and to have it dealt with forthwith.",33
134,Mr WEST,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The Attorney-General must know that the Government controls Parliament, and could, if it so desired, prevent the adoption of such a motion.",33
135,Mr LATHAM,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Unde r the amendment a private member Would have the right to move, for the adoption of the motion forthwith.",33
136,Mr WEST,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The bill also proposes to bring the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Act into conformity with the Electoral Act. The Electoral Act has been in operation for many years, and there is really no urgent necessity to amend it . As this measure requires serious consideration, why not postpone its consideration u n t i l the constitutional session to be held at Canberra next year ? The Prime Minister, when speaking on this bill, showed clearly that he has lost the calm judgment and affability that he at one time possessed. He proposes to rash this legislation and the referendum proposals through both Houses of Parliament. At least four months will elapse after the referendum is taken before the official figures will be available. He evidently 'thinks that there is a probability of imminent industrial disturbances. I assure him that, under the administration of Labour Governments, there are practically no industrial disputes in New Soutli Wales and Queensland. Perhaps the Prime Minister anticipates .that serious trouble will follow tke enforcement of . the Government's fmanci'al proposals. I assure that there, is no possibility of carrying the referendum proposals unless the proposal to take control of esseutial services is withdrawu.

144,Mr RODGERS,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Wannon) [8.0] - The discussion in committee has cleared the - air completely, if it were necessary, of any 'doubt on ithe question of whether - or not :amy party,- any section of a party, or any individual could be trusted, in this the welter of confused thought to accurately fourteen express the view of any other individual regarding these proposals. IFor instance, the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) rightly said that the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) and I were quite unable to put the case from the point of view of the dissentients on the Labour side and the body behind them. 1 recognize that I am unable to do it, and I would not attempt to do it. If it fell to the lot of the honourable member for Swan and myself to do that, their case would be unstated. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) made the position even more bewildering when he explained that, although he had not voted against the granting of the powers, he had spoken against the bill; that neither the honourable member for Swan nor I could possibly express the views of the body that he represented; and that he could not trust the Government, or even the Leader of his own party, with the statement of the case on his behalf. While the honourable member for Dalley, who trusts nobody in this chamber, stands in complete isolation, the honourable member for Swan and I , at least, form a party of two who tliink very much alike. preparation of the case for and against the proposals relating to commerce and industry would, as a matter of practical politics, be put by the Government side to the complete exclusion of both sections of the Opposition. Such a state of affairs would reduce the whole campaign to ridicule in the eyes of the people. If the honourable member for Swan and I had to draw up the case, we should call to our aid the clearest brains available, and attempt to prepare a statement that would clarify the atmosphere. But there is no person in the country who could express the views of the right honourable member for North Sydney to his own liking. Therefore, I intend to propose the insertion of a new clause, and I hope that the Government will give an indication at this juncture whether, instead of persevering with the amendment that the Honorary' Minister (Mr Marr) has moved, it will accept my suggestion, which, I think, after all, will be fairest to all sections, both in the Parliament and in the country. I propose to move the insertion of the following new clause:Section OA of the principal act apply in relation to any referendum upon Mr Rodgers. the proposed law entitled, "" Constitution Alteration .(Industry and Commerce) 1926,"" or upon the proposed Taw "" Constitution Alteration (Essential Services) 1926."" I hope that the Government, when it ascertains the feeling of the committee, and realizes. the state of bewilderment that will follow any attempt to state the case for and against, will recognize in my amendment a means of saving the unfortunate elector the trouble of perusing the proposed document, and of saving the country at least from £10,000 to £15,000, which would be the cost of preparing, printing, and distributing the referendum, pamphlet. My proposal would put all sides on an equal footing. Then the honourable member for Dalley could explain his. position to his heart's content, and everybody else in the chamber and in the country would be unfettered by official views stated by any party or section of a party. In view of the temper of the people outside, I think that my suggestion would meet the situation much better than any attempt to state the case for and against the proThe posals-as the right honourable member for North Sydney expressed it-in tabloid form. My amendment in effect would mean that this referendum would be conducted in the same way as that held in 19.16 by the Hughes Government, without the case for and against the proposals having been published in the form of an official pamphlet. If the amendment by the Honorary Minister be persisted with there will be no opportunity to deal with my proposal, because it will have been resolved to proceed with the publication of the statement of the case.",35

147,Mr CHARLTON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Hunter) [8.10] The Minister has submitted two amendments. According to the usual procedure the proposal by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) should be shall not considered as an addendum.,36

153,Mr HUGHES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,It would not be a newclause. It would have to be an addendum.,37
154,Mr SCULLIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Yarra) [8.12] - The only way to test the feeling of the committee on the matter is for the Honorary Minister to withdraw his amendment temporarily. Then an amendment could be moved to eliminate clause 3 of the bill with a view to the insertion in its stead of the clause indicated by the honourable member for Wannon.,37

It Avill entitle the majority party to submit a case to the people. I do not knoAv Avhether all the or minority parties, of which there are many. Avill have the same right. Supporters of the Government, Will feAv exceptions, faA our the proposals in both r bills; but honourable members on this side, with a few exceptions, faA'our the proposals in the first bill, but oppose those in the second bill. No difficulty arises in that connection in stating our views, but a case prepared by the Government, and setting out reasons for supporting the first bill, might not be acceptable to honourable members on this ^side. Although we support the proposals, we may not support the reasons advanced for them by the GoA ernment. The effect r of issuing a pamphlet may be to antagonize the two .parties on the platthe form.",37
163,Mr MAXWELL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Many of the reasons advanced by the Labour party might induce Nation alists to vote "" No."" Mr Charlton:-And the reasons on advanced by the Government might i duce members of the Labour party to ""No."" Even at this early stage we can see that there is a marked difference opinion outside. At the 1911 and 1913 referendums the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), who proposals was then a member of the Labour party, prepared pamphlets. At that time there had been a party conflict, and it was thought that each side should .have the itdivision right to state - its case. On the present occasion the two parties have agreed this Parliament needs additional powers, and both are going to advise the people to grant those powers. But members of the two parties may advocate the grantthis ing of the powers from different points of view. If the Government issued pamphlet of which we did not approve, - entire satisfaction »to .all. .and we had to explain ourselves on the platform, confusion would 'be created the public mind. In the circumstances, would be wise for the Government to accept the amendment. ""We shall have ruuch opposition. The press will be hostile, and that will be a big burden carry. The newspapers do much to create puiblic sentiment. Let us take the platcannot form in favour of the proposals is - in the first bill, and state views to the people. In that way the appeal will probably Tie more effective than if we issue a pamphlet. The ciramendment cumstances today are different from those that prevailed when the original act was posal to amend section 6A. passed. If we go before the country united, there will he a good prospect - obtaining assent to the proposals.",38
164,Mr BRUCE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs [8.28]. - The debate on the motion for the second reading of this bill showed that tremendous difficulties have to came in issuing a pamplilet stating views for and against the proposals. The right honourable member for N.orth .Sydney '(Mr Hughes) analysed the position - clearly, and showed that a pamphlet the could not give a fair statement of the on both sides. I recognize that considerable force in that contention.. As Government is responsible for these proposals, it would naturally like to present to the people its own arguments in favour ef them, but it recognizes that that would not the fair. The majority the first hill consisted of - supporters n - - of the Government and members of the vote Opposition, and only two honourable members voted against it . In view of of the voting in this' House, and the probable voting in (another place, the result - of issuing a pamphlet in favour of the in the first bill would be that direct supporters of the Government would state the case in support of the proposals, and would be able to present from their point of view. In view of the which took place in - bhis House that would mot be fair, and consequently that the Government is .prepared to accept the amendment. It is probably the only - way out of the complicated and novel situation which has arisen.

Electoral Act such an elector may go to the polling booth, hand in his postal ballot-paper, and receive in exchange an ordinary ballot-paper. Section 121 of the principal act. relates to an elector who attends at. the polling booth to record his vote, only to find, that the presiding officer is not satisfied that he is entitled tovote. His. name may not be on the certified roll. Under the Electoral Act the elector in such circumstances may demand a vote, in which case he is permitted to vote after having signed the necessary form.",39
168,Mr HUGHES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"""Whether his name is on the roll or not?",39
169,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Yes . The amendment is to bring the Referendum Act into line added:with the Electoral Act . Section 1 2 1 the principal act provides for the case of an elector who is told by the presiding officer that' he has already voted. 1924 amending legislation was passed provide that, in such circumstances, upon the elector signing a statutory declaration that he had not previously voted at the election, and that his name had been improperly marked off, the presiding present act. officer should issue a ballot-paper to him so that he would not be deprived of his vote.",39

"" (2.) Nothing in this section shall prevent the officer conducting the scrutiny from rejecting any ballot-paper as being informal although it is not objected to."" This provision is identical with that which is contained in the Commonwealth electoral law.",40

In the present instance, on account of the happy consummation of our efforts, the conditions may be different from those of an election. I do not know that we shall all be upon the same side; but all the respectable people in the country will be, and there will be no one to question the decision of the scrutineer.",40
180,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The scrutineer cannot do anything.,40
181,Mr HUGHES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Oh , can he not? good scrutineer can do a great deal. I want to learn from the Minister what is the intention of the electoral office in regard to the appointment of scrutineers representing all parties. - Mr MARR (Parkes-Honorar y Minister) [8.48] - The business of conduct-' ing a referendum is peculiarly non-party. There are no candidates. an election for the Senate or the House of Representatives the candidates can nominate scrutineers, but in the case of a referendum it is laid down that the Governor General shall appoint scrutineer at each polling booth, if he so desires.. The law in relation to the taking of referendums makes the following provision :1. The result of the referendum shall be ascertained by scrutiny. 2. The Governor General, or any person authorized by him, may appoint one scrutineer at each place where the scrutiny is conducted in each electoral division; and the Governor of a State or any person thereto authorized by him may appoint one scrutineer to be present at each place where the scrutiny is conducted in each electoral division for the State.",40
182,Mr HUGHES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The scrutineer will be a most important person.,40
183,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"As this will be a non-party question, and as all parties are satisfied with the act as it stands, we should be'prepared to accept the scrutineer appointed by the Governor General or by the Governor of a State, as he will be a non-party man.",40
184,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The presiding officer, and not the scrutineer, will have the authority.",40
185,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,That is so; but the other man will scrutinize the ballot.,40
186,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Dalley) [8.50] There will be much diversity of opinion concerning the merits of these referendum proposals, and if the Government is to have the sole right to appoint scrutineers, those persons who are opposed to its proposals will have nobody to watch their interests.",40
187,Mr HUGHES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Hear , hear!",40
188,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The whole matter will be in the hands of partisans.,40
189,Mr MAXWELL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Does the Dalley party claim the right to appoint a scrutineer?,40
190,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"-I claim it not for the Dalley party, but for the great majority of the people of Australia. A Mr HUGHES - There has always been a sufficient number of informal votes to carry these proposals, and therefore the scrutineer is in a position to defeat the referendum.",40
191,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"That is so, unless there are scrutineers watching the in terests of both sides. There is not the slightest doubt that the persons who are In appointed as scrutineers will be partisans and will not take a great deal of interest in the vote if it is not going the way they desire it to go. The Government ought to make provision whereby those one who are opposed to these proposals will have the right to nominate scrutineers to watch their interests. It is amply protected by its right to appoint scrutineers to watch its interests. ""We claim the same right on behalf of the m a j o r i ty of the citizens of Australia.",40
192,Mr LATHAM,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The majority?,40
193,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,I said the majority. After the referendum has been taken the honourable gentleman will discover that I am correct in stating that the majority of the people of Australia are hostile to these proposals.,41
194,Mr MARE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Parkes-Honorar y Minister) [8.53] - All parties agree that the Electoral Act is administered in a very fair manner.,41
195,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,I do not object to provisions of the Electoral Act.,41
196,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Honourable members must admit that neither the Government, the Opposition, nor any other party has a hand in the selection of poll clerks. Hundreds of those omcers are appointed at each election. Although they are officially appointed by the Governor General, they are selected by the divisional returning officers on account of their experience and proved worth. The scrutineers to whom honourable members refer are those who watch the interests of 2 ticular candidates. The omcers referred to in this measure will really be assistant presiding officers. The honourable member for Dalley need have no fear that the Government will pick out men who will watch the in terests of only one side.",41
197,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I am not claiming the right to appoint poll clerks; the divisional returning officers always act fairly in the appointment of those officers. But as at an ordinary election, we should have the right to appoint scrutineers who will watch our interests.",41
198,Mr LATHAM,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,It cannot be done.,41
199,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"There will be presiding officers and assistant presiding officers. At each individual centre there will be a scrutineer who will scrutinize the count and submit it to the divisional returning officer, who in turn will send it to headquarters. Those scrutineers will be appointed by the Governor General. honourable member for Dalley need have no qualms; he can rest assured that the divisional returning officers will see that the best men are appointed.",41
200,Mr MCGRATH,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Ballarat) [S.55] I hold' strong opinions regarding the necessity for the appointment of scrutineers. At one election we were able to upset the result upon appeal to the H i gh Court, because scrutineers representing our party were stationed at the polling booths. I had another experience when the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) was Prime Minister. * On that occasion he was not quite so anxious as he appears to be to-night to have scrutineers appointed. I refer to the conscription referendum that was taken in 1916. The matter was allowed to go through this House without much discussion, and it might have had very seriouis consethe quences. I was in charge of an office in London when the referendum was taken. The votes of the soldiers were counted in an adjoining room. As an anti-conscriptionist stationed in London I claimed the right to see the votes counted, but instructions had been received from - Australia that that privilege was to be accorded only to captains, colonels, generals, and other high officials in the military organization. Probably nobody knows the result of that vote. I am quite satisfied that an adequate check was not exercised at the count. The 5ar action then taken was opposed to the spirit of fair play. The reeling in regard to these proposals is somewhatmixed at present, but that condition may become accentuated in the ensuing seven or eight weeks before the vote is taken, and it is possible that parties will range themselves very strongly either for or against them. The honourable member for Dalley is merely claiming that every party shall have the right to nominate a scrutineer to sit at the table when the votes are being counted. The Government is not being asked to bear the expense. The proposal of the M i nistry is that one scrutineer shall be appointed for each counting place. There will be 20 tables in soine polling booths. I ti must not be forgotten that many electors require to be assisted to record their votes. In every election that I have conducted, but particularly since I entered the Federal arena, the scrutineers The of the Labour party have been instructed that when an elector who produces a Labour card asks for assistance every case shall be taken to see that the vote is cast in accordance with the wishes of the elector. What is wrong with the proposal to give every party the right to nominate a scrutineer ? The ' right honourable member for North Sydney stated by interjection that at past referendums the number of informal vote3 had been sufficient to carry them. If there are scrutineers at every table giving assistance to electors, fewer informal votes will be recorded. Frequently electors will not ask for assistance unless - they know that 'scrutineers are available to give it . ' The number of people who put their ballot-papers the box unmarked is surprising. Quite a number of people will vote "" No "" and "" Yes "" on these proposals. I hope the Minister will accede to the request that any political party which has strong feelings in regard to the questions to be submitted at the referendum may nominate scrutineers at each polling booth. j t r . HUGHES (North Sydney) [9.1]. - The honourable member 'for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) has just recalled to my mind the fact that, at the five referendums that have taken place in Australia, three on proposed amendments of the Constitution, and two on the conscription issue, the number of informal votes was very large. The questions submitted to the people in 1913 covered., inter alia, practically the same ground as the proposed amendments in relation to the industrial and commerce powers of the Commonwealth. On the proposed law relating to corporations, there was a majority against of 26,000, and the number of informal votes was 83,000. On that relating to industrial powers, the majority against was also 26,000, and the number of informal votes was 81,000. To all practical purposes the same ratio was maintained on the other four questions submitted. It is a most striking fact, and one not experienced in ordinary elections, that practically the same number of electors should on the six questions record informal votes, when they were simply asked to say "" Yes "" or "" No."" think it can be taken for granted that, in the overwhelming majority of cases, the intention _ of the electors was perfectly clear, but they probably made some technical errors which rendered their votes informal. If a scrutineer at a referendum is able to determine whether or not a ballot-paper is informal, he wields a power which, in the circumstances, may create a most unsatisfactory feeling in the minds of - the people when the forthcoming appeal is made. In all human probability, unless there is a great swing-over of opinion, I do not think that the. majority for the present proposals will exceed the majority against the previous proposals. The people will be so equally divided that if 20,000 electors cross from one side to the other it will be the most we can expect. The referendum would easily be in carried or lost by a majority of 5,000 votes out of a poll of 3,000,000, just as in 1913 the proposals were defeated by 26,000. out of a poll of 2,000,000. At that time, the two parties were so distinct that the lines of cleavage were obvious to all, - and when. I set out the case for, and the then Leader of the Opposition the case against, the amendments, the people accepted the arguments as those which appealed to them. At that stage we had had no experience in these matters, but, since then, the people have become a little more educated in regard to them. > We are now asking them to agree to two questions, in regard to one of which we have had no experience, and in regard to the other a new proposal has been embodied which will make many hesitate to accept it. I think that the Government should ""bring down an amendment to enable scnttineers to be appointed Tby both sections, because, for all practical purposes, on these questions there will be only two sections, those for and - those against. The argument put forward by the Honorary Minister (Mr Marr) is not at all convincing. He declares that a scrutineer will be non-partisan. As a matter of fact, a scrutineer cannot be non-partisan. He is compelled to vote "" Yes "" or "" No,"" and, unless he is a bigger fool than any one else in the community in giving his vote, must have reasons for voting one way or I the other. There is in the community a percentage of mental degenerates, but there are not enough of them to put one in each polling booth. Therefore, we must obtain the services of average men, and, human nature being as it is, the average man will give the benefit of the doubt to his own party.. That being so, I suggest that scrutineers be appointed by each party.",41
201,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Swan) [9.7] - There is something humorous in the situation. We have had the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) telling us of what has occurred at referendums. On every occasion a referendum has been taken in Australia the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) has been either Prime Minister or the right hand man to the Prime Minister, with the right to appoint scrutineers as well as presiding officers and poll clerks. Was the large number of informal, votes to which he has called attention caused by the class of scrutineers he appointed, or by the case for the amendments as prepared by the right' honourable member? This referendum will cost from £80,000 to £100,000. I hope the proposals will be turned down, and I will do all I possibly can to have them turned down, but at the same time. I realise that the administration of the Electoral Department is clean, and I . can see no value in adding to the expense by the appointment of. additional scrutineers. All they can do is to watch the marking off of names on the rolls, and take objection if at count they think a vote is being accepted OT rejected improperly.. We have just come to the conclusion that. it. is as not to publish the case for or against the proposals, because of the idifficulty of preparing and issuing the pamphlets. We should also encounter difficulty if we raised the question of appointing scrutineers. Who would appoint them?",42
202,Mr MCGRATH,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Thos e who are sufficiently interested for or against the Government's proposals.,43
203,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I do not see any objection to the appointment of scrutineers if they are paid by various organizations, but I have a great objection to the Government being asked to appoint nnd remunerate scrutineers on behalf of those who are opposed to their proposals.",43
204,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,I can clear that matter up.,43
205,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I hope the Minister can do co, because I do not want, to see the expense of the referendum increased in the manner suggested.",43
206,Mr WEST,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"East Sydney) [9.12] The scrutineers appointed by the Government simply attend the final count after the ballot-boxes are taken from the various tables in the booths. But I can see no objection to scrutineers being appointed at each table as is done in the case of ordinary elections. At one polling booth in my electorate there, are 25 tables, and. I am satisfied that I can get fifteen persons who will attend at that booth on polling day without fee or reward, and help the poll clerks at the tables. I have the greatest admiration for the officers of the Electoral Department. They carry out their duties and the trust reposed in them faithfully. Curiously, many people are nervous at the ballot box, but that is not the reason for so many informal votes. I took an interest in elections long before I was elected to this House, and I have frequently assisted as a scrutineer in the Senate count. At the last election many ballot-papers had such words written across them as "" Short and long,"" "" I am a socialist,"" "" None of them are any good,"" and others that I cannot mention, as thero.. are ladies in the gallery. It would conthe siderably help the conduct of the referendums if scrutineers could be allowed to act as they do at ordinary elections; well and it would give the public much more confidence in the proceedings. Plenty of volunteers would offer for this work, and with their help many people who otherwise might not be able to cast a formal vote in the way that they desired,, would do so. Mr G. FRANCIS (Kennedy) [9.20] The debate on this clause has proceeded on the assumption that only one scrutineer may be appointed; but sub-section 1 (2) of section 18 of the Act reads:The Governor General or any person authorized by him may appoint one scrutineer at each polling place in each State, and the Governor of a State or any person thereto authorized by him may appoint one scrutineer at each polling place in the State. Section 19 provides the machinery for giving effect to section 18. Obviously, two scrutineers may be appointed, and that will meet the objection raised by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Mahony) and other speakers on the other side of the committee. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) seemed to assume that ballot papers were-rejected by the scrutineers; but, as a matter of fact, only the presiding officer, or the assisting presiding officer, can reject them. In the circumstances I shall vote for the clause. Proposed new clause agreed to. Motion (by Mr MARR ) agreed toThat the following new clause be added:8. Section 33 of the principal act amended- (a) by omitting the words ""or on count of the absence or error officer which is not proved to have affected the result of the referenelections, dum"" and inserting in their stead the words "" or on account of absence or error of or omission any oflicer which did not affect result of .the referendum""; and (6) by adding at the end thereof lowing proviso:"" Provided that wliere tor was, on account of the absence or error of or omission by officer, prevented from voting on a referendum, the court shall for the purpose of determining witnesses. whether the absence or error of or omission by the officer did did not affect the result of the referendum, admit any evidence the way in which the elector tended to vote."". Motion (by Mr MARR ) proposed - That the following new clause be added:9. Tho principal act is amended by omitting the words and figures "" Commonwealth Electoral Act 191S-1919"" (wherever occurring) and inserting in their stead the words and figures ""Commonwealth Electoral Act 191S1925"".",43

209,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"In that case I should like the Government to give some consideration .to the wisdom of suspending compulsory voting for the purposes of this referendum. I am not pleased at the prospect of 80,000 or 90,000 persons giving informal votes on these matters. I know that compulsory voting is the present policy of the country; but I do not like it .

Seeing that postmasters postmistresses, school teachers, acand many other persons are authorized to of any witness postal votes for Commonwealth I think it reasonable that commissioners for taking affidavits in Victoria the who are competent to witness postal votes by under the State act, should also be comthe petent to witness them under the Comthe folmonwealth act.
