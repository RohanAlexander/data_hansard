Our action recognises and accepts God's promise expressed in the Second Book of Chronicles, chapter 7, verse 14. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that God's Word would be observed 'If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves and and will turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sins, and will heal their land.' We believe that God affirms this promise in the Book of Deuteronomy, Chapter 28, verses 1 to 14. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, PETITIONS by Mr Cadman. Petition received. Humanitarian Aid To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the Estate Duty House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned concerned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: 1. On 16 June 1976, when the students of Soweto township in South Africa demonstrated peacefully, many hundreds were shot down. of a deceased estate passes to 2. Since that date the people of Soweto and of South Africa in general have continued to protest at the denial of human rights and at the terrible conditions to which they are subjected by the white minority government. consequence of the savage repression suffered by the African, Coloured and other oppressed people in South Africa, thousands have been forced tofleeacross the borders into such neighbouring states as Botswana and, Mozambique. Whaling We, your peutioners humbly pray that the Government take immediate steps to provide humanitarian aid to the refugees from South Africa, in particular by providing funds respectfully show us, that for the supply of clothing, medical supplies etc. scholarships and transport costs to enable student refugees to continue their education in Australia. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Chapman. Petition received. Hearing Impaired Citizens: Special Telephone Metric System Equipment To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of certain members of the Australian Association for Better Hearing and other citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that a financial burden is imposed on hearing impaired members of the public in that the special telephone equipment, which is essential for such hearing impaired citizens to make telephonic communication, is subject to installation costs and rental charges.

Medical Benefits: Pregnancy Help Services To the Right Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully pray, and seek my face, showeth: That the weakest members of our society, the unborn, should have the same protection as all other citizens of Australia. That abortion is a denial of the civil rights of the unborn, involving as it does the destruction of innocent human life. That on 10 May 1973 the House of Representatives rejected the Medical Practices to legalise abortion on demand in the Territories controlled by the Federal Government. That women and girls with serious problems during pregnancy need special care and help to overcome their difficulties rather than encouragement to terminate their pregnancies. That termination of pregnancy can never be justified on sociological or personal grounds and can be a dangerous treatment when the mother realises that her child has been killed. That over 46,000 abortions were paid for in 1976 under the existing medical benefits schedule which stipulates the benefit payable for medical services under both Medibank and the private health insurance funds. That approximately $5,000,000 was spent on abortions in 1976 under Item No. 6,469-'The evacuation of the contents of a gravid (pregnant) uterus by curettage and suction curettage'. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government takes action 1. To assist financially those pregnancy help services which provide help and suppon to both mothers and their unborn children; 2. to stop the funding and specialising in elective abortions; 3. to stop payment of abortion claims under Item No. 6,469 of the Medical Benefits Schedule. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Hodges. Petition received. Aged Persons Hostels To the Honourable the Speaker and members of Representatives in Parliament assembled.

The humble petition of the undersigned Electors of Australia respectfully show us that we humbly pray: That we condemn government cutbacks in education, in health and social services.

We condemn the cutting of funds for Migrant education. We demand that funds be returned and extended. We demand an independent Schools Commission which is democratically constituted and is free from manipulation by the government. We condemn government's action of withdrawing funds from state schools' projects and giving it to some of the wealthiest private schools.

8,Mr WENTWORTH,TELEPHONE CHARGING DISTRICTS,"I did not say that, sir. I Education said that I had not asked for a seconder. Standing Orders require a notice to be seconded before it is included on the Notice Paper but they do not require it to be seconded when notice is given. NA",15
9,Mr WENTWORTH,SYDNEY FREEWAYS,"I further give notice that on the next day of sitting I shall move: That this House views with dismay the proposal of the New South Wales Government to abandon most of the projected inner city freeways and to sell the land already acquired for them, and therefore the House requests the Minister for Transport to approach the New South Wales Government and to urge that it change its announced plan before it is too late.

11,Mr SPEAKER,AMERICA SECURITY AGREEMENTS,"Order! The honourable member for Mackellar, with his characteristic courtesy, has informed me that he has a number of notices. He has given three. I shall not allow him to take further time of the House at this stage. He may provide the other notices to the Clerk as the alternative method of giving notice and they will be reported by the Clerk at a later hour this day. NA NA",16
12,Mr UREN,URANIUM DEVELOPMENT,"I direct my question to the Deputy Prime Minister. I remind him of my question on 18 October last when I asked him whether he had given authority for the carrying on of operations at the Ranger project. In his reply he said that no approvals would be given until a series of discussions between the various bodies had been held. I ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the Government is aware that the Ranger and Pancontinental mining projects are continuing their development? Is the Government aware that drilling is going on at both sites, that their camps have been extended and new ones have been built and that roads, particularly at the Pancontinental mining project, are being made indiscriminately through bush that is supposed to become part of the Kakuda National Park? Finally, I ask whether the fact that these unauthorised activities are ocNotice of Motion curring, contrary to the recommendations of the second Ranger Report, indicates that so called government supervision is in fact a farce?",16
13,Mr ANTHONY,URANIUM DEVELOPMENT,"No approval has been given at this stage for the commencement of mining for the Ranger uranium deposit. I made this quite clear. No authority will be given until all the appropriate measures have been taken. However, if work is to continue on proving up the ore body under a normal exploration licence that work can proceed. Work can also proceed on an extension of the road to Jabiluka which is part of the development of the whole region, including the Notice of Motion potential national park. I see no difficulties with the development of the road, and I am sure that it is in no way in conflict with the Ranger report. However, it seems pretty obvious that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is determined that he will embarrass the Australian Labor Party throughout the election campaign by being absolutely adamant that it does not matter whether contracts are breached, whether relationships with other countries are strained or how he embarrasses the British Labour Government or anybody else. He is hell bent to see that no mining will be done in this country so that it appeases all his left wing and communist sympathisers. NA",16
14,Mr MCLEAN,INTEREST RATES,"I ask the Prime Minister whether the economic pre-conditions for a further drop in interest rates have yet been established by the Government? If not, what remains the biggest obstacle to a further fall in interest rates in 1978?",16
15,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INTEREST RATES,"Providing present policies continue there is no doubt that interest rates will fall steadily- I do not think any one move should be dramatic-and sustainably from now on. Providing our policies continue, the consumer price index will continue to come down. It is worth noting, I think, that in the nonfood items in the September quarter the increase was 1 k per cent. Therefore, it was less than 2 per x cent, which was the total consumer price index figure. The expectations for the December, March and June quarters in relation to the consumer price index are heartening indeed. The Reserve Bank of Australia and the monetary authorities already feel that they are able to operate in the market place, as honourable gentlemen know, to achieve lower yields on government securities. That has been reflected through other markets also. However, the Government intends to act, and obviously the monetary authorities intend to act, in a responsible way in relation to these matters. I think probably only one factor could prevent these circumstances from unfolding during 1978. Throughout 1978, starting with the peak period in January-February, there will be a sustained reduction in unemployment in addition. The one factor that would prevent that happening would be a return to the mad deficit financing of the Australian Labor Party. We have already been told that that Party of great economic irresponsibility has learned nothing and will once again be enormously irresponsible if returned to power. We have been given notice of that in successive speeches made not only by the Leader of the Opposition but also by the honourable member for Oxley who people sometimes think has some element of economic responsibility. I fail to see why that is so because nobody more than the honourable member for Oxley led the attack on the Australian dollar and the value of the Australian dollar. In a speech he made over the weekend he supported his leader's madness and extravagance in relation to government expenditure. That madness and extravagance can have only one of two results. The tax cuts that we have announced would be abolished. It is worth noting that the Opposition is not committed to those tax reforms that we have announced and the tax relief that would ensue. It is not committed to tax indexation, according to the honourable member for Oxley. Alternatively, it can introduce an additional tax. It can take away the incentives that have been given to industry. Also it can take measures which will lead to higher interest rates and a return to the printing presses. The honourable gentleman should know that the promises made so far by Labor in relation to expenditure on the hospital development program, the sewerage program, growth centres, area improvement programs, the Australian Assistance Plan, tourist development, community assistance for leisure facilities, the program to reduce unemployment, national compensation, aged persons' accommodation, Medibank, the reintroduction of petrol price equalisationabolished by the Labor Government-extr a government funds for the beef industry, expansion of migrant education services, ethnic radio and television stations, expansion of telecommunications research, the establishment of overseas agricultural services, together with the substantial additional funds promised in relation to education, total about $3 billion. And the Labor Party has not even entered the race yet. When the Leader of the Opposition makes his policy speech, how much more is he going to promise? Really, the $3 billion man is starting pretty well. I suppose by the time he makes his policy speech the amount of money committed will be considerably more than that. The Australian people have far too much sense to be seduced by bribes, and the honourable gentleman is the greatest briber in the history of Australia. NA",16
16,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,INTEREST RATES,My question is directed to the Treasurer.,17
17,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INTEREST RATES,"Mr Speaker, the Treasurer went into hospital this morning for some X-rays. I do not know when he will be returning to Canberra.",17
18,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,INTEREST RATES,I will direct the question to the Prime Minister. Is he aware that the latest Bank of New South Wales Monthly Review claims that the Reserve Bank had been premature in entering into the bond market to share yields and that appreciable interest rate cuts were hard to justify before next year? Would he agree that the official interest rate cuts to date have been largely cosmetic because of the failure of the market rates charged for bank overdrafts and home loans through the building societies to move in the same downward direction?,17
19,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INTEREST RATES,"It is my understanding that that bank document was prepared before the results of the September quarter consumer price index came out. As Treasury sources would say, as I am sure the Bank itself would say, and as any reputable commentator would say, any estimates that were made before the results of that September quarter consumer price index were published would be quite inaccurate and would need substantial revision. I think any estimates that the Bank made today would be of a different character indeed. NA NA",17
20,Mr RUDDOCK,SECURITIES LEGISLATION,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. In view of Press comments last week on progress achieved towards the implementation of a national companies and securities Bill, can the Minister tell the House what progress has been achieved? Can he say if the progress is not all that it should be, whether it is being helped or hindered by those States whose governments are attempting, by introducing legislation, to indicate a level of concern which is not supported by their other actions?",17
21,Mr FIFE,SECURITIES LEGISLATION,"The matter contained in the question asked by the honourable member for Parramatta is of tremendous importance, is one that concerns the Government greatly and is one that has occupied a great deal of my time since I appointed Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. When my predecessor in this portfolio spoke in the House on 17 March last he indicated the details of the broad agreement that had been reached between the Commonwealth and the States in relation to a co-operative scheme for regulation of the entire field of the companies and securities industry. He also indicated occasion that a great deal more work still needed to be done in relation to detail before a final agreement could be drawn up. Since 17 March there have been meetings of officers of the monwealth and the States, and there has another meeting of Ministers. The honourable member asked whether actions by some States are slowing down Social >rogress in this matter. I feel that some States, E egislating in recent times, have perhaps indication that ultimately there may not be full co-operation, although I am bound to the ministerial meetings to date have indicated large degree of co-operation between the several governments. There was to have been a meeting of Ministers on 9 December, but because of the importance of this issue I asked be brought forward to 25 November. Unfortunately, not all Ministers are available on visory 25 November. The New South Wales AttorneyTreasury, General has asked that the next meeting be held the Reserve on 9 December. Obviously he has shown a great altered its estimates deal of confidence in the return of this ment, because I am sure the New South Wales ing the Vh per cent increase inoutlook Government would not want to be negotiating with a Minister who might not be in office the lowing week. That is an official recognition by outlook the Australian Labor Party "" I New South Wales honourable that this Government will be returned on 10 aspects of that December. Unfortunately a meeting cannot be held on half, 9 December because the South Australian Minisexpected ter will be unavailable. I understand that he will be in China on that day. The Tasmanian Minising ter has indicated the the meeting ought not proceed unless all Ministers are present. I assure the honourable member for Parramatta and other honourable members that this matter will be pursued, both at the officer level and at ministerial level, with a view to bringing in at earliest possible date co-operative legislation that will be supported by both the Common1977-78 wealth and the States. NA NA",18
22,Mr LES MCMAHON,BENEFIT,"Will the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security say was whether the Director-General of Social Services wrote to all State Directors of Social Services on 26 October 1977 about the payment of unemployment benefit in arrears? Did this letter suggest continuing delay in the payment of benefit to unemployed persons because the timing of adthe ministrative arrangements is so critical? Did the Director-General go so far as to suggest that on that income statements from the Commonwealth Employment Service should be collected daily by car or verbally over the telephone in order to minimise delay in the processing of claims? BeComcause of this administrative nightmare, will been many unemployed persons be denied income support to which they are entitled?",18
23,Mr HUNT,BENEFIT,I will obtain from the Minister for Security an answer to the detailed quesby tion put by the honourable member and provide given an him with the information in due course. say that INFLATION AND GROWTH FORECASTS a Mr ALDRED-I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Are there revised official forecasts of inflation and growth following the release of the September quarter consumer price that the meeting index figure.,18
24,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,BENEFIT,"The official adgroup comprising representatives of the the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Bank of Australia has substantially and undertaken a complete Governreassessment of the inflationary the follownon-food prices in the September quarter. It has done this folagainst the background of the much improved for the economy. I am able to give the gentleman information on some revision. For example, the increase in the consumer price index in the first half of 1977-78 is 8.6 per cent, and in the second 7.4 per cent. In thefirsthalf of 1978-79 it is to be 7.2 per cent. Of course, that confirms the outside estimates, which are indicatrates throughout next year of between 6 per to cent and 8 per cent-a remarkable improvement in terms of what other countries have achieved. I think even more encouraging are the estithe mates for growth throughout next year, which the also have been revised substantially upwards. Gross non-farm product in the first half of is estimated to increase by 1.7 per cent, but in the six months from 1 January 1978 it is estimated to increase by 6.9 per cent. The estimate for the first part of 1978-79 is 5.8 per cent. All the official advisings from the advisory group of officials from the Treasury, the Bureau of Statistics and the Reserve Bank who meet to undertake these forecasts point to a very substantially improved outlook throughout 1977-78 as a result of this Government's policies. Of course, if the policies of the Opposition ever came to be applied there would be different kinds of estimates and forecasts of renewed inflation, reduced growth and further increased unemployment. NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Minister for National Resources a question. Has the Government discussed with the Queensland Government the future role of hydropower generation in the Queensland electricity supply network to which the Federal-State Burdekin project committee directed attention in its report in May this year? Has the Government pursued the proposal which I put to the Premier of Queensland in June 1974 that the Australian Government, in conjunction with the Queensland Government, should undertake an examination of the ways and means of increasing efficiency and reducing costs within the power system with a view to lowering the price of electrical energy in Queensland?",18
25,Mr ANTHONY,NETWORK,"There has been considerable discussion with the Queensland Government over a number of years on assisting it to supplement its existing electricity network. Of course, the big contribution that the Commonwealth Government has made has been financial assistance towards construction of the Gladstone power station. It has paid the larger part of the cost of construction of that very large power station and has guaranteed the Queensland Government that further funds will be made available for continuing development of that station. The matter of hydropower which the Leader of the Opposition mentioned incorporates not only power generation but also the question of water resources. I have already made a statement to the House that the Government is looking at a national water resources program, for which legislation is now before the House, so that any agreements reached between the States and the Commonwealth can be implemented quickly. There will be continuing talks with the Queensland Government and other State governments on the question of water resources. Of course, we will integrate water resources programs into any electricity programs that the States might want to introduce. DAIRY INDUSTRY: UNDERWRITING NA",19
26,Mr LLOYD,FOR MANUFACTURING SECTOR,"I direct a question to the Minister for Primary Industry. The Minister will be aware of the value of government underwriting for the manufacturing sector of the dairy industry. However, is he aware of the concern being expressed by industry officials and factory managers that underwriting will cease with the introduction of Stage II of the National Dairy Plan? Can the Minister assure the dairy industry that Commonwealth Government underwriting will continue?",19
27,Mr SINCLAIR,FOR MANUFACTURING SECTOR,"I think every dairy farmer in Australia is aware that under Senator Wriedt and under the previous Administration the whole of the dairy stabilisation plan that provided a firm bulwark against market change was completely destroyed. The former Minister for Agriculture, as he was designated, felt that the dairy industry did not need maintenance and support and he was quite prepared to introduce, as he did, legislation to ensure that a high level of assistance to those who so demonstrably were being affected by market change would not be preserved. In contrast, our Government, recognising the difficulties facing the industry as a result of the stockpiling of skim milk powder, for example, and other dairy products generated in the European Economic Community, not only introduced and followed through a plan for marketing change as a result of a report of an Industries Assistance Commission inquiry chaired by Professor Sir John Crawford, but also provided a level of underwriting assistance to ensure stability in the market place. We provided in this season an increase on the assistance initially provided in the preceding season. Today the Government is underwriting the equalised returns for butter at $1,160 per tonne and cheese at $860 per tonne. In conjunction with the States other than the two Labor States, New South Wales and South Australia, again indicative of the general attitude of the Labor Party to the dairy farmer, skim milk powder is being underwritten at $360 per tonne and casein at $935 per tonne. Underwriting is pitched at these levels to enable efficient manufacturers to pay their suppliers around 65c per lb butterfat at the farm gate. We believe underwriting to be a form of assistance which is quite critical to the preservation of returns in the dairy industry. The Government has made no statement about removing undeiwriting. Indeed we have, right through, indicated that underwriting would be provided until such time as the dairy industry was in a position to expect reasonable returns from the markets that the efforts of our Government could develop. For that reason I can assure the honourable gentleman that our sympathy remains with the dairy farmer and with the interests of the dairy farmer. We would look very sympathetically at the position of the dairy farmer come the end of the present underwriting at 30 June next year. Indeed, it is my own personal view that until the marketing position of the dairy industry is improved, underwriting is essential to the viability of the Australian dairy farmer. NA",19
28,Mr FRY,FORESHORES OF LAKE BURLEY,"I ask the Minister for the Capital Territory whether he has refused to meet a deputation of Canberra people concerned at the proposal to develop medium density housing near the shores of Lake Burley Griffin at section 22, Yarralumla. Has the National Capital Development Commission been instructed not to discuss this matter with the residents concerned? Does the Minister agree that the foreshores of Lake Burley Griffin should be preserved for parklands, consistent with the Burley Griffin original concept of the national capital? Will the Minister take action to proclaim section 22, Yarralumla, as open space parkland area?",20
29,Mr STALEY,FORESHORES OF LAKE BURLEY,I shall look into the matters raised by the honourable member and will give him a reply as soon as possible. NA,20
30,Mr HODGES,POSSIBLE CLOSURE OF PHARMACIES,"Has the Minister for Health seen reports that the Government is considering the forced closure of chemist shops? Is consideration being given to the rationalisation of chemist shops? If so, is the matter being done in consultation with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia whose members constitute some 90 per cent of Australia's retail pharmacies?",20
31,Mr HUNT,POSSIBLE CLOSURE OF PHARMACIES,"The Government has no intention whatsoever of forcing the closure of pharmacies in Australia upon the Pharmacy Guild or its membership. It has no such policy or proposal before it. Despite what the honourable member for Prospect had to say, the so-called leaked document was a document that had no status whatever with the Government. It was a working document that the Minister had not even seen. So I give a categorical denial that the Government has any such intention. But there is one thing I would like to say, and that is that this Government has done more than any government before it to assist the pharmacies of Australia. The Whitlam Government had the opportunity of implementing the Scott recommendations which became available during the life of the last government. It failed to do so. When this Government came to office it amended section 99 of the Health Insurance Act and provided for the independent determination of pharmacy dispensing fees when agreement was not reached between the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Government. It has also done more than any other government before it to assist the isolated pharmacies of this country. Rather than abolishing chemist shops it has introduced a policy for isolated pharmacies GRIFFIN which is designed to keep the pharmacies in business. So it is a load of absolute rubbish to suggest that this Government is out to abolish this important sector of small business in Australia, and the chemists can continue to live in the confident hope that this Government will be returned on 10 December. The future prosperity of the chemists of Australia rests on the decision that the people make on 10 December. NA",20
32,Mr WEST,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I ask the Prime Minister whether he has given deep consideration to the latest unemploymentfigureswhich are now at a postDepression record level of 370,335, and are at least 5,000 higher than the September figures, even after allowing",20
33,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,Order! I ask the honourable gentleman to ask his,20
34,Mr WEST,UNEMPLOYMENT,. . . for maximum possible effects of certain recent industrial disputation,20
35,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,Order! If the honourable gentleman continues to speak while I am drawing his attention to something I will have to deal with him.,20
36,Mr WEST,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I did not hear you, Mr Speaker.",20
37,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,I am asking the honourable gentleman to put his question and to cease giving information.,20
38,Mr WEST,UNEMPLOYMENT,Is the Prime Minister aware that many industrial nations and international economic institutions are now calling for expansionary selective economic policies by industrial nations? Will he admit that no national economy ever recovered while unemploymentfigureskept rising?,20
39,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The matter which the honourable gentleman raises is obviously a matter of very significant importance. I think it needs to be understood that this Government has introduced a range of programs to help the unemployed, especially the young unemployed, and it is doing it in a way which is sensible, which provides additional help and training and which helps tens of thousands of individuals. One of the things which I think are so tragic about our political opponents is that whenever there is a semblance of a possibility that they have learnt something they very soon show that they have forgotten it. The Labor Government had a Regional Employment Development scheme costing at the rate of $250m a year and providing about 30,000 jobs. It abandoned that scheme because it knew that the scheme was not operating and would not operate. Now Labor comes back with a massive RED scheme which is to cost $800m and to provide, it is said, 40,000 or 50,000 jobs. The inal RED scheme would not work and there is no reason to suggest that the expanded and more extravagant approach would work either. In relation to training, under the revised monwealth Rebate for Apprenticeship Full Time Training scheme and the National Employment and Training scheme we are concentrating now on people who need to obtain immediate job skills rather than concentrating on those in tertiary institutions who do not necessarily want jobs at all. The Government has introduced experimental programs for unemployed youth, such as the Special Youth Employment Training scheme and the community Youth Support Scheme. The honourable member for Cunningham has asked a question which is serious and important, and it is quite remarkable that members of the Opposition who are supposed to be significant members of the Opposition show no concern at all for these important questions. All they can do is to go around like a bunch of chooks in a barnyard. They are about as intelligible as that.",21
40,Mr BRYANT,UNEMPLOYMENT,He has not answered the question. That is the problem.,21
41,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,Order! The honourable member for Wills has kept up a steady stream of interjections and I ask him to cease doing so. He has been supported in his interjections by the honourable member for Corio. I ask him to cease interjecting also. I ask the Prime Minister to answer the question and to leave me to deal with interjections.,21
42,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am demonstrating what the Government has done and is doing in this matter. In relation to the various traimng programs which are directed especially towards the needs of young people, over 120,000 people have been or are being helped at present. We announced at the time of the Budget that there would be no arbitrary limit on funds for any of the training programs. At the time of the Budget we announced also that for the Special Youth Employment Training Scheme the age limit would be increased to 25 years. More recently we announced that the eligibility period would be reduced from six months to four months. These training programs are being monitored constantly by my colleague, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, and also by the Minister for Education. The Government has made it perfectly plain that, if they can be further modified and improved, they will be. In addition, in the orig- term of this Government, over 800,000 people have been placed in employment by an increasingly efficient Commonwealth Employment Service under the administration of the Minister for Employment and Industrial RelaComtions. These are important matters. A return to the policies of mad and massive spending, of throwing money around like chaff, I do not doubt for one moment could get more people on the government payroll but the consequential rise in interest rates, the consequential increased expectations of inflation, the resort to the printing press would lead to a much greater reduction in employment in the private sector. That needs to be understood, were the honourable gentleman's party to put into practice the policy which the Leader of the Opposition is advocating now as a renewed solution to Australia's problems. In 1974-75 when government expenditure went up by 46 per cent in an attempt to overcome unemployment, the consequent inflation and inflationary expectations led to the circumstances where unemployment in fact rose in that year by about 200,000. The Leader of the Opposition knows quite well that what he is offering to Australia is a recipe for more of the same. It is a recipe that is doomed to failure. Even the honourable member for Oxley, when his words were being written for him by the Treasury, sometimes said something sensible. He said: It would take the total deficit to more than $4,600m and would be a prescription for roaring inflation with devastating monetary measures and high interest rate hikes leading to widespread corporate failures and unprecedented unemployment levels.",21

I refer to the report on the Bankruptcy Act tabled in the House last Friday. ask: Has the number of bankruptcies increased by 16 per cent to the highest level forfiveyears? Does the amount owing to unsecured creditors represent the largest indebtedness ever recorded in the history of this country? I ask the Prime Minister whether he is concerned with this drawhich matic sequel to his Government's economic ter policies?,22
46,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,BANKRUPTCIES,"If honourable drawing gentlemen opposite would only look at what is happening, they would know quite well that there has been a substantial increase in profits over the last financial year which will continue throughout the course of this year. This is ously a reversal of the situation in which profits and national product were falling, as they were at an earlier time under the previous Governweek ment. If the honourable gentleman is implying his question that he is in favour of increased profit, I applaud him because he is the first member of his party prepared to make that acknowledgement. If there is any information available in relation to the document, that the information is provided. NA",22
47,Mr YATES,UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS,"As the Minister for Employment consequence and Industrial Relations is absent, I direct my Australia question to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime consequence Minister noted that the Norgard report has Park operation pointed out that it is not of value monwealth Employment Servicefiguresto assess our unemployment situation? Therefore will take into account that the unemployment figurespeople have been totally distorted by the Victorian Electricity Commission strike.",22
48,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS,Order! The honourable gentleman will ask his question.,22
49,Mr YATES,UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS,Will the Prime Minister suggest that the Norgard report should be looked at that in future the statistics on unemployment should come from the Australian Bureau of Statunion istics in Canberra which can do the job better?,22
50,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS,"I think it is now widely recognised that thefigurespublished monthly by the Commonwealth Employment represent a totally inaccurate picture of the number of unemployed, and that is recognow. nised by some honourable gentleman on both his party have sides of this House. They are a Opposition supporters interjecting",22
51,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS,Order! The House will come to order.,22
52,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS,"If any honourable gentlemen on the opposite side of the House I are prepared to deny that that is recognised by any of them, I would like them to do so so that the ones who have recognised it can be revealed. The Australian Bureau of Statistics will be publishingfigureson a monthly basis from early next year. It is widely recognised that the basis on it provides the statistics gives a much betanalysis of the true state of unemployment in Australia. But there is one matter that does need attention to and it has become very evident as a result of events in recent times. The number of unemployed, according to current CES statistics, has been grossly swollen as a result of the Victorian power dispute- a dispute obviwhich some honourable gentlemen on the Opposition benches supported. In that circumstance, a dispute of about 2,000 people asking for $40 a more led directly to 450,000 being laid off, in about 50,000 having to register for employment and something approaching 40,000 still registered for employment. This has come to our notice because it was a massive dispute in its consequences, having massive effects for tens of I will see thousands of Australians. We need to understand that each and every strike, each and every dispute of that kind has a for employment in Australia. The dispute involving the Seamen's Union of over the export of coal is having the of a loss of jobs in the Norwich in Queensland. The dispute to use the Cominvolving the Builders led to positive decisionsLabourersthat the Federation has construction of he buildings would not proceed simply because do not want to get embroiled in any way State with the Federation, and again hundreds of thousands ofjobs have been lost. If honourable gentlemen on the opposite side of the House are really concerned for jobs in the Australian community they will reverse the and influence that the union movement has over them and try to place some influence over the movement for a change and suggest to it that strikes should not take place, so that jobs can be created throughout Australia. I believe this is widely understood not only amongst the general Australian public but also the working people of Australia, who have been betrayed time and time again by those who have sponsored strikes of this kind and by the Australian Labor Party which never does anything to condemn them. NA",22
53,Mr CARIGE,BEEF INDUSTRY,"I direct my question to the Minister for Primary Industry. What does the Government see as being necessary to ensure return to profitability for the Australian beef industry in 1978? Does the Minister see the Austo tralian Meat and Livestock Corporation, as presently constituted, being able to make a tive contribution to improved producer returns? What effect have policies flowing from the implementation of the Coombs report in the 1974-75 Budget had in prejudicing the present state of the Australian primary industry sector?",23
54,Mr SINCLAIR,BEEF INDUSTRY,"There is no doubt that the he circumstances of the farming community have suffered very seriously because of inflation because of changes in government policy that were implemented during the 1972-75 period. A number of extraordinary statements were made at a seminar in the honourable gentleman's electorate at the weekend by the man who principally responsible for those changes as Minpresumablyister for Agriculture. It is rather interesting that this man, having requested to be relieved of his shadow portfolio during the term that the Labor Party has been in Opposition, and having served in another area-the shadow portfolio has question. changed hands at least once since that senator has retired from the post; a member of this House is now the Labor spokesman on primary industry-no w purports to speak on behalf of the Labor Party presumably in thefieldof agriculWe ture. I hope that those things which he says demthe onstrate that he is now genuinely prepared to embark on a policy of support for agnculture. I see many of the problems primary producer and particularly the cattleman revolving around the necessity to provide again infrastructure support at a government level the way we did pre-1972 before the adoption of the Coombs report by the Labor Government in 1973. It is quite true that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation will provide a more widly embracing marketing opportunity for Ausfor tralian meat producers than did its predecessor. There is no doubt that the powers which are emailed within its legislation and which enable to market meat in certain circumstances and to promote and to advertise the qualities of tralian meat very extensively around the world are very much in line with the thinking of most meat producers. It seems that the Labor spokesman has not been aware of the powers that are in the legislation. He is already suggesting some changes to it which do not accord with the reaction of the Labor Party when the legislation was introduced in this House. I also see again that the spokesman is setting a pattern which was so typical of the Labor Party a when in goverament. He is coming out as a champion of a cause. Presumably, when it comes presenting a collective point of view as a member of a government-if ever there were to be posianother Labor government-h e would say to the producers: ' I supported you but it happened that the numbers were not there.' The overall policy of the party can be shown to be quite difierent from that which he as an individual presents. This is obviously true in regard to another matter about which he spoke at the weekend. I see that promised tariff restructuring and pledged several concessions including petrol equalisation. and The man who is the spokesman for the Labor Party on tariff matters is known from newspaper reports and his statements in this House to have a responsible attitude towards employment. Yet a spokesman for the Labor Party apparently dewas cided that he would remove all tariffs and",23
55,Mr SPEAKER,BEEF INDUSTRY,Order! The right honourable gentleman was asked a question about the beef industry. I ask him to remain relevant to the,23
56,Mr SINCLAIR,BEEF INDUSTRY,"Than k you, Mr Speaker. I can assure you that the policies affecting high protection are very relevant to the beef producer. on our side of politics are concerned about effects of tariffs but we are concerned about them in a broad responsible way. We are worried about the cost to consumers and to export industries on the one hand and the availability of jobs of the Australian on the other. I sought to identify the fact that in his speech in at the weekend this gentleman quite obviously took a different point of view from some others within his party. Equally, as he was Minister for Agriculture at the ume petrol price equalisation was lifted, he deserves to be given responsibility removing that form of support. I see that he now comes back and says that he will reintroduce it. He has not acknowledged that he it was responsible for its removal. He has not identified the fact that the added cost to beef proAusducers and primary producers generally was largely as a result of that decision and others that flowed from the Coombs repon. I think that primary producers need to recognise that this man's concern for the genuine opportunities of primary producers",23
57,Mr SPEAKER,BEEF INDUSTRY,Order! The right honourable gentleman is going far beyond the question. He is being irrelevant to the question that was asked. I ask him to remain relevant.,24
58,Mr SINCLAIR,BEEF INDUSTRY,"Certainly, Mr Speaker, I shall remain relevant. The opportunities for Australian primary producers are very dependent upon a sympathetic government attitude.That attitude demonstrably did not come from the Australian Labor Party or from the honourable gentleman who is seeking by fairly rude noises to intervene at the moment, or from that spokesman at Rockhampton at the weekend. The only way in which Australian agriculture and the Australian cattle industry can survive is by receiving sympathetic and aggressive support. Those industries will receive that support from the Liberal-National Country Party Government, and quite demonstrably they will receive it from nobody in the Australian Labor Party. GOVERNOR-GENERAL: TRADE WITH NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Minister for Overseas Trade: Did the Government authorise the Governor General to agree with the President of the Philippines at their meeting in Manila on 24 August last that the Philippines and Australia would soon eliminate trade barriers for their mutual benefit? What steps has the Government since taken to honour this agreement between the two heads of state?",24

60,Mr BAUME,PHILIPPINES,Is the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs aware of complaints regardby ing unfair treatment concerning taxation to overseas born people? Has he received correspondence in relation to such taxpayers in the Macarthur electorate? What action has he taken?,24
61,Mr MACKELLAR,PHILIPPINES,"Yes , I am aware of comMinister plaints regarding late payments of taxation files refunds to overseas born residents of Australia, particularly in the Wollongong area and in the electorate of Macarthur. I thank the honourable member for Macarthur and also his colleague no Senator Lajovic for bringing these complaints my attention. It is tremendously important, Mr ServicesSpeaker, as I am sure you would agree, that refunds are paid as quickly as possible. I know that these taxpayers have taken the trouble to put in their taxation returns just as soon as they could. I am very disturbed to think that there may be some feelings of discrimination against such taxpayers. I hope and trust that the Australian Taxation Office will make a quick investigation of this matter. To hasten that investigation I have taken up the matter personally with the Treasurer. Unfortunately the Treasurer is not with us today. Therefore I shall draw this matter to the attention of the Minister Assisting the Treasurer in the hope that these refunds can be paid as soon as possible. NA NA",24
62,Mr MORRIS,BASE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. He will recall telling the House last Thursday, as reported in Hansard: Let me assure the House that I have no knowledge of the activities of the Department of Administrative Services. That Department is totally independent of my Department. The Minister will recall also telling the honourable member for Chifley on Friday that he recommended a local stock and station agent to participate in the purchase of land for the Omega base on the ground that it was part ofhis normal representations. I ask the Minister: Is it a fact that he requested a local stock and station agent to be appointed to act on behalf of the Australian Government because, in his own words, he thought he could act more discreetly? Secondly, I ask the Minister: In the light of his statement in the House on Thursday is it a fact that in December 1976 he personally telephoned the Secretary of the Department of Administrative Services querying the way in which investigations into the possible sites for the Omega facility being handled? Was he not informed later that the officers of that Department had acted meticulously according to the instructions given the Department of Transport? Why has the refunds Minister misled the House?",24

I sought from the head of the Department of Administrative Services an assurance that speculators could not get into the area ahead of the Department with the result that the land values would become unreal. I was concerned to knowMr Morris-That is not what you said. Why do you not tell the truth?,25

The people of Gippsland are satisfied about the propriety of this matter. The price received for the land was less than the price received for land sold subsequently.

The fact is that the files on this matter have been laid on the table by the Minister for Administrative Services.

88,Mr NIXON,EXPORT OF URANIUM,"I am able to confirm that two ships containing yellow cake for the United Kingdom left during the weekend. The Associated Transport Container Australia ships ACT III left with 12 containers, and the ACT VII left with a record tonnage of 292 tons in 34 containers. I am happy to inform the House that only a handful of demonstrators were present. I think two things have been brought home sharply to those Australian people who are thinking about this question. Firstly, the way in which the Government has explained its policies on this question is being understood more and more by the people of Australia. The second factor, I think, is the visit by Dr Mabon, the British Minister who distinguished and contrasted sharply the approach taken by the British Labour Party and the British Trade Union Congress with that of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian trade union movement. I think it is fair to say that as a result the pro-communists and left-wingers were unable to get the general support for preventing the shipments last weekend that they were getting at an earlier date. I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ought to take note of the lack of support for preventing the shipment from getting out last weekend. I have no doubt that the people of Australia are genuinely comprehending more and more that the United Kingdom is short of energy, is desperate for energy and requires energy for the jobs of its people and for the heating of its homes. The only thing I am sorry about is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should so embarrass the Labor Party by splitting it down the middle by coming out with the communist line, as he has done. I am sure the people of Australia will recognise that fact and register their disapproval on 10 December.",26

95,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF URANIUM,The honourable gentleman has made his point. I will deal with it. The Minister said- I heard it quite clearly-that the Deputy Leader was taking a communist line. If he had made a comment which reflected personally on the Deputy Leader I would have required him to withdraw. To suggest that a line taken by the Deputy Leader may coincide with that taken by some other political party is not an unparliamentary expression.,26

In this case it is a reflection on me. I object to ask that it be withdrawn.",27
97,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,EXPORT OF URANIUM,"I wish to speak to the point of order. Is the honourable gentleman saying that to have a policy similar to that of the Communist Party is now offensive to him?

This affinity for and relationship to the Communist Party would be worth exploring.",27

There should be consistency in this matter now.",27

If there were any personal reflection on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition I would be thefirstto protect him.

Will the Government consider some means of reducing this burden in the light of the continuing rises in costs in rural industry at a time of depressed prices and incomes?,27
115,Mr ANTHONY,FUEL PRICES IN COUNTRY AREAS,"I am sure that the views of the Prime Minister and myself in relation to fuel prices in rural areas are well known. Indeed, if it had not been for the economic mess that we inherited from the Whitlam Labor Government, it would have been possible to reintroduce the fuel equalisation scheme which it abolished in 1974. Because of the constraints we have had apply and the need for a responsible approach economic management, we have not been able to reintroduce as many measures as we would have liked. I now see that apparently the Ausable tralian Labor Party is recognising that this is political issue and it is talking about bringing the equalisation of fuel prices. We have heard any details as to what this scheme will be, but I suppose another $ 100m here or there does not really add much when Labor thousands of millions of dollars. All I can say to the Australian people, particuplease larly country people, is that they should remember very clearly the circumstances of 1974 when the fuel equalisation scheme was abolished. There was an uproar within the Labor Government at the time and the so-called rural rump was going to have it reinstated. So much for the rural rump. The thumb was put down very hard by Mr Whitlam, the then Prime Minisposition, ter, who said that there would be no return of fuel equalisation prices. What I say to the rural people of Australia is that when they hear these promises being made by the Labor Party they should ask themselves how much reliance they can place on them. All the experience and all the performance of the Labor Party have pointed to Labor withdrawing forms of support and assist1976, ance to country people. By contrast, when a Liberal-National Country Party government says something it does it. NA",27
116,Mr MARTIN,CITIZENSHIP,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, whom I note is wearing a white buttonhole eUgibiUty today. Is it a fact that migrants who have been advised by you as Minister that they are eligible are unable to obtain their Australian citizenship for at least another six weeks, the excuse being that there are lengthy waiting periods for private citizenship ceremonies conducted by your Deof partment? Do these long delays mean that many migrants will not be eligible to vote at the Fedperiod eral election on 10 December because of the closing of the rolls on 10 November? Is this action being deliberately taken by you as Minister to prevent eligible migrants from voting this election? Was this action taken on your instructions as Minister? Is the Minister also aware that because of staff ceilings imposed the Government many Commonwealth electoral officers in Sydney are unable to advise migrants from Commonwealth countries of their oblicause gation to be enrolled and to vote on 10 lowed to December? Was this action taken by you as Minto ister deliberately and with your full knowledge?",28

119,Mr MACKELLAR,CITIZENSHIP,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his quesiton, because it gives me an opportunity to lay to rest much of the misrepresentation, particularly by members of the Opof the Government's attitude towards the citizenship. A number of statements have been made which suggest that somehow this Government is against the granting of citizenship to people who are eUgible to take out citizenship. I point out very briefly that in 1972 the number of persons granted citizenship was 25,971; in 1973, 34,891; in 1974, 40,709; in 1975, 84,059; and in the first full year of the present Government, 118,189. In the six months from January to June 1977 the number was 36,606. These figures give the lie to those people who suggest that this Government is against granting citizenship to* people who are eUgible to obtain citizenship. In relation to the actual questions, information has been made available to citizens about their to vote in federal elections. I have not given instructions that people should be denied citizenship prior to the elections this year. I have said, and I nave repeated, that those people who are eligible to be granted citizenship should be given it in the shortest possibletime.The period waiting for citizenship under this Government has been reduced significantly from the waiting under the previous Labor Adrninistration.

Is he aware that by this meeting virtually acknowledged that the economic poUcy hitherto pursued by developed nations overseas had been grossly wrong? Bein the past the Treasurer has slavishly foloverseas leads, can we expect him now to make a rapid reappraisal of fundamental economic policies? Should we interpret some recent rather tentative relaxation of economic restrictions not as election bait but rather as an implicit recognition that past policy was wrong and should be changed?",28

It needs to be understood that these are the economies in which inflation has been lowest. Disappointment has been expressed by some people that reinflation in Japan and Germany is not taking place to the extent they would like. Of course it has been suggested that the stronger economies would then drag forward the weaker ones with them. I have always had a considerable degree of reservation about the extent to which weaker economies can expect to have their problems overcome- I speak of those countries in Europe which have particularly high rates of inflation-by action taken by stronger economies, when that action might prejudice the strength that the stronger economies have attained generally through policies of restraint and sound monetary and fiscal management. In relation to Australia's own circumstance, we are much better off looking at commentaries coming from an increasing number of authoritative and most knowledgeable sources in Australia. I had in front of me earlier this morning the latest issue of SYNTEC, which was released today. I should like to read a couple of passages from it. SYNTEC, which may be one of the most authoritative commentaries on the Austrahan economy in the world scene, says: The change in Australia's money supply and, prospectively, inflation and currency positions means a long period of slowly falling interest rates 20 per cent in the underlying stucture over the course of 1978 is not now inconceivable. This is a prospect we have been stressing consistently now for two years. It is about to begin falling into place. The only thing that could destroy this prospect now is a break from the long wind-down strategy back to deficit-financing. The choice of the December election date appears to us to have eliminated the risk of that happening.' 'We expect the medium to long term bond rate structure to move gradually towards 8 per cent through 1978. We expect the rate of inflation to move substantially below 8 per eenton a year-on-year basis from mid-1978 onwards. Only two things would upset this prospect: (i) defeat of the Fraser Government; or (ii) reversion to pump-priming fiscal expansion. Given that these two qualifications won't apply, the whole interest and yield structure in this economy should move down by some 200 basis points over the nextfifteenmonths.' Earlier on Syntec says: 'In Australia, the policy of monetary wind-down pursued by the Fraser Government in the past two years has begun to have a dramatic pay off effect on inflation. The Budget view of inflation through 1977-78 has become out-of-date. The year-on-year rate of inflauon at end-1977-78 now looks like being some six full percentage points . . . less than at the year's beginning. This would represent a 44 per cent change in the rate of inflation over the course of this financial year. A further comment for the honourable member for Oxley: '. . . unless the Fraser Government now reverses policy, inflation in this country will decelerate quite markedly through 1978. Such a prospect is of fundamental relevance to clients of this service.Incredible as it may seem at this point, it means the gradual movement of the Australian dollar into the ranks of the semi-hard. Such a development would in turn extend substantially the downward path for Australian interest rates. Australia-give n re-election of the Fraser Government-is likely to be pursuing economic strategy akin to the US under Dr Arthur Bums in his hey-day (1974 to 1976). Given this.the Australian dollar will come gradually under a fundamentally based pressure to upvalue on the US dollar.' In other words, Syntec is saying that provided the present Government policies are continued the Australian economy will strengthen and become one of the leading economies in the world. I thank the honourable gentleman for his question.",29

143,Mr ANTHONY,NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY,"by leave-The purpose of this statement is to provide a summary of the more important aspects of the Government's energy policies to date and to outline some policy objectives for the future. In my statement today I will be dealing briefly with the rationale of energy policy, the usefulness of individual policy measures and general policy targets. The continued use of large and increasing quantities of energy by Australia is essential if we are to maintain our current living standards and see a continuation of reasonable rates of economic growth. Until the 'oil crisis' of 1973-74 it was widely assumed that growing world demand could and would be satisfied from established sources of supply without major upheavals. The Middle Eastern war of October 1973 and the subsequent oil supply restrictions showed dramatically how wrong that belief was. Secure and stable supplies of energy are now explicitly recognised as an essential ingredient of economic growth, and policy makers in the major energy consuming countries spend muchtimeanalysing energy problems. Many groups in the community have recently been expressing the view that there is a need for the Commonwealth Government to develop and implement a comprehensive energy policy, covering all forms of energy, because of the dangers and uncertainties that lie ahead in the energyfieldand the benefits that are thought to be likely to flow from far-sighted and resolute Government action. It is a view which we as a Government endorse. Usage of energy in our sophisticated industrial economy is so widespread that energy policy cannot be determined in isolation from other significant policy considerations. Our energy policy needs to recognise the interdependence of economic activities and the ways in which changes in energy costs and the availability of energy could affect the outlook for the economy generally, particular industries and private consumption. In our apfuture proach to energy policy we will be these considerations are taken fully into account. Two of the most basic problems in energy policy are the conservation of energy generally, and the related question of the replacement of fuels in scarce supply by others in more plentiful five supply-for example, oil by coal. Both these problems are linked to the more general problem of the need for a reasonable level of selfbeen sufficiency in those major fuels. A number of countries have, under the impact of the oil crisis, adopted objectives of energy 'self-reliance', 'energy independence', or 'greater self-sufficiency' in energy. These have some of the characteristics of slogans. Neverthemonwealth less, there is a considerable amount of truth the notion that self-sufficiency in major fuels worthwhile objective. There are strategic political advantages in being relatively free the threat of embargoes; there is also the ability of being able to avoid the very significant losses to national output of goods and services that would occur if embargoes were actually imposed. Some of these factors are quantifiable to a degree. On the other hand, efforts to achieve greater self-sufficiency can involve considerable costs for the consumer and the nation. It is necessary for governments to strike a ance between these costs and the benefits of selfIn sufficiency. Australia is, of course, self-sufficient in and indeed a major exporter of energy fuels, with the exception of crude oil. It is our dence on imports of crude oil which brings into sharper focus and need for energy conservation, inter-fuel substitution, and energy research development. It is in these areas that much of energy policy efforts will be coming in the future. One of our main tasks as a Government in the field of energy policy is to develop, as far as pracpolicy ticable, firm and stable guidelines for the of years have the field development of the energy industries. Firm ation incentives, guidelines are desirable because the lead times involved in major energy projects are frequently so extended that the commercialrisksto private guidelines, enterprise in undertaking its projects canriseto uranium very high levels. This argues for the development energy of a national consensus in energy policy, to extent possible, because private enterprise will bodies. continue to be wary of a situation in which the 'ground rules' could change drastically with change of government. In addition to these conhelp siderations affecting the private sector, we as Government may have to take decisions in the public sector affecting Australia's energy future, for example, on energy research and developextraction ment, which have ramifications into the distant too far for commercial interests to register ensuring that effectively in the present. One of the main problems in developing firm and realistic guidelines for energy pohcy is, of course, the degree of uncertainty which exists as to the situation we will be in in 20, 10, or even years time. Five years ago the present level of energy prices was predicted by almost no one, yet the effects of these price movements have very far reaching. Energy is required as a complementary commodity to all other goods and services we consume. To attempt to develop on a rational basis a complete blueprint for Australia's energy future would be an exceedingly daunting prospect. Quite clearly, the ComGovernment's role should not be to in attempt to dictate the precise future path along is a which energy producers and consumers should and move. Apart from being repugnant to our of philosophy as a Government, such an approach probwould be beyond our powers and almost certainly could not be made to work effectively in any case. It is, however, necessary to set the scene within which the private sector and government instrumentalities can operate with confidence, while, as far as practicable-that is, given our other objectives-allowin g the forces of the market to allocate our available resources of mancareful balpower, capital, and technology. one sense, Australia as a nation is still at a relatively early stage in the formulation of a national consensus in which all aspects of energy depenpolicy have been thought through in detail. Much public discussion will be needed before the finer details are settled. We are, however, well and placed in another way in that the principal our planks in our energy policy are to a large extent already in position as a result of the many important policy initiatives we have taken. The main initiatives we as a Government have taken in of energy policy over the last couple been in the areas of mining taxenergy pricing, the administration of export controls, foreign investment decisions on the development of and natural gas resources, assistance to research and development, and the for the mation of energy consultative and advisory The incentives we have provided to the mining a industries have been designed particularly to the oil industry, for example, the provision a for petroleum explorers to be able in future to write off their exploration expenses against income from any source. In general, the energy industries have benefited from the new provisions available to the mining sector generally. These decisions have improved the economics and financibility of most energy projects. The decision on crude oil pricing has also markedly improved the economics of the oil extraction industry-and is of significance in another way in that producers of hydrocarbons now have some tangible evidence of government support for the concept of world parity prices for local energy sources. We have prepared the way for uranium niining and for development of the North West Shelf gas reserves by the provision of assurances to potential developers and by the appropriate safeguarding of environmental and other interests. I am pleased to say that this aftercommodities. noon the companies have announced that they will now continue to proceed with the $50m feasibility study. We have diverted additional funds to energy research and development. Finally, we have taken a number of important initiatives in the setting up of consultative and advisory bodies the energyfield.These initiatives between them amount to a very considerable onslaught on energy problems facing Australia. In fact it could fairly be said, on the strength of these initiatives, that we have given energy a high priority in our overall policy program. I will now deal briefly with the types of policy measures which are available for the implemenvertically tation of our energy policies. Of all the measures which might be used to implement an energy policy, energy pricing is perhaps the most fundatransfer mental. Conect pricing will to a very large limit consumption of energy and encourage exhowever, ploration for and development of new energy deenergy posits. Other conservation measures-that is, provision of information-ma y also be able to play an important role. Encouragement of the substitution of fuels in plentiful supply for those in scarce supply may be economically feasible in some circumstances and efforts to develop means of converting plentiful fuels into scarce fuelsthat is, coal into oil-woul d be an even more rect way of tackling the same problem. The setinfluenced ting up of strategic reserves of liquid fuels also be justifiable as a measure to give protection from supply embargoes. Finally, assistance to research and development, particularly in coal liquefaction and solar power, should assist in developing new options which we may be able capitalise on at some future stage. Measures along any of these lines would involve costs, so careful judgments of net benefits are needed. Some further remarks on individual policy measures are in order. First is the price of energy. The price of energy provides a fundamental control of myriad individual decisions about the production and consumption of energy. The prices to which both producers and consumers react should therefore fully reflect the present and future value of our non-renewable energy resources. In practice, what this means in the Australian context at the present time is that policy measures will need to be taken to move the overall energy price level toward international parity levels, which have, other things being equal, a particular status as a measure of the relative values to the community of tradeable At the same time it will be necessary to ensure that the prices of particular fuels reflect the relative domestic scarcity and abundance of resources. In determining and influencing the price of energy in Australia we need to avoid making adjustments which are too rapid and which could cause serious damage to the prospects for industries using energy. A careful in approach taking into account the fact that industry is a major user of energy is warranted. When the considering the objective of moving energy prices towards international levels, we are, of course, aware that the Commonwealth Government does not have complete control over energy prices. Electricity prices, for example, are set by State electricity authorities. Domestic coal prices are set by the coal producers, many of which are integrated with the electricity generation industry or with the steel and cement industries and which therefore may, and often do, coal at prices which are not fully comextent mercial. The Commonwealth Government can, exert some influence on other domestic prices through its control over the price of indigenous crude oU. For example, the increases in oil prices which we announced at Budget time can be expected to enhance the economics of possible large new gas projects by allowing domestic gas prices to increase further whilst still remaining competitive. The economics of coal to oil conversion processes and other new energy digeneration methods could also be favourably by a higher oil price although these may processes are still a long way from commercial feasibility in Australia. By promoting a price differential between oil and other energy forms, we could encourage conservation of oil, together with fuel substitution. Co-operation between the to Commonwealth and State Governments will be essential in the implementation of the pricing aspects of a national energy policy. It will therefore be necessary for the target of moving energy prices toward international levels to be canvassed in the forum of the Minerals and Energy Council. Taxation incentives for the industries producing energy materials may assist new enconflict ergy mining projects by making them easier finance, but of course such incentives can achieved only at a cost to Government revenue. Concerning energy conservation measures, fuel improvement in the efficiency of use of energy will require wide public acceptance of the need for greater efficiency, and greater public knowlis edge and skill in methods of achieving it. An effective energy conservation program would essentially represent a campaign to change essentially national attitudes in relation to energy usage. I endorse the National Energy Advisory Comshare mittee's advice that conservation is the most effective action which can be taken to lessen our dependence upon imported oil in the immediate future. The Committee has recommended that major national program should be undertaken conserve energy, especiaUy oil. Basically the proposed program calls for immediate action which could inform the public of the need to conper serve, educate consumers as to how savings by might be made, and provide specialised advice and assistance to energy users. Fuel savings would be achieved by means such as better maintenance of industrial plant and vehicles increased use of insulation to minimise heat losses. Because the States have much of the exrequire pertise in the public sector, it is recommended that the national energy conservation program should be a joint undertaking of the Commonprobably wealth and State governments, industry, and various other bodies. One of the most direct in which security in short term supply of energy materials can be achieved is by stockpiling major fuels. The governments of several overrefined seas countries, notably the United States America and Japan, have already taken major measures along these Unes. Only essential ar time-scale. materials which could be vulnerable to supply interruption at short notice need be considered for stockpUing. For Australia probably only crude oU and/oU refinery products would qualAustralia's ify, as our supplies of oil in the future will depend to a large degree on its availability from OPEC countries. PrevaUing forecasts indicate that a desirable timing for stockpile establishment, if this necessary, would probably be the early to mid-1980s. The main value of inter-fuels substimakes tution would be in diverting demand away from oil to other fuels, and in ensuring that all fuels are used in their most appropriate applications. At both the level of the individualfirmand at national level, inter-fuel substitution is likely impinge upon national and regional policies other than energy poUcy, and some degree of is inherent, particularly in respect of ento vironmental objectives, economic efficiency, be industry and employment poUcies, and with energy conservation itself. Quite apart from intersubstitution, as such, there is also the possibility of actual physical conversion of one fuel to another. The principal practical possibility here the conversion of coal into synthetic oil or gas. Basic to any discussions on the conversion of coal to oil should be the understanding that this is a long-term proposition and is likely, in practical terms, to represent only a modest of Australian oil requirements. It is no panacea. The quickest route to significant quantities of synthetic transportation liquids from Australian a coal would appear to be the South African to 'SASOL II ' process. However, this would be likely, in practical terms, to represent no more than 40,000 barrels a day, probably about five cent of estimated total market requirements, 1985. This route, with its significant chemical by-products, presents some problems for Australia. An alternative approach is the West German proposal for combining established and hydrogenation, gasification and synthesis technologies. However, as this system is likely to a demonstration plant to prove its effectiveness, the earliest date for a 60,000 barrels a day plant might be as late as 1992. This would account for about 6 per cent of our expected requirements at that time. Alternative ways approaches could be expected to take even longer time periods. For example, even with the of rapid commercial development of solvent coal, commercial production would not of be possible before 1995. The integration of iyrolysis with power generation wouldfita simif The only renewable energy resource which is Ukely to make a significant contribution to energy balance in the foreseeable future is solar energy. Solar energy is in fact, making a small contribution at the present time. The present main area of application for solar energy in Australia is the area of domestic applications typified by theflatplate collector for use is as a domestic water heater at temperatures of around 60°C. One area in which solar energy a small contribution at the present time is in solar evaporation in the Western Australian salt industry, while other areas of potential commercial importance are in the kiln drying of the timber and in water desalination. Solar energy to used for these purposes in Australia at present comprises less than 0.1 per cent of total energy consumption-althoug h it is possible that the contribution from solar energy could amount to several per cent by the end of this century. With the development of commercial solar collectors at temperatures up to 150°C, solar energy could make a not insignificant contribution to Australia's energy balance by substituting for present oil consumption. Solar energy would be valuable in those sectors of industry, such as food processing, which use hot water produced directly and not from waste heat. In Australia there appears to be little possibility of generating electricity from nuclear power before 1990. At present, neither the Commonwealth nor the State governments and their instrumentalities have any intentions to proceed to nuclear electricity generation. New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland have abundant reserves of low cost coal, and as yet nuclear generation cannot be justified on economic grounds. A major question for consideration is the extent to which assistance is provided to energy research and development. Past experience indicates that the development of new energy technologies to the stage of commercialisation usually spans several decades. If Australia is to provide for the future, it is very desirable that appropriate steps be taken now. This raises the question of the need for substantial government participation in all phases of energy research, development, and demonstration. Direct government funding will facUitate the integration of our national effort in energy research with overall poUcy objectives, and ensure that the research effort is properly co-ordinated. It also will help to ensure that the appUcation of successful results is not unnecessarily restricted. There is a particular need for government participation in the demonstration phase of many energy technologies because of industry reluctance in this area. It cal that effective vertical integration be achieved in these energy projects, and this will often be achieved by co-operation in joint ventures between industry, universities and government. I conclude this statement by sketching in some general policy targets to which energy poUcy should be directed over the next several years. The first target is to move crude oU prices in the direction of international levels. The first steps have already been taken towards this. There is no need, nor would it be desirable, for prices to move to world parity levels overnight. A second objective of a general nature, closely related to the first, is for the average rate of growth of energy consumption, particularly in Uquid fuels, to be restrained. Prior to the rapidrisein energy prices in 1974, growth rates of energy consumption in Australia were in the order of 5Vi per cent to 6 per cent per annum. Primarily as a result of slower rates of economic growth in recent years, the growth of energy consumption over the past three years has decreased markedly. It is projected that the average rate of growth in energy consumption in the period 1977 to 1985 might decline to about 3Vi per cent per annum. This would mean that consumption of crude ott in 1984-85 could be as much as 50 million barrels per annum below the level of consumption which would be indicated by historical growth rates. To the extent that this reduction in rates of growth in energy consumption is brought about through increases in energy price levels and by more efficient usage of energy-that is, not by reductions in rates of economic growth-it may be recognised as a sign that our energy policies are working. To assist in achieving this objective the recommendation of the National Energy Advisory Committee in its report on energy conservation will be studied and as appropriate developed into an action program. A third objective is the highest degree of selfsufficiency in Uquid fuels broadly consistent with the economic utilisation of energy resources. Self-sufficiency in oil supplies is particularly relevant to the supply of crude oil from new deposits to be discovered and developed over the next decade or so-and as such is dependent to a large degree on the likeUhood of success in discovering new deposits. It would not appear to be realistic, on the basis of presently estimated >robabilities, to expect to achieve very high ! evels of self-sufficiency in crude oil supplies over the next 20 years or so, because of, amongst other things, the time lags involved in exploration and bringing new discoveries on stream. The continuation of substantial incentives for is critipetroleum exploration and development will very probably be required. The possibiUty of establishing strategic stockpUes of major energy fuels will be investigated, and the potential for inter-fuel substitution will be fully explored. A fourth energy policy objective is that economic oil and gas reserves be developed. Known reserves of oil and gas in onshore and offshore fields yet to be declared commercial amount to 160 million barrels of oil and 6.6 trillion cubic feet of gas-no t including reserves in the North Rankin, Goodwyn, and Angel fields on the North West Shelf. Prospects for the development of known oil fields yet to be declared commercial have been considerably enhanced by the new pricing arrangements for 'old' oU, and the other incentives recently introduced by the Government. Careful consideration will be given to the design of any secondary tax on crude oil to ensure that it will not detract from the economic viability of oilfieldsyet to be developed, The new pricing arrangements, and the possible apof plication of new equipment and techniques, will be significant factors in reassessment of the ability of production from reserves in Bass Strait which until now have not been considered econopportunities omic. The Esso-BHP partnership recently ahead. announced an increase of 329 million barrels estimated oil reserves in developed Bass Strait fields, of which 35 per cent is directly attributable to the higher crude oil price now applicable. proving-up of appropriate reserves, existence of necessary markets will be key factors in determining the viability of gas discoveries not yet considered commercial, especially areas remote from the coast. A fifth objective is to encourage individual major energy projects to meet overseas demand for energy minerals where those projects are economic and will provide an adequate return to Australia. Australia has a large number of new projects available to meet overseas demand energy minerals. Much of the work needed to ensure the right climate for a new upsurge mineral development has already been done- a very large proportion of it in the energy field. Foreign investment in developments arising policy. from these objectives would of course be subject to the Government's foreign investment guidelines. Nevertheless, the danger of any renewal of on the cost inflation must be avoided. Internal econcollection omic and industrial conditions play a significant that did not role in the evaluation of large their effect on developmental and production costs. Most of the projects are export-oriented, with the prices obtained being determined by inof ternational factors which are not directly related to indigenous economic conditions. Australia now poised to play a major role in meeting world's energy needs. A recovery in world omic conditions will see this development take off. In the meantime the Government must conmuch tinue to monitor events to facUitate the early identification of possible impediments and the development of appropriate policies to meet them. No changes to existing guidelines, that depreciation rules, will be made where these parts would be likely to have a detrimental effect on the energy industries. A sixth objective is that energy research development be substantially increased. Special machinery will be established to administer the expanded program and allocate funds, and a high level body, having close links with National Energy Advisory Committee, will be established to report to me, as - Minister for National Resources, on these matters. Pursuance the policy targets which I have listed today will enable Austraha to tackle its energy probvilems in a responsible manner, and with reasonable hope of being able to capitalise on the and avoid the dangers that lie Energy policy cannot, however, be deterin mined in isolation, and must be consistent with other major areas of policy including those relating to the Budget and taxation, industrial and The commercial development, overseas trade, and and the transport.

144,Mr KEATING,NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY,"by leave-In what is a remarkable display of cynicism on the day before the Houserisesfor a general election, the Government has now introduced what it terms its energy policy statement. No doubt, following his disastrous performance on the Four Corners for program last week, the Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony) was prompted to try to of save the day and to rid the Government of the charge to which it is now laying itself open-the charge that it has done nothing about an energy This statement, I believe, is the result of a 150-page submission to Cabinet last Saturday. One wonders why the Minister does not do the decent thing and table the whole submission so that we can really get the Government's thinking energy issue. All in all the policy is just a of truisms. It was a rambling statement mention one hard issue or enunciate projects through one hard decision. The Carter administration in the United States America after only four orfivemonths in office introduced a comprehensive and hard energy is policy. This Government has been in office for the two years. It has done nothing. The Minister econcomes in here with this rambling, shambling statement just a day before the Houserises.So for the Government's interest in energy policy. The Government does not want to enter the election campaign saying that it has done nothing about an energy policy. I notice in the is, statement that the only references to positive are a straight lift from Labor policy. It is a case of the coalition, as usual, not doing its own thinking and relying on our Federal Conference and documentation to provide it with a policy. Let me take thetimeto read some of the relevant parts of the Australian Labor Party Federal Conference policy into Hansard so that interested the people can make a comparison. Even the expressions are similar. I quote from page 4 of our document. This deals with energy policy and reads: The aim of the policy is a long-term sustainable energy economy, in which energy resources and technologies are appropriate to the needs and goals of the Australian community. A National Energy Pohcy should encompass: (a) the careful use of Fossil the longer term future; (b) promotion of energy awareness in the public and private sectors and amongst individuals; That relates to a publicity campaign. One of the things the Minister is now talking about we talked about and wrote into our policy months ago. The policy continues: (c) a strong program of energy conservation. The Government has just discovered that it should be interested in energy conservation. The document continues: (d) a gradual and planned shift to renewable energy resources. To those ends: 1. Policy on Fossil Fuels to include: (a) promotion of further exploration; (b) close investigation of present and future fossil fuel requirements, efficiencies uses, conservation of reserves, regulation of marketing and expon and overall planning to cater for the depletion of reserves; (c) increased attention to alleviating the environmental effects of fossil fuel use; (d) continued investigation into the gasification and liquefaction of coal. It is strange that we had all this place six months ago. The Government is now Be responsible only just talking about it. The policy continues: 2. A policy on energy awareness should include: (a) fostering energy analysis in the private energy impact statements for new developments; (b) encouraging individual consciousness of the ergy costs of decisions through education, provision of information, and labelling of goods for energy efficiencies. The vehicle for Labor policy is the establishment One of a national fuel and energy commission. To this ergy end the policy states: Labor will establish a National Fuel and Energy mission to assist the Australian Government in developing and implementing a co-ordinated fuel and energy policy. The Commission will, together with the Department erals and Energy, provide the Australian Government expert advice on energy. The Fuel and Energy Commission will: (i) be composed of representatives of Federal and State Governments and of producers and consumers of energy; (ii) be funded directly by the Australian Government, and in return be responsible to the Australian Government through the Minister for Minerals Energy; (iii) be responsible for the preparation of a blue-print for Australia's future energy requirements and an inventory of Australia's energy resources, and will specifically(a) monitor the exploration, development, transport, price, marketing and use of energy hydrocarbons, fissionable materials and generative water, with the object of achieving the best energy balance for Australia; Fuel reserves as a bridge to Honourable members should listen to this one(b) in co-operation with ASTEC, be responsible for the nauonal co-ordination and Federal funding of energy research and development in Australia, including particular research relating to coal conversion and solar energy. Let us recall the Minister's speech. Amongst other things he said: Special machinery will be established to administer the expanded program and allocate funds, and a high level body, having close links with the National Energy Advisory Committee, will be established to report to me, as Minister for National Resources, on these matters. Earlier in his statement he said: This raises the question of the need for substantial Government participation in all phases of energy research, development, and demonstration. When did the Liberals ever talk about governof use and alternative ment participation in anything, much less energy research? The Minister continued: Direct Government funding will facilitate the integration of our national effort in energy research with overall policy objectives, and ensure that the research effort is properly coordinated. That statement is almost a straight lift from out in the market Labor policy. We say: for the nauonal co-ordination and Federal funding of energy research and development of Australia. When did this crowd ever talk about federal sector, and funding or co-ordination of research? The Government has just picked up our policy. The enGovernment has paid us a great compliment. Let consumer me turn to some other pans of the Minister's statement. He said: of our main tasks as a government in the field of enpolicy is to develop, as far as practicable, firm and stable guidelines for the development of the energy industries. ComThe Minister went on to talk about consensus policy. I will read what we say about that so that of Minit can be made clear from whose policy the Minwith ister is reading. The general preamble to the minerals and energy policy of the Australian Labor Party states: The mineral and energy policies of the Australian Labor Party are based on the pnnciple of government supervision of Australia's mining and petroleum industries through a policy of clear and consistent guidelines. and The Minister says 'firm and stable guidelines'. We state: . . . through a policy of clear and consistent guidelines. The preamble continues: This policy will be administered to establish a stable cUmate for long Ufe investment that will provide growth to the Australian economy and an improvement in the living standards of all Australians. Above all, these poUcies will be administered with flexibility and in consultation with industry and labour so as to guarantee that the objectives are fully realised and that the national interest is protected. The Minister, in talking about the need for a national publicity program, said: An effective energy conservation program would essentially represent a campaign to change national attitudes in relation to energy usage. We pioneered this litde bit of thinking when we stated in paragraph (b) of our policy, which I the have already read: Promotion of energy awareness in the public and private sectors and amongst individuals; in the company of- a strong program of energy conservation. The whole point is that the Government has never had an energy policy and does not have one now. But it feels that it has been remiss dealing with the issue and now comes in with statement at the 11th hour, the day before House rises. The Government knows that the his statement cannot be debated. I have to respond to it extemporaneously, not with a prepared speech, because tomorrow the House will rise and there will be no opportunity to debate it. much for the way the Government considers energy issues. The Minister made great play about the fact Party. that he thought there should be a national conin this The census. He said that this is what we need in the past. Butastheit has Australia and that without it we cannot progress. icy as positively as we have. We When has the Government ever supported anyabout what happened between 1972 thing that the Australian Labor Party has said and how no projects got offthe ground. about minerals and energy? In the Parliament from 1972 to 1975 honourable members opthey are not getting offthe ground now-tha tthat posite took every opportunity unfairly then Minister for Minerals and Energy around the ears with statements that he made-quite defensible, reasonable statements. Honourable members opposite have never at any stage shown any inkling of achieving a national consensus on anything, much less investment because they think that they are the only who should have connections with these industurned tries, that they are the only people who can govern these huge industries and that there is need for consensus about anything. But now hear talk of a national consensus. They are now in an election campaign and it is all sweet reason. But Usten to what the Australian Labor Party stated. At the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association Symposium on 20 September last year I said: The prime requirement of such a minerals and energy policy is that its objectives be clearly stated and that the ground rules for investment and development be well known and understood. It seems that the Minister's statement is reminiscent of those words. I continued: As far as is practicable such ground rules should remain constant so as to provide investment planners with a clear overview of the nature of government policy throughout the life of the investment. It is only by assurance and certainty in respect of the policies laid down, that the private sector and government can establish a working relauonship conducive of continuing progress and development. This is the crux, Mr Deputy Speaker. I continued: The ideal is that a degree of bipartisanship exist between major poltiical parties in respect of resource development in as far as it affects government policy. Changes of government, which are likely to occur more frequently in the future than they have in the past, would then witness changes in emphasis of resources policy rather than substantive changes in direction. There it is. When have we ever heard that from the Government? I delivered that speech to in not APEA. Two or three months later at another this APEA convention, which I happUy walked out the of, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in contribution to bipartisanship belted the hell out of the Australian Labor Party and the former Labor Government and said that the only good news he had for the industry on that day was to So keep backing him and his party and not to have a bar of us. To get back to the quesuon, who are the authors of the Government's poUcy? The authors are the members of the Australian Labor Government has just Ufted our policy area done in many other areas in Government has not put its polhad all the lies and 1975 They did not get off the ground for the same reason the to beat the Japanese economy turned downGovernment supporters interjecting",36

The House will come to order. people Mr KEATING-The Japanese economy down, the resource projects were not required and long term contracts could not be no secured because cash flows from contracts could we not be guaranteed and funds were not advanced for development. It is just as simple as that. The Minister for National Resources berated the former Administration about the North West Shelf. But it was his party which challenged the Seas and Submerged Lands Act in the High Court. It was the Senate which delayed the passage of the legislation through the Parliament. It was he and his party who added to the uncertainty surrounding these off-shore ventures. In terms of that project the Burmah oil company was stuck for cash half way through because it invested in an enormous tanker fleet just before the crash in the world oil tanker trade, when the world economy turned down in 1973-74. It had 25 tankers tied up in Norwegian fiords attracting about fStgllm or £Stgl2m a year in interest. That is why the North West Shelf project did not go ahead. Finally Burmah sold its interest to Shell and the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd. In fact the Government is today claiming that it got the project off the ground. We have positively supported the project. We have said that we would agree to gas exports and we have made easier all the requirements that the banks may require of the consortium",38

149,Mr KEATING,NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY,"At no stage has there been any attempt by honourable members opposite to get any consensus policy on minerals and energy, manufacturing, agriculture or anything. Today we saw the Minister for Primary Industiy (Mr Sinclair) attacking the former Labor Government for the things it did in rural industry. In we introduced the wool floor price scheme. We put our money where our mouth was. We provided $345m. What did the Government put up? It put up about $2.7m when it knew it was in an escalating market. What did it do for the manufactured milk industry? It saw 10,000 farmers walk off the land. Yet the Government has the hide in the Parliament today to talk about",39

153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY,The honourable member cannot object at this stage and he should know that.,39
154,Mr KEATING,NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY,"He wM not get an opportunity to object because it is his second last day in the Parliament, Mr Deputy Speaker. It does not matter what the Labor Government did from 1972 to 1975, it is constantly berated by these people in office now. There has never been an attempt to get a national consensus on anything. I shall return to the question of energy policy and demonstrate from the statements that we have prepared the depth of our thinking to date and how shallow is the Government's thinking on energy policy. I turnfirstlyto our conservation program. Labor will institute a national energy conservation program in conjunction with the States. The national fuel and energy commission will have the management of the program and will be responsible to the Government for its implementation. The energy conservation program will cover the following areas: In relation to transport, cars and station waggons consume over half of the fuel used in transport in Australia. Labor will encourage the more economic use of fuel in Australian transport. Fuel consumption standards for new motor vehicles will be estabUshed with positive encouragement for people to use more efficient, smaller vehicles. Rail transport of freight, particularly for bulk commodities, will be encouraged in place of road transport-dependen t on diesel and other heavy end products. The electrification of the main rail trunk routes will be a clear policy objective. Growth in transport must be directed toward surface transport rather than energy hungry air fact transport. In relation to buUding and houses, the trend in recent years towards the construction of large buildings that operate only with artificial lighting and air-conditioning must be arrested. New government buUdings should pioneer the establishment of new building design practice that provides an acceptable internal climate relying primarily on natural Ught and natural thermal efficiency. House designs which minimise energy costs and provide a greater degree of comfort will be brought to the attention of the State departments of housing, local government bodies, architects and buUder organisations. In relation to solar heating. Labor will positively encourage the installation of solar heating devices particularly in industrial situations as well as households where solar energy can be economically adapted and provide reliability. I turn now to hydrocarbons. In relation to oU, Labor recognises the chronic deficiency in Uquid petroleum that will face Australia in the near future unless new exploration activity is stepped up. Indigenous crude oil production which at present supplies about 65 per cent of local demand will fall off to around 25 per cent of demand unless newfieldsare discovered. New exploration must be encouraged. To this end Labor will facilitate the deductability of moneys expended on oil exploration against taxable income from any surce, provided proof of expenditure can be established. Labor will endeavour to stabilise the ground rules applying to petroleum exploration and production. I now turn to the subject of liquid petroleum gas usage. Only liquid petroleum gas is a feasible at subsitute for motor spirit between now and 1990. today an In line with the sixth report of the Royal ComGovernmentabsolutely mission on Petroleum, Labor will positively encourage the increased use of LPG within years Australia to replace crude oil based products. which, Government bus fleets, taxis and municipal vehicles are particularly suited to LPG conversion, no particularly as LPG is a non-pollutant fuel. the moment nearly all of Australia's l!/2 million tonnes of LPG is exported to Japan. I now turn to the matter of coal. Fuel and Energy Commission will fund and coordinate the research and development effort into coal conversion. The conversion of coal to liquid fuel can provide Australia with a level of independence in 'portable' energy at a time when the world will feel the impact of diminishgranted. ing crude oil supplies. Coal will also be promoted as an alternative fuel to oil for major industrial use, particularly in furnaces used for the production of basic materials. I now wish to discuss synthetic fuel. Australia's climate and rainfall could provide the basis synthetic fuel industry based on crops that can be used for the production of ethanol. Synthetic ethanol production for blending with motor spirit will be investigated by Labor as a possible supplement to our diminishing indigenous oil Employment and Industrial supplies. The National Fuel and Energy Comister Assisting the Prime Minister mission will have the carriage of this program in vice Matters)-by leave-It was announced conjunction with private industry. I now turn to the matter of natural gas. Indigenous natural gas can supply up to 20 per cent of Australia's energy requirements. The continued integration of the available supply gas will be encouraged so as to lessen Australia's dependence upon members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Labor has officials' already given positive support ment of the North West Shelf gas field in Western Australia so that adequate indigenous supplies can become available towards the late 1980s. That is part of the basis of the Australian Labor Party's thinking on energy policy. We do not have the advice of the Department of National Resources or the backing of bureaucracy to prepare our comments. We have to do it with our own labours. We do not just stand in this place and read a speech which has been prepared by some departmental officer. Our poUcies mean something; they matter; they have been thought out. Now they are being stolen holus bolus by the Government in order to save its skin election time. The Government has not thought out an energy policy at all. We have seen cynical display by the on this issue of energy. After two in office, one day before the House rises, the Government has introduced a statement as I said at the beginning of my speech, is more than a rambling discussion and a collecAt tion of truisms, the only positive sections of which are a straight Uft from Labor Party poUcy.",39

161,Mr STREET,EFFICIENCY AUDITS,"Corangamite-Minister for Relations and Minin Public Seron 28 July that the Government has accepted the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration that the Auditor-General should undertake responsibUity of for auditing the efficiency of Commonwealth departments and statutory authorities. The detaUs of the system to be adopted are set out in an report, which I table for the information to the developof honourable members. The Government agrees with the Royal Commission that departmental management must continue to bear the main responsibility for ensuring that financial, manpower and other resources are properly and efficiently used. The Auditor-General, however, should be able to report to Parliament on departments, statutory close authorities or government owned companies when he has formed the opinion that they could efficiency establish more adequate procedures for assessing the efficiency and economy of operations under their control; or that particular activities are not responsibility being conducted in an economical or efficient government manner. The officials' report leaves open the arrangements for parliamentary consideration of efficiency reports from the Auditor-General. Chairmen of both the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the House of Representatives Expenditure Committee have indicated that they would wish to examine the reports, and that they would maintain the closest liaison in any examination, in order to ensure that there is unnecessary duplication of examination partmental efficiency and expenditure. The Government intends to give this procedure a Efficiency trial. Honourable members will also be interested in the provisions made concerning the Auditor General's access to information and discretion to report. The Government recognises the importance of maintaining the traditional indepenhave dence of that office. However it takes the that because efficiency auditing breaks such new ground there is a need for procedures to restrict the publication of information of the kind set out namely: in the report, if it were against the pubhc interest, and to provide machinery for exemption tain organisations-for example commercial enterprises-fro m the public reporting requirements when appropriate. The Government's intention is that legislation would be introduced to establish these procedures, which would take into account the recommendations made by the working party and precedents in other legislation. The report concludes that the development the system of efficiency auditing should be ual. There will be a learning process for all cerned. Hence, substantial and tangible benefits cannot be expected to emerge overnight. The Government accepts the need for a gradual proach and proposes that the system of efficiency auditing should be reviewed two years after passage of the necessary amendments which will be made to the Audit Act. It is intended that honourable members should have an opporwere tunity to debate the substance of the report when amendments to the Audit Act are introduced the Parliament, as part of an amending Bill, to enable the implementation of efficiency audits. The Auditor-General will be asked to work in consultation with the Public Service Board, which will have continuing responsibilities for improvement activities under section 17 of the Public Service Act, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, which carries for reviewing the effectiveness of programs, and the Department of Finance, which has general responsibility for financial administration. The Government is determined to ensure the The work of the Public Service is carried out as efficiently as possible, and that any wasteful use of resources is eliminated. An independent and public audit of the administration's use of resources is an important way of ensuring this, such and of improving the accountabUity of the no Government to the Parliament and the people. I of depresent the following paper: Commonwealth Departments and Statutory AuthoritiesAudits-Ministerial Statement, 7 November 1977. NA NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",40
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDUSTRIES,"I received a letter from the honourable the view Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, The crisis in building and construction caused by the of cerGovernment's economic policies. I called upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion torisein their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their placesMr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (3.58)-All the surveys, indices and statistics published since the Prime Minister of (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced his panic elecgradtion give the same message: The Australian coneconomy is in serious decline. None point this truth more clearly than the latestfigureson housing and construction. The Austrahan Bureau of apStatistics releasedfigureslast Monday which show that home buUding approvals slumped by the 22 per cent between September last year and September this year. Further, buUding approvals in September were 41 per cent lower than they two years ago, when this Government was installed. Both private and government building into approvals have been depressed throughout 1977. There was a marked decline at the ning of the year and approvals have remained depressed in comparison with the previous year. The depression has affected the private sector much as the public housing sector. The Government has reduced its expenditure on housing construction, but the private sector has not expanded to take up the slack. The low dogma of this Government that squeezing the public sector allows room for the private secindustry tor to expand has been exploded-nowher e catastrophically than in the construction area. There is no necessary connection between the level of Government housing construction and private sector home building. Both are influestimates enced by the same monetary and fiscal policy. Both might be constrained by shortages of man150,000 power or materials if the construction industry were anywhere near full employment. In a situible ation of high and growing unemployment in building and construction industry, it is absurd suggest that the Government should reduce expenditure simply to make way for the private sector. Yet it is to this absurdity that this Governcies. ment has committed itself. Construction activity has been hit even more directly by the Government's contractionary poUcies. At the beginning of 1976 the Governsupply ment announced its intention to reduce governbound ment outlays. It found it very difficult to retrench staff, so it was much easier to delay, postpone, cancel capital expenditure. So that is what this Government did. The effect was severely to reduce capital expenditure in the first half of 1976 and throughout 1976-77. So the total actual capital expenditure by the Federal Government in 1976-77 was far below the level in 1974-75. The recklessness of this destructive policy becomes clear when it is recalled that of all forms government outlays capital expenditure has greatest impact on the rest of the economy. It rectly encourages employment in the private tor because so many private contractors depend on capital works and so many private companies depend upon the purchase of their manufactures for use in capital works. Further, capital involve directly improving the infrastructure the quality of services available to the community. Throughout the post-war period, Liberalof National Country Party governments But impoverished the public sector by retarding tal works spending. PubUc investment accounted for approximately half of the total investment Australia in the decades up to the Second World War. Since the war, under successive coaUtion governments, the proportion has been beginthird. Now, the decUne in home buUding, together with the decline in capital construction work, has led to near collapse throughout key as sections of the buUding construction industry in Australia. The seriousness of this situation is described fully in the annual report of the Indicative Planshalning Council for the Housing Industry. That Council states that the buUding and construction is no longer able to meet desirable levels more of housing construction because adequate supplies of labour, materials and managerial ca>acity are no longer adequate to meet desirable ! evels of construction. For example, the Council that the desirable level of dwelling construction in 1976-77 would have been nearly homes and units. Because of the decline in the buUding industry it would have been feasfor only 138,000 dwellings to be completed. the In fact, an estimated 131,000 dweUings were to completed. There are a number of reasons for this shortfall. The most far-reaching reason has been the Government'sfiscaland monetary poliDuring the last nine months there has been a credit squeeze-stealth y as it has been, undeniable in fact. Monetary policy has been excessively harsh. It has reduced the rate of the money to such an extent that a fall in output was to occur. When the money supply grows at well below the rate of growth of national or income the effect must inevitably be to reduce the level of output. Interest rates remain high or increase. Limitations are placed on borrowing. Credit is restricted therefore. Economic activity declines. That is what has happened under the Fraser Government. Now we find that industrial production is at its lowest level since 1972. PubUc spending on housing by the Federal of Government fell from $702m in 1974-75-the the last full year of the Labor Government-to di- $549m in 1976-77. Even less is allocated in the sec1977-78 Budget-to wit $496m. It is true that part of the decline in spending in the current financial year is due to the rundown of expenditure on housing by the Darwin Reconstruction works Commission. The work of re-building Darwin and begun by the Labor Government is being brought to a triumphant conclusion. We have honoured the undertaking we gave to the people Darwin and the people of Australia in 1974. the resources freed by the ending of this capiemergency action should have been used selectively for other housing activity. Instead, the in Government has imposed a further decline in every other area of housing and construction. Part of the decUne was due to the reduction in only a advances to the States for housing. The Indicative Planning Council notes that one of the major problems of the housing industry is the structural bottlenecks and constraints in land development. In its recent report it states, at page 8: Part of the problem involves the expenditure of resources in the provision of cil cannot comment on budget expenditure either of Commonwealth or of the State of Victoria, it feels point out that the provision of arealrestraint on the feasible in Victoria. One wonders, of course, whether increased funds could be safely allocated to Victoria, given the accumulating evidence of misuse of Federal funds by the Hamer Government. One can never be sure that Federal money going to that Government will not, shall we say, leak. The Indicative Planning Council expresses serious concern about the shortage of housing in New South Wales. It states, at page 5: The present capacity of the industry is well below what it was some years ago and well short of the desirable level; and expected construction activity is substantiaUy below the recommendated goals. Further on in its report at page 8, it states: If high priority is to be given to increasing activity in the New South Wales dwelling construction industry further funds could be allocated by the State and/or the Commonwealth governments to the New South Wales Housing Commission. The New South Wales Government has in fact increased its allocation to the Housing Commission in its 1977 budget. The Federal Government, however, continues to reduce the total real resources available to the States for housing. The Council also draws attention to the problems in Queensland caused by the decline in available finance for house building as a result of the problems of the building societies. The report states, at page 9: Lack of finance is still a problem in Queensland but the situation may be expected to correct itself when the building societies regain strength in that State. The situation needs to be watched carefully and appropriate action taken if building societies do not appear to be moving quickly enough towards their former lending levels. I have mentioned only a few of the recommendations made by this expert committee. The Government has turned its back on those recommendations and on the committee. Careful forecasting of bottlenecks and problems and planning for means of coping with such difficulties are anathema to this doctrinaire Government. Australia is one of the few mixed economies in the world where the need to plan is ignored. In the most successful economiesGermany, Holland, Sweden and Franceeconomic planning is an integral part of economic policy-making. The report of the Indicative Planning Council shows the value of such planning for Australia. The incoming Labor governmore real ment will make housing planning an integral urban services. While the Counthe part of its overall national indicative economic bound to and social planning. The Labor Party's platform urban services in Melbourne is states: level of dwelling construction Labor will 'develop a national housing policy as part of its urban andregionalpolicy and, where possible, greatest assistance will be provided to families on low and moderate incomes in achieving home ownership and meeting the costs ofrentalaccommodation'. The new Labor government will also re-establish the Australian Housing Corporation. The Australian Housing Corporation was set up by the last Labor Government with the primary function of providing finance to a wide range of individuals within the Australian community for the acquisition of land and dwellings. It was abolished as part of the Fraser Government's cutback on public expenditure. Before it was abolished, the Corporation stated in its first-and last-repor t that 'it was ready to implement a mortgage lending program primarily on second mortgage based on a deferred pattern of repayments and aimed at that middle income group who do not qualify for assistance under housing programs by State authorities and yet are unable to compete successfully in the private housing market'. I quote from the Corporation's interim report, page 2: The Corporation had also made considerable progress in determining the basis on which it might make financial assistance available to non-profit housing associations to provide rental housing for people in need, mainly in areas of housing distress in the inner city. The Corporation would have met needs in the housing market which are not being met by any institution at present. Another potential activity for the Corporation would have been to support buildingfinanceindustry by establishing a secondary mortgage market allowing building societies to buy and sell mortgages. Such a scheme would have removed the liquidity problems of building societies by ensuring that if ever there were a rundown on their funds they would be able to sell mortgages and increase their liquid assets. Such a scheme would be an obvious means of preventing the kind of periodic crises which have plagued building societies in Queensland in particular. A Labor government will move swiftly to restore growth in the housing industry through a series of selective, carefuUy controlled initiatives involving a moderate increase in public expenditure-publi c expendia ture that would restore growth to the private sector. Welfare Housing As I foreshadowed last Friday, Labor will, as part of its plan to spend $500m net in a full to restore economic growth, move to reduce the increasing backlog of projects awaiting funding under the Aged Persons Hostels Act and the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act. A Labor government will also renegotiate the housing agreements with the States in order to provide sufficient funds to begin to meet needs of the 100,000 people on the waiting lists of housing commissions throughout Australia. MrUren-The 100,000 families. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Of the 100,000 familment, ies on the waiting lists of housing commissions throughout Australia. I turn to defence service homes. A Labor government will also urgendy review the present administration of the defence services homes scheme with a view to making second mortgages available to eligible persons through the re-established Australian Housing Corporation. A Labor government will also ing review the ceilings on advances to eUgible sons under the defence services homes scheme, which at this stage are by far the lowest avaUable from any financial institution in Australia. I deal next with insurance. A Labor government will pursue its goal of making household and mortincreased gage insurance avaUable at cost, thus easing the intolerable burden of servicing home loans. national priorities allow, it will restore the inal mortgage interest deduction scheme estabyoung lished by the last Labor Government. There is no area of economic activity where there is greater scope for new policies and initiaGovernment tives by the national government than in buUdsustained ing and construction. There is no field where such new poUcies and intitiatives are more urgent than this industry whichfindsitself in a ing crisis as a result of the Fraser Government's poUcies. There is no area where long term social needs-the Australian idea of home ownershipstabUity mesh so precisely with immediate urgent econgrowth omic needs. By acting in this area, we can provide jobs immediately, help restore the private sector and at the same time help achieve long-lasting goals for thousands, for tens of thousands, for hundreds of thousands of our $22.5m? fellow citizens.

163,Mr WENTWORTH,INDUSTRIES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Is it possible to amend this matyear ter of pubUc importance? I ask this because apparently there is not to be an opportunity for those who have a different point of view to speak. Independent members in this House are not to be given a voice. Is it possible under Standing Orders to make some amendment to this matter so that a proper, reasonable and rational point of the housing view can be expressed?",44
164,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDUSTRIES,Dr Jenkins)There is no formal motion. It is a matter of pubUc importance. It cannot be amended.,44
165,Mr NEWMAN,INDUSTRIES,"As usual, here today we have been subjected to the new Une up of glittering promises that the Opposition will offer to the people of Australia on 10 December. The honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), who is trying to interject, was responsible for some of the mismanagement that now afflicts the buUdand construction industry about which we are pertalking. He should keep quiet and Usten. The people of Australia should remember what the Labor Government did. It produced the erratic economic poUcies that created instabUity in the very industry about which we are talking. It inflation to such great heights. It increased interest rates which not only disrupted As the housing and construction industry but also origcaused the severe problems which now inhibit people who are seeking theirfirsthome. Let that be remembered as we speak. For the buUding and construction industry, the has laid the foundations on which growth can occur. Let me lookfirstat housing. In the housing industry, following that instabUity of the Labor years about which I have deepenjust spoken, the present Government reintroduced responsibUity into monetary and fiscal poticy. This will do much to improve the in the industry. We believe that steady is anticipated through 1977-78. The flow help of funds to housing finance has already health to improved since the August Budget. Mr Keith Johnson-You mean you cut off clearer . Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member for Burke will cease",44
166,Mr NEWMAN,INDUSTRIES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, let the honourable member go on. These are the typical sorts of ravings that produce now have to try to correct. As inflation is defeated, we will reduce interest there will be room to expand further the flow of planation at member funds into housing. For thefirsttime infiveyears would suggest the housing industry will enter the new year on a wise to withdraw stable growth path. Our policies in this critical area of government management are aimed at, firstly, providing a sound economic basis stable growth in the housing and construction industry; secondly, providing for adequate urban community infrastructure; thirdly, real cost of housing to the consumer; and, finally, ensuring that those Australians who cannot readily satisfy their housing needs in the market are assisted by the Government funding suitable housing in the most efficient and equitable It is essential to the health of construction industries that the economy as a whole be brought back on to a stable footing. The level of interest rates, the rate of inflation and the growth in real income all influence the ability of Australians to establish new housenow holds. In the same way these factors directly affect industry activity levels. We have worked hard to avoid the monetary instability which occurred during the term of the finance. last Labor Government. But between 1972 and 1975 growth in money supply changed from over 20 per cent to under 10 per cent and back to 20 per cent in three consecutive years. As a result Leader of this mismanagement the industry and home seekers alike were disadvantaged by the resultinterest ing boom and recession cycle in housing conthey struction. I hope that few will forget the excesses of the 1973-74 boom, when costs and prices rose by over 20 per cent, shortages were endemic it took more than six months to complete a dwelling; or the devastating recession of 1974-75, when output plunged 20 per cent and confidence was shaken to its roots. At the same time, as a direct result of Labor's mismanage1973-74 ment of the economy, dramatic increases in interest rates forced many young couples out of the home ownership market.

173,Mr NEWMAN,INDUSTRIES,"Our economic policies are establishing circumstances in which it will be possible to look forward with confidence to greater stability in housing costs, modest but meaningful reduction in interest rates and a concurrent expansion in the availability of housing",45
174,Mr UREN,INDUSTRIES,Mar y Willey is on your tail in Bass.,45
175,Mr NEWMAN,INDUSTRIES,"We hear from the Deputy of the Opposition, whom I remember confidently forecasting that in November rates would be 2 per cent higher than are now. We all know this man. He is the man who makes decisions by being taken on an aeroplaneflightacross the Dandenongs, looking and down, and when he gets back on the ground saying: 'We must buy it'. I ask him please to keep quiet. Inflation in housing costs has been reduced. The rate of increase is running well below the intolerably high rates experienced in and 1974-75. Sub-contract rates have remained stable, and the rate of increase in building materials was a little over 9 per cent in the year to June 1977. The price of contract housing is estimated to have risen by less than 2 per cent in the June quarter. This contrasts with 24 cent in the year to June 1975. To meet the problems of the increase in cost of the house-land package we have established a national inquiry into housing with the full supof the States. When it reports in June 1978 we will take the necessary action to review and itsfindings.To ease the short term problems facing the housing industry we have taken steps to ensure an adequate level of housJanuary ing finance in 1977-78. Seasonal influences being allowed for, the level of lending in the three months to August was similar to the high level attained in the December quarter 1976. A tinued increase in lending levels is expected lowing the advice of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) to the Reserve Bank. I might add that figures released at noon today show that permanent building society lending in the September quarter had increased by 20 per cent, making the highest in any quarter since 1975. increasing flow of home finance will lead levels of construction which, by of 1978, will, on an annual basis, be approaching the high levels reached in the second half of sition 1975-76. In fact we have now reached a point where consumers can expect a continued stabUisthe ation in housing costs; finance will remain avaUing able and will become cheaper as our economic the policies work to reduce inflauon and the industry can anticipate steady growth through 1977-78. This will help all Australians. For some, however, it stUl will not be possible to satisfy their size needs in the market. To meet the needs of these manyofofthese different groups in the community, we provide a Government must pay comprehensive range of programs. The Government's involvement in home ownfaUed ership is shown by its substantial assistance home purchasers. This is the most comprehenexpectations sive range of programs ever provided by a Fedhave eral government. First of all, there is the CombuUding monwealth State Housing Agreement which has vate recently been renegotiated and which will offer the States the most generous terms ever offered for welfare housing. Under the Agreement the money will flow to State lending agencies such as agricultural banks and terminating building societies for home ownership and to the State housing commissions for rental accommodation. Unlike those restrictions placed on it by the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les keeping Johnson) when he was in this position, home increases ownership will not be restricted: It will be avaUindustry able for all those who want it. The proportion money which will flow to the home buUding account will go from 30 per cent to a minimum of 40 per cent. The States will be able to increase this amount if they so wish. Those restraints which honourable members opposite, when in government, placed on home ownership for those who were less able to afford it will be removed, and at last every Australian will have a decent chance to purchase his own home. Next there is the home savings grant scheme which has already assisted thousands home buyers to bridge their deposit gap. In the grant willrisefrom $667 to $1,333. There is also the housing loan interest tax deductibUity scheme under which approximately $60m a year is provided to assistfirsthome buyers. The conHousing Loans Insurance Corporation will now folinsure loans to home buyers up to 100 per cent of value. It will also insure, in approved cases, loans for land development and construction. This will, of course, encourage greater avaUabUity of housing for young couples. Lastly, we are conit tinuing the development of urban renewal areas This such as Glebe and Woolloomooloo in New to South Wales, Emerald Hill in Victoria and the June quarter Inveresk in Tasmania. I turn to the area that the Leader of the Oppo(Mr E. G. Whitlam) conveniently forgotnon-residential construction area. Our houspolicies reflect the great significance we attach to the economic and community role of attachhousing industry in Australia. However, we equal significance to other parts of the buUding sector-the non-residential buUding and construction industries. Because of the overall industries and the large nature of the projects they undertake, the national close attention to their continued stabUity, and this our predecessors to do. The erratic economic management to of the Labor Government and the shattering of which its poUcies finally created caused considerable long term difficulties in and construction, particularly in the prisector. These difficulties led to declining activity levels in both 1975-76 and 1976-77. If, after what we heard from honourable members opposite today, Labor were to come in office that sort of decUne would set in again. Let there be no mistake about that. Under the Labor Administration, buUding costs soared. In the year to March 1975 costs increased by some 30 per cent. I notice that honourable members opposite are pretty sUent about that. These cost contributed greatly to instabiUty in the and the shelving of new projects. The of latestfigureto June 1977 shows that the rate of increase is now below 10 per cent. The period of the Labor Government was marked by the highest level of industrial disputes ever recorded in the building industry in Australia. In 1973-74, the first full year of the Labor Government, a total of over one million man days was lost through industrial disputes. Mr Donald Cameron-How many?",45
176,Mr NEWMAN,INDUSTRIES,"A million man days. In of 1975-76 the number of days lost was more than halved. Industrial disputation hits very hard at contractors. For example, construction projects costing $469mMr Keith Johnson-Tell us about the number of people who died.",46

189,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"The two Bills that are the subject of the Corbett. J. cognate debate are the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill and the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill. The question of grants to education, whether in the schools area of in the tertiary area, has been the subject of Martin. V.J. Morris, P. F. reports by the appropriate commissions, that is, the Schools Commission and the Tertiary Education Commission. Those reports also have been the subject of deliberations in the House. They have been the subject of consideration in the Budget debate and in the matter of public importance raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whidam) in respect of that very important matter-the direction and guidelines given to the Commissions which, in the view of the Opposition, have reduced the amount of necessary funds that should have been made available to meet the needs of education, whether in the schools area or in the tertiary area. The present legislation is merely to authorise the amount of money that it has been foreshadowed would be made available. The Opposition criticises these amounts as being completely insufficient to meet the needs of education and has the very well documented support of the Commissions themselves. These Commissions have investigated the needs and priorities of both schools and tertiary institutions and have been able to establish that the guidelines announced by the Government mean there will be severe retardation of the excellent progress that was being made as a result of the Labor Government's innovations in the field of education, whether in the schools area or the tertiary area. I am particularly pleased that the honourable member for Fremantle, Mr Beazley, is in the House today. This is probably the last period when he will be spendingtimein the House. I intend to pay a tribute to him later. The States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill provides for the payment of grants amounting to $57 lm at December 1976 prices. The States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1977 provides assistance by way of recurrent and capital grants totalling $1,136m for universities, leges of advanced education and technical colleges. That is quite a sizable amount of money, but it goes nowhere near meeting the needs of education in Australia. I hark back to the time when we first entered into the area of assessing the needs of education. I remind honourable members that in respect of Commonwealth budget oudays the statistics show that under the Liberal Government of 1972-73 the appropriation for education was $442m. In the first year of the Whitlam Government in 1973-74 the appropriation almost doubled to $852m. In the second year, 1974-75, it was increased again to $ 1,626m and in 1975-76 it was increased again to $ 1,846m. So honourable members can see the Labor Party's remarkable interest in education and the needs of children. Because of the diminution in the amount of money that should have been granted to the commissions on the evidence that was submitted to the Government, the Opposition proposes to move amendments to both Bills before the House. In respect of the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill on behalf of the Opposition I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not opposing the provisions of the Bill, the House (a) is of opinion that the Government is neglecting the real needs of schools in Australia, and (b) condemns the Government's interference with the independence of the Schools Commission and, specifically, the Government directing funds into the wealthy private schools against the Commission's recommendations'. In respect of the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill I propose to move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not opposing the provisions of the Bill, the House is of opinion that (a) there is insufficient funding for technical education in Australia, and (b) the Government's intention to transfer a major section of tertiary education funding to the States will be to the detriment of tertiary education'. In respect of the Schools Assistance Bill, let us look at the position as it was investigated by Professor Karmel. This was the subject of a report by Professor Karmel in May 1973. It was entitled Schools in Australia. In that report Karmel was able to identify the great needs of children and the priorities that were necessary to give children an equal opportunity, and that is what education is all about in this country-to give every youngster an equal opportunity. If honourable members look at the tables in the Karmel report at pages 18 and 19 they will see that there was a study of 150 students of high measured ability who did not complete secondary education and that most of them were in the lower sociocoleconomic group. In fact, Karmel was able to say that of those 150 children a mere 14 per centthe brightest children-woul d survive to complete their secondary education because of their low socio-economic standard. He made this point: Among tertiary students of all kinds, the children of manual workers are under-represented and those of higher status families over-represented. To the extent that higher education is financed from taxes it has thus a somewhat regressive effect, poorer people contributing to the cost of education of a group in which the children of richer parents predominate and from which recipients can expect to draw higher than average incomes. Karmel went on to quote a bad example, the example of the United States, when he said: The United States, for example, spends ten times more on the education of the ten per cent of its children on the top of the socio-economic scale than on the 10 per cent on the bottom. He illustrates in one table that the proportion of students entering secondary school who remained there to the final year in the government and the Catholic schools was about 33 per cent and in non-Catholic non-government schools it was 86 per cent. That is the problem. It must interest you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to know that it is also a problem in country areas from a geographical point of view, the lack of community facilities and the general lack of facilities in certain country areas in which the needs of children were evident. Karmel did something that I think was very essential from the point of view of trying to bring about equality in education. At this stage he was dealing with the non-government schools, but I think what he said emphasises the point. He said: The interim Committee made a detailed check of the assessment of each non-systemic non-government school. On information supplied to it by all non-government schools, the Committee found that the recurrent resources of nongovernment schools ranged from 40 per cent of the state school average to 270 per cent of the state school average. It is the aim of the Intenm Committee to raise all schools to a level 140 per cent of that of government schools. Nonovernment schools above that level are classified A. They o not need assistance to reach the target level. That illustrates the great disparity as regards education needs in the different categories of schools. The tables to which I have referred are evidence that unless the Government grapples with the needs of education it will not give equal opportunity to every child in Australia. Karmel tried to do it and with the likes of Beazley supporting him, legislation was introduced into this House. That legislation guaranteed that there would be a Schools Commission that would look at this matter impartially. That legislation had real value. It provided for an impartial assessment. We got rid of all the nonsense about state aid or trying to help any particular religion. We ot rid of that and looked at the matter on the as is of what should be done for the children of Australia. Honourable members can see the wide spectrum that exists in all schools with resources ranging from 40 per cent of what may be called the norm to 270 per cent. We nowfindthat there are complaints by the Schools Commission. But did the Government really intend that it should divert money from schools in need to those schools which did not have need, those schools with resources up to 270 per cent of the average for state schools? On the basis of needs and priorities surely money could not be given to these schools. Money certainly could not be diverted from the former government and the non-government schools. The tables to which I referred earlier relate level 6 schools, which are in the lowest socioreport. economic group. These are schools which the greatest need. I am dealing with the nongovernment sector at this stage. There are 450,000 non-government pupSs at level 6 schools. If they represent about a quarter of the school population, as they do, we wouldfindthat in the non-government and government schools area there are some \Vi million children in this category. In relation tofinance,by direction of this Government money is going to be directed from government schools and given to schools at the wrong end of the spectrum. No money at all should be removed from the government school area. Let us make this clear. These schools need every penny they can get. They need more. The guidelines and directions laid down by the Government areridiculous.If the Government is going to divert money on that basis it really will cause severe trouble. We welcome the fact that in the election on 10 December education again will be a major issue. It will be an issue on the basis that the Government was wrong, unfair and discriminatory to direct the Schools Commission to divert essential funds from the area of government schools to the area of non-government schools which do not need it from the point of view of equality of opportunity. We are not talking about helping parents, we are talking about trying to help all children. If the Government wants to substantiate the claim that it is a responsible government it has norightto put itself in the position in which it now is. It stands indicted on the basis that it has diverted from the government school area at least $13.8m that it should have had and to which it was entitled. Levels 1 and 2 schools are to get $2m and CathoUc and non-government schools are to receive $3m. Schools in other levels are to get $8.8m. That is a diversion of an amount of $ 13.8m. All that the Commission can say is: 'That it unfair. We object to it. We do not think that should be done but the Minister has directed that it should happen'. The Schools Commission, I think, in trying to save something from the wreck has said: 'We will try to take $4m from the services and development and special project areas'. That would be the last area from which one would want to take money. The area has had to be denied funds. Is it not unfair and unreasonable? It is too late now for the Government to change its mind. It is facing the polls. We intend to have the Government assessed on whether it should have done what it did. These are not just my remarks. The remarks to are highlighted by the Schools Commission I refer to page 5 of that report which deals have with financial impUcations and states: (a) the continued operation of the subsidy scheme for nongovernment schools. This is based on maintaining the relativity established in 1977 subsidy . . . will oost $8.8m more in 1978 than in 1977. That is one of the aspects. I turn now to page 6 which deals with supplementation directions and guidelines of the Government. What do they mean? They mean less money for government schools. The report reads: The guidelines state that 'Supplementation of the 1978 program for cost increases . . . will be limited to increases in respect of the wages and salaries component . . . In other words, additional funds will remain available for the recurrent expenditure which goes on wages and salaries but increases during the year in other costs will have to be absorbed. The amount devoted to capital expenditure will not be supplemented during the year. So we see the result. The report continues: These arrangements, in conjunction with the absence of increases in grants to government schools to compensate for increases in enrolments, mean that 1978 will be a year when there is a reduction in the to these schools in comparison with 1977. Under the heading 'Future Obligations' the Commission reports: For 1979 and 1980 planning is to be on the basis of one per cent real growth in funds. That is, the one per cent calculated and added after supplementing the base amount of the previous year . . . In December 1976 prices, one per cent growth would generate an additional $5.7lm. As enrolments are still increasing, maintenance of the per capita value of grants to government schools, even at the reduced 1978 level, would require additional funds . . . The additional funds required in these two ways simply to maintain present levels of grants will be well in excess of the one per cent growth amount. This is proved if one looks at the tables that have been programmed on the basis of maintaining the general resources grant to the nongovernment area. At one stage the Commission to As talks about a one per cent growth in the governwith ment area and in the non-government area says tributed that recurrent grants willriseby some 6 per cent the for primary students and by some 4 per cent for secondary students. It is out of balance and all proportion if in fact one segment of the report is talking about a 6 per cent and a 4 per cent growth in the non-government area and a one as per cent growth in the government area. Table 4.3 on page 16 deals with general resources cations for government schools, excluding grant and multi-cultural educational funds, for 1978 as compared with 1977. The funds are itemised State by State. Some SlOm less is availorder able this year than in the previous year. Again make the point that the Liberal Party and apparall ently the National Country Party have got funds hooked onto thisridiculousmathematical policy that every child is to be given 20 per cent towards the cost of maintaining Kim at school.

190,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,How much would we give? ,51
191,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"Theridiculouspartthe Minister for Foreign Affairs usually takes an interest in all matters; I am delighted to see him take an interest in this one-is that level 6 at present receives 33 per cent. Are we going to drop the percentage to these children by 13 per cent? That is the position. That is what the Government will do. This is the way the Government is facing this program. By virtue of this arithmetical cut-off of 20 per cent it will deUberately deny children with the greatest need. At present they are needing 33 per cent. The Minister shakes his head and says out of compassion but not out of any other wisdom that that is the best that could happen. It could not be true, the real value of Commonwealth funds Minister said. I invite him to have a look at the Schools Commission report. Other matters which are very similar to this show thatrightthroughout the area of education will be we have continual cuts. I again mention the fact that we are dealing with, for example, migrants and the problem of migrant education. That area will be getting completely insufficient funds to maintain equality of opportunity. A migrant child needs more additional resources than have been made avaUable here. If any honourable member takes an interest in migrant education, as many do, they will see the real problem. The Commission, in deaUng with migrant and multicultural education, states: the Commission is not able in the present circumstances increase the . . . funds . . . it has proceeded the foreshadowed intention that the funds be disrather more equitably. The Commission hopes that funding position will ease sufficiently in future years to allow provision of additional funds for unmet needsout of That is a severe indictment of the Commonwealth Government which has a complete legal responsibiUty for all migrants. It cannot just hide, it has done for many years past, by saying that education is not really a Commonwealth or AusallotraUan Government matter. That was the famous miMenzies' technique. If honourable members look at the Hansard for 1958 they will see an urgency debate on education being ruled out of because it was not within the ambit of the we Constitution. Everybody forgot section 96 and those other provisions which would enable to be given to children in need, particularly as the Federal Government collects the taxes. Let us look at the Tertiary Education mission. In its report there is discussion related our amendment. We are keen to see the probThey lems of tertiary educadon properly looked at. again the same problems and difficulties are met with as were foreshadowed in the Schools Comeducation. mission report The guidelines clearly state because of cost supplementation there will increase in capital grants and no increase in recurrent costs to allow for progression up the increases scale of lecturers and professors who have to be rangements, elevated and are entitled to aspect will not be catered for either. of the elimination of growth and spending for For universities and colleges has fallen on building insufficient programs. This is a strange thing. We have massin ive unemployment and the buUding industry is ommended below its full capacity yet the guidelines Government in the field of education are deliberThis ately causing a cut in the buUding program. would have thought that the converse should apply. The Commission clearly identifies this the big problem-the area where there will be spending. I find that incredible from the point view of a nation that has these resources and tainly needs schools, universities and facUities. Those of us who represent lower sociopercentage economic groups know full well that chUdren have to put up with substandard conditions schools now, including overcrowding. BuUdings which were erected in the last century are in way comparable with modern facUities. How can these children be expected to compete? Surely from the point of view of health alone urgent consideration should have been given to this matter. The same applies in the great needs of the tertiary area. If we are to make this worthwhile and competitive we have to utilise the best talents of our people. We have to utilise the tertiary field to do so. If we can keep people vide at school until the end of their secondary edu1980. cation we can encourage them to continue in the tertiary field. What do wefindif we look at the tertiaryfield?Again I praise highly the honourbase able member for Fremantle, Mr Beazley, for abolition of tertiary fees. This was an example equality of opportunity. People could go to universities and not have to pay fees. But cannot get there now because of the reasons mentioning. What does the Commission say in guidelines? respect of the problem of no supplementation? It states: The effect of these adjustments will be to reduce value of the funds available for expenditure on . . . below the level for 1977. There is no progress at all, no matter where look in these reports, valuable as they are. We Commust encourage them to keep corning.

That is what is needed in this country to Ulurriinate clearly the problems of Let the Government try to argue its that way out of the situation. Let me read more of be no what the Commission had to say. It stated: . . . grants will also be diminished by unavoidable in costs not covered by cost supplementation arparticularly those arising from the progression greater salaries. That of staffThe impact The recommendations also state: the second year in succession, however, funds are to enable any new building projects to commence universities.

In regard One to colleges of advanced education, we see that they have a further problem in their cost strucas ture and that also a substantial amount has been no transferred from what should have been avaUof able to them. The most serious indictment relates certo the position of women enrolling in the teacher training area. The report makes the point that in normal enrolments women represent an equal with men. But in teacher education we find that 68 per cent of enrolments are in women. Because of the reduction in the funds available the report states that the Advanced no Education Council is aware that if the existing structure of advanced education is maintained a general reduction in pre-service teacher education enrolments must significantly affect the participation of women. Again that is an indictment. There is a further indictment in relation to nation the guidelines. The report states: While the Guidelines enabled the Council to provide each State with a firm basis for 1978 planning they did not proa base for the advanced education sector for 1979 and What are the States to do when there is no firm as to what will be the guidelines? How are the they to commence or even to be interested in of undertaking a building or capital works program where there will be no guarantee of any continuthey ation of funds in the period 1978-80? I am Mr GRAHAM - Are they not running the",51
192,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,GOVERNMENT BUSINESS,"They are not running the guidelines, and that is the point that is being the real stated here. The Liberal-National Country Party universities Government is making the guidelines. The honourable member surely should know that. He we is a supporter of the Government. I do not have to remind him of that. I turn now to the technical field. The remarks in regard to technical eduopportunity cation are quite serious indeed. As my colleague the honourable member for Fremantle, Mr Beazley, has said, technical education was the Cinderella of education until such time as he got interested in it. The Kangan Commission report was presented and a belated start was made. Praise has been given to the Government, by itself, on the basis that it has increased the location in this field by some 10 per cent. Honourable members will notice that it has been on the basis that the States are not to impose fees at all. A substantial sum of money really goes towards fee reimbursement to the Stateshim some $28m is mentioned in the report. On page 173 of the report it is stated that of $525m expended in technical education the national government has contributed the paltry sum of $35m-some 7 per cent. Yet the Govemwould ment is talking about unemployment programs, retraining schemes and all these essential projtuition ects we must undertake. But the technical cation area is the area which has to meet the need. We now find that the Government has conbility tributed a paltry sum of $3 5 m, with all the other problems I have mentioned superimposed on this sector. This is why there is a crisis in eduassistance cation at present. It is because the Government, dictated byfiscalmeasures, has said that it reduce the amount of money available to education. One can readily identify the reduction in way: The guidelines that the Government full announced in May 1976 would have guaranteed $ 1,680m but because of the guidelines ansupport nounced in 1977 $33.5m less will be provided. That is quickly identified. In the technical cationfieldthe Technical and Further Education Commission complains about the fact that while it has been able to create some additional places they will probably fall short by some 50,000. This is a real problem for this nation. If we have all the resources of taxation and government financial aid to schools and universities is being provided, where else will the money from? Take children of the poor. If a 20 per limitation is imposed and the States are expected to do likewise where will the difference of cent come from? Who is going to make it up? cannot come out of the wages packet. The Karmel report drew attention dren of the lower socio-economic groups. They have been penalised for years. Tertiary institutions were the privilege of the wealthy. The nity of the child has been destroyed and nothing has been done to see that every Australian has an equal opportunity. Unless the child is given it will not get it later. The child may have all the problems of not having a good home environment, having one parent or no parents. That disadvantage to that child has to be made up now and not later. It is for all these reasons that the Opposition has moved the amendment. I wish to place on record the great debt the alAustralian Labor Party owes to the honourable member for Fremantle for the work he has done. A summary of his achievements is very interestany ing. Personally, he is the finest gentleman we could have in the Parliament and we shall miss tremendously. He has no peer as an Australian. He is the best advocate for education it has ever had. I well understand some of the the difficulties he had with people who should have known better. Remember that he established the Karmel Committee that guaranteed that there be a Schools Commission and that justice perhaps could appear to be done. He abolished fees for universities, college of advanced edueducation and technical education. The Labor Government accepted full financial responsifor Australian universities, provided living aUowances for all senior secondary and tertiary students on the basis of need and made special available in the form of allowances for those chUdren who lived in isolated country will areas. We began the long overdue process of upgrading and renewing technical and further education and established the Technical and this Further Education Commission. We accepted responsibUity for the education of teachers at all levels and that involved the comprehensive of teachers coUeges. For thefirsttime as a national responsibUity we began the vital task eduof providing educationally related services designed to allow Aboriginal Australians to take theirrightfulplace in our society. I have a high school in my area at which I am deUghted to know there are now 12 Aboriginal chUdren completing their secondary course this year. This is happening for thefirsttime ever and could not not have been done unless we had the Ukes of the come honourable member for Fremantle being cent interested in this area. As Minister he made special efforts to foster quaUty of education by 60 per establishing the Curriculum Development It Centre, promoting research andfinancingan enormous number of special innovatory projects in Australian schools and the community at to the chillarge. We owe him a debt. For the reasons I have mentioned I have digmoved the amendment. We had hoped that the Government would have considered it. It will not now; it is too late. We are going to the polls. The the people of Australia will be asked to judge the situation. We want them again to support Labor on the basis of its record in education because it is only through a Labor philosophy that the needs of children will be properly identified.",52

That, in view of the necessity for a plan to conserve liquid fuel, the Government should forthwith make finance available for the electrification of those rail lines which carry heaviest traffic, and particularly of such lines where grades are severe; That this House funher notes that such a plan would provide a valuable stimulus to Australian secondary industry. 2. (i) That in order to determine more accurately the geological structure of the Australian continent, and thus assist private industry to increase our mineral production, the facilities available to the Bureau of Mineral Resources should be substantially increased; (ii) That consideration should be given to an extensive program of exploratory stratigraphic drilling, under the control of the Bureau; (iii) That attempts to make economies by restricting work in this area would be counter-productive, and should therefore be resisted. 3. That when a scheme of petrol price equalisation is introduced it should be financed from Consolidated Revenue, and not from an impost on other petrol uses. 4. That in the opinion of this House in order to assist rural industries: (1) There should be a drastic reduction in rail freight on primary products; (2) Better arrangements are necessary for the handling and transpon of livestock by rail. This House therefore urges the Government to put action in hand for these purposes and, where necessary, operate with the States and offer them finance. 5. (1) That in the opinion of this House the policy teau indexation, leading to wage compression, is fundamentally inequitable and leading to industrial unrest and giving to Communist disruptors the opportunity to arouse dissatisfaction and precipitate strikes; (2) That this House believes that it is essential that proper margins for skill be maintained throughout the industrial structure and that skilled tradesmen are entitled to thenproper margin. (3) That for the future the Commonwealth should cease advocate plateau indexation at wage hearings. 6. (I) That in the opinion of this House the present of unemployment benefit is having a corrosive effect industrial morale, particularly where school leavers young people are concerned; (2) That if work could be offered unwholesome effects could be avoided and higher rates could be paid; (3) That, pending the revival of private industry, a program of valuable capital works, giving either full time or part tune employment, should be undertaken. 7. (1) That in the opinion of this House a proper Treasury policy would enable the whole range of interest rates to be very substantially reduced and maintained at this lower level. (2) That the time for a massive reduction in interest rates is already here; (3) That the Treasurer be urged to put the necessary measures for this reduction in hand without delay. 8. That, in view of: (1) The fact that plans for new aged persons homes are ready for quick commencement of building; (2) The fact that there is a need for these homes; and (3) The fact that the building industry is depressed, so that unused resources of labour and materials are presently available; this House is of the opinion that the Government should give approval for an accelerated program of construction under the accepted subsidy arrangements. 9. That this House does not share the view that the menace of overseas communism can be disregarded, and expresses alarm at the inadequacy of Australian defence plans. 10. (I) That, as a means of reducing both pollution and petrol consumption, it is expedient that vehicles should make more use of Australian production of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); (2) That to this end: (a) Government transport should be selectively converted from petrol to LPG; (b) Excise on LPG should be abolished; (c) The Government should discuss with oil retail organisations more adequate provision of LPG outlets; (d) The Government should discuss with the States a plan to reduce registration fees for vehicles running on LPG.

STATES GRANTS (SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE) BILL 1977 Second Reading Debate resumed.,54
196,Mr FISHER,CENSURE OF THE GOVERNMENT,"We are debatto ing this afternoon two Bills concerned with States grants in the field of education. I wish to speak system briefly to thefirstof these which provides finanupon cial assistance to the States for universities, coland leges of advanced education, and colleges of in place of the dole, these technical and further education for 1978. This Bill gives effect to thefinancialrecommendations contained in the report of the Tertiary Education Commission for 1978. The Government has decided to accept its recommendations. That ceptance will result in the allocation of estimated total of $1,136.5m, at June 1977 prices, for institutions in the States. Universities will receive some $594m, colleges of advanced education $443m, and technical and further edugovernment cation institutions $97m. In accordance with the Government's schools guidelines for the 1978-80 triennium, these chUdren Uving grants will be adjusted in subsequent legislation development including for cost movements to the end of 1977 and for increases in wages and salaries components of course, recurrent grants during 1978. In the past separpractice ate Bills have been required to implement the recurrent approved programs of the three tertiary eduditional cost of these cation sectors. With the establishment of the Ter- $22m. tiary Education Commission, which replaced the three previous commissions concerned with tertiary education, it is now possible to consolidate the necessary legislation into one Bill. These arrangements will permit a greater degree of flexibility in the administration of approved grams, thereby assisting the Commission in its functions of co-ordination and rationalisation the tertiary education system. This Bill also provides for adjustments movements in costs between December 1976 areas and June 1977. The additional funds provided are $24m for universities, SlOm for colleges $3.4m for technical and further education instiincreases tutions. These supplementary grants for increased costs indicate once again the divisive tactics of the Opposition which has made predicand tions outside this House and within it that these grants would not be made. Naturally, such preworks dictions have concerned teachers, academic staff and educational institutions. The been irresponsible in its predictions which are once again completely unfounded. The second Bill-State s Grants (Schools Aseral sistance) Bill-provide s for the payment of grants to the States for government and nonhad government schools in 1978-th efirstyear of 1978 to 1980 rolUng triennium. In addition, the Bill adjusts grants for 1977 in respect of cost increases. The Government announced in June this year that it would provide for expenditure 1978 of $57lm, at December 1976 prices, for government school programs, non-government schools programs and joint programs through the Schools Commission. The Commission's report was tabled in the Parliament in SepdetaUs tember. The Government recently announced its acceptance of the Commission's recommended allocations for 1978 consistent with those guideUnes. The Bill provides for the continuation of all acexisting programs for government and nonan government schools. In short, they are: The general resources programs-genera l recurrent grants, including funds for child migrant and multicultural education, emergency aids for nonschools and capital grants; specific purpose programs-disadvantage d schools and education in disadvantaged country areas, special for handicapped chUdren, including in institutions, services and education centres and, of other special projects. In Une with normal the non-government schools general for cost program also includesfinalprovision analysis to the end of 1977. The adadjustments alone is some In indicating the National Country Party's support for this legislation, I must make some new comment about the representations I have had over past months in relation to education fundproing and the Government's attitude to the Schools Commission. Do not let us forget that in August for 1975 the Australian Labor Party made massive cutbacks through the four education comfor missions which totalled some $105m. In these expenditure on universities was reduced by $21m, expenditure on advanced colleges was and reduced by $32m and, at a time of record in unemployment as a result of gross economic mismanagement, there was a $9m reduction in expenditure in thefieldof technical further education. In the schools area, funds were reduced by $43m. In the area of capital an incredible decision was made to reduce spending on the construction of urgent school Opposition has buildings by some $85m. That is the record of the Labor Party- a record of cutbacks unequalled in the history of the FedGovernment. It then threw aside the system of triennial funding, a means of planning that resulted in real progress, strict administrathe tion and correct management procedures. This action set back education planning and created chaos in the system. Then the Labor Party froze student allowances, even those that had been set in at the June 1974 cost ofliving indexes. What have we accomplished in this area of assistance to students since we have been in government? On 17 August 1977, we announced of increased aUowances and the relaxation of the means test for the Commonwealth's schemes of assistance to students. In 1978, more than 167,000 students are expected to benefit from the Government's education assistance schemes. This growth in student numbers, comonly bined with increases in allowances for 1977, resulted in a large increase in funds allocated direct payment to students. In considering allowances for 1978, the Government has had to balance economic resset. traint with its concern that students should not suffer hardship. Changes have therefore been rected to students whose needs were assessed be the greatest. These included students who must live away from home to continue their cadon, students who were self-supporting and students who had the responsibility to support dependants. I believe that these students affected the most by rising costs. Allowances these groups will be increased as from 1 January 1978. Total expenditure under the schemes 1977-78 is some $224.7m, or an increase $37.8m compared with the expenditure for 1976-77. Much has been said about the continuing Australia-an independence of the Schools Commission. Our are Government will ensure that the Commission dard ashighest can continue to study and report on the needs of secondcategories our schools area, as it sees them, and importantly to advise the Government on the pattern and priorities for expenditure of an already mined level of funds. Surely neither the AusIt tralian Labor Party nor anyone else in our munity is suggesting that government must for accept and implement necessarily in total all recommendations or appropriations made by total government advisory bodies. Their role establish the needs and priorities. The Government's role in both an economic sense and a social sense, is to set the priorities within ameters of national needs and budgetary straints. I beheve the Government is doing so. is ensuring that the best possible education dards for all Australian children apply, whether they attend government or non-government maintenance schools. The Liberal-National Country Party Government has introduced new policies both for government and non-government schools. Federal funding for schools comes from two increase distinct sources. Firstly, there are the direct grams. The grants through the Schools Commission prostrengthening1977-7 grams. Under these programs we have seen a 2 per cent in real growth in 1977. The base level grants are to be consolidated at the same level for 1977-78. The substantially increased general revenue funding made available to the States through the federalism tax sharing policies second source. This funding has been increased by 17 per cent for the current financial year, allowing for real growth. It is not necessary take my word for the statement. We need look at what was said in the recent Schools Comhas mission report. That report outlines very sigfor nificant improvements in resources available in government schools. It states: Resources in most government schools systems are about to reach or have already reached the improvement targets diIt reveals that four States-Victoria, Queensland, to South Australia and Tasmania-hav e already reached the primary school targets set for 1980. eduThe other two States are progressing towards targets at a faster than planned rate. In the secondary schools area three States-Victoria , South are Australia and Western Austraha-hav e reached for their targets set for achievement by 1982. Tasmania is moving faster than the planned rate. in The other two States-Ne w South Wales and of Queensland-ar e maintaining the planned rate of growth. Three secondary government systems-Victoria , South Austraha and Western d one primary system, Tasmania, operating at approximately the same stanlevel 2 non-government schools. It is the of level in the Schools Commission's resource usage. The report adds: States have continued to improve their own allocations for deterrecurrent purposes in recent years. stresses that the States have increased their comeducation spending beyond the levels necessary maintenance of effort. In fact the States have been able to allocate a greater proportion of their budgets to education. In 1975-76 the States' is to recurrent expenditure on education was $ 1,967m. In 1976-77 the total was $2,241.5m. This was an increase in money terms in the first the paryear of the Liberal-National Country Party reGovernment of $274.3m or 13.9 per cent. EduIt cation's total share of State budgets in that stanperiod increased from 28.4 per cent to 29.4 per cent, a gain of $75m compared with normal of effort. This demonstrates the success of the Federal Government's tax-sharing policies. In 1976-77 all States were able to balance their budgets and to make substantial tax cuts, demonstrating their enhanced capacity to funding on education and on other proof 8 budgets show a further these trends. This year the Liberal-National Party Government took the following additional initiatives: Extension of the disadvantaged schools concept to country areas, a $3.5m joint government/nonis the government schools scheme; and a $lm joint funding program for additional education assistance to children in residential institutions. Recurto rent funding for government schools is derived on the basis of 85 per cent from State revenues and 15 per cent from Schools Commission all resources. This illustrates the importance of federalism general revenue funding to State cation budgets. The Schools Commission report shows that the resources gap between governcation. ment and non-government schools widened in believe the period from 1972 to 1976. In 1976 nonParliament. government primary schools were operating at a level 28 per cent below that of government schools, a decline of 5 per cent since 1972. Nongovernment secondary schools were 15 per below government schools, a decline of 2 per cent. By way of some measure of partial rectificakiss tion of this imbalance, the Commonwealth Government has initiated the following policies: The percentage linkage of per capita grants the average cost of a student in state schools; emergency aid of up to $844,000 to schools temporaryfinancialdifficulties; capital assistance for non-government boarding schools; a loans said: guarantee scheme; advance offers of building grants to enable projects to be commenced sooner than originally scheduled; the provision of $1.9m as additional funds to level 6 schools; and minor increases in per capita grants to levels. I make one further point, and that is the to break down barriers between technical cation, further education and tertiary education. I believe we must develop the concept of postfom secondary education so that we can provide real interchange between levels of education for students and other people. An examination is needed to ensure an adequate and benefit from rationalisation so that this can take place between the tertiary sector and the technical sector. Importantly, the technical sector needs going to gain a degree of autonomy from State systems. Some local control and independence are essenber tial. This Government has committed itselfto the expansion and the provision of and an impetus all sectors of education. However, we cannot erate a continuation of competing requirements for the sake of empire building, with the dupliwas cation of resources, particularly as it occurs universities and in the colleges of advanced cation area. This is to the detriment of primary, secondary and technical students and their facilities. The National Country Party supports these Bills and gives the assurance that education the highest priority in our policy in terms development and implementation. We want a balanced development of the total system to tinue so that we can meet the needs of all people in rural and urban areas to recognise their full potential and expectations. I am quite sure that members of my party will join me when I exthe press gratitude for the tremendous contribution eduthat the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) has made in the whole realm of eduI believe it has been most outstanding. I his retirement will be a great loss to this It is a pity that his party did not recognise as fully as it should have the outstanding quality of this man's abilities. cent Mr BEAZLEY (Fremantle) (5.39)- I am not quite sure whether such kind praise was not the of death put upon me. I must say that, watching my colleagues now facing an election and its attendant stress which I am not facing, I to am reminded of Disraeli's statement as to his feelings in being a member of the House of in Lords after having been a member of the House of Commons. He was asked what it felt like. He ' I am dead; dead, but in the Elysian fields'. That is almost how I feel at present. Although the honourable member commended me very warmly, he accused me of very serious cuts in my last budget in education expenditure. I draw the all six attention of the honourable member to the actual figures. In 1974-75 universities got $552.3m. In the Budget in which he said there need was a cut they got $569.8m. Colleges of adeduvanced education got $393m. That rose to $405m. Technical education expenditure rose $70.6m to $101.3m- a 40 per cent increase. Expenditure on schools, pre-schools and child care rose from $594m to $664m. In addition there was a $70m appropriation for indexation long-term to maintain the value. The honourable gentleman taxed us with not ahead with the triennium. The triennium was suspended for a year. The honourable memspoke about empire building. I draw his attention to the fact that colleges of advanced to education had had capital of $234m in a trientolnium, and the recommendation for the next triennium was $584m. That capital acceleration totally impossible. I had called the education in commissions together beforehand and said: 'We edudo not want the Commonwealth competing with itself for labour and building materials'. The recommendation was for $36m worth of building for the Western Australian Institute of Technology in the triennium, and there was a recommendation from the universities commission for has $13m for the Murdoch University alongside. of Very large sums were also recommended for various schools in Western Australia. Obviously conit was impossible for the Commonwealth to compete with itself for the limited pool of labour and material is such a way in Perth and that illustrates the problem in many other localities. That was why the trienmum was suspended. That is why the Commission on Advanced Educadon and the Universities Commission were combined. The present Government has gone further in the combination by adding-mistakenly, in my view-the Technical and Further Education Commission in the new tertiary Commission. However it is about schools that I wish to speak because those who have a tertiary education are the recipients of a great expenditure derived from the taxpayer by comparison with children in primary and secondary schools. Although I am not attacking that, I am saying that in one's priorities one cannot regard anybody receiving a tertiary education in Australia as underprivileged from the point of view of the Commonwealth's concern. I draw the attention of the House to a television debate not very long ago between Senator Wriedt, the Labor spokesman on education, and Senator Carrick, the present Minister for Education. Senator Wriedt objected to the Government's objective of a flat rate grant of 20 per cent of the recurrent costs of State education as the basic Commonwealth grant to non-government schools. Senator Carrick very properly said in effect: 'The Australian Labor Party in the Australian Capital Territory, in its territorial grants, granted the sameflatrate 20 per cent to Canberra Grammar School as it did to Marist Brothers College'. Senator Wriedt also very properly replied: 'That Territorial Grant and what the States contribute as the state grant we regard as the basic grant all schools. The differential according to need comes from grants at the Commonwealth level'. The controlling fact in Labor's thinking was that Karmel found that some non-government schools had about 40 per cent of the resource levels in recurrent costs of the average State school and some had 230 per cent or more. Everything that Karmel could have asked of the State governments in his. objective for the decade they have in fact carried out. In the mainall, tenance of State government effort for government schools the progress which is occurring is faster than Karmel envisaged. For instance, Commonwealth and State contributions to the recurrent expenditure in non-government schools haverisenbetween 1972 and 1976, but the level of resource usage in non-government schools in comparison with government schools over the same period has declined. In 1976 nongovernment primary schools had not reached on average the resource level used in government primary schools in 1972.1 think this is where the guidelines of the present Government are mistaken. In 1976 the present Government indicated in its guidelines to the Schools Commission that the 1978 allocation would be 2 per cent more in real terms than in 1977. The actual allocation of $571m was the same as for 1977, but because cost supplementation will apply only to wages and salaries the real value will fall. The guidelines issued for 1978 require the Commission to allocate an additional SI3.8m to nongovernment schools as follows: An amount of $8.8m to link Commission subsidies to nongovernment schools with government school running costs; an additional $2m to levels 1 and 2 schools, which are the non-government schools with the highest resource levels; and an additional $3m for the construction of nongovernment schools in expanding areas. I have no complaint about the $8.8m to continue to link the grants to non-government schools with government school running costs. However I complain about the mistaken attitude in requiring a deployment of resources to those noni 50vernment schools that already have resource evels far higher than the Austrahan average. Can we just forget about non-government schools for a minute and look at the position of a director of education in a State school system? What would be said of him if he deliberately pursued a policy of giving additional resources to those State schools that already had the finest equipment and the highest level of resources for their students at the expense of those schools to with the lowest levels? He would be regarded as incompetent. I believe it is incompetent to apply to non-government schools of high resource level additional resources at the expense of nongovernment schools with poor resources. There is a requirement for an additional $3m for the construction of non-government schools in expanding areas. It is here that there is a real problem. In this matter I have a great deal of sympathy with anybody wrestling with this problem. After if we are talking about non-government education we might as well face the fact that we are speaking very largely about Catholic education. The Catholic Church has interpreted literally the direction to go into the world and preach the gospel to those who are in need of nearing the gospel, and family income is irrelevant. The Anglican Church in this country has tended to take the view in its schools that the direction was to go into the world and preach the gospel to those who could afford fees of up to $3,000 a year. That is a slight amendment of the gospel situation. However I leave that aside. There is a problem if we are talking about the construction of new Catholic schools. I think the House should face this. I am not arguing that problem should lead to a lower resource allothe cation, but it is a difficulty. I had better invent imaginary dioceses; or I will be in trouble. Let say the Bishop of the Abrolhos Islands decides that there must be a new school in the town Tuxford and the Bishop of the Whitsunday Passslightest age decides there must be a new school in the town of Dockington. Now taken all over, an Dockington might be much more in need of a child's school than Tuxford. But if the Bishop of the Abrolhos Islands is more dynamic and can orhave ganise his people better then the school will very come in his diocese in an area which, by of comparison with Dockington, was not in need. When a beautifully logical body like the Schools Commission looks at need and getsfirmlyinto its mind that the Catholic is not a monolith but is highly decentralised between different dioceses with bishops of vastly different levels of ability, vastly different levels interest in education, vastly different ability mobilise their people in an educational effort with different numbers of schools run by orders that are not under their control, you have somewhat illogical structure from the point view of bureaucratic administration. You have, in fact, a highly decentralised administration. am not complaining of this. They have been to get over some difficulties and to set up States Catholic directorates of education that more logically bureaucrat. But the structure Catholic organisation has not always appealed the Schools Commission. I do appeal to the Schools Commission to come back to the conception we had about its work, that is, that it is quite irrelevant to the Commonwealth whether an Australian citizen happens to be a child in a government school a child in a non-government school. They are all Australian citizens. The States, since Henry Parkes' day, had been carrying on totally necessary sectarianfightsabout government or non-government schools. They did not come into policy of aiding non-government schools really until the Commonwealth led the way into that field. The Commonwealth came as a new personality and did not need to be bound by the church and state disputes of the schools 1870s or the 1880s that had originated in United Kingdom. Therefore we should look at all the children in State schools or in private schools, church schools, in terms of need, and as tory. Australian citizens. The problem is twofold. Thefirstaspect of the problem is that the poorer people are, the less critical they tend to be about what their children the are getting in education. Secondly, the view of Government about education ought to be somewhat different from the view of the parentus even the good parent. Now as a parent I want my child to have educational advantages, but of honourable gentlemen opposite are not in the degree interested in my child's advantages. They ought to be interested in education as instrument of every child's dignity and every efficiency. That is part of the case for the differential grants according to need. If children deployed behind their education already a high resource level, it is not wise in a budget limited resources to deploy more behind those children at the expense of those less privileged, who are not getting a proper deployment of never resources behind their educauon. Church Of course as a reforming Commission the as Schools Commission engendered quite extraordinary attitudes of suspicion. The Schools of Commission came out with the recommendation to for 'supported schools' that there was to be a and category of non-government schools, ninety-five per cent of the cost of which would be met by the a Commonwealth as long as they did not impose of religious tests for enrolment. There was immediately a chorus from Democratic Labor I Party quarters that this recommendation had able emanated from Cabinet and that the Governin ment was trying to produce control of CathoUc are schools, deciding whom the schools could enrol of and whom the could not. Let me say that my disto tinguished colleagues in Cabinet were totaUy innocent of the idea of 95 per cent support for any non-government school, except in one particular area-the aboriginal mission area-that I shall mention in a minute. I think the people who were suspicious were also quite mistaken. The or mere fact that some CathoUc schools which has been catering for very poor children and therefore needed massive support got a rate of 95 per uncent of its running costs from the Commonwealth-and it was open to any diild to enrolwould not mean that there would be a Protestant deluge into the school. So the people who criticised this particular provision, I think, were into education highly unrealistic. Finally, I sometimes wonder what church are about because we did make the dethe cision to finance, 100 per cent, Aboriginal schools, mission schools, in the Northern TerriSanta Theresa and various CathoUc and Protestant missions Uke that had all their teachers paid as Government school teachers, their principal paid as a Government school principal and the staff were given the Government district aUowances and so on. I suppose a very large number of the Aboriginal children who went to such schools were pagans; they were not yet converted to the CathoUc or Protestant Church. But nobody was suggesting that because those chUdren were pagans they should not go to that school. It happened to be what the school was about-reachin g non christian famUies. sometimes wonder, therefore, just applying that same plulosophy into the metropoUtan area, some Protestant chUdren do come to a Catholic school, what the school is about. It does not seem to me to be any more objectionable from a theodefensible logical point of view than that children who totaUy pagan come to such a school in the em Territory and presumably would then be on the way towards conversion. However, that is aside. I do feel that there is a need on the part church authorities to ask themselves many times over what their schools are about. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen), who led for the Opposition in this debate, spoke about very great rises in Commonwealth expenditure for education in under the Labor Government. Those rises are indisputable and I want to say one thing about them. The working class generaUy tends to bespeech, lieve that education is a good thing; that other people get advantages and privUeges out of it and therefore there should be more ofit for them and for their farniUes. We were not tremendously critical of education as education. We wanted access to be widened. Is all that is going as cation on in the schools ideal? Is it achieving aims? Though not intensely critical one thing that was done by the Labor Government to look at values in education was estabUshment of Curriculum Development Commission. What should be the curriculum? What should be respect taught? The purpose of this Commission was to co-operate with State governments and private education authorities, to look at the nature of educational process. The Labor Government also commissioned the University to look at the value of the secondary grants that were being made to Aboriginal children and in what ways such grants could be perfected and improved for aboriginal famUies. There is a magSpeakernificent report as a consequence on this by Professor Betty Watts. Criticism has been constant, but most of the structure of educational innovation introduced by the Labor Government has been maintained by the present Government. I disagree however with some of the changes in the guidelines for the Schools Commission. I should Uke to come back to a much simpler guideline. If the Government continues telUng the Commission that it must transfer funds from here to there, itfinaUycaUs into question whether the Commission is being allowed to function. I do not think, as the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher) suggested was an alternative view to the Government's view, that we can just aUow commissions I a completely free hand. The guideUne I should Uke to see is a sum of money. We could say for if instance to a commission: 'We can appropriate $650m for you to spend. WUl you teU us the most intelUgent way to spend this?' That, I believe, is a guideline for a government dealing are with a commission. I think there is a tendency Northnow for too much intervention against the independence of the commissions. After all, I an think it is agreed that since the various Comofmissions came into being-thos e that were estabUshed by our predecessors and those estabUshed by ourselves-the y have greatly advanced education wherever they were and they therefore deserve confidence and not undermining.",54

202,Mr BRYANT,PAIR," I refer to the differential treatment as between State schools and non-State schools which I see implied in this legislation. For a definition as to which schools are disadvantaged and the decision on which schools are disadvantaged, we will rely upon the State Ministers for Education. For the definiuon of disadvantaged non-government schools the Commonwealth Minister for Education shall responsibUity determine the posiuon for himself. that that places many of the State schools at a disadvantage in comparison with non-State schools. It is not totally discriminatory in the sense in which we sometimes use the word, but the result will be that State schools will become the victims of all sorts of political points that well try to be scored by State governments such as the Queensland one. In Victoria we are pretty confident that the Victorian Government did apply the same kind of criteria as we wished to apply from the Commonwealth end. In this instance we are absolutely certain that the situKing,R.S. Lloyd. B. ation will be to the disadvantage of most Australian State schools which need Commonwealth help. MCLeay. J. E. We are looking for equality between the various forms of education in Australia. There is no Moore. J. C. Newman. K. E. doubt that one of the features of Australian education has been the inequality between States as there has been between country and city areas, between various socio-economic areas in the major cities and between Aboriginal communiSainsbury. M. E. Simon. B. D. ties and non-aboriginal communities. The only way of levelling out inequalities between States Viner. R. 1. and giving all the young people of Australia the same advantages and the same access to education is for the Commonwealth Government to Tellers: lay down the principles upon which disadvanCameron, Donald taged schools will be served. Therefore I ask the Government to give serious consideration to changing the form of definition of disadvantaged schools. That is why we wanted to speak in the first instance on the forms of definition in regards MCMahon, Les Martin. V.J. to disadvantaged schools. During the last term office of the Labor West.SJ. Willis, R. Government it was clear to those like my friend, the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins), Johnson, Les and myself who represent industrial areas of Stewart, F. E. Melbourne that the Victorian Government had no concern whatsoever for the disadvantaged schools in those electorates-the schools which comply with the requirements and the criteria set out in this legislation. Those schools have a large number of migrant children. The economic status of the parents is of a lower order than it is many other suburbs in the cities. The parents of these children are unable to support them in the same way at school and in many cases the parents are unable to apply themselves to the question of being part of the corporate body of the school life as they can in other areas. These are the schools to which the Victorian Government paid scant attention. The only we will level that out and give the equal treatment is for the Commonwealth Government to accept the same for the State schools as it does for I consider the non-State schools. I understand that the present Government is obsessed with Staterightsand therefore is loth to interfere with the power of State governments in the field of education. I consider, and I believe may my colleagues from this side of the chamber consider, that the rights of the children transcend any consideration of State rights or anything of not that order. I hope that the Committee will pay closer attention to this matter. This is a complicated piece of legislation. It has some SO-odd clauses. I hope we have made it clear to Government members and the people responsible for the management of business in this place that we consider it a serious matter that such an important piece of legislation has such debate. The general principles of education which we would have liked to have the Parliament will have to be bypassed. I hope that the Minister for Immigrauon Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar), will note my remarks and when he replies to the debate on this clause will give a clear statement of the reason for this differential between non-State and State schools. The Commonwealth Governable ment accepts a full and direct responsibUity disadvantaged non-government schools. Its whole approach to government schools is cation indirect. The Opposition feels that there should be no differential. Our duty is to all Australians, including young people, in the education equally and the objective is to create equality of access and equaUty of opportunity to a higher standard of education. I believe that clause 4 faU if the Federal Minister opts out. If a governset ment wants direct results it has to take direct sponsibility. I hope that the Minister is able answer my comments or at some stage to get effective answer from the Minister for Education (Senator Carrick) as to the reasons for clause Mr MACKellar- I will draw the honourable member's comments to the attention of the Minconsidering ister for Education.",62

205,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIR,Is put before the amendment seconded?,63
206,Dr JENKINS,PAIR," I have much and pleasure in seconding the amendment. Before dealing with the detaUs ofit I want to make a few general remarks on the Bill. This Bill is really the first brought in since the change to Tertiary Education Commission. It will be obvious to honourmembers who examine the situation that the for change to that Commission has brought substantial changes in the way grants for tertiary eduassistance are given. It seems to me that we need a better mechanism to handle the detaUs that are gone through in dealing with this type of system Bill in the Parliament. I remind honourable members that a joint will committee ofboth Houses of Uiis Parliament was up to investigate parliamentary procedures. reThe report of that committee seems to have been to buried in the last two years. Yet one of the an recommendations made m it was that there was a place for legislation committees to carry out 4. this process, rather than using the Committee of the Whole House to examine the Bill clause by clause. I would suggest, Sir, that when we are the setting up of the Tertiary Education Commission, with the combination of the three groups and we have the format of the Bill in the way it is presented, this is one of those times when honourable members of this House a should be able to make close examination of what is contained in the Bill. In his second readspeech on this Bill the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) said: Third Reading Under the Bill, the Minister will be given power to effect transfers of capital funds between sectors and between States advice from the Commission. Such transfers between sectors will be subject to consultation with the States conand, where any transfers between States are contemplated, will be made only with the agreement of those States. A number of us were having a look at that statement and arising from it we started to look for this provision in the Bill. WhUe there was general Second Reading consensus that this flexibUity in the transfer of funds was desirable, that it would lead to more use of funds in allowing the transfer, concern was expressed that Parliament, not only the States and the Minister, should be aware of way these amounts were carried over. I am sure most honourable members have not thought to subabout that aspect. In the way the Bill is laid out this provision takes somefinding.However, we were assured in examining it that that provision for Parliament to be informed of the transfer there. We think that is desirable. I turn to the matters contained in the amend the ment. Firstly it deals with insufficient funding technical education in Australia. Criticism in this area could be levelled also at the previous Adnunistration because technical and further education was the last sector to get ground. But the whole problem that is being highlighted in the community today is one of technological needs and persons to be trained this area. We find that although there is an increase in real terms for technical and further education, this really does not compensate the neglect of technical and further education the past. One thinks that perhaps some of the money that is being spent on expensive advertisbate ing campaigns for the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) with various apprenticeship schemes and so on, supreports plying employment and training for next to no one, would have been better put to more practithis cal use in these institutions. This is one area where the Government is to be greatly criticised for not accepting its responsibUity and acceleratnature ing the area of technical education for making Australia's benefit. The next criticism contained in the amendit ment is in regard to the Government's stated intention to transfer a major section of tertiary education funding to the States. There is no doubt that this will react badly to the detriment of tertiary education. We have all experienced the situation that occurred in that field prior the Labor Government accepting full responsiCinderella. bUity for tertiary education. It is a difficultfieldat anytimebecause faculties have to be provided for an increasing number of people. The tendbate. ency, in today's economy particularly, to keep the young person in education longer so that does not become an unemployment statistic is fuller debate. placing greater and greater strains on tertiary education. One looks back to the bad old days when the States funded tertiary education, admittedly through the autonomous bodies that controlled tertiary institutions. One knows of the lacks that there were in places for individuals, in variety courses and in the sort of equipment that is needed to carry out properly the teaching training in the disciplines. One can see this tion to transfer a major proportion of education funding back to the States as only a retrograde step because it has been shown in the past so many areas State Education Ministers can indulge in a lot more pork barrelling. suggested that there are problems with cenwas tralised bureaucracy, that there is disadvantage in this. But in education a great disadvantage is temptation at the parochial level of the States for to indulge in pork barrelling in funding the various institutions. At the moment there is a system Labor where there are recommendations for allocations. There is the examination of expenditure off the across the whole tertiary field. There have been great advances in tertiary in education since 1972 and it would be a shame to see a backward step taken in that area. The same criticisms that were offered to the State Grants for (Schools Assistance) Bill are offered on the in States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill. They are BUls that require much fuller deand much closer examination at the Committee stage. They have been subject to comthe mission reports and the various commission should be considered because of the criticisms they contain of the sorts of guidelines that Government has laid down-no t only the guidelines which do not allow for real growth in expenditure but which are so restrictive in their that they prevent the commissions from the true choice in the allocations of funds on needs. This was the element that we were able to introduce in our education legislation, whether was under the schools assistance legislation or the tertiary education legislation. We were able to use needs as a basis and guidelines were not so restrictive as to prevent some free choice by the commission on needs for the various aspects of education. I feel in this tertiary education field to that the technical education field is still the In return for the Government Whip not gagging me a third time for the evening I have agreed to sit down at this point in the deBut I repeat the complaint that I think Parliament is being treated with contempt in the he Government not allowing such important BUls",63
207,Mr SCHOLES,PAIR," I want to speak for two minutes about a matter which is of very serious concern and which I believe must be raised as often as possible in this Parliament. Last year the Tertiary Education Commission inof dicated in its report the disadvantage which was suffered by newer institutions because of the and freeze imposed on capital expenditures. The intenDeakin University, which is the institution I intend to mention, has a buUding program for establishing the basic facUities that a university that in needs to operate. That university has a requirement of about $17m. A grant of about It is $2m has been made to it. So the House will understand the sorts of difficulties which exist in the circumstances, I ensure point out that in the humanities-social areas of degree courses, any student wishing to study sociology, which is part of the education faculty of the university, would have to travel some 9 to 10 rniles to attend lectures because of that the education faculty is situated in the old premhonourable ises of the Geelong Teachers College, which is members wUlmember located in North Geelong, whereas the university is located in the Old Gordon Institute Waurn Ponds area. The art and design faculty is But located in a factory building in South Geelong. rather So the situation is that we have a university which does not have the basic accommodation which is desirable and which is required for institution. Being a new institution it is disadvanthe taged by the cut-backs by a far greater tude than would an established organisation at which new buildings would be additional faciliin ties. The facilities required by this institution the basic building structures m which the institufor tion can operate. I raise this matter on this occasion, as when a similar bill was before the House last year. I notice that little or nothing has been done cational in the interim. The continued freeze of capital skilled, knowledgeable, funds has been to the disadvantage and to the force, detriment of the students, and ition of the staff almost impossible because of split campus situation under which the lectures on different subjects are given at locations which are far apart. That seriously disadvantages the students, especially as there is almost no public transport available between the various sections of the university.",64
208,Mr BRYANT,PAIR," I wish to raise several points inrelationto what one might term the philosophy of it all. One of the points is related to the history and another to the adminisBecause tration. Perhaps I will deal with the history aspect first of all. I think the House has been rather unkind to honourable members on this side of the chamber in relation to this general matter. My friend, the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins), and I have taken a long term interest in education. I remind members the House that, when they come into the chamber to vote and theyfindthe same people causing the trouble, it will be because the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) is doing his duty in his inimitable way and cause we on this side are doing our duty as we it. On 6 May 1958 I, having been a member of this Parliament for two years or so, moved the following motion: The urgent need for the Commonwealth to take action to that sufficient funds are available to each State of the Commonwealth to provide adequate public education facilistudies ties for its people. In those days we were treated in a sUghtly different way, I suggest, because after I spoke to motion I was responded to on that occasion by Mr Menzies, the then Prime Minister and for Kooyong. Honourable be interested in his thoughts on in the that occasion. He had this to say: I should like to say to the honourable member that I envy the easy way in which he sets the Constitution on one side on the ground that it is out of date. I would rather have thought that even the right an honourable gentleman would now have joined forces of the ungodly and would have been magnion our side on that matter. The points I make about technical education particular are well set out in the report of the are Technical and Further Education Commission the triennium 1977-79. The few points that it makes may well be placed on therecord.At page I did xxwti of its report the Commission states: The most pressing need in the next triennium is to provide adequate opportunities to individuals to further their edudevelopment, including their capacity to become adaptable members of the labour and through this, to enhance security and job it makes the possatisfaction. the Further on the report refers to the fact that Australia clearly lags behind many other Western industralised nations in the level of skilled training of its labour force. In 1971 only half of adults in skilled blue collar occupations held appropriate trade or technician qualifications. It points out that the occupational mix of the labour force will operate to increase still further the importance of technical and further education in the development of labour force skills. of the significance of female participation for the future of the Australian labour force, there will be a growing need to come to terms with the apparent disparity between women's aspirations and the existing reaUties of the labour market. In the educational aspects of this process, the Commission sees the role of of TAFE institutions as being of major importance. I believe that some statements of particular importance are contained in this document. The report then goes on to point out what we ought to be doing in some other areas. I taught in the Vicbetorian education system for 20 years. I do not see know that I ever taught under circumstances which made teaching easy or comfortable, although I hope a good deal of that teaching was effective. I am not one who believes that all the gold plated trimmings and so on are needed in education to make teaching effective, but certainly teaching is easier and more effective if the equipment and the environment is adequate. Page 116 of the report deals with accommodauon in New South Wales. It reads: Students are at present accommodated in 290 buildings less than thirty years old, 300 buildings more than thirty years old and in 124 leased premises. It is unfortunate that over the last 30 or 40 years we have not capitalised in many areas of our education system as much as did the generation of our grandparents. I am afraid that over the last two years there has been a great fall-off in the dynamics of change in education. Some of that will occur because of nnances; a good deal of it will occur because of the internal dynamics of the system and the way in which change is encouraged. I think I should say that perience those people who have been occupied in the education industry, if one could term it such, have suffered a serious blow to their because of the insecurity that the last two years in relation to the development of curriculum research and such matters. I wish to place before the Parliament a matter concerned with administration. It is late to obtain an effective answer in this Parliament. It is concerned with clause 4 of the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill, which reads: (1) For the purposes of this Act, the Minister(a) may approve a building projectThat clause then sets out the institutions from which he may receive a submission-universities , colleges of advanced education, technical and further education institutions. I have no plaint about that. I point out to members of Parliament and to anyone else tening to the debate the actual significance of that provision if it is related to the provisions in the schools legislation. In that legislation no definition is given in relation to a building or even a school. I think I am correct in saying that. ever, such a definition is given institutions. I think that is of great advantage to the tertiary education institutions when the Commonwealth says: 'You can have $20,000 for this purpose or $ 1.35m for that building somewhere else'. If an application for funds is sent off to the Victorian Education Department which does not specify the Brunswick Technical College or a building project at the Moreland High School, or in it is not specified that the funds are for the pose offixingup the Fitzroy Primary School, those works will not be earned out. I think we have to instil in the States the same sense of direction, if one likes to call it that, the same sense of constitutional challenge in relation to primary and secondary education as we have been doing in relation to tertiary education for nigh on 20 years. I hope the House will take note of those points. I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) to put those points in his diary so that his colleague, the Minister for Education (Senator Carrick), can look at them. We willfixthe situation ourselves immediately after 10 December. Amendment negatived. Original quesuon resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would Uke to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general dereduced bate covering this Bill, the StabUization Export Duty Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Apple and Pear StabUization Export Duty Collection Amendment Bill (No. 2) as they are related measures. Separate questions will, course, be put on each of the BUls at the conwere clusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, Mr takenso Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject was a short matter of the three BUls to be discussed in this the early 1960s debate.",66
210,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,APPLE AND PEAR STABILIZATION,"Is it time the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the three measures? There being objection, I will allow that course to be foUowed.",67
211,Mr SCHOLES,APPLE AND PEAR STABILIZATION,"The Apple and them Pear StabUization Amendment Bill (No. 2) extends for a period of two years the guaranteed payment provisions under the Apple and Pear was involved StabUisation Act. The Minister for Primary pulling Industry (Mr Sinclair), in his second reading have speech, indicated that he beUeves that this will give stabUity to the industry, also that it will some guarantees to the industry which will able it to become viable. It will in fact provide what could be termed a base price for exports of apples and pears at risk. During debate on an earUer Bill this year the Opposition moved amendment to alter the underwriting price from $2 to $3 per box of apples, and from 80c to $ per box of pears, on the same limited export quantities. Our intention is to move the same amendment on this occasion because, as was contended then, the Opposition beUeves that the period since the present price was fixed costs and the efforts of the industry have such that it is not unreasonable to suggest that the prices which I have mentioned should now be written into the Act. This is the second time that a price has been fixed in legislation. prices will cover a two-year period. I point out that the Minister, in earUer this year, indicated that the Government was looking at additional means of assistance to the industry. The Minister, in his second reading Bill speech on this Bill, indicated that the Government was conferring with the States on a supplementary assistance program for 1978 which could involve an additional Sim to assist apple exports to Europe, including the United Kingdom. The amount involved if the amendI ment were carried very closely approximates the amount mentioned in the Minister's speech. feel that the industry would be better served an increase in the support or guaranteed price. is, I think, true to say that the industry, through its own efforts and through encouragement, has its number of trees to levels which are I Apple and Pear think manageable. I was a Uttle concerned sometimeago when I heard the chairman of the marketing board of Tasmania suggest that it was nowtimeto start of replanting trees because the market prospects as good. I hope that would not be underit would constitute what I would think sighted policy, as was the poticy in when people in Victoria and elsewhere were encouraged to plant pear trees at a when it was fairly obvious to most people that Britain would ultimately be going into the no European Economic Community. The result was that many growers who took the advice given to by the present Leader of the National Country Party and other members opposite suffered very heavy losses, and the Government in extremely heavy expenditure in out trees which had been planted as a result of that earUer advice. Those trees did not any economic effect on the industry. give This industry is vital to a number of areas. I enremember a few years ago accompanying the former member for Bendigo to the Harcourt area to discuss with the growers and the co-operatives in that area the problems of the apple and pear an industry, especially the problems which had come about because of the changes in marketing 1.20and storage methods which had rendered unsuitable as far as markets were concerned a number of varieties which had been very profitable and very suitable to that area. I think that to some in extent it was to the disadvantage of the conthe sumer. Some apples have ceased to be avaUable been on the market because theripeningperiod of other apples can be extended, and these fresh apples, whether they arrive early or late on the market, are always preferred. I do not intend to The delay the House much longer. I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to subhis speech stituting the following words: 'the House is of the opinion that the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted with a view to bringing forward a which (a) increases the rate of stabilisation payments to $3 per box of apples and $ 1.20 per box of pears and /or (b) provides supplementary assistance measures to facilitate adjustments in the fruit growing industry and to provide assistance directly to individual fruit growers until such times as a coherent planned policy, by which the Australian fruit growing industry can prosper, is determined'. make one other pomt. Because of the short period oftimeleft for this Parliament, the OppoWe sition would give a clear undertaking to the by Government that if the amendment were acIt cepted we would facUitate the passage of the subsequent legislation through the Parliament without any delay or adjournment.",67
212,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,APPLE AND PEAR STABILIZATION,Is the amendment seconded?,68
213,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,APPLE AND PEAR STABILIZATION,I second the amendment.,68
214,Mr GOODLUCK,APPLE AND PEAR STABILIZATION," I am very pleased to speak in this debate. After sultation with the industry in Tasmania my colleagues and I support the Government. should like to read a telegram from the newly appointed executive director of the State marketing authority, Mr Windas Smith, who simply out the requirements of the Tasmanian apple industry. Of course that industry is comparable with the industry in other States. The telegram reads: Restabilisation. Current maximum suppon of $2 per bushel for apples is appropriate but would be more if applied to all overseas markets especially developing kets with long term potential. Also important that ation and other suppon measures be established on manent basis. Fruit growing is long term project and renewed annual promises of support do not engender sufficient producer confidence. Because stabilisation on Australia wide average of market returns the grower receives below average return can be seriously disadvanalise taged. The best way to overcome Commonwealth contribution to supplementary support scheme say $3 for each $ 1 from State sources. Mr Burr-Hear , hear! But the State Government will not support that.",68
215,Mr GOODLUCK,APPLE AND PEAR STABILIZATION,"That is right. Windas Smith has simply set out the requirements of industry. To the best of my ability I have promoted the apple industry, as have my unfortunately colleagues from Tasmania and also my make colleagues from other States. I believe the induschardists try now has a future. Tasmanians should be aware of the vital contribution of the industry the economy of Tasmania. Those in the industry constitute 2 per cent of the total population contribute 11 per cent of the gross value of Tasthat manian agricultural production. One-third of the apples grown in Australia are produced in mania. Tasmania supplies two-thirds of the total Australian export trade. So when we talk of mania we talk of the apple industry. The most imponant single form of assistance cent, given is through the apple and pear stabilisation base rate scheme. The scheme is the incentive to the in 1969 was growers of Tasmania and Australia to stay on ticipated rateapproximately their farms. One is horrified to think what the economic situation would be in Tasmania without the apple industry. It generates so much income through shops, transportation, labour, equipment sales, domestic sales, et cetera. The main concern of the Government in continuing the scheme is to reduce the economic and social disruption at a time of declining profitabiUty in the industry. I make no excuse for the fact that it saddens me, and it also saddens every sincere Tasmanian and of course my Tasmanian colleagues-the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom), the honourable member for WUmot (Mr Bun), the honourable member for conDenison (Mr Hodgman) and the honourable member for Bass (Mr Newman)-to see the conI tinual reduction in production.",68
216,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,APPLE AND PEAR STABILIZATION,"Where are they? sets Mr GOODLUCK-They are Ustening. Of course I must mention the Tasmanian senators also. We are saddened by the desperate decision to reduce the number of apple trees in Tasmania by 40 per cent. Between October 1973, when the scheme was introduced, and October 1976 over effecuve 40 per cent of the total tree area was removed. marAdmittedly some of the trees were old. Orchardstabilisists have come forward with a completely a perefficient way of producing apples, but unfortunately they have been let down by what happens operates after the apples leave the packing shed. Trees who have been pulled out, and all of a sudden we rethat we have quaUty apples; but we cannot this problem is to increase supply the world market, and that is absolutely extraordinary when there is a shortage of fresh fruit in Australia and in the world today. Mr Groom-Yes .",68
217,Mr GOODLUCK,APPLE AND PEAR STABILIZATION,"Of course the honourable that member for Braddon agrees with me. Orchardists have answered the call for efficiency, but high transport and freight costs every season a nightmare for them. Orneed support to enable them to compete favourably with Argentina, South Africa to and New Zealand. Exports of Australian applies have fallen sharply from a peak of 150,000 and tonnes in 1971 to 88,000 tonnes in 1975.1 think is indicative of the unfortunate effect of the tree pull scheme. Increases in ocean freight costs Tashave added greatly to the costs of marketing Australian apples overseas. Between 1971 and Tas1975 the average yearly rate of increase in freight costs to the United Kingdom was 16.4 per level which is substantially above the average of inflation in Australia in those years. The for apples sent to the United Kingdom $1.70 a case. The anfor 1978 is nearly $6. Since 1971 Australian production costs and international marketing costs have increased more rapidly than they did during the previous decade. In particular, the cost of labour has risen more rapidly than the cost of most other production inputs, and for that reason fruit growers have been more disadvantaged because of the increases in their costs of production than have most other Australian exporters. Export freight costs have also risen more rapidly than the of most other marketing services. Freight costs thus are high as a proportion of returns for apples and pears sold in Europe. Those costs currently about 60 per cent of the return on apples. The growers have been aware of the tiplicity of problems that have beset them and their industry. Last season a concerted effort made to restructure the industry. Tasmania is very small place, but fortunately we have some very good editors who writeMr Groom-We have some good members too.",68
218,Mr GOODLUCK,APPLE AND PEAR STABILIZATION,"Of course we have some the future they very good members too. We have editors who Tasmanian write editorials that hit the nail right on the head. sition I think the honourable member the honourable member for Wilmot will agree believe in the in support; with me that on 17 October the editor of the industry should be allowed Mercury hit the nailrighton the head with his ground. They are probably using very appropriate editorial. I will just pinpoint a political gimmick to try to impress some of the points that he made. The apple industry has been greatly assisted by the restrucrequired; the growers do not need it. It is notis of turing and the formation of a single marketing authority that has cut out some problems that have beset that industry for 40 years. The torial states: One of the biggest Tasmanian tragedies of recent has been the demise of the State's fruit industry. grubbed out orchards in the hean of 'apple country' bear mute testimony to the passing of an era. There have been innumerable inquiries to try to establish the reasons for the decline of the suggest methods of bolstering it. They range from the tently pessimistic, which suggests it would be wiser growers benefits to quit the industry rather than to to prop it up, to the far more marketing and higher quality control could ensure vival of the industry. Some reports had a common theme-that if the industry was to remain viable, it would need a concerted effort everyone associated with it-growers , exporters, and ments. Several experts stressed that the industry fragmented and that the days of growers doing their thing must be sacrificed for the collective benefit of the industry and all those engaged in it. It seemed generally agreed that a new marketing setup would be vital to co-ordinate and promote sales. It also would need to re-establish confidence among European importers, some of whom were caustically critical the poor quality apples that had somehow been shipped from Tasmania. And last season, reports from the UK and the Continent indicated that under the new interim marketing setup Tasmania was once again reaping the benefits from high quaUty fruit bringing premium prices. But the supposition that all was again well with the industry was shattered when some growers expressed dissatisfaction with the executive director of the marketing authority . . . Fortunately that problem has been overcome. Last season, even though the crop was down to 1.2 million cases, it was a good season. It was cost brought about by a co-operative, by everybody working together, by improvement in quality control and a demand for Tasmania apples in the are United Kingdom and Australia. Fortunately, with the freight equalisation plan, we were able multo bring apples to the mainland of Australia. Also the United Kingdom had a very dry season was and our apples were in demand. If we are to cona tinue to consider Tasmania as being the apple isle, we will have to make absolutely certain that we protect its markets. This year growers do not need the additional support price; they have indicated that. But if in do need this support, I think all members wouldriseto the occasion and would agree with members of the Oppowho, if I may say so, are acting a little bit for Braddon and hypocritically this situation. They do not really they believe that the to run into the the situation as the growers of Tasmama. As I said this year the support not much use giving the growers the money if they cannot use it. Of course I support the Governediment, and all other members from Tasmama support the Government. We will have a good years season again. We, as Tasmanians, can feel proud Scores of that the growers in TasmaniaMr Groom-We stick together.",69
219,Mr GOODLUCK,APPLE AND PEAR STABILIZATION,"That isright.As I was sayfruit export industry and to persising, we as Tasmanians, can feel proud that the to pay growers in Tasmania have been able to come continue together and make a good industry once again. optimistic that insisted better the surThat is indicative of all Tasmanians. We have an apple industry again and we can proudly say that Tasmania is the apple isle. We do not need these from political gimmicks. We do not need an additional governamount by way of support this year. We will be had become able to stand on our own feet and say in the own future that if the growers need money we will support them. (Quorum formed).

I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of both BUls to be discussed in this",69
220,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate (No. 2) 1977 covering both measures? Second Reading Mr Crean- Mr Deputy Speaker, before that is put can I have some assurance that Order of the Day No. 7 will not come on for debate tonight? I refer to the Australian Rural Bank Bill. I can understand that Orders of the Day Nos 8 and 9 are to be discussed but surely the House ought to know whether this most important Bill-certai n people think that it is significant, but I do not-to establish a new rural bank will be brought on for debate tonight? At least the Government should come clean about it. I ask that question with great respect to my friend the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) who I think shows decency in relation to parliamentary procedure. It is nearly 10 p.m. Does the Government intend to push through these two measures-the Brigalow Lands Agreement Amendment Bill and the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Bill-and then at a late hour tonight to come back to Order of the Day No. 7, the Australian Rural Bank Bill? I would have thought that this measure was important enough to receive some deliberation tomorrow. I would like some assurance that the Government does not intend to rush it through tonight.",70
221,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,Order! I think the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has made the point that he wanted to make. This matter is in the hands of the Government. The motion to which the House agreed was that the debate on the Bill be postponed until a later hour. Mr Crean- A later hour. How late?,71
222,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,"That is a matter for the Government to decide. Mr Fife-It is the intention of the Government to bring this very important measure forward this evening. As I understand it, that has already been indicated to the Opposition. The reason for postponing the measure at this point is that we are waiting for the Minister for Primary Industry and Leader of the House to return from a commitment in Sydney. He will be here later this evening and it is our intention to proceed. Mr Crean- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ",71
223,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,"Order! The subject matter before the House at the moment is the suggestion that the Brigalow Lands Agreement Amendment Bill be debated cognately with the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Bill. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports received the indulgence of the Chair to make a comment and to ask a question, which was answered by the Minister. At this point I am afraid that he is transgressing the business orders of the House. We should proceed to the question whether it is the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the subject matter of both Bills. Mr Crean-Agai n I seek the indulgence of the House.

He is taking up the time of the House. The question has been answered by the Minister and I suggest that we proceed with the business before the Chair. Mr Crean- Mr Deputy Speaker, if I may say so, with all respect, I do not want to move dissent from your suggestion but all I am saying is that consideration of a very fundamental measureOrder of the Day No. 7, the Australian Rural Bank Bill-ha s been deferred. Let me say to my friend at the table, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, whom I respect and who I think respects me, that if the Government is going to rush business through in this way it is on the Government's head. If I may say so to you, Sir, you know what that means. We are to debate Orders of the Day Nos 8 and 9. How long are we to sit tonight?",71
225,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,Order! The honourable member for Melbourne Ports sought the indulgence of the House to raise a matter. He has mentioned it. I think that the Chair has been very tolerant with him. The House agreed to the motion to postpone Order of the Day No. 7. The proposal before the House now is that the Bills be debated cognately. I think it would be wise if we proceeded with that. I ask again: Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering both measures? Mr Crean- I want to know why you want to defer Order of the Day No. 7.,71
226,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,Order of the Day No. 7 has been deferred. The motion has been agreed to by the House. We have proceeded to Orders Nos 8 and 9. Mr Armitage-Are you going to deal with it tonight? Mr Fife-Yes.,71
227,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,Order! The honourable member for Chifley will remain silent. Mr Armitage-It is common sense. That is all he is asking.,71
228,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,I suggest that the honourable member for Chifley exercises common sense. Mr Armitage- I have been exercising it. I have been here for a long time.,71
229,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,Order! The House has agreed to the motion that Order of the Day sensible. No. 7 be deferred until a later hour. The now before the House is that the Brigalow Lands Agreement Amendment Bill and the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Bill be debated cognately. Mr Armitage-So you are still going to rush the Bill through.,72
230,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,"Order! The honourable member for Chifley will not continue to interject and interrupt on this matter. The suggestion by the Minister for Business and Cononly sumer Affairs (Mr Fife) that the Bills be debated cognately is the only matter before the House the moment. Mr Crean- I want to speak to the proposal debate the Bills cognately. Surely debating the Bills cognately means shortening the process. I am asking is why you are shortening the processes. Surely we are entitled to know. I hope that my friends will take two or three hours bate Orders Nos 8 and 9. If they do, when will get back to Order of the Day No. 7?",72
231,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,I suggest that the September. honourable member has been a member of the House long enough to know that that has no relevance to the proposal before the House. Mr Armitage- I raise a point of order,72

233,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,"The honourable The member for Chifley will remain silent. I suggest to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that whatevertimethe House gets back to the other legislation has no relevance to the matter now before the House. Anything the House has decided previously has not relevance to the legisble lation to which the honourable member refers. suggest to the honourable member bourne Ports that the deferral of Order of the Day No. 7 until a later hour this day has no face relevance to the proposal to discuss the two problems measures cognately. Mr Crean- Mr Deputy Speaker, with all that respect, I believe that the matter before the House is whether we shall have a cognate bate. If you want to argue that we should have a cognate debate, we can take a lot of time about it. I think that to have a cognate debate respect of Orders of the Day Nos 8 and 9 is proposal Mr Bourchier-What is this all about? Mr Crean-Surely people in this Parliament have some respect for sensible ordering of businessMr Armitage-And the institution. Mr Crean-And the institution ofParliament.",72
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,"I suggest that if the House does not agree to a cognate debate, the Bills should be discussed separately. That is the matter before the House. If it is not the wish of the House to have a cognate debate, to have a at general debate covering both measures, the House will proceed to discuss both measures separately. Is it the wish of the House to have a to general debate covering both measures?",72
235,Mr SCHOLES,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,"I presume All that the Bill before the House is the Brigalow Lands Agreement Amendment Bill. It is one of two pieces of legislation before the House arising to defrom the statement by the Minister for Primary we Industry (Mr Sinclair) on additional assistance to the beef industry made in this House on 22 The Bill itself authorises the deferment of payments under the brigalow agreement for a penod of 12 months from July 1977 to July 1978 without penalty to the persons who are required to make the payments and also without penalty to the Queensland Government. The in fact, legalises the agreement between the The Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government to assist that section of the beef industry in the brigalow area which is in conditions difficulties because of the poor market and the lack of cashflowavailable to persons involved in beef production in that area. whole crux of this Bill and the related measure, which the House will debate at a later stage, is to provide some cashflowassistance. Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence I will refer to the other measure briefly because the two Bills are so intenelated it is almost impossinot to debate them, as I would have hoped I we would have been able to resume debate on for Melthe ministerial statement. These two pieces of legislation scratch the surand little more in solving the long terms of the beef industry. Recently we had an indication from the Japanese Government an additional 10,000 tonnes of beef will be received by Japan this year. That is a breakdethrough but honourable members will have not noted in the Press in recent days that the Japanese Government has indicated also that it in isreducingthe domestic price for beef-which , I think, is not before time. It may well increase Japanese consumption. Inputs into the industry by the bureacracy-in this case the private bureaucracy within Japan-brin g the product, which I think would sell in greater quantities but for the exorbitant price, to Japanese consumers at a price in excess of $6 per kilogram. The price received under existing agreements for Australian sales of beef in Japan is considerable than $2 a kilogram, the differential being made up of moneys which are taken out of the beef industry by the Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation, an organisation which controls the imports, the marketing and the retail sale outlets of beef within Japan. Today we became aware of an alarming announcement by the United States of America that there is a suggestion that the American imports will be varied on a year to year basis. For the Australian beef grower, this is a very serious suggestion because the United States constitutes the major and best Australian market. Australian beef does not constitute a serious threat within that market, representating a very small proportion, a complementary proportion, of the American market. The American Secretary of Agriculture has suggested that a cyclical import arrangement may be introduced whereby imports would be at a higher level in some years than in others. This would destroy almost totally any hope of rationalising the beef industry within Australia and any hope of bringing about the sorts of market reforms and export market stabihty which are important if the industry is to be returned to a viable state. I think it is important also to point out that the problems which confront the beef industry are long term problems which are concerned with not only terms of trade but also the weakness in the market place of the beef producer. He is extraordinary weak, as are most primary producers in the market place. Until recent years he has tended to resist, to his own detriment, change in methods of marketing his products or means by which his products come to the market place. Very largely he has been a conformist with auction system and has allowed himself to be manipulated by persons better organised and more commercial in the market place. The industry's Japanese operation of our exports, for instance, is a perfect example. We send more than one selves bidder into the Japanese market place to sell beef to a single buyer with the result that we up with the lowest possible price, not the best price for our export product, which disadvantindustry ages the grower but not the meat companies which are selling in the market because their bidding in the auction system is arranged so that their share of the price is taken out and the grower gets the thin end of the stick. It is as simple as that and that is the basic problem through the whole of the industry. There obviously are problems in other areas less where assistance could be rendered. This Bill merely attempts to remove a disability from one section of the beef industry which has been extremely hard hit. In some areas of the industry it has been suggested that this type of agreement should be more uniformly spread among and passed on to other growers who have not dissimilar problems, but at the moment I suggest that the House ought to be considering-it should have done so much earlier-arrangement s by which the industry can have a type of stabihty and the grower can be given undertakings or have market arrangements established which will enable him to receive a reasonable price for his product. One does not sell any product other than primary products in Australia to the bidder, quite often a single bidder, for the price the purchaser wishes to pay. If l may just use a parallel, a person does not go to General-Motors or to the Ford Motor Company and bid for a motor car because they do not wheel them out the gate and say: 'What will you give us for them'. They tell you how much you will pay. But the cattle grower and most other primary producers do in fact take their products to the market place and say to the buyer: 'How much will you give me for it?' They accept, and are forced to accept, whatever price is offered. There is some movement in the area of beef classification. It is slow and it has taken the Government a long time to agree to underwrite such a scheme when it is accepted. The pressure coming from the industry itself is most likely the greatest that has been experienced in any primary industry. I suggest that it is pressure which ultimately will bring about a far stronger primary industry in Australia. I do not believe that those who go quietly or tend to feel that it is nasty or not proper to put their documented and the proper cases before governments, and to go public if necessary, in order to have their industry problems dealt with seriously on the basis of the real needs and the real needs of those who are participating in that industry, do themany service. It is important that the spokesmen for the industry put their case firmly and end without favour. For too long political considerations often have overridden the needs of an and the case has been put not on the basis of the needs of the industry but quite often on the basis of industry politics, organisational politics or just straight out party politics. I think that has now passed. We are going through a phase of change in primary industry organisations which ultimately will be to the good of the whole of primary industry. I believe the other thing which is to good of primary industry itself is that the ducers are corning to the view in most industries that it is necessary for them to have marketing arrangements which will enable them to sell their products from the strongest possible position. If I may refer to other sections of the beef industry statement which was made by the Miningly ister for Primary Industry which is the derivative of the legislation we have before us and therefore very relevant to that piece of legislation, the ister announced a scheme under which $10 a head up to 200 head could be made available to beef growers for various processes which could be undertaken by them. Among the processes are spaying, drenching and other control measures including measures associated with the brucellosis eradication campaign, area in which the Government ought to have some concern. It would seem to me that the gram of eradication very likely will not be completed at the due date and if this happens could have an effect on overseas markets well especially in the United States and in Europe. There are serious problems arising from the shortage of funds within the industry whereby control measures are unable to be implemented. I am certain that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife), who is sitting at the table, will realise there are problems between State of New South Wales and the toria because programs are progressing at different rates and according tables which, if they are not altered very soon, more of this type will result in almost having to create a sea of unless there is a substantial where the River Murray is in order to protect proach to marketing, a speeding those areas in which brucellosis has been fications scheme and an approach eradicated from those areas in which the prowhereby gram is not as well advanced. There is another problem which certainly affects New South Wales and which, I think, affects other States. This could be the subject the not too distant future of industrial problems within the industry if it is not solved at a political level, and that is the workers compensation side of the brucellosis eradication campaign as ate regards infection and the problems associated with abattoirs involved in the program. I think some action by the Federal Government is necessary in this area in order to make sure firstlywhat that those abattoirs which are properly equipped and are able to deal with infected animals are utilised without disability to the grower or to persons working within the industry. Also the anomalous problems within the workers compensation legislation and the problems that are being aggravated because insurance companies are the forced to protect their interests in the area of proworkers compensation should be ironed out. I understand that discussions are taking place on this between the States and the people within the industry, but it does constitute a threat which I think is understandable. The disease is communicable to human beings. There is at least evidence that the disease has been caught unknowby human beings. There also is evidence to suggest that it is extremely difficult to establish that the disease has been caught in the work Minplace and this involves a serious problem of workers' compensation. I raise that matter because all the assistance in the world and all the goodwill in the world will not solve the problems of the industry unless the smaller problems of those who work in the industry are looked at. This particular problem could have serious which is an repercussions. proTonight I will not mention the need for the animal health laboratory, which is currently deit ferred. I merely point out that the industry may suffer very serious losses if the Government continues to defer that project indefinitely. It is very an insurance project and it is a long term insurance project because its completion will take eight years. We are running on luck at the moment, or hope, in that area and we must hope that we have eight years plus to allow for whathis ever delays are placed in the way of the comState ofVicpletion of that project. to different timeweFinally, may I think the House should realise that well in the future have considerably of legislation before the House change in the apup of the classito the industry not only do the processors get their share but the employees in the abattoirs and other processing works get their share and the growers get their share. In the United States at in the moment the grower receives something like 56 per cent of the retail price. In Australia it is below 35 per cent and in many cases far lower than that. The industry cannot continue to operunless the grower's share of the price in the market place is comparable with his costs in placing his product in the market place. The product should be sold on that basis. I repeat I said before: People cannot go to the Ford or to General Motors and say: 'We will give you $2,000 for a car'. The companies would laugh and say that it costs $7,000 or $10,000 or whatto ever it is and that if the people car they do not have to buy it. That sort of thing cannot quite be done with cattle, but plenty of perishable products are sold in the market place on the same basis. It should be possible and is possible to devise marketing methods which will guarantee the grower a pnce which is comparable with what he is entitled to expect from market place. We are not good sellers. I suggest that we are poor sellers in the expon areas because there is tions no reason that the exporting companies need to . portion obtain a better price. The situation in Japan in other areas where exporters compete against one another for contracts on the basis of who can bid the lowest is not in the best interests of the industry. The Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation should be in the market place seeking the best possible price. I am extremely concerned at statements made by the newly appointed chairman of that organisation that will not operate differently from the old tralian Meat Board, the reason the legislation the Corporation was put through this Parliaand ment, the reason it was sought by the industry and the reason it should be acceptable to the industry is that it was expected to operate differently. It expected to play a more vigorous and a more active role in the market place and the industry. If it is, as the new chairman has said, not to be different from the Australian Meat Board the value of the organisation is nil. I certain that the industry itself is not prepared to accept that situation. I can inform the House that the Opposition would expect the Corporation to act in the manner in which this Parliament and the industry expects it to act and not in the which the old Meat Board acted. The legislation was passed for specific reasons. If the chairman not prepared to carry out the provisions of the legislation actively I think the industry is entitled to demand that a person be appointed to that position who will. The Opposition does not oppose subsequent legislation which will come before the bosiness of thegoHouse the House. It merely points out that this legisParliament is dissolved. Those lation is at best a patching operation and at an operation which will provide little relief and, being able to speak to the Bill. However, Iatwill in the case of the Beef Industry (Incentive Paycomment ments) Bill, possibly nnanciai administrative sed in relation nightmares for those people who become involved in seeking assistance under it. It is legislation which is aimed to assist. For that reason the Opposition does not oppose the Bill but points out that far more substantial areas government activity are required if there are not be many more such Bills to prop up sections of do not want the the industry.

NA AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Second Reading Debate resumed.,75
237,Mr CORBETT,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,"The it Brigalow Lands Agreement Amendment Bill Ausamends the Brigalow Lands Agreement Act of for 1962. That Act was amended previously in 1965 1967. This Bill deals with problems being endured by people who are in the area covered by the Brigalow Lands Agreement Act. I recognise, as do most people who understand the problems of beef producers today, that there are in people outside the area concerned who also need assistance. Nevertheless, this is one of the areas of great difficulty. It is an area where there has am been probably as great a financial problem as any other area in the beef industry. Since this Bill has been brought into help those people I think that we can look at the expansion of the scheme to areas which are possibly almost as much enway in titled to relief as are those people. Because of lack oftimewe cannot have as is many speakers as I am sure would like to speak to the Bill. I know that the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Carige) were anxious to speak but cannot do so because of the this Bill or the time. Weofcannot limitation time.There has to be a limitation of on forever. We have to get through before the two members worse have expressed to me their disappointment not on some of the views that they expresto it. Under the Brigalow Lands Agreement Act Queensland is required to repay loans and interest made to the State by the Commonwealth of for the purchase and development of brigalow lands. The scheme was warmly welcomed by State Government when it wasfirstintroduced. At that time it seemed that it would be a developother ment scheme which would have tremendous value to the State and would be viable and eficial to those people participating in it. no fault of the people engaged in it that it did proceed as expected and provide a satisfactory development scheme. The difficulties that the people are experiencing in the area are beyond their control. Brigalow land is a highly productive type land. A lot of the land is used for the production of agricultural crops. The brigalow land in the area where the scheme applies is confined largely to the production of beef. Because of the disasthis trously low export prices continuing over some period of time, these people are in grave finanproposal cial difficulties. The export price of beef so the domestic price. These people are now proover ducing at well below the cost of production. cannot go on just doing that. The settlers been placed in an impossible position in endeavouring to meet their commitments and to carry on. The difficulties that they have very great. They have certainly done their best. We must give credit to them for the courage and determination with which they have faced problems. They have endeavoured to try to meet their commitments. But the Government now, this realising this position, has agreed to extend consideration which is outlined in this Bill. people concerned certainly deserve what is being done for them. Under the Bill the Commonwealth Governto ment is willing to grant concessions to the State Government m respect of repayments to the Commonwealth by the State, but it does require that similar concessions be made by the State the settlers in the brigalow areas. I am sure that the State is only too anxious to do so and will operate fully with the Commonwealth in that regard. The Commonwealth and the prepared Queensland governments are anxious to assist the brigalow settlers under this obvious that the Commonwealth has made concessions to assist these settlers. The State Government welcomes it in helping it to provide assistance to the settlers through the concessions that are being granted to the State. There is no doubt that there will be no problem between the governments on that aspect. There will be a operative effort. It is, however, proposed that a 12-month moratorium on repayments to the States will accepted by the Commonwealth. The sible repayments of principal will be deferred and it the spread over the following years. This is a measure which has been successfully applied in areas. I remember the Agricultural Bank in Queensland, of its own volition, adopting that bensort of procedure. Loans were made available It was over a 20-year period. Borrowers striking not difficulttimesappealed to the Agricultural Bank which decided whether to fund the outstanding payments over the period of the loan. It decided that it would fund outstanding payments over the period of the loans. I was in an area where of this applied and all the people I knew who were affected fulfilled their commitments. When one is dealing with primary industries and the vagaries, the difficulties and the unreliability of markets is certainly a proposal or an idea that should be considered and applied. I believe that this incorporating that idea is a very good affects one. Interest which would normally be payable the period will be waived. One aspect of this They concession is that it is being provided by the have Commonwealth for one year on the condition that the State Government agrees to extend a similar concession to the settlers, according to faced are need, for an average two-year period. There may be some comment- I have heard some comment-that the State feels that perhaps their the Commonwealth might provide sufficient funds to cover that two-year period and not have requirement. That is one of the matters that I the have heard debated. But that is how the present The situation stands. What we are most concerned about is that the brigalow settlers should get the concessions and relief that they are justly entitled receive. The period over which the payments are made at present is 20 years but the Government has quite generously, I contend, agreed to extend this period to 27 years in relation to the to State's commitment to the Commonwealth and once again providing that the State apply similar corelief measures to the settlers concerned. I have no doubt at all that the State Government will be to meet that requirement, but when one is dealing in a business way these things have scheme. It is quite to be stated. I am hopeful that this concession will enable the brigalow settlers to. carry on their work in developing the brigalow area and enable them to keep in business until, hopefully, the market price of cattle rises to enable them to show a profitable operation. I concede that one of the things cothat confronts this Government is to do everything in its power to assist in whatever way it can to enable those prices torise.The Australian be Meat and Live-stock Corporation has a responjob on its hands. I am not going to condemn at this stage, as it has already been condemned, before it has an opportunity to prove what it able to achieve. It is a new organisation. I think we should give it an opportunity. I have no doubt that avenues are available whereby the supplychance. demand situation can be improved. We must look for more markets. We must develop the the ones we have. As has been stated, the Japanese market has been expanded to take another 10,000 tonnes of Australian beef. Provided we can do that and at the sametimekeep our proreceive. duction to a level so that we can reasonably expect to get profitable prices for our beef, that is the soundest of all bases for the continuing perity of the beef industry. The people who have been working in this industry have suffered greatly. Those of us have watched this problem and have been conimmediatefinancialretief cerned with it have a great deal of satisfaction seeing that these people are at least going to this degree of assistance. If further concessions are needed they will be a matter for considerdebated ation in future and I believe they will be, and cerhope tainly should be, sympathetically considered by this Government. The relief granted by way of moratorium on both principle and interest will be a significant measure to give assistance those in that area. That is what present. There is no doubt that the people there have suffered a great deal. They are poverty stricken in many instances through no fault of their own. The States of Queensland has had to bear its share of responsibility to ensure the age two years' moratorium that I have menthis tioned for those in need in the brigalow. Area of that scheme is mainly situated within the eral division of Dawson. It is for that reason I mentioned that the federal member for Dawinducement son was so concerned about the matter and was anxious to be able to put the case for his constitutions ents when this Bill was debated. Mr Martin-He is not here.",75
238,Mr CORBETT,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,He is a very good member. He would not be able to speak on this Bill if were here because of the time Umitation. I have already mentioned that and I think it is unfair to condemn him for that. Mr Martin- I am not condemning him.,77
239,Mr CORBETT,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,"The honourable member is condemning him. If he were here he would not be able to speak because of the time factor. have mentioned that a couple oftimes.However, while buUding up the properties and enocuragation ing the bouyancy of the beef market we have to remember that these breeding herds were Payments) acquired at high prices when these people were starting. They had that difficulty. They went in that is when the prices were high, when the industry was thriving. This factor is on top of the problems that they struck later. So they really had no The Government must remember that. These people are exceUent settlers. They deserve consideration that they are being given. Until prices get back to a more profitable level the Government will have to continue to give them the consideration that they are justly entitled to With other commitments the loans that they proshave received have increased through high interest rates, and without the relief currently being offered by the moratorium the financial burden that these people have to carry would be who impossible to bear. The moratorium will bring from some of the loan in redemptions. Coupled with the $2,000 grant proget gram which is contained in the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Bill, which is being cognately with this Bill, these things we will be sufficient for these pioneer settlers to ride this trough and get over this two-year relief a period when there will be a return to higher market prices and hopefully full viabUity. It is the to desire and the duty of this Government to see we are doing at that this is achieved. It should also be appreciated that the Commonwealth has assisted with a cash flow to those settlers with children with the alteration of famaverily aUowances. But that is outside the scope of Bill. However, it indicates that the Govern3 ment is deeply concerned with the problems that fedthese people face. The package for beef may not that be the complete answer but it will be an for the States also to co-operate and be an encouragement to private lending instituand to the settlers and beef producers themselves to assist towards afinalrecovery which I believe will come. Those people who are trying to forecast beef prices for the future have a hopeful outlook. But the people who are in severe he financial difficulties now cannot wait for that time. Their interest payments are accruing at such a rate that unless they get this type of assistance they will not be able to see this time through. Therefore, it is vitally necessary that we should give it to them. We need the short term assistance to bridge the gap until some other longer range program on beef classification and I a marketing scheme are given afirmerbasis to guarantee a stable market price. That is the situat which we have arnved at present. I want briefly to touch on the Beef Industry (Incentive Bill. I have mentioned the Australian Beef and Live-stock Corporation, the problems Mr Martin- Mr Deputy Speaker, could I seek your indulgence because I am rather confused in view of the eventsMr Fisher-Is this a point of order? Mr Martin-It is a point of order. I am not normally confused by the happenings in this House but on this occasion I am confused and I seek a ruling from you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Bourchier-Jus t a minute. He is still speaking. Mr Martin- I am raising a point of order.",77
240,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,"The honourable member will raise his point of order and raise it quickly. Mr Martin-And I will not be bustled by the honourable member for Bendigo. My point of order is this, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I seek your guidance on it: I am somewhat confused as to which Bill we are discussing. As I understand it, leave was not granted to have a cognate debate. Mr Fisher-You should have been here earlier. Mr Martin- I was in here the whole time.",78
241,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,"In regard to the point of order raised by the honourable member for Banks, there is no leave. It was a matter of suggestion to the House. When the honourable member for Melbourne Ports discussed other matters I said that if the House did not want to consider the Bills in a cognate debate they could be debated separately. I again put the question: Is it the wish of the House to have a cognate debate on the subject matter of both Bills? At that point of time there was no objection. I called the honourable member for Corio on the understanding that this was a cognate debate before the House.",78
242,Mr CORBETT,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,"The Bills are interlocking because the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Bill affects the viability of the beef producers under the Brigalow Lands Agreement Amendment Bill. It is only common sense that the Bills should have been debated cognately, and I am grateful that permission to do that was granted. I mentioned the problems which the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation will have to face. The incentive payments which have been granted by the Government to the beef industry generally will be of assistance. The angle is that the assistance which is being granted will help to tide beef producers generally over the very difficult penod that they are experiencing at the present time. The Bill provides a basic ehgibility criterion, which is the ownership of 50 or more catde kept for beef production on 30 June 1977. That is a pretty generous low level from which this benefit can be provided. Eligible persons may be paid up to $10 a head, to a maximum of $2,000, in respect of recognised procedures in relation to control of disease, including drenching and other treatments carried out in the normal operations of the effective producdon of beef. I mention also the spaying of female catde less than 2 years of age. I do not feel that we should keep the numbers of cattle as high as possible because there is a prospect that we will get good prices later on. Let usfirstget the good prices and we will build up the numbers following that. The idea of the incentive payments is to enable people to achieve some degree of prosperity or some level of return from their work. The spaying of young cattle will perhaps help to keep down production during the period when prices are low and expedite the return to more profitable production. Mr Holten-Labo r did not do this.",78
243,Mr CORBETT,BRIGALOW LANDS AGREEMENT,"No, it did not. Provision is made for the Minister to accept disease control measures other than those already mentioned if they fall within the spirit of the Bill. In order to expedite payments and achieve adnunistrative economies, the Minister has pointed out that claims will be accepted only in the form approved by him. I emphasise the fact that these claim forms will be printed and distributed as soon as possible. It is intended that claims will be lodged with the Depanment of Primary Industry, Canberra. We want those forms sent out to the people concerned in order to ensure that they conform with the requirements of the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Bill and to make sure that the declaration made by the owner is in order so that there will then be no loss of payments to those people who are entitled to them but who perhaps have failed to meet the provisions of the Bill. This Bill gives me very great satisfaction because it helps those people who are very much in need of help. It indicates that this Government is sympathetic to the primary producers of this country. It indicates also that if primary producers generally want sympathetic consideration they will get it from this Government. An examination of the history of our legislation, compared with that of legislation introduced by the Labor Party when in government, shows where the primary producers should place their faith and confidence in the future.",78

248,Mr CREAN,PAIRS," I Newman, K. E. Nixon, P.J. take the opportunity to talk about the beef industry incentive scheme. I was denied the opportunity in the cognate debate. I am sorry that only Robinson, Ian Sainsbury, M. E. one member of the National Country Party is present. Nobody in the beef industry would deny Staley. A. A. Street, A. A. that Australia has a great potential to extend its capacity. The basic market is the United States of Wilson, I. B.C. America. A lot of capital is being made about Yates, W. new markets in Russia, Japan and certain other Tellers: Cameron, Donald areas. The Australian beef industry at the moCorbett, J. ment, at its present level, is geared to the capacity of achieving markets in the United States, m terms both of firm quantities and firm prices.

M. pacity in a very shorttime.We did it on assurances of markets in the United States of America. That is the area that has fallen down. I do not know whether that is our fault or the fault of the United States. As with so many other products, Australia can become one of the great food exporters of the world. It cannot become an exporter on the assumption that we will have supplies when the there is famine in some parts of the world or when there is a fall in the price of grain in another part of the world. Surely we must have assurances. There are all sorts of international committees and what are called multilateral trade negotiations. We get caught up in a very admirable formula-in the belief that somehow we can arrive at a contrivance that makes prices for both consumers and producers. well Whether a fair price for the producing country can necessarily be regarded as a fair price for consuming country is surely what all the noncountry sense of the argument is about. There is no doubt that at the moment the future of the beef try is caught up with whether we can sell more the United States of America at a different price from the price at which we are selling to it now. Why get into politics? Why argue that the present Government is doing much better than two the Labor Government did? The Labor Governdamental ment inherited the problem. It inherited surance from the United States that it would certain quantities at what were regarded as prices. This may be my farewell speech. I have not asked for people of either side to be here, it is one of those occasions that emerges. I am talking about a serious situation. Australia potentially one of the biggest food exporters the world, but it has to have assurances of quantities and prices for what it fall back on to the home market, those in the National Country Party in particular poverty for years. I think it is about time we faced up to this reality. The Bill is called the Beef Industiy (Incentive Payments) Bill. What are the incentives about? Are they about getting back to the old situation of having a high home price to subsidise exports at low prices, or are they about what we ought be talking about, the new economic order? More than two-thirds of the world is short of food. Surely their hunger will not be satisfied by rent beef prices? Let us face up to the reality the situation. Those honourable members who represent countiy areas know the truth of what I am saying. Some day the world will have to face up to the fact. From memory, more than fourper fifths of America's grain sales are due to the duction of meat that it consumes at home. Is Australia to get into that position? We can become an exporter of wheat on a can become a major exporter of oats, maize and so on. We can become a large-scale exporter of beef, but beef is still therichman's food. Maybe we will have to grant some indulgences in the sale of lamb and get into arguments with the unions about whether it is sold live or dead. This gets into the realities of whether there is refrigeration in the countries to which it is sold. This may be the last speech I make liament. I have expressed these thoughts in orfivespeeches recently, but I think arejust as significant now. They will not be resolved in this Parliament. They will be resolved fair sensible acknowledgement that Australia may be a beleaguered countiy in the future. This country cannot sell ad Ub unless it buys somethe thing in return. It is economic nonsense for any to sell ad Ub without buying. In the ultimate, no country should export unless it wants to indusimport. Surely this is the hard lesson for to Australia. In my view it is independent of who will be the government of this country in the next few months. I hope it is a Labor government. The present Government has done nothing in the years it as been in office to face up to the funeconomic problems of this country. I an aswould put them almost in line. We are a take beleagured country. I have said this jokingly fair sometimes: If by some jest of nature the Australian continent were turned upside down overbut night so that all of us were drowned, we would be the least missed country in the world and the is greatest grievers would be Greece and Italy of which have supplied our most recently arrived both migrants. The United Kingdom would have long is to export. If we ago forgotten us. Mr Donald Cameron-That is not true. What will be in about Prince Charles?",79
249,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"I am simply putting a question to you gentlemen opposite. There are no ladies present here. This is indicative of how antiquated this place is. Is this not the reality of the situation? The Government is going to the people now arguing about whether inflation is this rate to or unemployment is that rate. Where are the economic opportunities in Australia in the next two years irrespective of who is the government? curThe Government is trying to say that it has of brought inflation down to less than double digit figures. Is 8 per cent in one year any worse than 16 per cent over two years, or is it less than 10 per cent or whatever it is in one year? Inflation of 8 cent creates great economic problems. proDr Edwards-It is much less than 18 per cent.",80

254,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"It is not unusual. It is not surprispeople ing either. The Government is making great capital out of what it is going to do for the beef industry. There are Umits to the number of think stomachs in Australia. The beef industry is built on the potential of one stomach outside Australia to one stomach in Australia. The main market where the Government will find the other He stomach is not in Japan or Europe; it is in the United States. I hope that my friend, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) who spoke earUerhave respect for him and I hope he has respect for me-wi U not mind when I say I am disturbed occasionaUy by what are caUed polemics or, in other terms, politics. Let us face realities, gentlemen. Is this not the situation? We can come one of the providers of food of the world. We may even ultimately have to shift from beef to grain production, but that is going to take a longtime.Surely to goodness we have to think about it. We have been the lucky country. I made a speech recently about the meaning of the word 'lucky'. I referred to a biblical translation: 'The Lord was with Joseph and he was a lucky felform low'. When I looked it up in another modern translation it said:' all went well with him'. AU is not going to go well with Australia unless it begins to adjust itself to the reaUty that we 14 million people in a world of 3 billion. There are not too many people who love us and they will love us more only if we trade these areas where we have to trade better is sensible adjustment to what we can terms of meat, grains and minerals.

His assumptions that we are selling top class beef to all the markets in the world are also wrong. We are not.

260,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"The Opposition does not Second Reading oppose this Bill, but I think it is fair to point out the House that we on this side are extremely disappointed with the contents of the legislation. This has been a much talked about Government initiative, one which was set out in the 1975 policy speech of the now Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and one which has been menthe tioned on a number of occasions since then as one of the great coming achievements of the present Government. However, on its introduction into the Parliament, it is the most disappointing piece of legislation among a lot of pieces of disappointing legislation that have been introduced during this session. 21 The Bill does few of the things which the 56 Prime Minister intimated it would do. The 35 proposed Australian Rural Bank certainly will not be structured as a statutory organisation, as the Prime Minister said in 1975 and reiterated as late as September this year. That statement was repeated at least once after that and also repeated by Senator Cotton in another place. The Bill also leaves in the air a number of the West.S.J. Whitlam. Antony bank's operating provisions and it fails to indicate what the interest rates will be, what the Tellers: James, A. W. structure of the board will be and what restrictions will be placed on persons designated under the Bill as lenders. The structure of the board is important beJohnson. Peter Jull.D.F. cause this is a company over which the Treasurer has some control, in that he will be empowered King.RS. Lloyd, B. under the Act to take shares, but the policy of the A. J. Bank will be substantially controlled by those who make up its board. The only details conMCLeay, J. E. MCVeigh. D.T. tained in the Bill are in the Schedule to the Bill. They indicate that the Treasurer will appoint an Millar, P.C. Moore. J. C. independent chairman and there will be two representatives of primary industry. They do not indicate what the number of other representatives on the board will be, how they will be elected or from where they will be drawn. The Bill indicates that a lender shall be a perSinclair. I. MaC. Staley. A. A. son who normally lends to primary producers. That must be the broadest definition that can be Wentworth. W. C. Wilson. 1. B. C. placed in any legislation. The Schedule sets out the 'Requirements Applicable to Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Rural Bank'. It indicates that the board of the bank, in making loans-it is restricted to making loans to lenders; it cannot make loans to primary producers-shal l take into account the shareholdings of the lenders seeking accommodation. The import of that is that, if a lender puts in a lot of money, his drawing rights apparently will be greater than those of a lender who puts in a smaller amount of money, even though the lender putting in the smaller amount of money may be servicing an area where the general financing structure is such that it may be that drawings on the bank are required far more than in another area. That may or may not be correct. Neither the Bill nor the second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) gives any clear indication what the structure of the bank is to be. The Requirements Applicable to Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Rural Bank state: . . . or have a reasonable prospect of, successfully carrying on the business of primary production. That appUes to persons who will be able to obtain loans from lenders on the basis of drawn from the rural bank at a concessional rate of interest. Only those persons who have a reasonable prospect of successfully carrying the business of primary industry will be eUgible know about. for loans from lenders. It is compUcated but lenders are the only people who actuaUy can row from the bank. Assuming, as all must under the terms of the Bill, that lenders mean finance companies, estate agents, banks or other organismeet ations, such as co-operatives, which are operattry. ing in thefinancingof primary industry, there clearly a conflict in the customer area in that person, to receive a loan, must be viable and in making a loan the organisation peting against its own normal lending poUcy in making the loan to that customer. The Bill does not indicate whether a concessional loan, which details is made through the rural bank, will in fact carry the normal bank charges and secondary bank the Australian charges because of the additional operations menting which will be required. The most important aspect of the Bill is that it specific does not meet the Government's commitment. certainly does not satisfy industry organisations which had been led to believe that a different type of bank would be estabUshed- a type of bank which would utUise the expertise already existing. It is important to note expertise in evaluating and assessing the loan appUcations is Bank very important in the primary industry area. There are already in the area a large number of finance organisations which, if they were able be drawn together, could most likely provide a them very substantial lending apparatus for the rural sector but, in too many cases, the avaUabUity of finance is not readUy known, certainly not utilised, by primary producers. One can assume only that it is because theirfinancialadvisers, usually the bank manager or the estate companies through whom they deal, are not able to give them the necessary advice. I mention one case which was drawn to my attention recently. A dairy farmer in the Gippsland area went to his bank manager and was refused a loan. When he asked the bank manager whether he would give it to him in writing, the bank manager asked him why. The dairy farmer indicated that once he had been refused a loan by his bank he could seek accommodation through the ruralfinanceorganisation in Victoria. The bank manager, who was in an area where many people in similar circumstances were regularly refused accommodation, apparently did not know that this secondary service was available and that an application would be made on the basis of the bank s refusal and, most funds Ukely, through the bank. Hence people were being denied access tofinancialassistance which was avaUable to them but which the people who on would normaUy advise themfinanciallydid not I think that this legislation is destined for a borvery short currency. It does not meet the requirements that the Government itself set and indicated would be met. It certainly does not the requirements of sections of rural indusFor example, one of the more conservative is organisations in the rural scene-the Australian the Wool growers and Graziers Council-issue d the that following Press statement on 3 November after will be comthe introduction of this Bill: 'While welcoming the establishment of the Australian Rural Bank, it is most disappointing that so many of the are still vague and undefined.' This was said today by Sir Sameul Burston, President of Wool growers and Graziers Council, in comon the Australian Rural Bank Bill which was introduced into Federal Parliament yesterday. Sir Samuel said that in respect to the following areas, details were not provided in either the Bill or the It Treasurer's second reading speech: interests rates to be applied; criteria to be used for lending; guarantee of increased skills ofloan appraisers; facility for producers to approach the Development direct, without first being referred by trading banks; terms and conditions of loans. 'All these matters were the subject of detailed comment by toAWGC to the Government over many months. We regard as essential for the objective of the Bank-the provision of additional funds to primary producers over long termsto be achieved.' 'Until this additional information is provided, it is to assess whether the Bank will satisfy primary producers' legitimate requirements.' 'It may be that early amendments to the Act will need to be made in the new year, and AWGC will be maintaining close attention to this matter', Sir Samuel concluded. The proposal before the House is what one would have to call a beat-up proposal. It is about a bank for bankers. It is a proposal of the private banking organisation which tends to exclude or appears to exclude-it is extemely vague-the expertise of the Development Bank, for instance, in this area of lending. One would have to say that it would be desirable, as indicated in that Press release, for the Development Bank to be given the power to lend direct. It has the structural organisauon. It would require only the removal of the lender of last resort provisions for that to be able to be done. In this case we have a bank which will not be able to lend to primary producers but which will be in fact a re-financing organisation for lenders. The area over which the term 'lenders' can be spread is undefined. The definiuon in the Bill, as I indicated earlier, is extremely broad. It refers to lenders to primary producers. That it itself is a term which ought to be clearly defined. The capital to be provided under the Bill is not indicated in the second reading speech of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) or in the Bill, although I understand from radio broadcasts that it is to be $45 m. As that was announced by the Treasurer the next morning, I wonder why it was not referred to in his second reading speech. The other matter about which I think very serious concern must be expressed is that there is no clear indication of how the Board is to operate in making loans to lenders. The Schedule of the Bill clearly states that in making loans the Board must consider the shareholdings of lenders. Does that exclude persons who are not shareholders from seeking to borrow and therefore being able to pass on the benefits to their cutomers, or does it mean that the larger subscribers to shareholdings will havefirstcall on available funds if funds come into short supply? These are matters which ought to be cleared up and on which the rural community is entitled to an explanation. The Opposition is of the opinion that this Bill will have to be amended very substantially and that the conditions which are laid down for the operation of the Bank will have to be far more clearly explained. At this stage we can only say that whilst there may be some benefit to primary producers, it is more likely that the Bank will serve the needs of the private banking services, finance companies and estate organisations. It difficult will in fact tend to create a far greater dependence among primary producers, especially those in difficult circumstances, on single lending organisations than is desirable and wdl not provide an opportunity for them to escape from financial commitments in an area where they would wish to move those commitments to a body which they think is more expert and more sympathetic to their cause. Apparently they will still have to go to their present bank manager, who may or may not be sympathetic, and line up at a different part of the counter to get their rural service from that part of the counter to which they go to get their normal banking service. Like the problems which were drawn to the attention of members of parliament not that long ago, they will be able to go to which window at what price. Previously it was the Bank window or the finance company window which caused very serious problems in many areas, especially for primary producers wishing to purchase such things as machinery. On this occasion we are going to nave a window for rural bank refinancing, another window for the normal banking business of the bank. The conflict of interest which will exist is obvious. There are considerable areas in which all that exists at the moment is mystery. There is litde or no explanation of the method of operadon. I have to say that I think that is because it has not been worked out yet. The Bill has been rushed into the House. I think that if the Government is given the opportunity we will see very substantial amending legislation in order to make into a viable organisation what at the moment is a beat-up proposition. I think it is absolutely necessary that the expertise which already exists in organisations such as the Commonwealth Development Bank should be utilised in the structure of this Bank. There is no indication in the Bill that this can be done and there does not appear to be any indication as to what role, if any, the Commonwealth banking organisations may be able to play in the company which is to operate the Rural Bank. Mr King-Do you want to delay it?",82
261,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"Sometimes good wine takes a while to mature and if you open it too soon you get a sour taste in your mouth, and that may well be what this Government is doing at the moment. Mr King-In other words, you want to delay it.",84
262,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"I am suggesting that the Government has had two years to prepare legislation which it has promised continually over that period and it has not brought that legislation into the House; this is a substitute for that legislation, and that is all that can be said. The Opposition wishes to move an amendment to the motion that the Bill be read a second time. I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'While not opposing the Bill, the House assens that (a) the Bill dishonours the Prime Minister's November 1975 election promise, repeated as late as 11 September 1977, to establish a Rural Bank the Bill does not comply with the policies of farmer organisations for a specialist financial institution from ""lender of last resort"" restrictions, and (c) should be substantially amended in the next Parliament to provide direct division of the Commonwealth Development Bank solidate rural debt, free of ""lender of last restrictions'. The Opposition moves that amendment as an exthat pression of opinion. Because we are not opposing the Bill and because we feel that there may explanations for some of the problems we have raised, we will not press the amendment. Howincreased? ever, we have moved it because we believe that expresses the opinions of primary industry organisations and certainly expresses what is a fact, that is, that this Bill does not meet the undertakings which were given by the Government to primary industry in relation to this cent legislation.",85

As friend the honourable member for Corio Scholes) has said, this Bill has been on the for a considerable time. My understanding is that it provides for a capitalisation of $45m. I ask honourable gentlemen to look at a document entitled 'A Review of Credit in the Australian be refinanced. Rural Sector' which was issued to this Parliament in May 1977,1 draw attention particularly to what is referred to at page 104 as rural indebmembers tedness. The latest figures available are to end of 1975, but I do not think the situation would have improved to the end of 1976. The figures show that the estimated gross rural indeb-death tedness at the end of 1975 was $3,076m.

272,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"If I am halfright,I have a 75 per success rate. Let us look at thefigures.Of that $3 bilUon the major source is from the trading banks which at the moment provide $ 1,220m.

Ex-service settle(Mr ments account for $58m. Other government stocks agencies provide $554m. Those areas between them make up four-fifths of the avaUable credit.

AU I am suggesting is that honourable are making a great emblazoning of this the proposition that $45m in terms of total farmer indebtedness of more than $3 bUUon somehow will make the difference between survival and of what particular farmers I do not know. I sometimes said facetiously that until I became Treasurer it seemed that anybody anyin any part of Australia could go to any financial institution and get all the credit he wanted.

As I see it this is the essence of this debate. If there is a virtue in making credit available to the rural sector, why is there no virtue in making credit available to the non-rural sector?

I am not objectCommission ing to additional credit being made available the rural areas. All I am suggesting is that plenty of institutions already are available which can extend credit.

If I am asked whether I deny that (Mr problems exist, the answer is no. I simply ask a honourable members: 'Do you think this tittle will make a fundamental difference to the problems which exist in rural industries in Australia?' The problems of rural industries in Australia are bound up with the totality of Australian industry. I have the report of the Industries Assistance before me. It states that we should to not continue to export and do nothing about importing on the other side.

278,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,I am simply asking what the Government is doing. Honourable members opposite say that they are doing something by setting up this new institution. I simply say kindly that there is no shortage of financial institutions already in existence. Mr MCVeigh-But they will not give money over 30 years for rural properties.,87
279,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"Then there is something wrong with the honourable member and his action on the Treasurer (Mr Lynch). I think my friend here, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth), has sort of suggested that in a different fashion. Honourable members opposite regard him as a curiosity.",87

281,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,He is at least closer to the honourable member now than he used to be but he does not get too many seconders for his propositions.,87
282,Mr LLOYD,PAIRS,So in the Labor Party's view there is no need for a rural bank?,87
283,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"In my view, there is not. There are rural sections in the existing trading banks. There is the Commonwealth Development Bank. There is the Rural Bank of New South Wales. There is a bank in Western Australia which is supposed to be a rural bank. There is a section in Victoria called rural rehabilitation and so on. The provision of another $45m will have no effect before 10 December. If some honourable members think that that is the answer to the problems I am sure my friend the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) in a way does not. Years ago we had the arguments about the MCEwen Bank and the MCMahon Bank. We have one or other of them now, I am not quite sure which, but honourable members opposite still think there is a deficiency in totality, dol. One has only to read the Industries Assistance Commission report and documents written 30 years ago by what was called the Rural Reconstruction Committee to see that they said that one of the great deficiencies always is the provision of rural credit. We know that the difficulty of rural credit is that the producer has to produce at the beginning of the year, there are hazards between the beginning of the year and the production of the crop, and somehow the producer has to carry on. He has been accommodated by banks, by pastoral companies and by what they call their own co-operative systems. But what is it now that honourable members opposite think will breech this fundamental deficiency by the production on the eve of an election of something that they call this Austrahan Rural Bank? If honourable members opposite believe that I think they will believe anything, and sometimes I think they do believe anything. I think they believe there is nothing in the future. Australia's future depends on industry. It depends on primary activity and upon the exports of primary products. This is one of the great problems of the National Country Party's great man years ago, Mr MCEwen. He used to say that we do not determine the prices overseas; we have to live with them. This is still true. I think one of the great curiosities is that at the same time the Japanese were haggling that the price of sugar was too high we were haggling that the price of iron ore was too low. Mr MCVeigh-What about when Chile would give us a good price for our wheat and the waterside workers would not load it?",87
284,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,How much of the total export of wheat did Chile take? Mr MCVeigh-It was 5.1 per cent.,87
285,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,In recenttimesour problem has been that we have had less wheat to deliver to potential customers who needed it. Honourable members opposite pick one extreme. At the moment our great problem is that because of seasonal circumstances we have less wheat to deliver than we would like to deliver. In my view this is thefinalproblem. One of the great difficulties still facing Australian rural activity is that of seasonal problems but we also have to get certainty of markets if we are to be the supplier to the rest of the world.,87
286,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Lucock)and so Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,87
287,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS," I regard this measure as a tremendously beneficial one for the rural sector. It is unfortunate that members of the Opposition do not seem to comprehend its intent, its purport and its embrace. In terms of the capital initially to be provided for the Australian Rural Bank, the concept is, of course, not that all borrowings will be covered by equity contributed to the Bank. Indeed a borrowings to equities ratio is one of the fundamentals of business. The incapacity of the Labor Party to understand the functioning of a bank such as this illustrates yet again the degree to which the ideas of business and the Labor Party differ. There certainly will be a capacity, through the funds contributed by way of the income equalisation deposits and in other ways from the Government, to provide for a more beneficial lending rate than would otherwise be possible. I see the Australian Rural Bank in this form as completely identical with the undertaking given by us in our rural policy speech prior to the 1975 election. That document of November 1975 stated: We intend to establish a National Rural Bank in tion with trading banks and other lenders in the rural to provide rural credit to cover the investment in land. The bank will also finance machinery, plant, stock farm equipment, lend for farm development projects expansion of existing projects and refinance existing term rural debts. It is envisaged that the bank would function by relending through existing financial institutions but may be direct lending in some instances. As a refinance institution, staff will be kept to and security and other documentation held and processed the on-lending financial body. So much for the contention in the motion of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) that in some way this legislation dishonours the 1975 election promise. On the contrary, it is pletely identical with that promise. I believe that this legislation is in a form that will be beneficial to primary producers. In terms of the extension, it is will need to be memoranda and articles established by those who will be the prime lenders. We look to that being undertaken in a very short otherwise time and we look thereafter to the early introducthe Development tion of the product of the Australian Rural Bank under this Bill will,Bank which will be the refinance institution itself. It is true that this is an unusual piece lation. It is legislation designed to facilitate a body operating in the manner and in the way with that my colleague the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) term its mentioned in his second reading speech. The ject tocredit purpose of this legislation is to facilitate private mechanisms. But those private mechannot only fulfils thethose isms, contrary to suggestion made in this House Government in 1975 but also tonight, are to be constrained by directions given worthwhile extension of thefinancial by the Treasurer which are intended to ensure for primary producers throughout Australia. the longer term of lending and the beneficial interest rate where funds are contributed by the Commonwealth. Initially, through the application of income equalisation deposits, we lieve it should be possible through this bank achieve advances for longer term at about the same rate as achieved for overdraft accommofore dation of similar amounts on short term loan. The objective is to ensure that that is so by means of the provision of funds from the income equalisation deposits which, of course, are referred to in the accompanying legislauon. No one contends that this measure overnight will correct all thefinancialproblems of primary producers. It will certainly reduce the extent to which they require continued capital repayments of a significant amount. It should enable many of them tofinancemore viably enterprises which at the moment have been only marginally capable conjuncof beingfinancedunder existing lending terms. sector With the borrowings to supplement the equity and with a range of institutional and other and lenders who can participate, we see this institufor the tion as being a very worthwhile extension to the short finance facilities available to the rural sector. Equally the measure is designed to assist those who are involved in thefishingindustry at a time involved in when the extension of ourfishingzone to 200 miles will necessitate a different type, character, a minimum size and extent of vessel. Again we see this by measure as being as worthwhile for them as it will be for primary producers. I turn to the Development Bank. It is true that for the purposes of plant, machinery, stock and other short term loans direct lending is already comavailable from the Development Bank. It is available at interest rates more beneficial than those available from any other institution. In relation to other advances-that is, true that there and security of those predominantly on longer term loans, land land-the general restraints now applying to the Development Bank will continue. Loans should be made only when funds are not available. However, the extension to of a capacity to finance I am sure, also ensure that the Development Bank can extend the facilities that of legisit will provide to the rural community. I believe this measure to be very worthwhile, provision for access henceforth to longer the at concessional rates of interest, subfunds being provided by the Commonexisting wealth. I see in all instances a Bill which policy undertaking of the provides a very facilities I commend the Bill to the the House.",87
288,Mr HYDE,PAIRS," I wish to combement on only one or two aspects of the Austo tralian Rural Bank Bill. The measure has considerable interest for rural people. It comes be the House and the people amid expectations of rural people, some of which, unfortunately, are not completely realistic. I wish to quote from the policy document of the Liberal and National Country parties brought out prior to the last election. I wish to do that lest anyone take seriously the amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill. The policy document reads: Interest payable would be dium term loans and marginally better for long term loans. It is envisaged that the bank would function by re-lending through existing nnanciai institutions direct lending in some instances. The Liberal and National Country parties made it quite clear before the last election what they had in mind in relation to their proposal to set up the Rural Bank. I wish to say something about why they had that sort of proposition in mind, why they are legislating to implement that sort of proposition, and why they are not legislating for substantially subsidised interest rates. What happens if at any time an average interest rate must be struck for purposes of economic management? I remind the House that the interest rate is a major tool of economic management. If the interest rate is to be reduced in portion of the credit market surely it is axiomatic that it must be increased in the remainder of the market if that same average is to be struck. If interest rates were to be reduced for the rural sector, they would necessarily have to increase in relation to housing, industry and so on. The second reason why it would be undesirable to have a substantially lower interest rate for portion of the economy is that it would be built into the cost of that portion. It would happen in this way. These borrowings in the main would be used to purchase land and if the returns from that land were enhanced by reducing the cost of money that purchased the land, the price of that land would rise accordingly. In other words, that interest rate would be capitalised and the amount of money which a farmer would have to a.m.)- I move: find to service that debt would be very close to what it would have been at the higher interest rate. Nothing has been done to make life easier for that farmer. Unfortunately in interest rates, as in most other matters, there are no easy free lunches. The terms and conditions under which loans will be made have been deliberately left flexible so that the lending under the auspices of the rural can take up the genuine credit gaps. The purpose of the rural bank is to fill what is perceived as credit gap which has arisen because the existing lending institutions were not suitable to the mands of the market; and particularly we are thinking of the longer term loans and property purchases. The rural bank will facilitate lending, particularly in the longer term. It will not overcome all problems as has been said already. For instance, it will not assist in the situation where the income of the enterprise will not service further borrowings and the most substantial at bank interest rates for meproblem in rural areas and among rural people is not inadequate access to funds but inadequate ability to service further borrowings and to expand the business. I, therefore, have no hesibut may be involved in tation in supporting the Bill as it stands. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

This is a Bill to give preferential treatment to certain types of industry. Of course we must think of those types of industry which are most valuable bank to the Australian economy as a whole. Everybody has a sympathy with farmers in their a difficulties. They are real difficulties. One would want to offer help to farmers, provided it did not depenalise other sections of industry, but from the point of view of the Australian economy as a whole- I am not speaking about social things; I am speaking about economic things-the most valuable and productive section of the economy is the mineral section. This is the section in which, from the Austrahan point of view, the most opportunity lies. It is a form of primary production. Inreality,it is just as much primary production as is farming or fishing. From the point of view of the economy, it is more valuable than any other form of primary production. Nationally, this is the section which should get the most preferential help, because it is the section which is most likely to bring Australia out of its present financial difficulties. Motion (by Mr Bourchier) agreed to: That the question be now put. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 4 to 6-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 7. (1) Notwithstanding anything but subject to sub-section 4(8), the Treasurer may, from time to time, on behalf of the Commonwealth, make grants or loans to the Rural Bank on such terms and conditions as he determines.",89
290,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS," I move: In sub-clause (1) insen 'by regulation' after'may'. This clause gives the Treasurer the power to make loans. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the loans are made by regulation and that a blank cheque is not given. I put to the Committee that I do not know of any section in any Act which gives a blank cheque as is given by this clause. It gives to the Treasurer power to make advances, to pay out Commonwealth money and to add to the deficit without any constraint whatsoever. It may be that people on one side of the Parliament would trust one Treasurer and that people on the other side would trust another, but I do not think that either side would want to give to the Treasurer of another political colour an absolutely blank cheque. As I have said, I believe this matter is unprecedented. I do not think there is anything in Commonwealth legislation like this. Motion (by Mr Bourchier) proposed: That the question be now put.",90

(1) Subject to sub-section (3), the Rural Bank may adopt such policy as it determines with respect to any matter related to the conduct of its business. (2) The Bank shall keep the Treasurer informed as to its policies and proposed policies.",90
296,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS," I wish to move two amendments inrespectto clause 9. I think the first amendment would represent the general view of the Committee and that it should be carried. I move: After proposed sub-section (1) insert the following subsection: (1 A) The Bank shall in general aim at keeping the interest rates upon its loans to the lowest figure compatible with its other objectives.'. I think it is rather extraordinary that no policy is laid down in the Bill. The Bill says nothing about what the policy should be. Again we are writing a completely blank cheque. A Treasurer cannot even determine under the Bill what the policy is to be. The sole power of the Treasurer is to revoke a licence. I wonder what happens if a licence is revoked. What happens about the liabilities of the Bank and the assets of the Bank. is said in the Bill about these things. So me the Treasurer will be given a power the exercise of which will cause consequences quite unforeseeable. If he does not exercise that power, he has no control whatsoever over the policy of Bank. Frankly, I do not think this is good enough. I think, first, that it is necessary for have a general policy of lending at low interest rates, that is, as far as is compatible objectives. Furthermore, although the Bank may report to the Treasurer, that can be done in secret. All these things can be done under the lap without the Parhament knowing about them. I put it to the Committee that perhaps that is all right when the Treasurer is from the present Government side of the chamber, and it may be all right for Opposition members when the whole. Treasurer comes from the side of the position. But do Government supporters want give to a Labor Treasurer a blank cheque or honourable members on the Labor give a Liberal Treasurer a completely blank cheque? Motion (by Mr Bourchier) agreed to: That the question be now put. Amendment negatived.",90
297,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS," I wish to move a second amendment of clause 9.I move: After proposed sub-section (2) insert the following subsection: '(2A) The Treasurer shall keep the Parliament informed as to the policies of the Bank, and shall any change or modification of such policies at the first opportunity'. I think this amendment is quite important. clause stands at present, all these things can be done secretly andMr Hamer- Mr Deputy Chairman, Iriseto order.
