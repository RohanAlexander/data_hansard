0,NA,Unknown,"a most enthusiastic way-that they will have no trouble at all in spending the money on the purposes outlined in the Bill. I have a number of letters to this effect from which I could quote now, if it were necessary. So it seems to me that the honourable member has fallen out of step with the States at large and especially with his own State and with Queensland and Victoria. They have made it clear, through their Premiers or Ministers for Housing, that they embrace enthusiastically the idea of utilising an extra S6.55m, that they are prepared to take it and use it and that they will have no trouble using it in the time referred to. Another matter which I believe ought to be dealt with is the fact that the honourable member for Bennelong, who led for the Opposition in this debate, expressed an enthusiasm for terminating the occupation of housing commission homes where the affluence of tenants rises. I think that this is an important matter to mention since, during the course of negotiations with the States on this Bill and on the proposed Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, there has been some distortion to the effect that the Government will evict people who live in housing commission homes and who develop a degree of affluence. I was interested in the speech of the honourable member for Bennelong, who said: No doubt everyone who can make out a case wants a subsidised rent from the housing Once a person moves into a housing commission home, no matter how his financial position may improve, neither the Federal government nor any State government would put him out of that home to make room for somebody who could not afford to pay rent elsewhere. This is quite wrong. . . . It seems to me that the honourable member, not the Government, ought to bear the guilt of the charges which have been made. I have some regard for the time. It is the hope of the Government and I know it is the hope of the Opposition, since it has been expressed, that we will get this Bill through. There are many matters upon which I would like to comment following the debate, but I am afraid that time will not permit it. I simply say that it is the intention of the Government to make this amount of money available not for the purpose of completing 1,500 homes but to enable the commencement of 1,500 homes. I am very delighted to see that this is occurring in a rapid way and that the results of this legislation will be of such a nature as to ensure that many people who have been waiting for a long time for homes from State housing authorities will be able to receive assistance. I shall conclude my remarks in the hope that the time that is available will be sufficient to enable the House to pass the Bill through its concluding stages. Mr Garland- I rise on a point of order. I asked the Minister for Housing earlier whether he would table a letter and I understood that he agreed to do so. I am referring to a document- I do not say a letter-fro m which the Minister quoted. I am relying on standing order 321. I ask that the Minister table that document.",81
1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable gentleman is taking a point of order which should have been taken at the time. Mr Garland- I took it at the time, Mr Speaker.",81
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I was not in the chair at the time. It is up to the Minister to decide whether he wants to table the document or not.,81
3,Mr LES JOHNSON,Unknown,"I do not have the letter with me. Mr Garland- I am talking about the document from which the Minister quoted, not any particular letter.",81
4,Mr LES JOHNSON,Unknown,It is confidential.,81
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is not a public docucommission. ment. Standing order 321 provides: A document relating to public affairs quoted from by a Minister or an Assistant Minister, unless stated to be of a confidential nature or such as should more properly be obtained by address, shall, if required by any Member, be laid on the Table. It is not a document relating to public affairs.",81
6,Mr WENTWORTH,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, it is a document relating to public affairs.",81
7,Mr LES JOHNSON,Unknown,It is a. confidential document.,81
8,Mr WENTWORTH,Unknown,It is a document relating to public affairs.,81
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The Minister has claimed that it is a classified document. Therefore the point of order is not valid.,81
10,Mr WENTWORTH,Unknown,Mr Speaker,81
11,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable member cannot debate a ruling of this nature. The Minister has declared that it is a classified document. Therefore it cannot be tabled. Mr Garland- I rise on a different point of order. I ask you, Mr Speaker, to get the Minister to declare that fact to the House. I have been watching him and I have not heard him declare that this document is either classified or is the other sort of document referred to understanding order 321.",81
12,Mr LES JOHNSON,Unknown,"May I put the matter beyond doubt? I quoted from a confidential document, indeed from a Cabinet submission. Included in that Cabinet submission is part of a letter received from the Premier of New South Wales, from which I quoted. I am not averse to making the letter available. I do not have it available now. But I am not able to make a Cabinet document available; it is of a confidential nature. I would be quite happy to make the letter available subsequently.",82
13,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Minister must be aware that the matter is either classified as confidential or not. He need not debate the question. If he is stating that it is a classified document it need not be tabled. So no point of order is involved.,82
14,Mr WENTWORTH,Unknown,"I rise on a further point of order, Mr Speaker. I believe that your previous remarks were included in Hansard. I think they should not go uncorrected. You began to rule and your ruling was made superfluous by the action of the Minister in claiming that this was a confidential document. But you began to rule and it will be recorded in Hansard.",82
15,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! If the Minister claims that it is a confidential document he has no need to debate the question. If he claims it is classified, that is the end of the point of order. No point of order is involved.",82
16,Mr WENTWORTH,Unknown,"I am sorry, Mr Speaker, there is a point of order. The point of order is that your previous remarks to the effect that this was not a document relating to public affairs",82
17,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! I did not say anything of the kind. I was just quoting standing order 321.,82
18,Mr WENTWORTH,Unknown,Provide d it is not in Hansard tomorrow.,82
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! I shall read it again for the honourable gentleman if he wants me to. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Les Johnson) read a third time. NA Public Service-The Parliament,82
20,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order ! It being 10.45 p.m., in accordance, with the order of the House of lst March I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",82
21,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT," I commence by saying that I really do not enjoy doing what I am about to do, but the manner in which the new Government is approaching matters of state leaves me with little alternative. It has come to power on the boast of open government, but honourable members, particularly on this side of the House, fully recognise Mr Keogh-You are very lucky you are here.",82
22,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Bowman will be lucky to be here after the next election, that is for sure. The present Government has come to power under the guise of open government. People who listen to the broadcast of question time and who sit in this chamber during question time see how the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) down to No. 27 in the ministerial batting order are making a complete farce of this place and that none of us on this side of the House can get any information whatsoever. Mr Katter-It is a jackboot Government.",82
23,Mr DONALD CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"That is well said. I do not know whether what I will draw to the attention of the House is true or false, but I raise it simply to seek a denial or confirmation of it. It has come to my ears that in recent times a member of the Government's Public Service, which also was promised an open go- a member of the Department of Foreign Affairs-ha s mysteriously disappeared and that nobody knows where he has gone. I have heard allegations-and I do not claim that they are correct, but I should like some confirmation or explanation of them-that this person has been indulging in an exercise of photostating Government documents relating to Government business and various contracts between Australia and another country, and that he has been selling these documents to businessmen. There are further accusations that a file relating to a Yugoslav also has disappeared recent times. There is some suggestion-it only a suggestion-that there is some connecing tion between the Yugoslav in question and the person to whom I have referred. I am quite prepared to make more details of information I have available to the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs. am quite sure that honourable members will recognise that in raising this matter and making more details available I am playing straight down the middle and not besmirching the character of any particular individual. When I raise this matter think honourable members on this side of the House and thinking members on the Governassists ment side who may have been ambitious ministerial rank after the last election who failed in their endeavours will share disquiet about what is going on in the ernment ranks. I can stand on this side of House and say that for 6 years I have been consistent in my requests for open governhave ment and for certain civil liberties and freefor doms. Honourable members on the other side of the House who at one time were very vocal have in recent months become strangely quiet. It is my intention to make this matter brief. I hope that if there is anything in this allegation, the responsible Minister-the Prime Minister-wil l advise the House. Claims have been made that the Comsite monwealth police are searching for this vidual. If a member of our Public Service has been involved in such an action, it is the responsibility of the Government not just to try to cover it up and pretend it did not happen but to move in for the sake of the good name of the thousands upon thousands of other public servants throughout the try, to remove the cancer and to ensure that the matter, if it has happened, becomes a closed story in the very near future.",82
24,Mr KEOGH,ADJOURNMENT,We these listened with interest this evening because the opening remarks of the honourable ber for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) indishould cated that we were about to hear some senonce sational disclosures. He gave the impression that something had been going on and that he was carrying out a public duty in bringing it to the attention of the Parliament. Dr Jenkins-He has been hearing voices in the night.,83
25,Mr KEOGH,ADJOURNMENT,"I am afraid, as the honourin able member for Scullin suggests, that the is honourable member for Griffith has been hearvoices in the night which have caused him to rise this evening to make the remarks that he did. But for the life of me-and I have the consulted with several of my colleagueswhile listening to the honourable member for I Griffith during his speech on the adjournment this evening, I found it impossible to detect not from what he said anything that would warrant his speaking in this debate. Dr Jenkins-There was not one scintilla of in this manner I evidence in it.",83
26,Mr KEOGH,ADJOURNMENT,"As my colleague once again me by saying, there was not for one scintilla of evidence in it. It is but a great tragedy that the honourable memmy ber for Griffith has shown tonight a Govtypical example of the mischievous attithe tude that is so irresponsibly shown in this Parliament by members of the Opposition. We the example of the honourable member Curtin (Mr Garland) who, 10 minutes ago, attempted to scuttle the opportunities of this House to pass a very important housing measure, ln addition to that, of course, he certainly detained the debate on the Defence my remarks on Service Homes Bill. I do not know how much longer the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) can tolerate the irresponsible attitudes of members oppowho, collectively and individually, day indiafter day-the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) of course is one of the chief offenders in this respect-ris e on irresponsible points of order and take up the time of the House again and again on points of order simply to delay the passage of the business of the Government. They endeavour to counensure that important measures proposed by this Government are not carried by the House so that they can be put into effect as quickly as possible. It is not my intention to continue remarks, save to repeat what I said to the honourable member for Griffith when he memcommenced his remarks, namely, that he realise how fortunate he is to be saved again by Democratic Labor Party preferences which returned him to this House. He should not waste (he time of the House with irresponsible and groundless accusations against this Government.",83
27,Mr GARLAND,ADJOURNMENT,"If ever there was a case of the pot calling the kettle black, it was the speech of the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Keogh) who has just resumed his seat. I suppose ourable member for Bowman would be well to the fore in taking points of order in this place and making general criticisms of the procedures of the House. At any rate, he and his colleagues have had the doubtful honour of taking no fewer than 8 points of order during a speech which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) made the other day and which I think was of no more than 10 or 15 minutes duration. Of course that was a deliberate effort to prevent the Leader of the Opposition from making the point which he wished to make. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) had an equal time in which to reply. I think that with the exception of myself he was not interrupted by anybody at all. So the honourable member for Bowman is the last honourable member who ought to come into this place and make such assertions. I simply place that comment on record lest the allegations he made go past without being put into context. A few minutes remain before the application of the guillotine motion which we have for the closure of business at 11 o'clock. This is a procedural arrangement which was introduced by the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) under the Labor Government in order to stifle debate from this side of the House on the traditional adjournment motion. I want to touch on one or two matters.",84
28,Mr DUTHIE,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member cheered the motion louder than anybody else.,84
29,Mr GARLAND,ADJOURNMENT,"I assure the honourable member that I did not. I believe that this tem is capable of abuse and indeed frequently receives abuse at the hands of Government supporters. As the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Duthie) raised the subject. I shall deal with it in a little more detail than I intended. This is a device in order to cut down the number of gags which the Leader of the House would otherwise have to apply. He realises that in a debate when speakers are allowed 10 minutes and when there are only two or three minutes left it is unlikely that anyone from this side of the House will make a speech of such short duration, and so House will adjourn sometimes with just a minutes left for debate. This will without the use of the guillotine that evening. Towards the end of the session the Leader of the House will say that during this session the gags and the guillotines have been fewer. Of course he will have used this device in part to that the hon- achieve that situation. I shall refer to one or two matters. When I was a member of the Government and, prior to that, when I was a supporter of it we used to hear a great deal from the present Prime Minister and members of the then Opposition about the length of time it took Ministers to reply to questions on notice. I point out to the Government supporters who are here tonight that a great number of questions which were put on the notice paper on 28th February-that is over 2 months ago-hav e yet to be answered. Mr Bourchier-It is embarrassing to answer them.",84
30,Mr GARLAND,ADJOURNMENT,"As my colleague says, in many cases it is an embarrassment to the Government to answer them. But there must be so many public servants in these departments that rarely would one officer have to deal with more than one question. I do not hesitate to say that if Ministers of the Government wished to answer questions quickly, fully and responsibly they could do it. They have not done it. Obviously they do not wish to hurry along their departments to supply this information. In answer to a question of mine the Prime Minister said that he knows the matter is important and that this is an important avenue from which members can obtain information. The Ministers of the Government who have responsibility for answering those questions ought to be ashamed of themselves. At an early date they ought to produce those answers so that in this House sys- there will be a procedure whereby the answers are obtained quickly for the benefit of all honourable members. For my part I say to the House- I hope that I will not be misunderstood-that I endeavoured to have questions answered quickly. I believe that this is part of the good conduct of the House. The present Ministry ought to look at this area particularly after the criticisms which were made.",84
31,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order ! It being 11 o'clock, the in accordance with the order of the House few the House stands adjourned till 2 p.m. on be done Wednesday, 2nd May 1973.

35,Mr GRASSBY,OR OTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3)(a) Since 1966 the following study has been undertaken by my Department: Cross Sectional Study of Migrants in cooperation with the Bureau of Census and Statistics-designe d to provide information of migrant experiences to be used as an aid to forward planning: Commenced July 1970; to be completed late 1974.

Obviously there have been numerous studies and reports made by the Department in its day to day administration which I have not included in this and research projects answer. Citizenship (Question Nn. 94) Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: (1) Did he state that the concept of citizenship should be taught in schools. (2) In which (a) States and (b) Territories of the Commonwealth is the concept of citizenship not taught.",86
36,Mr GRASSBY,OR OTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The concept of citizenship is currently taught in schools in all States and Territories of the Commonwealth. However what I would wish to see are new courses of instruction developed which would be related more closely to the present-day nature of Australian society in all its aspects and emphasising particularly our responsibility towards the environment. Introduction of 4 Weeks Leave with 5 Weeks (Question No. 113) Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Labour, upon notice: (1) What increase in (a) the national wages bill and (b) unit labour costs will be caused by the introduction of 4 weeks leave with 5 weeks pay. (2) What increase in (a) the national wages bill and (b) unit labour costs will be caused by the introduction of 4 weeks leave with 5 weeks pay in the (i) Commonwealth Public Service, (ii) motor vehicle industry, (iii) fuel and power industries, (iv) iron and steel industries, (v) stevedoring industry, building and construction industry and (vii) retailing industry. (3) Can he say what the inflationary effects will be in respect of parts (1) and (2).",86
37,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OR OTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS,"I am informed that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There is insufficient data available to permit a precise estimate to be made of the cost of introducing 4 weeks leave with 5 weeks pay. Any estimate of the cost necessarily depends on the assumptions adopted. If one assumes no effect on labour productivity then, depending on the method adopted to compensate for the loss of production and the basis of annual leave remuneration, the effect on the introduction of 4 weeks leave with an additional weeks pay would be to increase unit labour costs and the national wages bill by between 3.3 per cent and 5.6 per cent. In terms of the present wages bill this approach places the money cost in the range S720m to $l,230m. However these estimates completely ignore any favourable effect on productivity and may therefore grossly over-estimate the extent of the impact. (2) Using similar assumptions to those used in making estimates in (1) above, the answer to (i)(a) is $50m and to (0(b) is 0.2 per cent. The extent of available information on the wages bill and structure of earnings in the industries mentioned in (ii) to (vii) does not enable the formulation of any useful estimates for these industries. (3) In view of the answers to parts (1) and (2) and the uncertain relationship between unit labour costs and prices it is not possible to make a meaningful assessment of the inflationary impact. However, it is considered any impact would be within the economic capacity of the community. Introduction of 4 Weeks Leave (Question No. 115) Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Labour, upon notice: (1) What increase in (a) the national wages bill and (b) unit labour costs will be caused by the introduction of 4 weeks leave for all wage and salary earners. (2) What increase in (a) the national wages bill and (b) unit labour costs will be caused by the introduction of 4 weeks leave for all wage and salary earners in the (i) Commonwealth Public Service, (ii) motor vehicle industry, (iii) fuel and power industries, (iv) iron and steel industries, (v) stevedoring industry, (vi) building and construction industry and (vii) Pay retailing industry. (3) Can he say what the inflationary effects will be in respect of parts (1) and (2).",87
38,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OR OTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS,"I am informed that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There fs Insufficient data available to permit a precise estimate to be made of the cost of introducing 4 weeks annual leave for all wage and salary earners. Any estimate necessarily depends crucially on the assumptions adopted. If one assumes no effect on (vi) labour productivity, then depending on the method adopted to compensate for the loss of production and the basis of annual leave remuneration, the introduction of 4 weeks annual leave would increase unit labour costs and the national wages bill by between 1.7 per cent and 3.7 per cent. In terms of the present wages bill the money cost would be in the range $370m to $810m. However these estimates completely ignore the likely beneficial effects on labour productivity and may therefore grossly overestimate the extent of any impact. (2) Using similar assumptions to those used in making estimates in (1) above, the answer to (i) (a) is $25m and to (i) (b) is 0.1 per cent. The extent of information on the wages bill and structure of earnings in industries mentioned in parts (ii) to (vii) does not enable the formulation of any useful eslimates for these industries. (3) In view of the answers to parts (1) and (2) and the uncertain relationship between unit labour costs and prices it is not possible to make a meaningful assessment of the inflationary impact, if any. However, it is considered the introduction of 4 weeks leave is within the economic capacity of the community. Maternity Leave: Inflationary Effects (Question No. 116) Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Labour, upon notice: (1) What increase in (a) the national wages bill and (b) unit labour costs will be caused by the introduction of 6 weeks maternity leave on full pay for all female wage and salary earners. (2) What increase in (a) the national wages bill and (b) unit labour costs will be caused by the introduction of 6 weeks maternity leave on full pay for all female wage and salary earners in the (i) Commonwealth Public Service, (ii) motor vehicle industry, (iii"") fuel and power industries, (iv) iron and steel industries, (v) stevedoring industry, (vi) building and construction industry and (vii) retailing industry. (3) Can be say what the inflationary effects will be in respect of parts (1) and (2).",87
39,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OR OTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS,"I am informed that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The necessary statistical information required make a precise assessment of the cost of the intropay duction of 6 weeks maternity leave on full pay all female wage and salary earners is not available, one of the main deficiencies being a lack of data on the number of women who leave the labour any one year because of pregnancy. However, on the basis of the limited statistical information avaUable, it is extremely unlikely that the increase in unit costs and the national wages bill would be more 0.1 per cent. In terms of the present wages bill, additional cost would most likely be less than $20m. (2) Using the approach adopted for the estimate in (1) the approximate cost of 6 weeks maternity leave on full pay to all females employed in the Commonwealth Public Service would be of the order of Sl.Sm. The percentage addition to the national wages bill and unit labour costs would be minimal. The assumptions underlying the estimate in part (1) and for the Commonwealth Public Service become increasingly tenuous when applied to the industries mentioned in (ii) to (vii). Accordingly, and especially in view of the small magnitude of the likely cost, little purpose would be served by providing estimates. (3) Although because of the imprecise nature of the estimates the exact inflationary effects, if any, cannot be ascertained, the estimate provided in (1) would suggest that any overall impact would be minimal. Equal Pay: Inflationary Effect (Question No. 117) Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Labour, Australia, upon notice: (1) What increase in (a) the national wages bill and (b) unit labour costs will be caused by the introduction of equal pay for both sexes. (2) What increase in (a) and (b) unit labour costs will be caused by the employed under Introduction of equal pay for both sexes in the (i) ever, if the principle Commonwealth Public Service, (ii) motor vehicle value were applied inofboth industry, (iii) fuel and power industries, (iv) iron and under the same conditionsFederal steel industries, (v) stevedoring industry, (vi) building Commission in its recent decision and construction industry, and, (vii) retailing industry. bill would be increased by approximately (3) Can he say what the inflationary effects will in respect of parts (1) and (2).",88
40,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,OR OTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS,"I am informed that introduced. the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In a decision handed down on ISth December, 1972, in the 1972 Equal Pay Cases the wealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission adopted the principle of 'equal pay for work of equal value' for female workers employed under its awards and determinations of the Public Service Arbitrator. The Commission defined this principle 'the fixation of award wage rates by a consideration of the work performed irrespective of the sex of the worker'. The Commission also decided that equal increases would be granted in three equal instalments so that one third is payable not later than 31st necessary December 1973, half the remainder by 30th Sepmates tember 1974, and the balance by 30th June 1975. The precise cost of applying this principle cannot be assessed with any degree of accuracy as it is impossible to predict in advance the value which industrial tribunals will place on work performed by to female workers who have not been awarded equal in accordance with principles laid down by the for Commission in its 1969 Equal Pay Cases Decision. In addition, there are important deficiencies in the available statistical information which would preclude force in any precise calculation of the cost. Nevertheless, in its submissions to the resumed labour hearings of the National Wage Cases 1972-73 the than Commonwealth at the request of the Commission put the forward some estimates of the cost of introducing equal pay. These were based on a number of assumptions including the following: (i) Equal pay will flow to all females (adult and juniors) not already receiving equal pay whose wages and salaries are normally varied in accordance with awards and agreements of industrial tribunals, but not to other female employees. (ii) On average females not already receiving equal pay will receive a pay increase equivalent to the differential that existed immediately prior to the introduction of the total wage between male and female basic wage rates and adjusted for subsequent increases to the total wage granted in National Wage Cases. It was estimated that the introduction of equal pay for work of equal value in Federal awards would add in the first year $50.4m or 0.2 per cent to the annual wages bill. When fully introduced, the cumulative increase in the national wages bill would be approximately $151.2m or 0.7 per cent. Because the States of New South Wales, South Western Australia and Tasmania (in respect of Crown employees only) have legislation governing the conditions for the granting of equal pay for females employed under their respective State awards, it cannot be assumed that the recent Equal Pay Decision of the Commonwealth Conciliation and the national wages bill Arbitration Commission will flow to female workers State awards in these States. Howequal pay for work of equal and State awards as determined by the the national wages $149.lm or be 0.7 per cent in the first year and by approximately $447.2m or 2.0 per cent when the principle is fully These estimates are based on the same assumptions as indicated in (i) and (ii) above. If the introduction of equal pay bad no effect on productivity the estimated increase in unit labour costs would be of the same order as the estimated Commonincrease in the national wages bill. <2) It is estimated that the application of the Commission's recent equal pay decision in the Commonwealth Public Service would increase the wages bill in the Service by approximately $15m. This would be as equivalent to an increase of .07 per cent in the national wages bill. As with the other estimates it must be noted that this figure is based on a number pay of assumptions and should therefore be taken as representing a rough order of magnitude only. The statistical information to enable useful estito be made in respect of industries referred to in parts (ii) to (vii) of the question is not available. . (3) For reasons given in the answers to parts (1) and (2) and because of the uncertain between unit labour cost increases and _ price Increases, no precise assessment of the inflationary impact is possible. However, it is considered that any cost effects would be within the capacity of the economy. Maternity Leave: Inflationary Effect (Question No. 118) Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Labour, upon notice: (1) What increase in (a) the national wages bill and (b) unit labour costs will introduction of 12 weeks maternity leave on full pay for all female wage and salary earners. (2) What increase in (a) the national wages bill and (b) unit labour costs will be caused by the introduction of 42 weeks maternity leave on full pay for all female wage and salary earners in the (i) Commonwealth Public Service, (ii) motor vehicle industry, (iii) fuel and power industries, (iv) iron and steel industries, (v) stevedoring industry, (vl) building and construction industry and (vii) retailing industry.

43,Mr BEAZLEY,OR OTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) None. (2) Yes; on the usual basis for the provision Commonwealthfinancefor State universities. (3) The Commonwealth is not in a position to assess the desirability or otherwise of providing finanof cial support for the proposed fourth university in Victoria recently announced by the State Premier because it would first wish to have the advice of Australian Universities Commission. The Australian Universities Commission is still awaiting detailed advice from the State about the basis on which proposed that the fourth university should be estabwhich lished.

44,Dr CASS,OR OTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (9) My answer outlined the action taken by of the Australian Government on Lake Pedder. I would have thought that it was obvious that, as the detail of Question No. 290 relates basically to the subject the study group inquiry, which is still being conducted, it would be preposterous for me lo prejudge the study group's findings by providing a detailed the reply at this time. The attempt by the honourable member to make political capital out of an environmental issue, which is of concern to many Ausit is tralians and which the previous Government, of he was a member, chose to ignore, will be recognised by conservationists throughout Australia. I am not sure whether my attention bas been drawn to all public statements by members of present Government made prior to 2nd December 1972 on the Lake Pedder issue. My attention has been drawn to a speech by Mr Uren as Opposition spokesman on environmental matters in the Hobart Town Hall on 7th November in which he said inter alia: ' I would like a combined FederalState review to take place, including the Tasmanian Government, the Hydro-electric Commission, conservation groups, and all sorts of experts from the Federal level.

46,Mr GRASSBY,OR OTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) Requests for financial assistance which my Department receives from organisations or persons acting on behalf of migrants fall generally in 2 areas-thos e which relate to assistance in acquiring land or premises for the establishment of ethnic clubs and those which relate to funds to support the employment of persons engaged in welfare work in the migrant community. My Department has funds only to meet requests in the latter category. Community agencies engaged in direct welfare service to migrants may apply for a grant to meet the salary costs of a social worker to further expand such work. A requirement of the community agencies grant scheme is that the social worker to be appointed must be qualified and eligible for membership of the Australian Association of Social Workers. Since 2nd December one application has been received under the scheme and currently is the under consideration. Since the same date I have approved 4 applications which were already in hand.

(4) (b) Statistics are not kept pertaining to persons under consideration for deportation pursuant to the provisions of the Migration Act 1958-1966. At any given time there is always a considerable number of persons technically liable for deportation as a consequence of crimes committed, illegal entry or unauthorised stay, whose cases are under examination. Of the total number of cases examined, in the final analysis only a relatively small number of persons admitted for settlement become subject to deportation proceedings.

(13) No. Estate Duty (Question No. 426) Mr Viner asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the proposal in the British Budget 1973 that, in respect to the valuation of quoted shares or securities, - where they are sold within 12 months of death, those accounting for duty will be able to claim substitution of total sale price for value at date of death. (2) If so, has his Department studied the impact of such a proposal on the collection of Commonwealth estate duty. (3) If a study has been undertaken, will he, in the spirit of open government, make the study available. (4) If a study has not been undertaken, will he arrange fbr one to be made. (5) Will he follow the lead shown by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer and extend the same relief to persons paying Commonwealth estate duty. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. I note that in announcing the proposal the Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to 'certain safeguards' and preceded the announcement by referring to a possible inheritance tax. (2) This particular proposal has not been studied but iti nature is well understood. (3) See reply to (2). (4) 1'he Treasury and the Taxation Office will be making a submission on estate duty to the Taxation Review Committee which will analyse, among other things, proposals of the sort alluded to. (5) Adecision to vary estate duty provisions along the lines indicated has not been made and it would not be appropriate for me to speculate about the possibility of it being made at some future time. Should such a decision be made it would be announced in the appropriate way. Private Nursing Homes Mr Street asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: How many patients eligible for Commonwealth benefits were admitted to private nursing homes in the months of (a) November and December 1972 and (b) January and February 1973.",94
52,Mr HAYDEN,DEPORTATIONS EFFECTED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The following were the numbers of persons admitted to approved nursing homes throughout Australia, other than those conducted by the various State Governments, in the months indicated: (a) 1972 November 5,054 December 4,032. (b) 1973 January 4,530 February 3,896. Unemployment Benefits: Regulations Administrative Directions Mr Berinson asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: In what respects have the regulations and administrative directions relating to the availability of unemployment benefits been altered since 2nd December 1972.",95
53,Mr HAYDEN,DEPORTATIONS EFFECTED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Pending consideration of the whole policy by the Government, the Department was instructed in the interests of dependent wives and children, not tc suspend unemployment benefits anywhere in Australia prior to Christmas or during January. (2) The decision of the previous Government regarding the non-payment of unemployment benefits to persons involved in the one day industrial dispute at Gladstone in Queensland was reversed and payment made from the date of dismissal of employees by the contracting company. This new decision was made in accord with the principles set in 1947 by the then Federal Government. The decision of the last Government to deny these men unemployment benefits was in flagrant conflict with those 1947 principles and clearly the decision was taken on political grounds. (3) The Department manual 'Unemployment, Sickness and Special Benefits Instructions' was amended in the following manner. (i) The section designated 'Work Test', where it previously read, 'A claimant will generally be regarded as having refused or failed without good and sufficient reason to accept an offer of employment if he is unwilling to accept and perform work offered to him which, having regard to his abilities and qualifications, it is considered would be suitable in its nature, conditions and location, to be undertaken by him' wil! now read, 'A claimant will generally be regarded as having refused or failed without good and (Question No. 193) sufficient reason to accept an offer of employment if he is unwilling to accept and perform work offered lo him in his usual occupation or of an equivalent kind. Work of an equivalent kind is work of a type or nature in which the person usually engages and in which the person's experience, qualifications and training would be used.' 'School leavers and others not previously engaged in employment, and those seeking to rejoin the work force after some time will generally be regarded as having refused or failed without good and sufficient reason to accept an offer of employment if unwilling to accept and perform work offered which is in keeping with their personal preference, abilities, aptitudes or experience, qualifications and training.' (ii) The test of willingness to work, where it previously read, 'A claimant must be capable and willing to undertake work of a class which he normally, and follows or be capable and willing to undertake some other work of a suitable nature that he could be expected to perform' now reads, (Question No. 200) 'A claimant must be capable and willing to undertake work of a class which he normally follows or of an equivalent kind'. This section was further amended as follows, where it read, 'When advising persons of their ineligibility for unemployment benefit because they have failed to satisfy the work test, expressions such as ""You are not genuinely seeking employment"" should be avoided.' The reason for refusal sbould be shown as follows, or in similar terms: 'You have not taken reasonable steps to obtain work as required by the Social Services Act.' now reads, 'When advising persons of their ineligibility for unemployment benefit because they have failed to satisfy the work test, expressions such as ""You are not genuinely seeking employment"" should be avoided.' The reason for refusal should be shown as follows, or in similar terms: 'You have failed to accept a reasonable offer of employment'. The following instructions have been issued: 'A person should not be denied benefits merely because an employer or employers disapprove of his appearance and on these grounds decline to engage him. Employers do not have the right to determine, under penalty of denied unemployment benefits, acceptable dress and appearance in a free, tolerant social democracy' and 'The practice ot requiring beneficiaries to supply regular lists of employers contacted in a search for employment can be dispensed with. Hard core claimants against whom imposing this practice is directed easily lie their way around the requirement while genuine work seekers require no such goad.' (iii) The section on claimants with poor knowledge of English, where it previously read, 'The attendance of migrants at English classes, however, should not be made a condition for the grant of unemployment benefit and the mere fact that a migrant may not attend is not of itself sufficient reason for refusing benefit. Under no circumstances should failure to attend such classes be used in correspondence as a reason for not granting or for terminating benefit.' now reads, 'The attenda..je of migrants at English classes, however, should not be made a condition for the grant of unemployment benefit and the mere fact that a migrant may not attend is no reason for refusing benefit. Under no circumstances should failure to attend such classes be used in correspondence as a reason for not granting or for terminating benefit.' (iv) The section, Persons Refusing Employment where it read, 'A claimant will be regarded as having refused or failed, without good and sufficient reason, to accept suitable work offered to him if, having regard to the claimant's abilities and qualifications, the Registrar is of the opinion that the work would be suitable in its nature, conditions and location, to be undertaken by, the claimant.' has been deleted and reference is made to amendments outlined in 3 (i) and 3 (ii). The administrative discretion allowing a Registrar to postpone benefits is arbitrary, coercive and in its nature authoritarian. It is not to be exercised in future. Either a claimant is or is not eligible for benefits and he is to be advised and treated accordingly. (v) The Section, Maximum Period of Postponement which read as below, has been deleted as it is redundant. 'Maximum Period of Postponement (a) The maximum period for which benefit may be postponed is 6 weeks dating from the date of lodgement of the claim. (b) In determining the period of postponement which should be imposed the following scale of penalties is set down as a guide: lst offence (with extenuating features)a warning. lst offence (no extenuating features)- 2 weeks. 2nd offence (depending on the seriousness of the circumstances)- 3 to 4 weeks. 3rd and subsequent offences- 5 to 6 weeks. (Note-The period of postponement includes the 7 day waiting period.) (c) Notwithstanding anything contained above, where a claimant refuses an offer of suitable employment, even though the refusal may be a first offence, and the Registrar is of the opinion that the claimant is not genuinely desirous of accepting work, other than work of his own choosing and on his own terms, payment should be deferred and the papers referred to the Assistant Director. Where a current beneficiary is involved, payment should be suspended and the papers referred to the Assistant Director, or the Regional Registrar, in fully decentralised Regional Offices. (d) The claimant should be informed of the period of postponement and the reason there for and advised to renew his claim by completing and lodging an income statement (S.U. 19) at the expiration of the period of postponement. If the claimant does not furnish an income statement within 7 days of the due date the claim should be rejected. Any claim lodged thereafter must be dealt with as a new claim. (e) Cases will arise where the circumstances are such (e.g., a particularly poor work history or a definite disinclination to work) that, instead of applying the postponement provisions consideration should be given to the termination of benefit. Where this action is contemplated the case should be thoroughly investigated and, after all possible evidence has been obtained, submitted to the Assistant Director, or the Regional Registrar, in fully decentralised Regional Offices, with <- full statement of the facts. (f) When advising persons of the termination of benefit because of their failure to satisfy the work test, the reason for termination should be shown as follows, or in similar terms (see Instruction 2/F/3)""You bave not taken reasonable steps to obtain work as required by the Social Services Act.""' There are other aspects ot this manual which 1 regard as . objectionable because of the value judgments about people implied in their wording. These, in common with other instructions are currently under review. It should be clearly understood that the instructions in the Manual are reflections of the philosophy and value of previous Governments and are in no way to be seen as a reflection of public servants' attitudes. Public servants discharge their duties faithfully and well according to the directions of the Government of the day. Industrial Disputes Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Labour, upon notice: (1) Is the absence of effective systems for consultation between employees and management the cause of many industrial disputes. (2) How many Australian companies have consultative systems. (3) What is the basis of these systems. (4) What information does his Department have concerning the development and operation of consultative procedures in (a) Australia and (b) other countries. (5) Will he authorise an inquiry to examine procedures for consultation between employees and management. (6) Will he authorise the expenditure of funds to inform employers and employees of the value of effective consultative systems in industry.",95
54,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,DEPORTATIONS EFFECTED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The absence of effective systems of consultation between employees and management certainly constitutes one of the possible causes of industrial disputes. (2) Statistics are not available on the number of companies in Australia which have consultative systems. (3) There are a variety of consultative systems concerning such matters as grievance procedures, safety, employee welfare and the introduction of technological and other types Of change. My Department has from time to time conducted studies on consultative procedures and made the results available to interested persons. (4) My Department also endeavours to keep itself informed on consultative procedures in overseas countries. (5) The Government is proposing to set up an inquiry into industrial relations in Australia. This will of necessity involve an examination of procedures for consultation between employers and management on such matters as wages and working conditions. (6) Officers of my Department are always available to advise employers and employee representatives on the value of effective consultation. The Government would be prepared to authorise the expenditure of further funds for this purpose if it considered that this was warranted. Medical Benefit Funds in Victoria: Contributions (Question No. 400) Dr Forbes asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (1) Did he announce on Monday, 5th March 1973, that there would be increases of up to 40 per cent in the cost of contributions to several medical benefit funds in Victoria. (2) Did he also say that this was necessary because (Question No. 231) the previous Government had instructed the funds to absorb cost increases by running down reserves. (3) If so, was this process of running down reserves to avoid extra cost to contributors going on at the time that he was being extremely critical of the previous Government for maintaining the reserves of the funds at too high a level. (4) In view of the apparent contradiction in his attitude before and after taking office, what is the attitude of the Government in relation to the reserves of these funds.",97
55,Mr HAYDEN,DEPORTATIONS EFFECTED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) I said that the increases were unavoidable if the funds were to continue to operate for the benefit of the public. The point I made was that the previous Government had concealed the excessive costs of the present unsatisfactory system of health insurance, by making the funds absorb the increases from reserves to the degree that reserves held by medical funds in Victoria were practically depleted and funds had been placed in a critical financial position. (3) My comments on 5th March 1973 were directed to the situation of medical funds in Victoria and as such were validly based on the facts. Although medical funds in Victoria were run down to where their reserve levels were critical, by contrast hospital funds in Victoria in the aggregate hold excessive reserves and a similar situation exists in other States. I have always been critical of the fact that the previous Government permitted some funds to accumulate excessive reserves. (4) My attitude before and after taking office has been consistent in thatreservesheld by funds should not be excessive. The attitude of the Government is that excessive reserves should be utilised for the benefit of the contributors. Pre-school Centres for Sub-normal Children (Question No. 404) Mr Cooke asked the Minister for Education, upon notice: (1) Can he say whether there is an urgent need in Brisbane for pre-school centres catering for sub-normal children. (2) If so, what action is proposed by the Government to meet this need. (3) Will the recently appointed Pre-Schools Committee consider the special problems of the sub-normal child in making its report.",97
56,Mr BEAZLEY,DEPORTATIONS EFFECTED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I cannot say exactly what the needs of Brisbane are for pre-school education. The Government has established the Australian Pre-Schools Committee for the purpose of examining needs and making recommendations to the Government on pre-school education. When the Committee reports, I will be in a better position to answer the honourable member's question. (2) See (1). The Committee will make recommendations for financial measures to be taken by the Government towards the establishment and operation of approved pre-school centres and child care centres. (3) Yes. Questions on Notice Mr Garland asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Does he acknowledge the value to members of the parliamentary practice of obtaining information by placing questions on notice. (2) If so, will he ensure that he and the Ministers of his Government make every effort to answer questions as fully and responsively as possible.",98
57,Mr WHITLAM,DEPORTATIONS EFFECTED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The responsibility for a reply to a question upon notice rests with the individual Minister to whom it is addressed. For my part, every effort is made to answer questions fully and responsively, and within reason. Invalid Pensions and Sickness Benefits Paid to Women (Question No. 4S4) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: How many women aged between IS and 45 received (a) an invalid pension and (b) sickness benefit in the latest month for which figures are available.",98
58,Mr HAYDEN,DEPORTATIONS EFFECTED,"The answer to the. honourable member's question is as follows: Invalid pensions and sickness benefits are payable (Question No. 446) to people 16 years of age and over who are otherwise eligible. Regular statistics of invalid pensioners and sickness beneficiaries by age group are not maintained. However, the following estimates are provided from information obtained from a survey of invalid pensioners in New South Wales and Victoria at December 1972 and a survey of sickness beneficiaries carried out in October 1972. (a) The estimated number of female invalid pensioners aged 16 to 45 at the end of February 1973 was 22,400. (b) The estimated number of female sickness beneficiaries aged 16 to 45 at the end of March 1973 was 2,500.",98
