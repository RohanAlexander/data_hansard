They should be put to the people before a number of reflected the conditions recommended by members note the supplementary submissions by which ALGA indicate they will actively support argument put by ALGA in earlier evidence of meeting the stated preconditions. As at the date of the first hearing in mid-January given the latest possible date for an election meeting those preconditions in time to hold were not high. Given the nominated date for the prospect of these preconditions being reduced. As such, the prospect of a referendum election raises serious risks that it will be of stakeholders, including the states, has inform the voting public through public education realised. There has been a lack of engagement with states have even responded to the minister in support this referendum. The coalition members that the meeting of both of the expert panel's issue is put to the people. Australia is a federation support of state governments can make or break opposed to change, history proves it is very difficult coalition members, the recommendation by the achieve the states' support for financial recognition being able to make a recommendation on the the Australian people. A number of witnesses be successful, states either had to be actively the issue. I quote the conclusion to our dissenting Coalition members noted that the Chair's immediately to put in place the necessary steps Federal election. We held concerns that the time was insufficient action may address those concerns. However, it is occurred and seven weeks has passed Coalition members are now of the opinion that election date of 14 September 2013 is insufficient informal and partisan education campaigns and referendum question. We acknowledge concerns regarding the impact constitutionality of direct payments to local granting constitutional financial recognition may at a local government level. As noted, the Committee received constitutional for funding currently provided directly to local government, of (potential) judicial findings that The most obvious avenue is through grants through passed on in full and subject to use for the programs Commonwealth-local government programs). 2013, evidence was received that, even being late November 2013, the prospect of the referendum at the same time as the election the election and the time that has since elapsed, fully met by 14 September this year has only held in conjunction with this year's federal held in an environment where potential consensus not been met and where the opportunity to fully and other avenues has not been fully the states and, as yet, I do not think some of the regard to where they stand or whether they will of the committee were strongly of the view conditions is vital before any referendum on this of states and, as the evidence attests, the referenda. If state governments are largely for referenda to pass. In the view of the expert panel that the government negotiate to is an essential precursor to the committee likelihood of the referendum being supported by reinforced the view that, for the referendum to supportive of the measure or at least run dead on report to the report of the inquiry: Preliminary Report recommended action be taken to hold the referendum in conjunction with the 2013 but remained open to the prospect that such immediate clear that such urgent and immediate action has not with little if any progress. the time remaining between now and the nominated to put in place all the necessary mechanics, formal, to otherwise ensure an informed outcome for the of further High Court cases that may impact on the governments by the Commonwealth and that delays income at a cost to the many valuable services provided evidence that clearly demonstrates that avenues exist to still be provided in full, even in the face direct payments are not constitutional. the states, tied on the basis that they must be both currently funded (or as directed under future Coalition members acknowledge that this is a less evidence that options such as this are available and risk of loss of funding to local government, eventuating and Williams cases. As such, we consider there to be little financial referendum on financial recognition of local government conditions previously discussed have been met. As such, Coalition members of the Committee recommend recognition of local government only be held after those previously promoted by ALGA, have been met. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (10:22): I rise to speak of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition recognition, the likelihood of success and lessons including the dissenting reports. The coalition has committed to support government in the Australian Constitution-that expert panel produced-and I was very recommendation. The final report said, The majority of panel members support a referendum Commonwealth negotiate with the States to achieve and second, that the Commonwealth the Australian Local Government Associationnecessary to achieve informed and positive public this report on the concerns about a failed referendum to a major public awareness campaign and That was December 2011. They were very forward-and what did the government and Zip. Absolutely nothing. Once again, they are interested in this program. They made an election but they have done nothing to support it in any way. There are a whole range of thoughts and that this is all an undercover plot to take over unless we run an informed public awareness are going to get up in the public arena. That committee-came up with the same conclusion: run a public awareness campaign. That was the recommendation in 2011. It the government has done nothing. The minister issue. Where is the funding for ALGA? government was quick to give the Indigenous public awareness campaign, but to show its particular issue it has given nothing, committed Association for their public awareness campaign, of the December 2011 report and again in the clean avenue than direct payment, but accept the that, accordingly, there is likely to be no potential from further developments following the Pape risk to local government in delaying the holding of a in the Constitution, until such time as the that a referendum on the issue of financial the pre-conditions posed by the Expert Panel and on the final report of the majority finding of Local Government, the case for financial from the history of constitutional referenda, the appropriate financial recognition of local is our policy. Back in December 2011, the honoured to serve on that expert panel-its and this was back in December 2011: in 2013 subject to two conditions: first, that the their support for the financial recognition option; adopt steps suggested by ALGAengagement with the issue, as set out in the section of … Steps include allocating substantial resources making changes to the referendum process. clear recommendations with a very clear way the minister do with those recommendations? either setting this up to fail or they are just not promise to have a referendum on this issue, views out in the public arena. Some people think state governments; I assure you, it is not. But, campaign, those are the sorts of messages that is why the expert panel-and, indeed, this second we need to talk to the states and we need to is now the recommendation two years later, and is reprehensible in his lack of action on this Where is the funding for this campaign? The community $10 million to help them with their lack of interest and lack of support for this nothing, to the Australian Local Government which was a recommendation that came out report from the committee that we have just had-because if you do not want to do something, to do nothing. That is the hallmark There is no doubt that we have issues with Pape and Williams cases show that there are said in his comments to the hearing that we held change should not be seen as anything more government. It is not about taking away the looking at funding more money to … this is a mechanism for local government to That is what local government is legitimately looking governments are incrementally allowing local government in the federal system as a whole, as is the federal thing that both federal and state governments agree something, is who is going to do it, and more I think we have all seen that over the years. state and federal governments down to local to the people, because it does have that community programs and projects more efficiently, more financial value than many of the state and government had delivered the pink batt scheme, going to achieve something like that So, once again, it is all very well shifting able to fund them so that they can do it effectively. from running the bus system and the transport Basically, they pick up the need in the community they know what their community wants. So As Professor Brown went on to say: So we really need to recognise that this is financial flows of resources to local government-growing necessarily as a result of both federal government resources with the third tier of government The other issue that he highlighted, and which possibly pass as a referendum would need government with state governments as it is currently. conspiracy to wipe out state governments. government should be left with the states. This efficient conduit for financial delivery for recently in the High Court. As I said, the federal up this referendum to fail. In the first round of hearings, ALGA raised being ready without having the funding to run last hearing they said they believed that if campaign. So this is why my colleague Mark additional comments that we believe that form another committee and take the time of this Labor government. funding for local government and, indeed, the issues going forward. But as Professor AJ Brown in Sydney earlier this year, this constitutional than a new conduit for funding to local rights of state governments; it is more about local government. His report states: get a larger agreed share of the total financial pie. for and that is what it should be looking for. State a larger share of responsibility and resources government. When anything major happens, the first on, once they have agreed that they need to do often than not local government plays a huge role. We have seen the shifting of responsibility from government. Because local government is closer contact, they are in a place to deliver effectively and, quite frankly, with better federal governments. Dare I say it, if local it would have worked; but you are never from the federal government level. the jobs onto local government, but we need to be Local governments now do everything system to running libraries and child care. because they see it, they understand it and we need to be able to fund that effectively. about increasing, in a planned, sustainable way, the them, even though that should occur and state government being prepared to share those more effectively. That is what this is about. I agree with, is that any change that could to leave the regulatory control over local Once again, I highlight that this is not a We all agree that regulatory control over local is about providing a more effective and more the states, as has been successfully challenged government, by not doing anything, is setting their issues about not being prepared and not an effective public campaign. However, at the they were funded appropriately they could run that Coulton, the member for Parkes, and I made the of all people, ALGA, the Australian Local Government Association, is best positioned public awareness campaign in the time frame members whether this referendum will succeed. They came to the last hearing and said yes, the minister done? Has the minister got any have not heard back. This is something he should the expert panel started meeting. Why hasn't vital interest. Why hasn'the reassured the states them, that this is just a conduit, as Professor funding methods? But, once again, the minister interested in seeing this referendum succeed, allude to-the funding they gave the Indigenous there for ALGA. And, quite frankly, that funding be able to effectively run a public awareness We all know the importance of local government on a day-today basis. If ALGA tells us it that is what we should be doing. Once again, this federal government. I call on the minister ministers that this is a campaign to make funding have had with our successful challenge in campaign for a referendum. I would also like to place on record my and associations and indeed individuals who as well as to those who attended the public There is a genuine interest in this area, and there outcome. But, once again, it is the government that is setting this up to fail. In February committee that they recommended that we continue unless the government is genuine, unless the government works with the local government this referendum succeed.

It is the minimalist recognition, to know whether it can or cannot deliver the and is best positioned to know through its they are ready to go.

This is of that this is not about taking power away from Brown said, for more efficient and effective has done nothing. The minister is not and I am very concerned that the funding they referendum supporters-is not going to be needs to happen today if ALGA is going to campaign for this referendum to succeed. in the community, because they are there needs funding to run an effective campaign, then tragically, we are not getting that support from to act immediately to reassure his state more efficient, to bypass the problems we the High Court and to move forward with the appreciation of the many local government areas contributed over 140 submissions to the inquiry, hearings, which helped with our deliberations. is a genuine interest in facilitating the right that is dragging the chain. It is the government this year, ALGA gave further evidence to the with a referendum. But, as I have said, government funds that campaign and unless the associations and bodies, we are not going to see on that flawed basis they are setting it up to a pleasure to rise to speak on the final report Recognition of Local Government. I do so in these matters, having served on local around amongst some councillors-and perhaps is aware of it-is that if you do any more than a declared criminally insane! So I am sort of pastures-but I am not sure how long the member just under the limit! But, to go on to the has recommended the adoption of financial I think it is fair to say, and it is through the constitutional financial powers that are that the words 'local government' be inserted said, a minimalist position, but it is a very would know, we had the Pape case in the High funding by the Commonwealth government constitutionally valid. So there is speculation, government circles, that that same ruling federal funding that goes direct to local councils. One of those programs which have been quite Liberal-National coalition government and Roads to Recovery. Roads to Recovery has around Australia and in local communities. government to local governments to assist I think that in the Mackay region in particular that roads are the No. 1 issue for nearly all residents learnt that in the first week of being a local three days after I had found out I was elected knock on the door-I was actually living in Deputy Speaker Livermore-from someone who 'Wow, this is a good initiation into local constituents.' His complaint was about a local to Recovery program eventually, MCColl There are so many roads that get upgraded period of this term of parliament, we have Avenue in South Mackay; they are doing a Paget, Archibald Street in Paget, Grasstree Madam Deputy Speaker. There is also Eversleigh Mackay, Mount Martin Loop Road-in your Armstrong Beach, Paradise Street in South were not there, or if there were a High Court detriment of all of those residents and motorists point of view of the ones in my electorate-Connors Street-these are very well-used and, up until have this funding in place or if it were subject detriment of not just the local government I know that there is an argument that we through the financial assistance grants, funding the states to local government. But the report such a good methodology for distributing that little bit of a superficial reason but it does governments 'lessens the ability of the Commonwealth implementing its own policies at a local level'. important. The second reason the indirect route government as a legitimate third tier of extended to the Commonwealth government-simply into that financial head of powers. That is, as I important one. As many people around this place Court, which came up with a ruling that direct to schools being state controlled was not and I suppose it is well founded in local could essentially be used to negate some of the successful was that introduced by the former continued under the current government-that is, had immense benefits for local governments all It is delivered directly from the federal them in their road construction budget. it has been somewhat of a godsend.

At 5.30 am I got a an area which is now in your electorate, Madam wanted to complain about a road. I thought, government: 5.30 am knocks on the door by road, which we got upgraded through the Roads Street, which is in Walkerston. through this program. Currently, over the last had Roads to Recovery funding going to Casey bridge upgrade there. We have Connors Road in Beach Road-again, down in your electorate, Road in Sarina, Paradise Street in South electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker-along with Mackay, and on and on it goes. If this funding challenge to that funding, it would be to the who use those roads. I can tell you from the Road, Archibald Street, Paradise recently, well-worn roads. So, if we did not to a High Court challenge, that would be to the but to the local communities. can direct that through the states. Certainly, does go from the federal government through has given some indication as to why that is not funding. They give three reasons. The first is a say here that that indirect route through the state to implement and to be seen to be The other two reasons are probably more is not good is that 'it fails to recognise local government in the Australian system.' It says: Although this is an issue of status, it is clearly Australia. I am going to come back to that point in a second. one is: … local government and its advocates raised governments is inefficient, ineffective, and may government by reason of deductions It is always a major concern when you have got that you are going to see less of the dollar less of the money actually going into bitumen, that actually build these roads. So that is the important. The No. 2 point that was raised on the issue key point. Obviously we had local government bigger council that, most people would have the time with Mirani Shire Council and Sarina though there were some benefits. At that time were a fair few residents who felt that because a lot of the funding that went through The unfortunate reality is these amalgamations by the then Beattie government. What it saw Mirani shire and Sarina shire. They had councils their own elected mayor. Now, on the Mackay representative-if I am not mistaken-from the mayor and six councillors; and there is but I think that reduced representation is a very and your own mayor collecting your own rates, your own area. You have got people on the ground like Netherdale, Yongala and Grasstree Beach some of the projects, as a fact of life, representation there. I know the report states that there could government in the Constitution, a democratic better in giving local government a true position governments. Unfortunately, it is at the moment. councils merged. We are currently seeing de-amalgamations be done at the stroke of a pen although they are some concern again, particularly in your electorate, part of the world, I read the newspapers and fact is local government now is simply the creature particular option, it would be for a full democratic may not be amenable to a lot of people, particularly recognition as a minimalist position of great significance to local councils throughout The final and probably the most important concerns that Commonwealth funding via State result in a reduction of the money flowing to local for administrative expenses. double handling or triple handling of finances actually get down on the ground. You are going see less of the money going into the work crews reason why the financial recognition is extremely of the validity of local government is also a amalgamations. I went through that. I was on a thought, stood to benefit from amalgamations at Shire Council. I was opposed to that even I represented a rural division in which there they were in rural division they missed out on Mackay City Council at the time. were just done by the stroke of a pen really was reduced representation for residents in that were about seven members strong with Regional Council, I do not think there is one old Mirani shire, which, as I said, had its own one representative from the old Sarina shire. sad thing because if you have your own council then you are spending all that money back in in these little townships. I know in places their say is completely watered down now. So get overlooked now because there is not that have been another view in the recognition of local recognition, which may have gone one step and not just making it a creature of the state The reality is tomorrow we could see other across the state and that too can giving a vote at this stage. I know it is causing Madam Deputy Speaker. Being in your know that there is some concern about that. The of state government. If I was to vote on a recognition.
