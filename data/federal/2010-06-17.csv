1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 9 am and read prayers. NA Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 18th Annual Meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum,17
2,The SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"As leader of the delegation, I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 18th Annual Meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, held in Singapore from 17 to 23 January 2010. The delegation comprised the father of the House, the member for Berowra, as deputy leader; the member for Deakin; and Senators Ian Macdonald and Glenn Sterle. I first attended the APPF in 1998 and have witnessed its development over the years and understand its relevance to the Australian parliament. The countries that participate in the APPF matter to Australia because of our strategic and economic interests. So each January for the past 18 years members of the Australian parliament have joined with members of other national parliaments in the Asia-Pacific region to discuss matters of common interest. With such a broad membership, it is inevitable that there are varied perspectives on many issues raised at the annual meetings. But I think it is fair to say that participants endeavour to treat each others' views with respect. Therefore, one of the principal outcomes of the meetings is that a measure of understanding is gained of the views and interests of regional neighbours. The matters addressed at the Singapore meeting were along the same lines as in the past. They can be grouped under three broad headings: economic and trade matters, political and security issues, and interparliamentary cooperation within the region. I will turn now, briefly, to the substance of the meeting. The delegation proposed resolutions on terrorism, energy security, the global economic situation and trade liberalisation, and regional collaboration on social measures in the economic downturn. We were also involved in the discussions in the plenary on agenda items such as climate change and the APEC meeting in 2009. The delegation fully participated in all sessions of the drafting committee, where draft resolutions were settled before they were returned to the plenary for adoption at the final session. At that final session 14 resolutions were adopted. As might be expected in an organisation that has been operating for so many years, there are issues that need to be reviewed from time to time. At the Singapore meeting some delegations raised issues relating to the APPF's rules and their interpretation. I am pleased that steps have been taken by the APPF to consult member countries about possible reforms. The proposals that are received will be considered at the next annual meeting, which will be held in Mongolia in January next year. In preparation for the meeting, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra assisted with comprehensive briefing materials and advice and with the drafting of resolutions. The Parliamentary Library assisted with valuable briefing material, and the Parliamentary Relations Office provided administrative support. The delegation appreciates all their assistance. On behalf of the delegation, I would like to thank the Australian High Commission representatives in Singapore: the High Commissioner, Mr Doug Chester; the Deputy High Commissioner, Ms Penny Burtt; and the First Secretary, Dr Anton Alblas. Their briefings were very helpful. The hospitality offered by Mr Chester gave us an opportunity to build on our relationships with Singaporean members of parliament and others in Singapore who have ties to Australia. Dr Alblas provided additional assistance to us, including arranging meetings, at our request, with the Ministry of Finance, the waste management department and the Singapore Marina Barrage and accompanying us throughout those meetings. I thank the delegation secretary, Catherine Cornish, for her diligence and support, and my senior adviser, Christopher Paterson, especially for his assistance in the workings of the drafting committee. I thank the deputy leader, the member for Berowra, and all members of the delegation and their accompanying spouses. I believe we represented the parliament effectively.",17
3,Mr RUDDOCK,DELEGATION REPORTS,"Berowra) (9.05 am)by leave- Mr Speaker, I thank you for your leadership of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 18th Annual Meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum. I wish to make a few observations in the context of the history and role of this organisation. a former member for Bradfield, David Connolly, was instrumental in moving for the establishment of the organisation. It was formally established while he was still in the parliament, in January 1993. Its objectives involve promoting dialogue amongst parliamentarians within the region. I would commend those who are interested to examine paragraphs 2.20 through to 2.29 of the report of the delegation because they outline the contribution that was made to the debate and the resolutions that were settled. I had the privilege of being able to speak-and I note the Attorney is in the chamber-on matters relating to terrorism and particularly its impact on our region and the regional responses that had been made. It was particularly important, I think, to encourage dialogue and cooperation to prevent terrorism. In that context, working with members of parliament, particularly from Indonesia, who were involved in the drafting committee was in my view a very valuable role to fulfil. The efforts that are needed in relation to counterterrorism depend very much upon political leadership, and it is needed not just here in Australia but in the region generally. The opportunity for dialogue in relation to those matters seemed to me to be a very important and complementary contribution. As the Speaker noted, our colleagues Senators Sterle and Macdonald were there, as well as the member for Deakin. Each of them made substantial contributions, as are outlined in the paragraphs I have referred to. I would encourage those who are interested to see whether it fulfils a useful role to examine the matters discussed and the contributions that were made and to contemplate how this plays a positive role in terms of consensus building.",18
4,The SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I thank the member for I believe Berowra for his comments. NA (PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVIEW) BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Snowdon, for Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",18
5,Mr SNOWDON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Lingiari-Minister for Indigenous Health, Rural and Regional Health and Regional Service Delivery) (9.08 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Professional Services Review (PSR) Scheme and the Medicare Participation Review Committee (MPRC) are important parts of the government's efforts to ensure Medicare is used correctly and taxpayers' money is not abused. The PSR Scheme is a peer review process for investigating whether a practitioner has inappropriately rendered or initiated Medicare or Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) services. This scheme also aims to protect patients from the risks associated with inappropriate practice and this bill enhances the protection of the public. In 2008-09 Medicare Australia referred 136 matters to PSR. This bill makes amendments to the provisions for the Professional Services Review (PSR) Scheme and the Medicare Participation Review Committee (MPRC) in the Health Insurance Act 1973 (the act). The proposed amendments do not alter the purpose of the PSR Scheme or the MPRC process, but address the recommendations of the 2007 review of the PSR Scheme. Change in requirement to refer to the NA Practitioners who are found to have engaged in inappropriate practice may be reprimanded, counselled and/or disqualified through the PSR process from providing these services for up to three years. At present, a practitioner must be referred PBS. to the MPRC if they have committed a relevant civil or criminal offence, or been found to have engaged in inappropriate practice by the PSR on two or more occasions. The bill removes the requirement for the Director of PSR to refer practitioners who have been found to have engaged in inappropriate practice on two or more occasions to the MPRC and provides for the director and the determining authority to apply a disqualification period of up to five years to those practitioners. Prescribed pattern of services In 1999 the profession agreed that when high numbers of services are provided a possibility of poor quality arises. The number agreed was 80 or more unreferred attendances on 20 or more days in a 12-month period. This bill clarifies in legislation that a practitioner who performs this number of services is automatically deemed by the legislation to have practised inappropriately, unless they can provide evidence that exceptional circumstances existed. The bill requires the Medicare Australia CEO to request a review by the Director of PSR, if the CEO becomes aware of a ‘prescribed pattern of services'. The final determination that a ‘prescribed pattern of services' constitutes inappropriate practice can only be made under the PSR Scheme. It is not a decision that can be taken by the Medicare Australia CEO. Expanding the coverage of the PSR Scheme At present the PSR Scheme and the MPRC apply only to medical practitioners, dentists, chiropractors, physiotherapists, podiatrists, optometrists and osteopaths who provide services under Medicare and the In the 2009 calendar year, practitioners not covered by PSR and MPRC arrangements provided 3.6 million services at a cost to Medicare of $350 million. These practitioners include audiologists, diabetes educators, dieticians, exercise physiologists, mental health nurses, occupational therapists, psychologists, social workers and speech pathologists. The bill provides for a determination to be made that a health professional is a practitioner for the purposes of the PSR Scheme and the MPRC (recommendation 12 of the review committee). This will enable the PSR Scheme and the MPRC to be applied to allied health professionals who provide Medicare services. Administration improvements The bill provides for improvements to streamline the administration of the scheme related to recommendation 4 of the review committee by: - providing an extension of time for a PSR committee or the determining authority process in some circumstances, such as where a person is unable to participate in the process due to illness; - providing for a PSR committee or the determining authority to take no further action in some circumstances, such as where the person dies; - providing for a final determination to take effect seven days after the day on which an appeal is withdrawn or discontinued by the person. Improving the protection of the public The bill includes amendments to improve the protection of the public under the PSR Scheme. If the conduct of a person under review poses a threat to patient life or health, the director must contact the relevant body-that is, the body in each state or territory that is authorised to recall patients for independent medical review, such as the Chief Medical Officer. The bill also requires the the relevant registration body. Other minor changes The bill makes a number of other minor administrative changes to the scheme. These are: - clarifying that Medicare services which are requested may be reviewed by PSR, whether or not they have been rendered; - authorising the Director of PSR to give information about a person to the determining authority, on one occasion, up until the authority makes its draft determination; - protecting patients by requiring persons who are disqualified due to a PSR or MPRC process to display a notice to inform patients that services will not attract Medicare benefits; and - amending certain provisions to clarify that the instrument referred to is a legislative instrument under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. Unrelated amendment The bill contains one amendment not directly related to the PSR Scheme or the MPRC. Currently the Health Insurance Act provides for regulations to be made in relation to referrals to consultant physicians and specialists. Over the last decade a broad range of health practitioners have become able to provide Medicare services. This change will enable the current regulations applying to referrals to consultant physicians and specialists to be expanded so that they apply to any referral made for a Medicare service. This bill will ensure that the PSR Scheme continues to operate effectively as part of the government's efforts to protect the integrity director to notify of Medicare. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Coulton) adjourned. NA GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 June, on motion by Mr Stephen Smith: That this bill be now read a second time.",18
6,Mr RIPOLL,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"It is a pleasure to speak on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2010. I have spoken on EMDG bills in the past, because I am a supporter of this type of legislation and this program. It is always a pleasure to speak on one again, although the context of this amendment bill is unfinished business from the previous government in relation to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. Firstly, I would like to congratulate the Hon. Simon Crean, the Minister for Trade, for his good work in this area. I know his commitment to export business, to export companies, to Brand Australia, to a range of key issues around Australia as an export nation. I strongly support this amendment bill because it will enhance Australia's ability to export and will encourage business, particularly small and medium enterprise, to participate in an important part of Australia's economy, and that is exporting. This bill will reduce the demand on the scheme. It needs to do that because the previous government, in an unfunded manner, overran the scheme, causing a range of problems in funding years for people who had applied for funding and grants-the budget for this program had actually run out. This is not good enough. It is not satisfactory for business to be placed in those circumstances. The reason we are here debating this bill, the reason we have this amendment, is to fix up a problem left over from the previous government, who saw fit, during a heated election campaign in 2007, to overrun this program without funding that overrun. This amendment bill will increase the minimum requirement for export promotion expenditure from the current $10,000 to $20,000. That will mean that organisations will have to spend $20,000 before they are eligible, before they can apply. I think that is a fair and reasonable beginning point, given that the $10,000 figure has not changed for quite some time. We propose to reduce the maximum number of individual grants that are available to an applicant from eight to seven-a reduction of just one. We also propose to reduce the maximum that is payable per grant from the current $200,000 to $150,000. That will mean there are more grants available for more individual companies and businesses. We also propose to cap the maximum amount claimable for intellectual property expenses at $50,000. Most important is the fact that we will be extending this program for a further five years, giving certainty and confidence to a whole range of mostly small businesses, but some larger ones as well, that rely on these programs to develop their export markets. We need to understand that in its context. It is a grant to help them develop those markets. Once a company can stand on its own feet, once it has established itself overseas in the particular market that it has chosen, then it no longer needs the assistance of the Commonwealth and should be able to make enough profit, have enough revenue from its export markets, that it no longer needs the assistance of the government. The amendments we have placed on the table are fair, equitable and reasonable. They were done in consultation with the sector, and the sector supports them. The sector understands that, if we are to continue this program, the program needs to be checked and measured against expectations and funding. It is never satisfactory that a program is left unchecked or that a government overpromotes and overruns a program deliberately but then does not fund that overrun. I just do not think that is a satisfactory position. We have taken action to do something about this. We have increased the funding that is available, to make amends as best as possible and fund the unfunded liabilities that were left over from the previous government. As I say, these unfunded liabilities were run up close to the election last year. These are good changes. They do provide some certainty. They do provide for an extension of the program by five years. What this program does is build on that contribution that small and medium enterprises make to the nation now. It does provide for a strong export culture to grow even stronger and it helps to reduce that information gap between government organisations and the export markets they are particularly targeting. It is done in coordination and cooperation with Austrade and a range of other government service bodies. Most importantly, if you are a small business owner, it reduces your costs. It means what you actually spend can be reduced because the government will foot part of that bill, which I think is very important. Australia is a competitive export nation. The program is about trying to assist those very important small businesses that we all acknowledge are the backbone of our national economy, the largest employer in the country. It is the small businesses, the mum-and-dad businesses and the unexpected businesses that are very important exporters. It would surprise a lot of people who they are. I have spoken in the past on these grants, because I think they are very important. I recall very early on in my tenure as a member of parliament visiting Claypave, a paver and brick manufacturer, which was then in my electorate but, sadly, is no longer. They are a great local business, a large employer, and they do a fantastic job. It would probably surprise people to understand that a brick manufacturer, a paver manufacturer, would export its product. Bricks are pretty big and heavy. They are not something you would naturally think Australia would export if you think of the labour costs. It is a labour sive production, which would suggest that it was not a viable export product or that exporting a product such as bricks to a nation such as China is counterintuitive, but that is exactly what Claypave do. What they did was differentiate themselves from every other brickmaker in the world with a highquality, well-manufactured, highly labour intensive product and exported it to the rest of the world. They export to China, the United States and the Middle East and they are looking to other markets. I know, because I have spoken to the CEO and the company on many occasions, that a part of their success-it is only a small part-and a part of the confidence they had to go out and spend the R&D and marketing development money they needed to in those markets was due to the federal government standing there behind them with a really good program. We have always been supportive of this program and it is good to have the Minister for Trade, Simon Crean, in the House today speaking on this particular bill. He knows just how important this bill is. That is why these amendments are on the table. We want to make sure that this program not only survives but grows in a properly funded manner and not in the manner that was left behind by the previous government. For our enterprising, innovative companies around the country, the biggest tick of all is that we have extended this program for a further five years. I could not think of a better way to promote a whole range of businesses. Just in case people are listening or later read these speeches, think in just one seat how much impact a grant has. How much impact does it have in a seat like Oxley, which is my seat? I can tell you it is enormous. Over the years I have had dozens of companies not only apply for but also receive grants. I will run quickly through a list. In my electorate I have got companies like intenMajans and Leslie Consulting, which is another incredible story. Bruce Leslie is the proprietor of Leslie Consulting, a mining engineering firm in my electorate. Counterintuitive to what you might think would exist in Goodna, on a small plot in Goodna we have a small firm of highly skilled, highly dedicated individuals that provide services and intellectual property to NASA, to the United States, to German engineering companies and to European mining engineering companies. In South-East Queensland, in a small suburb in Goodna, is this incredible company that is doing global things. Most people who drive past never know that, but it is a great story to tell and I congratulate Lesmercial lie Consulting, Bruce Leslie and his team for the great work they do. They have applied for funding and they obviously deal in export markets. There are companies such as FARMkids, Acoustic Technologies Electronics, Aren Education, Eighteen Hunter Street, Australian Cotton Shippers, Very Small Particle Co - it is not half obvious what they might be into-and companies like Welding Sales, Decina Export, Specialty Products Group, Excel Technology Group, PR Polymers, Global Chef, Tooltech and John Woodward's Australian Finegrain Marble. These companies are in a range of sectors from food manufacturing and product manufacturing to professional services to scientific and technical services, to motion picture and video production, to election equipment manufacturing, to higher education, to toy and sporting goods wholesaling, to cotton growing, to basic chemical product manufacturing, to hardware goods wholesaling and to other basic polymer manufacturing. There is a bit of a pattern building here with lots of manufacturing companies. There are lots of highly skilled, highly trained expertise that small Australian companies are exporting to the rest of the world. We are exporting toy, sporting and recreational product manufacturing, non-metallic mineral mining and quarrying technologies. Companies such as Cooke Freeze, Mox Products, Metal Storm, PR Polymers, Decina Export and a whole range of other companies are all exporting. I wanted to read the names of those companies out and talk briefly about the industries involved not only to demonstrate just how important the program is and the money that is spent on promoting export markets but also to highlight the variety and the manufacturing base of the sorts of companies that you do not see in the headlines and that you do not really see when you drive past comor industrial states or even in parts of suburbia where some of these businesses exist. They are the backbone of this country. They are, in totality, the largest employer by a lot, which would be the easiest way to describe it. Those smalland medium-sized enterprises are the biggest employer in the country. I congratulate the minister for his work in this area, for supporting this very important program and for ensuring its survivability and its sustainability over a long period of time and particularly for extending it for the next five years. I commend the amendment bill to the House.",21
7,Mr CREAN,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"I congratulate the member for Oxley on not only his contribution to this debate but the way in which he has brought home the significance of the EMDG Scheme, what it means, to businesses and smalland medium-sized enterprises in particular within his electorate. The great potential for this nation is our ability to grow our trade. Trade is not just exports, as I will go on to explain. The fact is that trade is the multiplier of economic growth in this nation, and the more we can do to assist more of our people to export and those who already know their potential to export to get into more markets the better off this country will be, in terms of not only economic growth but also job opportunities. I also thank all of the other members who have participated in this debate. In particular I thank the opposition for their support for the amendments that we are proposing in the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2010. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme, the EMDG Scheme, does make a valuable contribution towards building a strong national export culture for this nation. It reduces the information gap about export markets by supporting marketing activities in new markets and it lends a much-needed helping hand to smalland medium-sized enterprises seeking to get into those markets to take advantage of the opportunities through the increasing trade liberalisation and the success of our trade negotiations. The scheme also reduces the financial barrier to exporting, by providing enhanced access to funds. It increases the competitiveness of Australian companies by exposing them to competitive overseas markets, and this in turn forces non-exporting local companies to become more competitive. EFIC's 2009 global readiness index shows that one in five jobs in this country are related to trade; one in seven jobs, to exporting; and one in 10 jobs, to imports. This year, the EMDG Scheme will help support the jobs of over 140,000 workers employed by grant recipients-smalland medium-sized Australian exporters. Analysts have long accepted that companies which export tend to pay higher real wages than non-exporting companies. So not only is trade good for economic growth; it is good for jobs and it is good in terms of its tendency to drive real wages higher. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme is itself a great multiplier: for every dollar spent under the scheme, we generate over $5 in taxpayer benefit, and studies show that EMDG recipients tend to enjoy much greater levels of labour productivity in their workforce. I made the point earlier, but it is worth repeating, that trade is not just about exports; it is also about imports. To underscore this point, many export market development grant recipients highlight the fact that many exporters value-add imported inputs to finished products which are then themselves exported. I will give a few examples. Optalert Pty Ltd manufactures an advanced driver assistance system for use in the mining and transport sector. Up to 70 per cent of inputs are imported, but the company now has exports valued in excess of a million dollars. Data Signs Pty Ltd manufactures traffic signs which incorporate imported solar panels. The company is exporting finished products to markets including the UK and the United Arab Emirates. Heldon Products uses imported gas fittings to manufacture air conditioning components which are then exported to markets including India, the UK and the US. These are all companies supported by the Export Market Development Grants Scheme and all good examples of companies that acquire their inputs through imports; but their competitive advantage, their value-add, is the way they convert that into a value-added commodity for export. This is a government that has demonstrated a genuine and substantial commitment to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. Since we came to office, we have injected an additional $100 million over the past two years, and this has played an important role in helping Australian exporters deal with very tough global conditions. The fact is we did inherit a mess from the coalition government, which was content to introduce guidelines that increased demand on the scheme but did not see fit to provide the extra funding needed to fund those changes. When we made changes to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme on coming to office, we injected the $50 million needed to fund them and we then had to find a further $50 million to fund the coalition's changes. This stands in stark contrast to a coalition that was happy to take the icy option: expand eligibility but do not fund it-once again, a policy low-road approach. But the substantial growth in grant demand in recent years has created a growing imbalance between the scheme's provisions and the funding available under the scheme. The scheme is now out of balance due to a combination of natural growth and increased demand arising from guideline changes introduced by successive governments. Now is the time to restore that balance, and these amendments will rein in future demand on the scheme and lay the foundations for a more sustainable funding model. The changes will move us further along the road towards the goal of building greater certainty into the scheme-this was a specific recommendation of the Mortimer review of trade policy-and industry itself is broadly supportive of the amendments and accepts the need to restore balance to the scheme. I am confident that industry will welcome the moves to put in place a more sustainable funding model for the scheme. I personally remain fully committed to the EMDG, and these amendments will help secure the long term future of the scheme and its role in promoting Australian jobs and Australian exports. Following government actions to address the impact of the global financial crisis, a tight and responsible central budget was called for and in this context the EMDG has had to play its part as well. I remain strongly committed to the future viability of the scheme. These amendments lay the foundation for it. I commend them to the House and I welcome the contributions that have been made to the debate. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",23

9,Mr MCCLELLAND,BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY,"For the information of honourable members. I present a replacement explanatory memorandum for the Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Bill 2010. NA (RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT) BILL 2010 Cognate bill: NA (RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 May, on motion by Dr Emerson: That this bill be now read a second time.",25
10,Ms LEY,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to speak today on Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 and Income Tax Rates Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010. At the time the Rudd government was elected there were four tax incentives for business research and development: the 125 per cent R&D tax concession, the 175 per cent incremental premium concession, the 175 per cent international premium concession and the R&D tax offset. What we are seeing here with the introduction of this legislation by the government is clearly a revenue-raising exercise. The government's publicly stated intent was to offer enhanced incentives for companies to invest in R&D. It claimed that the new R&D tax credit would offer more predictable, less complex and more generous support. Labor has made various concessions since its original announcement. They have included: changes to definitions, the reversal its decision to largely treat software development differently from other forms of R&D activity, the elimination of certain forms of R&D that had originally been placed on an exclusions list, and changes to feedstock rules. However, throughout the process the government has continued to signal its intention to substantially alter the definitions of core and supporting R&D, restrict the eligibility criteria so that supporting R&D will only be funded if it is undertaken for the dominant purpose of supporting core R&D, confer sufficiently vague meaning on the term ‘dominant purpose' so as to render it confusing and subjective, and revise the objects clause to reduce support for spillover and additionality benefits. The government's changes to the eligibility requirements are sweeping and threaten to significantly erode support for R&D investment in Australia. They are also fundamentally inconsistent with Labor's stated intent of making R&D tax support arrangements simpler, more predictable and more generous. Instead, they impose a series of barriers upon firms rather than offering encouragement for innovation. In narrowing the definition of what constitutes genuine R&D the legislation will disqualify from assistance many forms of R&D undertaken by Australian businesses. In turn, the overwhelming expectation of those groups who have launched submissions on the exposure drafts is that Labor's changes will reduce the number of firms qualifying for concession. The proposed definitions of R&D will also foster significant uncertainty and complexity and will impose unnecessary administrative and compliance costs on many firms, especially small and medium enterprises. Indeed, Business Strategies International has advised that it is likely that protracted and expensive legal challenges to the of interpretation of the new definitions will even be initiated in some cases. So, in short, the legislation radically alters a regime that has been operating effectively since the 1980s and does so in a way that disadvantages a large number of Australian businesses. Where companies must currently demonstrate that their R&D activities are novel or have high technical risk, Labor proposes to fund firms only in cases where they can show that they have introduced a wholly new technique, process or solution. Its effect is punitive on a large number of companies whose best innovations are often based upon making refinements to existing practices, as well as the small business sector given that approximately 60 per cent of current applicants are small or medium enterprises. The changes have attracted substantial criticism from a variety of stakeholders. Increased innovation and productivity are both key factors in Australia's future economic success, but this legislation seeks to gut an incentive that is integral to assisting and encouraging a diversity of companies to improve their business operations. Within the last couple of days the Senate committee that inquired into this legislation handed down its report, and there was a comprehensive dissenting report by the coalition senators. I would like to draw on some of the comments made in that report to underline the opposition's feeling and disappointment with this legislation and obviously to underscore the fact that we will be voting against the legislation in the House. The coalition does support increased business investment in research and development and appropriate reforms to legislation to help achieve this outcome. Clearly, we do. We also accept the general principle that changes to the current law may potentially help to achieve a higher R&D rate for a greater number of Australian businesses, but we will not be supporting this bill because of its several significant shortcomings. The first problem area that the coalition senators have drawn people's attention to is the consultation process. Throughout the inquiry, there have been considerable complaints made about the failure of appropriate consultation associated with the legislation. The government has given itself an absurdly short timetable for community consultation and examination by the parliament of what is a fundamentally new approach to the definition of ‘eligible expenditure'. The new approach would apply to all business R&D expenditure undertaken from 1 July 2010. Under the timetable presented, business will have two weeks to examine the new act before R&D spending will come under the new regime. Even putting aside the particular features of the proposed changes, this timetable for introducing a fundamentally new approach will increase the range of grey areas surrounding the tax incentive and the resulting uncertainty will see businesses scale back their expenditure. This outcome sits in stark contrast to the purpose of the R&D tax incentive, which is to encourage additional R&D expenditure by business. A consistent theme of the submissions to the committee's hearings was the inadequate time to digest the key documents associated with the introduction of the bills. Proper consultation with all relevant industry stakeholders over an extended period of time would have, we believe, prevented the numerous problems identified in the coalition senators' report. There is no evidence of any supporting documentation, rulings, regulations, guidelines or forms for the new legislation, and this is really concerning, particularly if the bills are to take effect from 1 July 2010. How can we expect business to pick up on such a complex new regime, with no supporting documentation, in little under a month? It was stated at the hearings that the educational material was still being developed by AusIndustry. The fact is that this legislation is being unnecessarily rushed through the parliament, leaving the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research to prepare education campaigns, regulations and guidelines which have not been adequately tested with industry and stakeholders. This is a totally inappropriate state of affairs when industry is recovering from the global financial crisis and possibly facing further rough times ahead. The first recommendation from the coalition senators' dissenting report is that the start date for these bills be amended to 1 July 2011. Let us at least give it 12 months. An additional result of the hasty development of the bills was numerous drafting errors, as well as inconsistencies between the explanatory memorandum and the bills as identified in several submissions. We continue to be alarmed at the regular drafting errors that keep coming up in the Rudd government's legislation. This is hardly surprising, given that there is such limited time between drafting and introduction. In no way do I blame the parliamentary draftspeople, who do an excellent job, but time is necessary and time is clearly not being made available to them. The second recommendation the coalition senators made is that the passage of the bills be delayed in order to rectify those drafting errors. I would now like to move to the substantive problems with the legislation itself, centring on the definitions of ‘core' and ‘supporting R&D'. This bill substantially alters the definitions of core and supporting R&D. In narrowing the definition of what constitutes genuine R&D, the bill will disqualify from assistance many forms of R&D undertaken by Australian businesses. In turn, the overwhelming expectation of the groups who have lodged submissions on the exposure drafts is that the government's changes will reduce the number of firms who will qualify for the concession. There will be particularly grave consequences for firms focused on industrial R&D and other non-white lab coat activities, including those involved in manufacturing, prototyping and process development. This was well explained in a submission to the Senate committee by Michael Johnson Associates. They explained that the problem with the new definition was that ter aligned with the Frascati Manual definition as had previously been contended by Treasury. In fact, the eligibility of the third limb of the Frascati definition, ‘experimental development,' is in real doubt. R&D expenditure and concessions have been built on this definition for as long as I can remember. There is a very narrow definition of a ‘core activity', ‘experimental work', ‘unknown outcomes', ‘new knowledge' and then there are a range of choices as to what ‘supporting activity' might be, with a strong flavour that anything in a production environment is in danger of not being eligible. It is those trials that could be unable to be claimed. Certain companies, when they look at this definition, believe that the majority of what they do is core and that their claims might be able to be sustained in this environment, but other companies look at this definition and say that a lot of what they do is in a production context-hence, the considerable confusion. The second and central basis for the coalition senators' strong opposition to this new approach to defining eligible business R&D is that it is highly restrictive. As I said, approximately 25 years our R&D tax incentive has been based on what is known as the Frascati model, which has been developed under the auspices of the OECD over a number of decades. Under this model R&D is defined as: … creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications. The second part of the definition-‘the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications'-is central to the objections that many people have made about this new approach proposed by the government. The objects clause of the bill states that it is to encourage industry to conduct research and it is not bet- development activities: … by providing a tax incentive for industry to conduct in a scientific way experimental activities for the purpose of generating new knowledge or information in either a general or applied form. So, critically, this clause omits the second critical element in the Frascati approach: ‘the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications'. Similarly problematic is the ‘supporting R&D activities' definition in the bill. This was raised with considerable concern in several submissions and I understand it was followed up quite substantially during the hearings. The Australian Industry Group pointed out two major concerns with the definition of supporting R&D: Firstly, supporting R&D expenditure is only eligible if it is ether “directly related to” core R&D activities or if it is “undertaken for the dominant purpose of supporting” core R&D activities. This means that businesses would have to be undertaking core R&D before any of its R&D expenditure could qualify as supporting R&D expenditure. If a business has no expenditure that qualifies as core R&D, it will have no eligible R&D expenditure. for Secondly, in any case much experimental development is neglected by the dominant purpose test in the definition of supporting R&D activities. In the Bill (s355-30), a supporting R&D activity is defined as an activity directly related to core R&D activities except if it is an activity that is: explicitly excluded, or if it is an activity that “produces goods or services”, or if it is an activity “is directly related to producing goods or services”. In any of these cases the expenditure needs to be undertaken for “the dominant purpose of” supporting core R&D activities. So the third recommendation of the dissenting report of the committee is: The Coalition recommends that the definitions of core and supporting R&D be reconsidered to be more closely aligned to the Frascati model of R&D. Another area of concern is the eligibility criteria. The government's changes to the eligibility requirements are sweeping and they threaten to significantly erode support for R&D investment in Australia. They are also fundamentally inconsistent with the government's stated intent of making R&D tax support arrangements simpler, more predictable and more generous. Instead, they impose a series of barriers upon firms rather than offering encouragement for innovation. The major concern was the use of the term ‘dominant purpose'. Several witnesses at these hearings expressed concern about what the term actually meant. In submissions and during the hearings, there was evidence of continual and considerable confusion about what was meant by ‘dominant purpose'. The introduction of the dominant purpose test appears to be a large impost on businesses. As KPMG said in their submission: The overwhelming feedback from our diverse client base indicates that a “dominant purpose” test will exclude a large proportion of production trial activity that is a necessary and legitimate part of the research and development cycle. If the aim is to contain the cost to revenue associated with large and open-ended production trials, the introduction of a cap on the total value of the group's R&D claim would better achieve this objective, whilst also providing clarity and simplicity for claimants. The dominant purpose test should be removed as it imposes an unnecessarily high threshold as evidenced in the EM, and does not target the minority of excessive claims which the Government purports are occurring. Several alternative models were suggested, such as ‘a purpose directly related to' test; a ‘substantial purpose' test; apportionment of expenditure; dollar-capping the extent of production trials on the total value of the R&D claim, or on eligible R&D expenditure, for companies with group annual revenue exceeding a billion dollars; using more sympathetic language; specific provisions for specific excesses; time limits for trials; and pre-approvals for projects above certain values. All of those are options, either individually or in combination. So recommendation 4 was: The Coalition recommends that the dominant purpose test be removed and be reconsidered. The last area of technical objection concerns the object clause. The object clause needs to be revised in respect of spillover and additionality benefits. The object clause currently reads: (1) The object of this Division is to encourage industry to conduct research and development activities that might otherwise not be conducted because of an uncertain return from the activities, in cases where the knowledge gained is likely to benefit the wider Australian economy. (2) This object is to be achieved by providing a tax incentive for industry to conduct, in a scientific way, experimental activities for the purpose of generating new knowledge or information in either a general or applied form. It was pointed out that this definition is much more restrictive and could impact on Australian industry. The Corporate Tax Association said: While those concepts may be well and good, they are impossible to prove and therefore should not be part of the statutory framework-even as part of an objects clause. Such language might well be appropriate for a second reading speech but, in our view, does not belong in the law itself. We would much prefer the objects clause to make reference to increasing the efficiency and international competitiveness of Australian business, which reflects what we regard as the proper rationale for the incentive. The fifth recommendation of the coalition senators is: The Coalition recommends that the Object clause be amended to ensure that both research and development are given equal tax benefits. In short, this bill radically alters a regime that has been operating effectively since the 1980s and alters it in a way that disadvantages a large number of Australian businesses. While companies must currently demonstrate that their R&D activities are novel or have high technical risk, this government essentially proposes to fund firms only in cases in which they can show they have introduced a wholly new technique, process or solution. Its effect is punitive on a large number of companies whose best innovations are often based upon making refinements to existing practices, as well as on the small-business sector, given that approximately 60 per cent of current applicants are small or medium enterprises. Together, the proposed changes to elements of the legislation, such as the definition of R&D activities, the dominant purpose test for supporting activities, the registration processes and the feedstock rules, will have an effect opposite to the government's stated intentions of providing greater generosity, predictability and simplicity. They will disadvantage rather than benefit most Australian companies intending to undertake R&D. The changes have attracted substantial criticism from a wide diversity of stakeholders, including major organisations. This is notwithstanding that during the development process of this legislation there were changes made that did meet with the approval of those stakeholders. Those changes did not, however, answer all the stakeholder concerns. The government itself implicitly acknowledges a large number of potential problems with the legislation, including drafting errors and definitional concerns. It is not appropriate that bills be rushed through when they contain such errors and therefore give rise to considerable uncertainty. Reviewing elements of bills after three years is not an appropriate means of addressing problems of the kind that are evident in this legislation. A more practical step would be to make sure they are more appropriately drafted in the first place. I am not reflecting on wasting the parliament's time when we have to fix up poorly drafted legislation but on wasting the efforts and the energy of small businesses, who will often back away if they do not understand and cannot conclude that they fit into a published set of criteria and cannot be confident that, if they make an investment, they will get the R&D tax benefit they seek. Increased innovation and productivity are both key factors in Australia's future economic success, but as I said earlier these bills do damage to an incentive that is important in assisting and encouraging a great array of our wonderful small and medium enterprises to improve their business operations. The coalition will not be supporting these bills.",25
11,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010. It should not come as a surprise to anyone in the community that the opposition is opposed to this legislation. This is an opposition that is opposed to a two per cent cut in the company tax for all businesses. It is an opposition that wants to put a new tax on businesses as well. The fact that it has taken a position opposed to what is a very beneficial piece of legislation that is supportive business should not come as a surprise to any of us here. Indeed, the opposition is the worse friend that business has ever had and it is demonstrating that again here today with its opposition to these bills. These bills implement the government's new tax incentive for research and development to replace the existing R&D tax concessions. The new R&D tax incentive is about boosting investment in research and development, strengthening Australian companies to become more innovative, productive and prosperous, and creating jobs for the future. I want to talk little bit about producity. tivity for a moment. I would have expected the member for Farrer, who is a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics which recently delivered a report on this subject, to have made a more meaningful contribution in this debate. Unfortunately, the position of the opposition really is to oppose everything and we again had a demonstration of that today. I recently had the pleasure of presenting the Standing Committee on Economics report entitled: Inquiry into raising the producergy, tivity growth rate in the Australian economy. Over the past decade, Australia's productivity growth has slowed considerably. Average annual labour productivity growth fell from 2.1 per cent in the 1990s to around 1.4 per cent in the 2000s. Compared to other countries in the OECD, Australia's average annual productivity growth has performed relatively well since 1985, approximating the OECD average and ranking 12th, one below the US. But the productivity growth rate has been in decline since the 2003-04 productivity cycle, with growth rates averaging minus 0.2 per cent per year. What would it mean if we were to increase our productivity again? An increase in productivity growth rates would mean a larger economy, higher living standards, and a of reduction of the fiscal pressure from ageing. It is useful to remind ourselves of this simple fact: if we were to boost productivity growth from an average of 1.6 per cent to two per cent a year and sustain this over the next 40 years, real GDP per person would be around 15 per cent higher. That is equivalent to raising living standards by $16,000 a year in today's dollars by 2050 for every man, woman and child in Australia. Given that increasing productivity is one of the desired outcomes of the new research and development tax incentive, it is pertinent to talk about how we can increase productivProductivity growth was responsible for 80 per cent of the increase in our incomes over the past 40 years, but achieving this higher average productivity growth will not be easy. It will take the right investment and effort and it also requires all sectors of the economy to work together to achieve this goal. The government has a broad agenda to increase Australia's productivity including: investment in critical nation-building infrastructure such as roads, rail, ports, clean enwater, and health and education infrastructure including computers and trade training centres in schools; investment in skills and human capital, including measures to enhance teacher quality, the early childhood quality education agenda, and investment to achieve ambitious targets for higher education attainment rates; support for innovation in critical areas, including innovation by business, collaboration between private and public sector researchers and investing in the research capabilities of our universities and public research agencies; economic reform, including reducing business costs from regulation and tax reform as part of this government's response to the Australia's Future Tax System Review. Productivity-enhancing reforms, particularly through nation-building infrastructure and improving the skills base, will grow the economy, improve living standards and partly offset the fiscal pressures of ageing. By growing the economy we increase our capacity to meet the fiscal costs of ageing without increasing the overall tax burden on working Australians. The best way to grow the economy is to maintain our focus on productivity and on investing in skills and infraper structure-nation building, the education revolution and regulatory and tax reform to underpin productivity growth in the decades to come. Building productivity, of course, is not just a challenge for government. Ultimately, it is Australian workers and businesses that will deliver higher productivity by skilling themselves up, tooling up, and working smarter. With an ageing population, productivity growth is the key driver of future growth prospects. Reforms that reduce barriers to participation will also lift growth and reduce future pressures. Steps to grow the economy and ensure permanent spending growth is sustainable, including through the implementation of the government's fiscal strategy, will reduce future adjustment costs and the economic and fiscal consequences of ageing. Of course, the bills I am speaking on today will do a number of things besides offering better incentives to Australian firms for increasing productivity. The new research and development tax incentive provides more generous benefits and is better targeted towards R&D that benefits Australia than the existing concession. It redistributes support in favour of small and medium firms which are more responsive to fiscal incentives. It provides cash upfront to small innovative firms, giving them the certainty they need to invest in growing their business. It is also substantially simpler and accompanied by improved administrative arrangements. The new R&D tax incentive replaces the existing R&D tax concession for all income years starting on or after 1 July 2010. The two core components of the new incentive are a 45 per cent refundable R&D tax offset for eligible entities with a turnover of less than $20 million, which is small and medium enterprises, and a non-refundable 40 cent R&D tax offset for all other eligible entities. This doubles the base rate of existing support for small and medium enterprises and raises the base rate for larger firms by a third. Instead of receiving 7.5c in every dollar, small and medium enterprises will receive 15c for every dollar and larger firms will receive 10c for every dollar. The new refundable tax offset provision makes upfront cash support available to more small and medium-size companies. The new refundable tax offset is available to corporations with turnover under $20 million. Under the current law, a refundable tax offset is only available to corporations with an annual group turnover of less than $5 million whose group aggregate R&D expenditure is not more than $2 million per year. The government aims to lift Australia's R&D performance through increasing the number of businesses undertaking R&D. There are two million businesses in Australia and only around 8,000 of these businesses benefit from the current R&D tax concession. The government's intention is for the higher rates of reward under the new incentives to attract more firms to the program. It is fairly obvious that a very small proportion of Australian businesses-only 8,000 out of two million-are taking advantage of the current R&D tax concession. Without a doubt we need to encourage many more businesses into R&D and this legislation will help towards that end. This legislation also tightens up the scheme of R&D tax concessions. The existing scheme is allowing some companies to use taxpayer dollars to subsidise ‘business usual' activities rather than research and development activities. It appears from the member for Farrer's contributions she is keen to ensure this continues. The government has a responsibility, however, to deliver value for money for taxpayers through better targeting of the scheme. This has been achieved in the new legislation through a more focussed definition of eligible R&D activities. The new definition of core R&D activities still covers both research and development activities. A common misperception-and one that the member for Farrer tried to perpetuate-is that the new incentive excludes R&D activities carried out in a production environment. It is not true that production trials are effectively excluded by the dominant purpose test. Manufacturers will still able to claim core R&D activities that fall within the definition of an experiment generated for the purpose of acquiring new knowledge. The dominant purpose test only applies to supporting R&D activities that are production activities. The explanatory memorandum emphasises that the fact that an activity serves a commercial objective as well as being directly related to R&D does not preclude it from qualifying as supporting R&D. The government has undertaken-despite what the member for Farrer said-an extensive consultation process, including inviting public submissions on a consultation paper and two exposure drafts of legislation. The government has received over 380 submissions during these three rounds of consultation and has held public hearings attended by 550 people. In addition, there have been extensive discussions with key industry representatives and advisers over almost a year. So for the member for Farrer to say that this legislation is rushed is simply not true and a misrepresentation of what occurred in what as was a very extensive consultation process. During this consultation process the government has made some significant changes where stakeholders have made constructive suggestions for improvement. In particular, the definition of core R&D is now simpler and the dominant purpose test for supporting R&D has been limited to production activities and activities on the exclusions list. The government has decided not to enact the widely criticised ‘augmented feedstock' rule that was set out in the first exposure draft legislation. The government still plans for the new R&D tax incentive to start on 1 July 2010. Although some industry groups have called for its introduction to be delayed for a year-as the member for Farrer did-a delay would mean that many Australian companies would not get the very substantial benefits be that the new scheme offers, with a doubling of benefits and cash upfront to smaller firms. Introducing the new incentive is critical to Australia's future, to enhancing productivity, to making us more competitive and to creating new wealth and jobs. Stakeholders in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have been supportive of the new incentive and are keen to see the new R&D tax incentive enacted as soon as possible. The information technology industry has also welcomed the revised approach to software R&D. The government provided $38 million in the 2009-10 budget to ensure that AusIndustry and the ATO are equipped to assist taxpayers in adjusting to the new scheme. AusIndustry will provide guidance and educational material to industry, including specific information on those industry sectors in which there is the most concernmanufacturing and mining. Research is critical to Australia's prosperthat ity. That is why this government has committed itself to a program of renewal and reform for Australian innovation and research. Our overarching goal is to create a stronger, fairer and more productive Australia. We must be a country where individuals, communities and industries all benefit from the fruits of research and innovation. This government is helping boost R&D performance, encouraging researchers and industry to collaborate in ways that make both more competitive, and helping translate new ideas and technologies into high-skilled, high-wage jobs. Australia does a lot of research and much of that research is brilliant. In recent years we ranked 11th in the world for output of research papers and ninth in the world for total citations. We averaged ten citations per paper, which puts us in the top 20 internationally and which most people would agree represents a pretty high impact. But is this good enough? Can we do better? China and India have become research superpowers in a relatively short time and we need to be aware of that competition. China is increasing its total expenditure on R&D as a share of GDP by eight or nine per cent a year. In Australia, it is only one or two per cent. India lifted its spending on academic research by 180 per cent in the seven years to 2005. Not only do we need to lift our productivity growth, but we also need to increase our overall research. If there are to be more new jobs and new economic opportunities, there has to be also a dramatic increase in collaboration between universities and industry. This is one of the great weaknesses of our innovation system and an area in which we fell further behind under the previous government. Australia ranked 16th out of 28 OECD countries for research collaboration between industry and universities in 1997. By 2004, we had fallen 10 places to be last out of 26 countries. ABS data for 2006-07 suggests less than one per cent of Australian firms get information or ideas for innovation from universities. Australian businesses will receive a significant boost in support for research and development under the new R&D tax incentive legislation about which I am speaking at the moment. This important reform will encourage more Australian companies to engage in R&D, providing Australians with the high-end technologies and skills needed to compete in a competitive global market. This will make Australian companies more innovative, productive and prosperous and position them to create jobs for the future. This government is replacing a complex and outdated R&D tax concession with a simplified R&D tax credit that gives business better incentives to invest in research and development. The scheme will stimulate more of Australia's two million businesses to undertake research and development-rather than just the 8,000 businesses that benefit from the current concession. The R&D tax credit doubles the incentive for small and medium enterprises-the engine room of the economy-while increasing by a third the incentive for big business to undertake R&D. Small innovative firms will be the big winners from the new R&D tax credit, with greater access to cash refunds for their R&D expenditure and more generous rates of assistance. The R&D tax credit will focus on supporting genuine R&D and be worth $1.5 billion a year to industry. These bills deliver one of the biggest improvements to public support for business innovation in over a decade. Small companies have greater access to cash refunds and a higher base rate of assistance being provided through the new 45 per cent refundable tax offset. Large companies can invest knowing they can claim a non-refundable tax offset of 40 per cent of their expenditure on eligible R&D activities. The new R&D tax incentive better focuses public support towards activities likely to produce economy-wide benefits. This will ensure that the new R&D tax incentive rewards a company's genuine R&D, not business-as-usual activities, as proposed by the member for Farrer. The new R&D tax incentive is an important part of the government's plan to encourage knowledge-creating and knowledge-using industries to boost productivity and activity in all sectors of the economy. I commend the bills to the House.",30
12,Mr FLETCHER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"When I gave my maiden speech to the House in February this year, I mentioned key policy areas in which I hoped over time to be a voice for change. One of the areas I spoke about was the process of commercialisation of innovation-that is, moving smart ideas from the laboratory to the market place. In my speech at that time. I mentioned that I saw this as requiring: … closer ties between research institutions and industry … choosing key areas of research where we can build real scale and leverage that into national competitive advantage. In addition, the emphasis on the commercialisation stage is very important to bear in mind and goes to perhaps one of the key differences between the coalition and the government on this legislation, which seems to embody a philosophy which fails to recognise the importance of the commercialisation phase and fails to recognise the relative importance of the development phase, as contrasted to the research phase. I want to pay particular tribute to the Howard government Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston, for whom I worked. Senator Alston had a deep interest in the issues of innovation and commercialisation. It was a privilege to work with him and others, including Neville Stevens, the then secretary of his department, David Quilty, his then chief of staff, and indeed Dr Terry Cutler, who was an important informal adviser on these issues. Dr Cutler's name is prominent in this policy area as the author of one of the key reports which influences the policy changes put forward today. It is unfortunate perhaps that the connection between Dr Cutler's recommendations and the specific policy changes appears to be less direct than it ought to be. It is very disappointing that the legislation before the House is flawed in its approach to re-engineering the mechanism of concessions for Australian businesses for research and development. This legislation does not give effect to the theme which the Labor Party took to the 2007 campaign of promoting innovation. Its substantive effect is quite at odds with what is claimed and in fact winds back support for research and development in Australia. It is certainly true that Australia's research and development levels are running at below a the OECD average and the objective of increasing research and development levels is one which all of us support. The key issue before the House is whether the mechanism proposed in this legislation is going to be effective in encouraging research and development. On this side of the House, we are clearly of the view that it will not be effective. It is important to understand the context for the current research and development tax concession and the way it has worked in practice. It has been an important mechanism to support business expenditure on research and development. The Australian Industry Group, in one of its submissions during the process of developing these bills, had this to say: The case for public support of business research and development arises because of the direct and indirect spillovers that arise when the full value that flows from the expenditure is not captured by the businesses making the expenditures but part of which flow to other parties … Without public support, the total quantity of business expenditure undertaken would be less than the socially optimum level. It is clear that inherent in that is the notion of a public good and it is well accepted that an appropriate area of public policy activity by a government is to encourage public goods because, for the reasons the Australian Industry Group has articulated, private players may not sufficiently act to encourage those goods themselves. The existing research and development incentive arrangements consist of four elements: the basic 125 per cent tax concession; the 175 per cent premium concession; the 175 per cent international premium concession, and the refundable R&D offset for small companies. The Rudd government's stated aims are to make the R&D tax support arrangements simpler, more predictable and more generous. None of these aims, regrettably, has been achieved in this bill. One of the things that are particularly striking is the profound internal contradictions between the two major reports that have been used by the government as the basis for these legislative changes. There was the Productivity Commission report, which was released in 2007, which concluded that the basic 125 per cent tax concession was failing in its purpose as it gave concessions in relation to R&D that would have happened anyway. I do not express a view as to the merits of that conclusion; I just note that there is a contradiction between the underlying philosophy of the 2007 Productivity Commission report and the review that was conducted in 2008 by Dr Terry Cutler, of whom I spoke earlier. He is a man who has been involved in policymaking in this area for many years. Objective observers have described Dr Cutler's recommendations as being the polar opposite of the Productivity Commission report. He recommended an increase in the base concession, a greater concession available for smaller entities and a closure of the incremental provisions. When the government first responded in May 2009, in its Powering ideas statement, it supported the move to a tax credit. But the story then got very murky as the Treasury got involved in the consultation process, issuing a paper in September 2009 and exposure drafts in December 2009 and March 2010. The Treasury's paper seemed to revert to the Productivity Commission approach of substantially tightening up eligibility criteria for the tax concessions. It is important to note that the Productivity Commission conceded that its proposals for restricting the scope of the concession would increase administrative and compliance costs and that there would be unforeseen consequences. One industry participant I have spoken to expressed the view that the September 2009 paper could have been written based wholly on the Productivity Commission report, as it makes so little reference in substantive terms to what was recommended by Dr Cutler. It is for this and other reasons that a number of industry observers have asked whether this is simply a revenue measure in substance, designed to reduce the amount of tax expenditure in this area, and that that is the overriding policy objective as opposed to stimulating research and development. The key provisions in this bill create a 45 per cent refundable tax credit for entities with a turnover of less than $20 million and a 40 per cent non-refundable tax credit for all other eligible entities. But there is an tant sting in the tail: this bill brings a new and more restrictive regime to determine eligible research and development activity. The bill creates two key categories for eligibility, being core research and development activity; and supporting research and development activity. There are very significant problems with both of these definitions. Many industry participants have made that point, including the Australian Industry Group. It has been widely pointed out that the and the new provisions that it introduces are not consistent with the Frascati definition of research and development, which has been the basis for the approach used by the OECD in this area for decades. Under that approach, research and development is defined as ‘creative work undertaken on a systemic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humanity, culture and society, and the use of this stock to devise new applications'. Importantly, under the existing arrangements in Australia consistent with this definito tion, research and development includes both creating new knowledge and using existing knowledge to create new applications. The problem with the approach that the bill takes is that it limits, in both its objects and its specific provisions, the availability of the credit for activities that are undertaken for the purpose of ‘acquiring new knowledge or information'. In other words, this bill involves a clear shift to put a greater emphasis on research and a reduced emphasis on development. We do not believe that that is a good policy approach. It removes from the application of the credit a key aspect of what research and development involves-what in the Frascati model is called ‘experimental development' which is defined as, ‘Systemic work, drawimporing on existing knowledge gained from research and/or practical experience, which is directed to producing new materials, products or devices, to installing new processes, systems and services, or to improving substantially those already produced or installed.' In other words, under the bill, novelty becomes a prerequisite, and the use of existing knowledge to develop new applications is rejected. The bill seeks to address this concern with the notion of ‘supporting R&D activity' but bill the definition of that term is so circumscribed that most observers believe it is going to be very difficult to take advantage of it. A whole range of activities are specifically excluded-for example, an activity that produces goods or services or an activity that is directly related to producing goods and services. In addition, there is an overarching test that the activity must be for the ‘dominant purpose' of supporting core research and development activities. This dominant purpose test effectively operates to kill off any application of the credit experimental development. Some experts have pointed out that it is difficult to envisage a situation where a supporting activity would not fall within one of these exemptions and thus be barred from eligibility for the credit. There is, in addition, real uncertainty as to what this new term ‘dominant purpose' means. Heather Ridout, of the Australian Industry Group, has called the new approach deeply flawed and says that it will significantly reduce innovation. Indeed, the Australian Industry Group commented in its submission: In a manufacturing environment, research and development is necessarily heavily biased towards development in a live production environment-whether that be to commercialise research into new marketable products, to improve existing products, or to improve the efficiency of manufacturing processes. All of these activities are essential in order to remain competitive mature global industry, continue to export, and compete against imports. Another party making submissions on this bill estimated that 60 per cent of their activities would no long be eligible under the new definition. It is also noteworthy that that 2007 Productivity Commission report to which I referred earlier found that 61 per cent of business research and development was experimental development-that is, drawing on existing knowledge. In other words, there is a huge area of ground which has now been excluded from being eligible for the tax credit. So we are at risk of moving from a regime which provides incentives for research and development to a regime which simply provides incentives for research. Therefore, one has to be very sceptical about the government's real motives for this legislation, particularly given the strong involvement of the Treasury in the final form of the legislation. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the primary motivation is to achieve cost savings. An additional aspect of this legislation which is deeply troubling is that the consultation process has been wholly inadequate. It is interesting how often that is the theme of the Rudd government. The timetable for these proposals was completely absurd. The first draft exposure bill was released just before Christmas. There were very substantial rewrites and a second draft exposure bill was released with entire concepts having been altered. The new regime is supposed to take effect on 1 July-that is, in less than 15 days. The bills have not even been passed. A Senate committee inquiring into this matter reported only one or two days ago. So we have flawed policy and policy which has been developed with inadequate consultation. We also have policy which has a substantive effect which is quite different to the government's rhetoric-once again a in a clear theme in the way the Rudd government operates. What we have seen, regrettably, is an all too clear example of the atrocious process that characterises the way that the Rudd government operates. In substance, what we are seeing is a bill which introduces a complete change to a regime that has operated effectively for quite a number of years to provide tax incentives for research and development activity. The way in which the changes have been introduced has maximised confusion and uncertainty in the sectors that rely upon this research and development tax concession. The underlying substantive policy impacts of this legislation do not conform to the government's rhetoric and its stated objectives, so it is no wonder that amongst the comments which have been made by expert observers about this legislation is the following: The R&D tax concession was broad-based and available to every company. With this nonsensical and complex piece of legislation, they are killing it. That comment comes from a KPMG partner. A tax partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers described this legislation as ‘a kick in the guts for business'. The Dean of Business at the University of Technology Sydney, Roy Green, was quoted in the Australian Financial Review as saying the proposal ‘seems mainly designed to bring about cost savings on support for large corporate R&D budgets'. The CEO of the Australian Information Industry Association has stated: … the whole success of the NBN rests on the value-added services to be delivered on the back of the network. This is a huge area of opportunity that will be stifled by the proposed changes to R&D that limit what software companies can claim. Without expressing any additional views on the merits of the NBN-my views on that topic are well known-I would simply point out that that is yet another piece of evidence of the internal contradictions which are absolutely rife in this legislation. The fact is that its substantive effect will be at odds with its stated purpose. The fact is that the regime of consultation which has occurred has been wholly inadequate and has left most interested parties frustrated and disappointed that their expertise has been disregarded. The fact is that we have, in substance, a piece of legislation which not only is not going to achieve the stated objectives but in fact, on all of the evidence, appears designed to achieve a quite different set of objectives. Sadly, this is a story which is all too common under the Rudd government, where we hear one stated policy objective but the actual substance of what is done is quite the opposite. For these and many other reasons, the coalition is not supporting this legislation.",35
13,The SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Order! The question is that this bill be now read a second time. Before calling the member for Canberra, I understand that it is the desire of the House that there be no points of order during the speech. I call the member for Canberra.",39
14,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Wouldn't it be good if that happened all the time! It is indeed a challenge for me to do justice to almost 15 years in this place in just over 15 minutes. But I suppose I cannot complain about the constraint, given the opportunities I have had over those years to burden our long-suffering Hansard reporters with just under 250 speeches and 40 questions without notice, which I suppose is something I can claim a little pride in. I have to admit, though, that there are probably a lot of people with a higher record than mine-but I have left that to others to prove! I would like to reflect on these 15 years and, in doing so, I would like to thank a few people. The first thankyou, of course, is to the people of my electorate of Canberra. It is such a special place and it is easy to love every part of it. In this ancestral land of the Ngunawal people, from the Gordon Valley, under the eaves of the snow capped Brindabellas-and they have been of late-to the rural areas to the south, through the picturesque Tuggeranong and Woden valleys and Weston Creek, right into the old heart of the city and the inner south, it is a very beautiful place of idyllic family living, a free and relaxed city, confident in itself and proud of its place at the heart of the democracy of the nation. But it is the double-sided nature of Canberra, the city and the seat of government, which makes it a special place, and this is a subject that I would like to come back to a little later. I thank my fellow Canberrans for the trust they have placed in me. I can genuinely say that representing them in this place has been pretty special. I want to thank the people of the ACT Labor Party. Of course, Bill Hayden famously said, ‘Hell hath no fury compared to the ACT ALP.' The real quote, of course, is: ‘Hell hath no fury compared to a woman scorned.' Well, I am glad to say that neither quote described my experience. In fact, on both counts, the contrary is very much the case. The ACT branch is a wonderfully loyal and talented part of the ALP that makes a major contribution to the federal party in so many different ways. It has been a great honour to be their choice to represent the people of Canberra and I thank them for their support. I have been fortunate to enjoy wonderful support from so many gifted and generous individuals over my career. Sadly, I cannot and will not try to list all of them here, so I want to thank all of my supporters, both inside and outside the party, who have done so much to help me over my 15 years as the member for Canberra and, originally, the member for Namadgi. I want to issue a special thanks to the members of Centre Coalition, my own party grouping; to the trade unions in the ACT, whose support I have always valued; and most especially, of course, to my own staff through all of the years who have worked so tirelessly and effectively for me on both the bright and the darker days. I want to thank the member for Fraser and Senator Kate Lundy. Bob and Kate and I have formed what I would call an effective triumvirate in this territory, and I am happy to think we have grown to four recently with Mike Kelly in Eden-Monaro not that far away. I want to thank the previous longserving member for Canberra, Ros Kelly, for her encouragement and her strong mentoring role. I also need and want to recall the contribution of Terry Connolly, a close friend and former Attorney-General in the ACT who, sadly, passed away three years ago. I came to this place at an immense time of change in Australia. A long period of Labor government had come to a stark end and a new period of uncertainty was emerging in Australian political life. I want to remind the House of the shock the people of Canberra had to face through significant Public Service cutbacks at the time which caused considerable pain for many of my constituents and saw this community plunge into a recession. It was indeed a very challenging time. I also recall the manner in which a former member for Oxley announced the arrival of the One Nation Party on the national scene. But Labor's response to this time of uncertainty was defined by the tremendous campaign waged by federal Labor under Kim Beazley in 1998, when we actually won the popular vote. Difficult times followed, with the tough debate on the GST legislation and the stressful period of East Timorese independence, but Labor remained a strong and effective opposition and our electoral prospects looked positive in 2001. Then came the flow of asylum seekers, and the infamous Tampa incident on that fateful dawn of 24 August 2001. Then there was the ‘children overboard' affair-in my view, one of the darkest days of government in Australia, eventually leading later to the tragic so called ‘Pacific solution' to deal with the issue of asylum seekers. As I reflect on this period and the long cold years of opposition that followed it, I cannot but conclude that Australia seemed to retreat in on itself a little. The great compassionate element to the Australian personality, which I cherish and see as crucial to the national personality, seemed to grow just a little dimmer over those years. Although overall these were very tough times for those on this side, there were some extremely rewarding things occurring for me. I was given the opportunity to come to the shadow ministry, with responsibility at different times for family and community services, ageing, seniors and disabilities. I am very grateful for the confidence my colleagues placed in me to hold those important roles. I had the opportunity to push the social justice concerns which I am passionate about and, I believe, position the ALP fairly well in policy terms. I would like to leave a message here today. I think Australia is still coming to terms with the issue of disability. There is a need for an increased consciousness in the nation of the enormous challenges that those with disabilities face and the incredible strains placed on those that care for them. There is no doubt that, over time, decisions have been taken to help improve opportunities and life participation for those living with disability. However, they need more support from us, the Australian community, and we need to work more closely with them to deal with the immense practical day-today challenges that they face. I do not in any way wish to diminish the gains made and the work that has been done. But there is a need for a change in national consciousness and I hope that I, along with colleagues, have played some small part in assisting this. A courageous policy response is also called for. We do need to think seriously about a national disability insurance scheme, federally funded as Medicare is. Such a scheme would be a significant change, but it has to be placed firmly on the debate for social policy reform in this country. We now await the Productivity Commission inquiry, which is due to report in July 2011. I want to make a few other points which I think are really important. I do not think there is a political cookie cutter that you use to cut out the shape of the perfect politito cian. If so, it certainly wasn't used on me! But my point is that there is no one profile for success in this place. I entered this parliament slightly further along the age scale than many-well, not many, but some-and without the perceived advantage of a tertiary education. I carry these two elements with a certain sense of pride and I encourage others out there to consider what they might do. Also, I loved very much being on Labor's front bench but I also loved the work that I have done as a normal parliamentarian. I reckon there is a bit of a mentality around that unless you have got to sit up the front then you have not really made it. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",39
15,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Those who haven't are all here, hearing from me! Honourable members-Hear, hear!",41
16,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I do not agree with that at all. Some of the best things I have done to serve this House have been in the committee work I have been involved with. I have certainly done my fair share. I calculate that I have served to some degree on around 50 inquiries. I want to mention two, but before I do I want to take the opportunity to thank the incredibly professional committee staff that we have in this place. Their calibre is incredibly high and, may I say, there are not enough of them. We need to pay attention to that. The 2½-year inquiry into Indigenous health, leading to the Health is life report in 2000, was in my view a significant turning point in facing up to the scandal of Indigenous health in Australia. It was a long and difficult journey and I know that it changed the attitudes of the members in this House who were involved. I was also very fortunate to chair the inquiry into the challenges facing carers and their support needs. I am glad to can say that the report's key recommendationincrease financial assistance for carershas been acted on by this government, along with other important recommendations. Of course, there is always much still to be done. Another great privilege I enjoyed in this place was to see the apology given so eloquently by the Prime Minister to the victims of the stolen generation. I know that all those around me were, like me, deeply aware of the power of the moment, the quiet sacredness of it and the real healing that it can and will lead to and has led to. This of course flowed from the excellent Bringing them home report, which we on this side read into the Hansard through the adjournment debate back in 1997, if I recall, because the government of the day would not allow us to debate it. But where I want to conclude is to return to where, of course, it all counts the most: my work in the electorate. I have been asked many times lately what has been my biggest or best achievement during this career. I look at it in a slightly different way. It has been a privilege to be able to assist individuals or families or local organisations within my community in a very personal way at times. No matter the issue, if you are able to guide them through difficult times or circumstances, to me that is the great achievement. So there have been thousands of great achievements. Over the years, people have shared their private and personal stories with me, and I have to thank them for their trust and confidence in so doing. As well, I must recall that fateful Saturday in 2003-and I look at the member for MCEwen as I do this-when this city was under terrible threat. The Canberra bushfires were a shocking and horrendous experience, but we saw the best in people at the same time. I had the privilege of being appointed to the ACT Chief Minister's bushfire recovery community reference committee and worked very closely with a variety of community representatives for over 18 months. The bushfire recovery response processes established by the ACT government were remarkable in their structure and detail. They became a model for emergency response generally and, I believe, had some reflection in the Victorian processes. Now I want to make a comment specifically about this wonderful city, as I did in maiden speech. It is a home to people born here and people who have chosen to move here for work or other reasons. They make up a great little Australian community. They also happen to live in the country's national capital, and they are very proud to do so. They do their bit to promote the national capital, to defend it when the odd sledging comes along-and that comes along a little bit too often-and to care for it. They realise that at that level it does not belong just to them; it actually belongs to the whole country-to all the people in all the electorates represented here in this House. So, if I could leave a parting request, please, please, please always remember that this city has two personalities: it is a local community, much like every other local community represented here, but it happens also to be the national capital of all of Australia. It is a city we would like all Australians to be particularly proud of. May I remind you that its centenary is coming up in 2013. I very much cherish the opportunity I have had to serve the people of Canberra. It is a very large electorate in population termswe should have a third seat soon, one would hope-and the demands have always been there. I have made working with community groups a key focus. I am proud, like many members in this place, to be a patron of a number of organisations. They include groups such as the ACT Eden Monaro Cancer Support Group, the Tuggeranong Festival, the Australia Thailand Association, the Tuggeranong Hawks Football Club, Special Olympics ACT Region and Arthritis ACT, to name but a few. These and so many other groups have given me so much energy and enjoyment. I also cannot help but mention the thrill I have had at seeing my much loved Sydney Swans play so many games at Manuka Oval. I am sorry to see they are diminishing in number. I only hope to enjoy my seeing many more in future footy seasons. I hope the ACT Minister for Sport and Recreation hears that comment. I did my thankyous at the beginning but I have left a couple till the end. I want to thank all the Parliament House staff who do such a wonderful job helping us. We know it is not easy, as we pollies can sometimes be a highmaintenance bunch of people. I will mention all of them, I hope-the attendants, Hansard, the clerks, the drivers, the printers, the cleaners, the library staff, the plumbers, the painters, the education unit. If I have missed you out, please forgive me, but this place would not operate without all of you. My last thankyou is to my caucus companions and my colleagues opposite. It has been a delight-in fact, an absolute privilege-sitting here with you. Of course, it is the friendships with the people you work with that make this business so rewarding. I thank you for helping me in this difficult yet privileged role of serving the Australian democracy for almost 15 long, happy years. It will depend on when the election is called whether I reach that 15-year mark. In conclusion, Mr Speaker, my thanks to you as well and to all of my colleagues, both present and past. I would like to mention a couple in particular: Graham Edwards, who left the House a couple of elections ago, and was a great friend and mentor to me; and Janice Crosio, who left a little bit earlier than and under whose wing I was placed on the first day I came into this place. Any ill behaviour I have displayed I attribute entirely to her! I am sure she is proud of the one time that I was ejected from the chamber! Mr Speaker, I thank you.",41
17,The SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"To the member for Canberra, I say that I will always cherish the association and working with her on a number of parliamentary and caucus committees where I was advantaged by her sharing her insight and compassion.",43
18,Ms MARINO,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 and related bill. This legislation contains a number of significant changes to the eligibility criteria and requirements for government support for research and development. These changes, as we know, have attracted substantial criticism from a wide range of industry groups-the very groups that need to be taking advantage of the research and development support. There is great uncertainty and there is great concern. Following a review of the National Innovation System administered by the newly elected government, Labor announced in its 2009-10 budget that it would replace the four current tax incentives for business R&D with a new R&D tax credit. The main components of the Labor government's new R&D tax credit packages are restrictions to the categories and types of eligible activities, a 45 per cent refundable credit for firms with an annual turnover of less than $20 million and 40 per cent non-refundable credit for firms with a turnover of more than $20 million. The new tax credit actually imposes restrictive barriers on firms rather than offering encouragement for research and innovation. No-one should underestimate the need for research and innovation as a proven driver of conthat, tinuous and evolving economic growth, productivity, competitiveness and profitability. That is why the coalition has serious concerns over the government's changes to the R&D tax concession. The changes to the eligibility requirements are quite broad. Less emphasis appears to apply to development and it is a real issue. It threatens to significantly erode financial support for R&D investment in Australia-an unintended consequence, I would hope, but one that is very real. The eligible R&D activities under the legislation to qualify for the tax incentives are categorised as either ‘core' or ‘supporting'. There is a stricter test on the definition of ‘supporting' R&D in this bill. What I would not want to see is any reduction in innovation as a result of this restrictive part of this particular bill. It may disqualify assistance from many forms of R&D currently undertaken by Australian businesses-the drivers of innovation, productivity and profitability. The proposed definitions of R&D will cause significant uncertainty-they are already. They are extremely complex and, for practical purposes, will impose unnecessary administrative and compliance costs on many firms, particularly small to medium enterprises. When you read through the definitions in the legislation, it becomes clear and apparent where the complexity and uncertainty is arising and will continue to arise. The concern has been echoed by Business Strategies International, which has said that it is likely that protracted and expensive legal challenges will be initiated in some cases. That is something businesses do not need and should not have to afford. It could well lead to a reduction, as I said, in investment in R&D as a result. Interestingly, in their submission to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry, the Corporate Tax Association detailed concerns they have regarding this legislation, largely about the proposed new definition of R&D. Their submission stated: From what members have said to us, many corporates expect to see their claims reduced significantly, mainly as a result of the proposed dominant purpose test for supporting R&D activities in a production environment. In some cases, corporates may form the view that the compliance costs involved in working up a claim are not warranted, and will not register projects they might have under the existing rules. That certainly will not be of benefit to this nation. Coincidentally, in the current political environment of the resource super profits tax, in both the explanatory memorandum and in oral briefings from Treasury and the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, the examples of offending behaviour were dominated by those in the mining sector, one after another. I am afraid that this is just another attack on Australia's mining and resource sector. The legislation is seeking to change not only the new resource tax but also R&D in the mining industry. The Minerals Council of Australia, in its submission to the consultation paper, described this legislation with the heading ‘A shift in the wrong direction'. The submission also stated that the exposure draft was ‘likely to have extensive adverse effects on the minerals industry'. The MCA further stated: … the second exposure draft fundamentally alters the nature of the R&D tax benefit by the replacement of long standing and well understood concepts … They are two very important issues for those engaged in R&D, and they certainly are long standing and well-understood concepts. Similarly, an article in the Australian Journal of Mining from September-October 2009 stated: Based on the recommendations contained in the Cutler review, tightening of the definition of eligible R&D activities may focus on preventing what are referred to as ‘whole of mine' claims. The article continued: Companies with increasing levels of R&D expenditure may also wish to bring R&D spending forward to take advantage of the … concession before it ends on July 1st, 2010. As I mentioned, the changes contained in this legislation have attracted substantial criticism from a wide range of industry groups. In an article in the Australian newspaper on 2 June 2010, the Advanced Manufacturing Coalition was quoted as saying: … the new system could “increase the time, cost and risk of undertaking R&D in Australia”. I am certainly very concerned about that. This indicates that the scheme could threaten some manufacturing firms' international competitiveness during the next decade, and we should be seriously concerned about that. In their submission to the Senate inquiry, the Advanced Manufacturing Coalition raised concerns that this legislation increases the risk that some manufacturers will defer or cancel R&D or simply take it offshore, a move that would be highly detrimental to the Australian manufacturing industry, researchers and workers. KPMG Australia has expressed concerns that the changes will restrict the access of all companies, irrespective of size-not just smalland medium-sized enterprises-to the R&D system. That may be the intent of this legislation, but it is not a sound intent. The petroleum industry also provided a submission and participated in the public hearings. During the Sydney public hearing, Caltex's Manager for Government Affairs and Media, Mr Topham, stated: We have a long history of investment in R&D, averaging approximately $15 million per annum. Our concern is that the current drafting of the legislation could leave a substantial amount of our R&D expenditure ineligible for tax credits. … We believe the eligibility rules are flawed and that the implementation timetable is unreasonable and impractical. This has been a repeated complaint. The Minerals Council of Australia submission also highlighted their concern: … the Bill fundamentally alters the nature of R&D tax benefit by the replacement ofas I said earlierlong standing and well understood concepts with new and … completely unheralded concepts. I note, on the examples in the biotech and surgical industries being quoted by those opposite, that those industries may not be affected by the changes in this legislation. I believe that research and development is a vital component of this nation and of any industry, whether it is health, mining, petroleum, natural resource or environmental management, agriculture or any other. I do see, as does the coalition, immense benefit in R&D programs. The fact that this legislation seeks to remove an incentive that is integral to assisting and encouraging a diversity of companies to improve their business operations has to be of concern to everyone in this House, on all sides, and the need for clear, concise guidelines for R&D for small to medium enterprises is very important. As stated in the dissenting report by coalition senators to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry report: The Coalition supports increased business investment in research and development (R&D)as we shouldand appropriate reforms to legislation to help achieve this outcome. That should be the desired outcome of any legislation of this type: to support increased business investment in research and development. However, we cannot support legislation that has shortcomings that include the failure to have appropriate consultation, the substantial alterations of those definitions of ‘core' and ‘supporting' R&D, the government's changes to the eligibility criteria, the object clause contained in the legislation and the intellectual property issues. The new regime is due to start on 1 July, the but there is very serious confusion and uncertainty out there, right across the board, and I note that the education campaign to inform companies of various sizes will not come into effect until after the legislation is passed. The education campaign needs to happen prior to the legislation changing. As I have said, the changes proposed by the Labor government have attracted substantial criticism from a variety of stakeholders, for very, very good reasons. Unfortunately, and it is typical of this government, this legislation is seriously flawed.",43
19,Mr SYMON,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 together with the supporting bill, the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010. These introduce a new research and development tax incentive to replace the outdated and complex R&D tax concession. Expanding research and development in our business is a central requirement of building an innovative and productive country. Increasing research and development that is conducted in Australia by businesses and companies is important; indeed, it is vital to our country's future. If we look at where R&D tax concessions came from, we go all the way back to the 1980s when it was introduced by the Hawke government, with the tax concession originally set at 150 per cent. But, as we have seen over the years, there was a problem with that-that is, companies could not claim the tax concession until they turned a profit. I see that as a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem when it applies to small and innovative start-up companies who are spending money on R&D but, as in many cases, not making a profit so there is nothing to claim. The 2008 Cutler report also highlighted that issue. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Innovation examined national research and development funding as a part of its 2008 report entitled Building Australia's research capacity. At that time, the committee-of which I am a member-heard evidence from Universities Australia that, in Australia, gross penditure on research and development as a percentage of GDP stood at 1.76 per cent in 2007-08. But that was in comparison to the OECD average, where that same measure of gross expenditure on research and development was 2.26 per cent. In dollar terms that gap was estimated to be $5 billion. Research and development comes from two main sources, of course-public institutions such as universities, CSIRO, research institutes and government organisations; and the private sector. I think it has been a chaland, lenge for everyone in this parliament over the years to increase that private sector research and development expenditure. In 2001 Australia ranked 15th out of 21 nations of the OECD for private expenditure on R&D, and yet ranked third at that time for government expenditure on research and development. In 2001 Australian private sector R&D was 0.76 per cent of GDP. But this compared to Sweden investing 2.84 per cent of GDP in private R&D, Finland investing 2.39 per cent and Japan investing 2.11 per cent. In the figures from 2007-08 Australia's private R&D has increased so that 1.27 per cent of GDP is invested by the private sector in R&D. However, we still remain 14th in the OECD ranking for that. Any sustained rise in private R&D leads to the development of better products and innovations that generate more economic growth, create jobs and help keep Australia at the leading edge of technological advances. As an example of the benefits that can be derived from successful developments from R&D we need look no further than the CSIRO patent on Wi-Fi technology. It has been in the news quite a lot lately through various legal cases. CSIRO first applied for its Wi-Fi patent in 1992, and of course we now all use it. Every day, anywhere you take a portable device, you are more than likelywhether it is a portable computer, an iPad, a ex- PDA of any sort, or one of a whole heap of other gadgets-to have a Wi-Fi connection. That is one of the things that we now take for granted in the 21st century. When it was first invented it was unprecedented, of course. People did not do that sort of thing in those years, and they were not that long ago. It is estimated that this patent alone could deliver $1 billion to the CSIRO in years to come as this patent is applied and enforced-and of course actions are still going on worldwide to apply that patent to make sure that CSIRO ultimately, the Australian people benefit from that discovery. In 2007-08 Australian businesses invested over $14 billion in R&D. We can do much better, and that is why the Rudd government is introducing this new R&D tax incentive. The new R&D tax incentive provides benefits more generous benefits for eligible research and development activities. It provides more than the existing concession and is better targeted towards research and development that benefits Australia. It is also substantially simpler and accompanied by improved administrative arrangements. The new R&D tax incentive will replace the existing research and development tax concession for all income years starting on or after 1 July 2010. These bills provide for increased assistance for genuine R&D and redistribute support in favour of smalland medium-sized enterprises with annual turnovers of less than $20 million. R&D activities contribute to innovation by creating new knowledge and technologies, and by increasing productivity, jobs and economic growth it allows Australia to respond to present and future challenges. These bills will expand the number of businesses that can access government support for their R&D expenditure and investments. There are more than two million businesses in Australia but at present only around 8,000 of these businesses benefit from the current R&D tax concession. The intention of these bills is for the higher rates of reward under the new incentive to attract more firms to the program. The two core components of this program are: a 45 per cent refundable R&D tax offset for eligible entities with a turnover of less than $20 million, as I have mentioned, and a nonrefundable 40 per cent R&D tax offset for all other eligible entities. With this change of rates and delivery mechanism there is a clearer and better-targeted definition of ‘eligible R&D activities' that ensures that the incentive is available in circumstances consistent with the underlying rationale for government intervention and, what is more, that taxpayers get real value from it. These bills double the base rate of existing R&D support for small to medium enterprises and raise the base rate for larger firms by a third. Instead of receiving 7.5c for every dollar in R&D, small to medium enterprises will receive 15c and larger firms will receive 10c. Small, innovative firms are big winners from the new R&D tax incentive, with greater access to cash refunds for their R&D expenditure and better rates of assistance. To give an example, suppose a company with a turnover of $10 million spends $1 million on eligible R&D activities in an income year and that they are in a tax loss position. Under the new R&D tax incentive that company would be entitled to a cash refund of $450,000. Under the existing R&D tax concession the company would only receive a tax deduction worth $375,000. Of course, there would be zero benefit if the company was not running at a profit. Profit can be many years away, and many start-up firms may never get to access it. They may actually not survive that start-up process. So small to medium enterprises will be encouraged to take the risks on R&D through the government substantially increasing the overall concessions and, for the first time, introducing payments for companies that are yet to make a profit because they have invested in R&D. This new scheme will really help small start-ups and encourage innovation in Australian industry. The new R&D tax incentive will better target government support towards genuine R&D activities. The key elements of an approach such as this are to establish a clearer definition of ‘core R&D activities and to introduce a test for supporting R&D activities and stronger administration of the incentive. These changes will ensure that the new R&D tax incentive rewards a company's genuine R&D, not their business-as-usual activities. The existing scheme is allowing some companies to use taxpayer dollars to subsidise business-as-usual activities rather than genuine research and development activities. This new legislation provides a more focused definition of eligible R&D activities. The new definition of core R&D activities still covers both research and development activities but it is focused at a project It recognises that the innovation dividend for the economy will come from refocusing public support on genuine R&D, not on routine business activities as has been previously commentated on in many sources of the media and, indeed, in this place. Obviously, these changes will cause current recipients of research and development incentives to examine the impact of the definitional changes, and I would hope that they would then apply it to genuine R&D that does benefit the country as a whole. Business-as-usual support is not what is needed when we are talking about innovation. We want new ideas. We want support to chase those ideas so that Australia benefits. Recognising the importance of information technology in a modern economy, the new R&D tax incentive will ensure most software R&D is treated consistently with R&D occurring in other sectors. Importantly, these bills further open up the new R&D tax incentive to foreign corporations that are resident in Australia and those that carry on R&D activities through a permanent establishment in Australia. The bills also ensure a new incentive will be available for expenditure on eligible R&D activities conducted in Australia, regardless of where the resulting intellectual property is held. That strengthens the case for foreign companies to conduct R&D activities locally. On an underlying cash basis, the new R&D tax incentive is expected to be budget neutral over its first four years of operation. Small companies are the winners from the R&D tax incentive, with access to cash refunds on R&D expenditure if they do not make a profit and higher base rates of assistance being provided through the new 45 per cent refundable tax offset. Larger companies can invest, knowing that they can claim a non-refundable tax offset of 40 per cent of their expenditure on eligible R&D activities. level. The new R&D tax incentive better focuses public support on activities likely to produce economy-wide benefits. This will ensure that the new R&D tax incentive rewards a company's genuine R&D, not business-as-usual activities. Finally, the new R&D tax incentive is an important part of the government's plan to encourage knowledge-creating and knowledge-using industries to boost productivity and activity in all sectors of the economy. I commend the bills to the House.",45
20,Dr JENSEN,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I am speaking in unequivocal opposition to the government's Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010. I am the only person in this House that I am aware of who has worked as a research scientist within both CSIRO and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. I have spoken in this House many times on this government's short-sighted penny-pinching budget cuts to such organisations as CSIRO and ANSTO. This legislation just drives another stake into the heart of scientific research in the form of business R&D in this country. So much for the clever country! The first question which should always be asked about legislation is: is it necessary, especially when there is a very good system already in place? Given this government's dismal track record based on the philosophy of ‘if it ain't broke, let's break it', what are the alleged problems? Michael Johnson Associates is Australia's leading specialist R&D tax concession firm, and this is how it views the so-called flaws in the current system that are used as excuses for this legislation: … 1-The current Concession facilitates bogus, illegitimate claims against the taxpayer … … … In fact, all the evidence over the history of the program is that it is responsibly used by the vast majority of users and very few risk assessments proceed to prosecutions. Removing benefits from all taxpayers for the inappropriate behaviour of the few is not a rational response to the issue of alleged misuse. … 2-The Concession provides assistance to non-genuine R&D … … … The real mischief here is when one starts to import a moral dimension to what is genuine R&D. The strength of the current Concession is that it delivers an internationally-competitive definition of eligible industrial R&D. The proposed definition in the Credit, in seeking to narrow the definirules tion to limit assistance to “genuine R&D”, manages to disqualify the vast majority of R&D actually conducted by Australian businesses, large or small. … 3-The criticism of the Credit has come from those with a vested interest in the status quo … … … If a submission comes in arguing for the status quo, does it automatically follow that the submission can be discounted because it is designed to protect a vested interest? … … … … responses such as the recent public submissions to the Treasury will always come in the main from those with a vested interest. That is the usual driver for a party to respond at all. Blind Freddy could see that! Using that ridiculous and specious argument, can we then look forward to the union movement being locked out of any input into IR legislation? It continues: … 4-80% of the Concession goes to 100 companies For decades, Australian Bureau of Statistics on R&D have indicated that the vast majority of innovation spend is incurred by a handful of Australian companies. This is, and will always be, a matter of fact. The current trends in the Concession simply reflect this fact. Given that the Concession is open-ended, the share of those 100 companies will be determined by the prevailing rules and the amount they identify and claim. When added to the spend and claim of the other 7,900 firms in the program, the proportions will then be determined as a matter of mathematics. There is not a finite amount of claims and assistance available. The proportions are only determined after the claims are identified and made against the rules. The thinking behind the restrictions in the new Credit is that the rules can be changed to alter these proportions. This is entirely possible. You can rewrite the rules so that the proportion of assistance accessed by the other 7,900 is a much larger figure. The problem comes in when the are so restrictive that the proportion is larger but the overall value of the assistance to those 7,900 companies falls. This is exactly the concern being reflected by the commentators regarding the Credit. We are being offered a program that wipes out assistance across-the-board. A larger slice of the cake might go to SMEs but so what if we are now cutting up a cup cake as opposed to a passion fruit sponge. Yet again, the good old socialist focus on distributing current wealth instead of enabling individuals and companies to create more is writ large in bold italics. This is the classic Fabian sheep clothing of R&D funding hiding the wolf of grabbing back money and wrecking proven and effective programs. This bill has been condemned by groups and individuals across the business and scientific spectrum. Let us hope that this dissent will not prompt another unscrupulous and indefensible ad campaign from this government. Last February, Peter Roberts wrote a comprehensive article in the Australian Financial Review giving a cross-section of responses about why this bill should be defeated. He said that the change in definitions of eligibility and exclusions will ‘slash the $1.4 billion cost of assistance by as much as half', according to KPMG. Roberts continues: While the new credit is a big boost for start-up companies and some foreign companies, it has been condemned by business groups, tax professionals, academics and staunch Labor supporters as betraying an innovation agenda pioneered by Hawke government minister John Button. Of course we know the respect the Prime Minister showed for John Button and his work. He chose to visit a film star for a photo opportunity rather than pay his respects at John Button's funeral. Ms Plibersek-That really is a bit off.",48
21,Dr JENSEN,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Well, it is true. Celebrity over substance has been one of the hallmarks of our egocentric Prime Minister. The general feeling is that the main aim of this legislation is to bring about cost savings in the R&D area. One of the main criteria is that core R&D be both innovative and risky when in the past it could be one or the other. This incompetent and fiscally destructive government knows nothing about being innovative but a lot about being risky. As if the mining industry has not already been bludgeoned with a proposed resources rent supertax, this R&D legislation will, according to Roberts, ‘reduce the claims of mining companies for pilot plant expenditure and manufacturers for the cost of prototypes.' So, what sorts of investment levels have we enjoyed in the past? According to reports on a Booz & Company innovation study, Australia was the sixth largest importer of global spending on research and development in 2007, attracting $4.3 billion in global R&D investment. Booz's strategy practice principal, Bernadette Howlett, was reported as saying that Australia is ‘clearly benefiting from the globalised outsourcing of R&D spending'. She continued: The long-term outlook is encouraging because of the capability of our local skill base, and the insions. creased reputation our R&D teams have for innovation and for being able to respond to consumer demand … Now that the full impact of this legislation is starting to be appreciated, that long-term outlook will not look anywhere near as rosy. Furthermore, the government cannot resort to its tried and true ‘plan A' when things start going rapidly round the U-bend: pretending they were not aware of problems. The Senate inquiry into the scheme was told by grants experts only last month that the scheme is too restrictive and complex. Let me repeat that: this legislation, which the government claims will simplify and improve funding for R&D, is too restrictive and complex. Accounting firm BDO told the inquiry that modelling it had conducted involving its clients in the mining and manufacturing sectors showed that those sectors would be particularly hard hit. One must ask again: why is this government doing its level best, or actually worse, to destroy the mining and associated industries? This is economic treason. BDO's R&D partner Tracey Murray said: In the mining industry, 90% of our current claimants would have their R&D claim reduced under the R&D tax credit program by at least 80%, with 10% of claimants not being able to access the incentive at all. And what of manufacturing, where I am sure at least a few of the Prime Minister's favourite ‘working families' are employed? BDO's assessment was: When we modelled the manufacturing industry, the very industry that Australia is striving to increase productivity in, our modelling indicated a significant number of clients would have their access to the R&D program reduced by at least 65% in terms of value, with a number of well known, world-leading companies unable to access the provisions at all because of the operation of the dominant purpose and the feedstock proviThe compliance burdens of this proposal are also going to increase, another blow to businesses which are keeping this company afloat despite the Prime Minister's cynical and pathetic attempts to portray himself as the great saviour of our economy. Sandra Mason, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, says it appears that the government is trying to target some sectors or groups who it feels are getting more than their fair share of R&D tax incentives. However, she says that the legislation is too broad and will capture or rope in many other companies. Using a sledgehammer to crack a nut is another familiar and abiding failing of this grossly incompetent administration, so those critical comments sadly have a ring of truth as loud as Big Ben. Ms Mason was also reported as expressing concern at the introduction of a dominant purpose test, which requires that companies hoping to claim for supporting R&D will need to prove that the work complies with the dominant purpose test of supporting core R&D. According to critics, this goes too far as many traditional supporting activities, such as market research, market development and feasibility studies, have the dual purpose of supporting core R&D and furthering a firm's commercial strategy. But then, what would this government know about how business operates? Thanks to the calamitous handling of the BER and insulation programs, we can clearly see the answer-absolutely nothing. The Prime Minister has been saying he wants Australia to become more productive. How does this alleged desire marry with the R&D tax legislation? A major issue with R&D is trying to quantify much of it. Dean Parham, until recently an Assistant Commissioner of the Productivity Commission, wrote a paper on the empirical analysis of the effects of R&D on productivity. According to that paper, while growth in the OECD area was slower in parts of the eighties and nineties, that was a period of major growth in R&D in Australia. He wrote: Local tax incentives are thought to have contributed substantially to the growth and timing of change in Australian R&D activity. The problem really comes when you attempt to measure the value of R&D. As Dean Parham wrote: … R&D activity is an investment in knowledge accumulation and in the development of technologies. The corresponding assets-the stocks of knowledge and technologies-are intangible assets whose values are largely unobservable. … … … This measurement difficulty looms as a fundamental problem in establishing a link empirically between R&D and productivity. Therefore, if these changes are being driven by Treasury and taxation officers who are seeing an opportunity to claw back some of the money this government has wasted, this paper illustrates the difficulty of measuring R&D outputs, and the inherent dangers in trying to quantify intangibles. I should remind the government that this is not an esoteric philosophical debate; it is about real companies, real employees and the real future of our country. I have received representations from companies in my electorate who are reiterating many of the concerns that major players have voiced. I hope that the government will listen to these concerns now and act accordingly, instead of barging ahead with deeply flawed legislation and then wanting to consult with industry. Where have we heard that one before? One of my constituents said that R&D tax incentives have been critical to the recent growth of his company and to increasing the level of intellectual property and the resulting design and manufacture undertaken in Australia. He posed questions about keeping promises, which are very relevant to this government. I must say I admire his optimism. He wants to be assured that the stated aims are fulfilled by this legislationremaining revenue neutral at $1.4 billion funding; shifting the benefit to SMEs; removing compromising claims for whole-ofmine style projects and supporting activities which form a large part of the expenditure; increasing the number of claimants; increasing business expenditure on R&D; and targeting R&D with concepts of additionality and spillovers. He explained that there are major economic pressures on companies to relocate their design and manufacturing activities to low-cost centres offshore. However, while the current R&D tax incentive scheme is in operation, the development of intellectual property can be economically pursued in Australia. The only real question about the intent of this legislation is: is it yet another desperate attempt by an ideologically driven and intellectually destitute government to reclaim money to fill in the gaping black hole of debt it created, or is it yet another mean spirited and vindictive attempt to destroy another success story of the Howard government? Or is it a bit of both? My constituent warns that: Any move to constrain or reduce the support of R&D to companies would only hasten and increase the tendencies to move offshore. I do hope that this statement of fact, which is blindingly obvious to anyone outside the Labor Party, will prompt the more intelligent and economically literate members of the Labor Party to for once abjure the party line and stand for what is good for the country by not supporting this bill. We shall soon see which is more important to them-their own continued existence as Labor Party ciphers or people genuinely concerned for the greater good of Australia.",50
22,Ms OWENS,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to support the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 and the associated Income Tax Rates Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010. Those who have known me for a while will know that I have a great passion for innovation in all areas and that I see our nation as one with great talent in this area. Innovation and R&D drives productivity growth and it drives the creation of national wealth. We are very good at it. Many Australians know that ours is a land with great wealth in its soil-both under it and within it-but we also have great talent in mines. Whether it is through science or research, as a percentage of our population we lead the world in terms of our creativity. We are very good at it. Fifteen years ago we led the world in solar technology; we do not now. But we did and the capacity is there to lead the world again in so many areas. When we look back at the period of the last government, one of the great regrets we will have as a nation is that, in the time of one of the greatest booms we have ever seen, we did not invest in that natural talent. In fact, our level of innovation as a percentage of GDP dropped. We dropped further and further down the OECD table until we sat well and truly at the bottom in terms of innovation between our universities and businesses at the end of the last government's term. We did not invest in our talent for innovation and, as a nation, we were let down as a result of that. We were one of the few developed countries in a parallel area that reduced expenditure on education as a percentage against GDP. There can be no doubt that, in the modern world of global competition, innovation must be at the core of any strategic plan that a nation has for its future. We must continue to improve the way that governments encourage business to invest in innovation because it does drive productivity and growth and it drives the wealth of the nation. The current scheme does not get the return that we might expect for the investment that we make. Funds are increasingly going to business as usual, to projects which include parts of what we might legitimately call innovation in R&D but which go to the whole project. The consultancies that have grown up around the program have increasingly regular clients and we now find that there are only about 8,000 small businesses out of the two million out there that apply for funding. We also see a narrowing of the field of successful applicants. This is not an indication that there is bad behaviour going on. It is just an indication of a pattern that tends to happen when a grant program exists for a long period of time and consultancies get involved. I know this because I fulfilled that role a while before I came into parliament. I was not working in the R&D area, but I did have five grant writers that worked for me in procuring grants for small business. I know very well that over time, as a consultant, you get better and better at squeezing projects into the guidelines, extending the guidelines out a little year by year, and that your client base does tend to narrow. You get very, very good at getting grants year after year for the same businesses. There was one year when my clients received 100 per cent of the funding in one particular federal government grant category and it was well known that, if you wanted funding in that area, you had to come to me. So I do actually know how good you can get at stretching those boundaries and reducing the number of clients that receive the funding. We are now down to a situation where, out of two million businesses, only 8,000 apply and a relatively small number of those receive the bulk of the funding. Our innovation needs to be spread across the economy and it is recognised internationally as an important driver of productivity and growth. It encompasses a wide range of activities including workforce skills, venture capital, knowledge transfer, management practices, technology uptake and, of course, R&D. In our global economy, companies must invest in R&D to improve their competitiveness and their ongoing profitability. Knowledge produced by a firm's R&D often has benefits to other firms and to the economy as a whole-that is, the R&D can have a net positive impact beyond the benefits that accrue to the firm. However, from an individual firm's point of view, uncertain returns from the R&D activities may mean that a firm chooses not to undertake them. Where this happens, less R&D may take place than would be desirable from a whole economy perspective. A carefully designed incentive lowers the cost of doing for R&D and helps boost productivity and economic growth. To this end, this new R&D tax incentive focuses assistance on activities that are likely to deliver economy-wide benefits that would not be enjoyed in the absence of public support. It also significantly improves the incentive for smaller firms to undertake R&D. The current scheme, as I said, does not get the return that we might expect because so much of current funds are going to what would be called business as usual. The new scheme is more generous and better targeted towards R&D that benefits Australia than the existing concession. It redistributes support importantly in favour of small and medium firms. We all know that small and medium firms are more responsive to fiscal incentives than large firms, so that is a very sensible measure. It provides cash upfront to small innovative firms, giving them the certainty they need to invest in growing business. I worked in small business for a substantial part of my career before entering parliament and I am well aware of how important that upfront cash payment is in encouraging innovation. The new system is also substantially simpler and accompanied by improved administrative arrangements. It is also very important that we reduce the burden on businesses applying for this concession. The new incentive replaces the existing R&D tax concession for all income years starting on or after 1 July. There are two core components of the new incentive-a 45 per cent refundable R&D tax offset for eligible entities with a turnover of less than $20 million and a nonrefundable 40 per cent tax offset for all other eligible entities. This effectively doubles base rate of existing support for small to dium enterprises and raises the base rate for larger firms by a third. So, for small businesses, instead of receiving 7.5c for every dollar they will receive 15c for every dollar and larger firms will receive 10c for every dollar. The new refundable tax offset provision also makes upfront cash support available to many more smalland medium-sized companies. The new tax offset is available to corporations with a turnover under $20 million. The current law sets the cap at companies with an annual group turnover of less than $5 million, so there is a substantial improvement for smallto medium-sized enterprises there. The government also aims to lift R&D performance through increasing the number of businesses undertaking R&D up from that relatively small 8,000 businesses that apply now. The government has a responsibility to deliver value for money for taxpayers through the better targeting of the scheme and I believe that the new legislation achieves that through a more focused definition of eligible R&D. The new definition is simpler than the old one. Core R&D activities are experimental activities whose outcome cannot be known or determined in advance on the basis of current knowledge, information or experience but can only be determined by applying a systematic progression of work that is based on principles of established science and proceeds from hypothesis to experiment, observation and evaluation and leads to logical conclusions and is conducted for the purpose of acquiring new knowledge, including knowledge or information concerning the creation of new or improved materials, products, devices, processes or services. The new definition of core R&D activities still covers both the research and the development activities. The government has undertaken an extensive consultation process the on this, including inviting public submisme- sions on a consultation paper and two exposure drafts of legislation. That the member for Tangney could see that as a lack of consultation defies belief because there has, as I said, been extensive consultation over two exposure drafts and prior consultation. The government received over 380 submissions during these three rounds of consultation and held public hearings which were attended by 550 people-again, considerable consultation in this area. There have also been extensive discussions with key industry representatives and advisers over almost a year. The government have made some significant changes where stakeholders have made constructive suggestions for improvement, as we should. In particular, we have simplified the R&D definition-and I have read that out-and the dominant purpose test for supporting R&D has been limited to production activities and activities on the exclusion list-again, simplifications requested by the sector itself. The government still plan for the new R&D tax incentive to start on 1 July 2010. We acknowledge that some industry groups have called for its introduction to be delayed for a year but a delay would mean that Australian companies do not get the very substantial benefits that the new scheme offers, which is a doubling of benefits and cash upfront to smaller firms. Introducing the new incentive is critical to Australia's future-to enhancing productivity, to making us more competitive and to creating new wealth and jobs. I have to say I am quite shocked to hear that the opposition will not be supporting these amendments. Stakeholders in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have been supportive of the new incentive and are keen to see the new R&D tax incentive enacted as soon as possible. The information technology industry has also welcomed the revised approach to software R&D. I am also pleased that the new scheme will reduce compliance coststhat is very important for small business. The measure provides a tax benefit above the normal corporate income tax benchmark and the benefit is voluntary, so all associated compliance costs are also voluntary but we still must work towards keeping them to a minimum. The draft R&D provisions are shorter, clearer and simpler than the existing R&D provisions, mainly because we have avoided the four different benefits available under the existing law and replaced them with a single entitlement to a tax offset. They are important simplifications. There will be compliance costs associated with the change from the former arrangements during the early stages of the new incentive but these will reduce as taxpayers become accustomed to the new scheme and adjust their practices. We have also provided $38 million in the 2009-10 budget to ensure that AusIndustry and the ATO are equipped to assist taxpayers in adjusting to the new scheme. AusIndustry will provide guidance and educational material to industry, including specific information on those industry sectors in which there is most concern, including manufacturing and mining. These are very sensible reforms to an incredibly important area of government incentives, namely research and development. As I said, research and development and innovation, particularly in the modern world, drive growth and wealth creation and are fundamental to any nation seeking to position itself as a strong economy in the future. I commend these bills to the House.",52
23,Mr TURNBULL,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"This legislation, the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010, proposes altering the basic structure of Commonwealth government incentives for business research and development spending for the first time in almost a quarter of a century. If passed, it would replace the existing R&D tax concession available to businesses since 1986 with a new R&D tax credit, effective from 1 July 2010. The existing tax concession has been the key mechanism supporting business innovation for 24 years under both Labor and coalition governments. It has been repeatedly refined and amended over the years, but is very familiar to businesses and currently assists around 8,000 firms. The concession is estimated to have a cost to the budget of $1.5 billion in the 2009-10 financial year. Not only is the existing concession well understood by business; it also has been very successful over time in encouraging a higher level of private investment in innovation in Australia. So it is not surprising that the Rudd government's proposal to replace it with an entirely new incentive scheme has been contentious, most of all among those Australian businesses most committed to investing in science and innovation. The government is presenting its proposed shift to an R&D tax credit as a ‘more generous, more predictable, and less complex tax incentive' that provides better value for money. I agree, as I am sure all honourable members would, that taxpayers have every right to demand value for money when they support the business sector. And there are a number of features of this legislation that are sensible, in particular the ideas of replacing tax deductions with tax credits and making tax credits for eligible R&D refundable in cash to small firms without tax liabilities. But in the end, the coalition opposes this legislation for the same reasons that many innovative Australian businesses have opposed it. Firstly, the government's claims that these changes would be revenue-neutral over the forward estimates do not seem credible. While it is true the level of assistance for eligible spending will increase modestly, the activities eligible for support have been drastically narrowed. The bills look more like a revenue grab than a reallocation of resources. Secondly, Labor claims that the new regime will be simpler and easier to administer are already in tatters, given the business uncertainty and legal questions created by sweeping changes to the eligibility rules and tests, in particular the new distinction between ‘core' and ‘supporting' R&D and the ‘dominant purpose' test. And thirdly, these changes replace a wellunderstood policy with a successful track record of encouraging business activity critical to our economic future with an incentive very different in design which may deliver very different outcomes. These risks posed were summarised very well by AVCAL, the venture capital industry group, in their response to the exposure draft: … the narrowing of the eligibility criteria for the R&D tax incentive will materially affect the future of many innovative businesses in Australia. These businesses, which would have been at the forefront of the Government's efforts to foster home-grown innovation, will now be ineligible for the very incentives which are intended to pel innovation forward in Australia. While it claims this legislation is revenue neutral, the government concedes it dramatically alters the types of R&D eligible for public support. This can be seen if we consider the most important features of the bill. Assistance would be directed to core R&D and away from supporting R&D-to basic research, for example, but not industrial process improvements. Supporting R&D activities could still be assisted if innovation rather than commercial advantage is their dominant purpose but, as so many businesses have pointed out, virtually all R&D serves both objectives. Dominance of innovation alone is likely to be difficult to establish. Tests for spending eligibility would be tightened. Currently, activities must be innovative or involve high levels of technical risk to receive support. The legislation would change this requirement to ‘considerable novelty' and ‘high technical risk'. As AVCAL's response to the exposure draft points out: This change to the definition may unintentionally lead to the exclusion of many genuine valueadding R&D activities that should be supported and are currently eligible for support … The form of the incentive would change. The current tax concession applies an uplift to eligible R&D spending to create a tax deduction which varies in value if the company tax rate changes. The new legislation would replace this with a tax credit which has a dollar value uncoupled from other tax rates. In the case of small firms without tax liabilities the credit would be refundable in cash. The level of assistance would rise. Currently, firms receive a tax deduction of 125 per cent of eligible R&D spending or a premium tax deduction of 175 per cent when spending exceeds the average of the three previous years. Under the new legislation pro- firms that turn over under $20 million would receive a 45 per cent tax credit-equivalent to 150 per cent deduction. Larger firms would receive a 40 per cent tax creditequivalent to a 130 per cent deduction. Because of the narrower range of activities that would be supported, a larger proportion of assistance is expected to go to small firms with a turnover of under $20 million. It is helpful to consider these proposed changes in the context of the original rationale for the R&D tax concession and the backdrop of the government's broader role in science and innovation. The R&D concession was introduced by the Hawke government in 1986, with broad aims to encourage Australian firms to lift onshore research and development and so become more innovative and internationally competitive. This appeared to be a daunting challenge in the 1980s, when most Australian manufacturers were struggling to survive and modernise, and local firms invested far less in innovation on average than their counterparts in other OECD countries. Private spending on science and innovation started rising gradually, in relative terms, in the late 1980s but as recently as 1998-99 gross business expenditure on R&D in Australia was still only 43 per cent of the OECD average. Happily, over the past decade that gap has narrowed quickly. In 200607, the most recent year for which we have international data, business R&D spending in Australia was 80 per cent of the OECD average. If the data is adjusted for industry ture, recognising Australia's smaller than average manufacturing sector for an OECD country, business R&D exceeded the OECD average. In 2007-08, the most recent year of the ABS data, Australian companies spent $14.4 billion on research and development-up 85 per cent from four years earlier. Most of that investment took place in the manufacturing and mining sectors, as we would expect. Growth rates for business R&D in Australia have been particularly rapid in the last four or five years, but this spurt is just the latest phase in a long uptrend which has transformed Australia from a laggard in private R&D into a normal advanced economy. Since the existing R&D tax concession was introduced 24 years ago, business spending on innovation has grown by almost seven per cent in real terms, annually-double the growth rate of the economy. Obviously, the R&D concession has played a critical role in all of this-almost certainly in kick-starting business investment in innovation from its moribund levels of the mid-1980s; probably in driving strong subsequent growth; certainly in making R&D less costly for firms which spent on eligible activities. It is notoriously difficult to measure the precise impact of policies such as incentives for R&D since we cannot observe what would have happened in their absence. But it goes without saying that innovationthe introduction of new or significantly improved products or processes-should be, must be, a critical policy concern for government. In the long run a nation's capacity to innovate determines how quickly its economy can grow, how quickly its living standards can increase and how well equipped it is to surmount economic, social or environmental challenges. Climate change and the health needs of an ageing population are just structwo examples of public policy challenges where it is clear innovation and new technologies are going to play a major role in the solutions. Market economies obviously provide wonderful incentives for innovation in the private sector, but the public sector also has a critical role-and not only in providing welleducated workers, fair laws, stable macroeconomic and tax policies, and the other institutions and infrastructure essential for a strong economy. As the Productivity Commission has pointed out, there are two powerful rationales for direct use of public resources in science and innovation. The first is to pay for R&D that improves the functioning of government or the quality of the products and services it delivers. This includes advances in areas from defence to transport, health and education. Obviously, not all of this R&D needs to be carried out in the public sector, but much of it needs to be funded by the public sector. The second is to pay for R&D that generates ‘spillovers'-benefits that are not easily or completely captured by the innovator but boost the economy as a whole. Such spillovers often arise from basic research or ideas and processes that are readily mimicked, adapted or diffused without any reward to the inventor. Understandably, the private sector tends to underfund such spending. The Commonwealth government currently spends more than $8 billion a year on what can be broadly defined as research and development, or around a third of gross expenditure on R&D in Australia. The bulk of this spending-almost $5 out of every $6-is channelled through research institutes, research grants, universities or public sector agencies such as the CSIRO or the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. The remaining $1 in $6 is largely delivered through the R&D tax concession, which of course is the main instrument for encouraging private spending likely to create spillover benefits for the wider economy as well as commercial value for the investing firm. In the past three years the design of the existing R&D concession twice came under scrutiny during inquiries into innovation policy, first by the Productivity Commission, in 2007, and then by the review led by Dr Terry Cutler, in 2008. In each case changes were recommended. The Productivity Commission found the eligibility criteria for the basic 125 per cent tax concession did not fully screen out R&D which would have happened anyway and suggested economic pay-offs could be increased by restricting it to small firms. It recommended the 175 per cent premium rate be retained for all firms but the criteria for eligible R&D spending be tightened. Finally, the Productivity Commission acknowledged that restricting the concession would increase administrative and compliance costs. The Cutler review urged that the existing R&D tax concession be converted to a tax credit of 40 per cent for larger firms and a refundable tax credit of 50 per cent for firms with turnover under $50 million. It also recommended that all R&D undertaken in Australia which met the relevant definitions be eligible for the tax credit, including R&D by foreign companies. There is merit in both sets of recommendations, and each review raised legitimate questions over aspects of the design of the existing R&D tax concession-in particular the provision of support to some R&D which provides sufficient returns to the companies that undertake it and which would happen in any case. The government's response, however, combines the most onerous features of both and ignores the generous aspects of each. Cutler's proposed 50 per cent tax credit for small firms is reduced to 45 per cent and limited to a turnover of $20 million, not $50 million. The idea of premium support for firms which invest consistently in R&D over multiple years does not make the cut. The arbitrary distinction between ‘core' and ‘supporting' R&D is a heavy-handed response to the challenge of screening out spending on innovation that does not need assistance, that does not pass the additionality test. And there is little doubt the proposed legislation would add to uncertainty and complexity in the near term, rather than reduce it. There are also several positive features of the legislation, as I mentioned earlier: specifically the replacement of tax deductions with tax credits, the scope for cash refunds of credits to small firms without tax liabilities, and the higher rate of assistance provided to small firms. But on balance, however, the negatives outweigh the positives. As I noted earlier, incentives to private firms are only a fraction of the government's total commitment to R&D-$1.5 billion out of more than $8 billion. So while it is tant to get the mechanism for distributing the $1 in $6 right, it is even more important to ensure we also spend the other $5 in the most economically beneficial way. This is a much broader topic than the scope of this legislation but it is important to address nonetheless. I have always believed Australia should develop more of its own intellectual property, and a large part of my experience before politics involved starting innovative businesses which created jobs and indeed exported technology. Over the past couple of decades Australia has evolved into a much more conducive environment for innovation than it has been in the past. I have described the growth in business investment in R&D over the past two decades, which in turn has increased the cost of the concession. We can be pretty positive about the existing environment Australia presents for innovation, particularly innovation in early-stage companies. In fact, according to a survey by Ernst & Young in 2009-10, Australia ranked as the fourth most attractive market for venture capital investment, behind the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. But there is always room for improvement. Our combined government and private expenditure on R&D now exceeds two per cent of GDP and is above the OECD average but it still lags behind the high levels of spending on innovation in leading countries such as the United States, Japan and Israel. Many countries have tried to emulate the dynamic level of innovation seen in the US economy, but most have failed: the web of economic, educational and cultural forces and institutions that create a Silicon Valley are hard to untangle or replicate. Israel is an interesting contrarian example, however, and over the past decade has emerged as an economy increasingly driven by innovation and technology. There are more Israeli than European companies listed on the Nasdaq, importhe world's main stock exchange for tech firms, and the per capita venture capital investment in Israel is twice the per capita level in the United States and 30 times the level in the EU. As with Silicon Valley, there are many forces behind this story, some of them difficult to replicate. Favourable immigration policies and a flow of technically skilled migrants from the former Eastern Bloc, the use of military procurement to develop targeted areas of technical expertise, higher education funding that promotes interdisciplinary collaboration and university-business linkages, and high but targeted public spending on R&D all contributed. Australia shares some of these advantages and lacks others. But perhaps the most important lesson to take away from Israel's experience is that the public sector's role in leading and encouraging this economic transformation was not driven by direct support for private R&D. It involved effective policy design and coherent objectives across the whole of the public sector's support for innovation-or, in Australian terms, the $5 in $6 as well as the $1 in $6. It would be easier to accept the Rudd government's bona fides on innovation if it were committed to better economic returns and taxpayer value for money across the whole of public spending on science and innovation. Instead, we find it focused on narrowing the R&D tax concession, the one part of that spending which unequivocally benefits business. So much as there are some positive features of this legislation, they are outweighed by its negatives and the very strong underlying hint of Labor antibusiness ideology. I will not be voting for this legislation.",55
24,Ms MCKEW,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (12.07 pm)-I am delighted to be able to speak to the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 in far less conditional terms than the previous speaker, the member for Wentworth. I feel this legislation is a very significant reform that aims to achieve a number of things. Firstly, it will support investment in research and development. Secondly, it will strengthen companies either undertaking or seeking to undertake research and development activities in Australia and encourage them to become more innovative, productive and prosperous. Thirdly, this is about the promotion of high income, high quality jobs for the future. The research and development tax credit is also a central element of the Rudd government's long-term agenda to lift Australia's innovation capacity and indeed our performance. The minister, Senator Carr, set out year in his landmark Powering ideas report the government's framework for a 10-year reform agenda to make Australia more productive and more competitive. The Powering ideas report in turn was borne out of Dr Terry Cutler's 2008 review of the National Innovation System. The recommendation there, of course, was delivered in August 2008, and that was that the research and development tax concession be changed from a tax deduction to a tax credit. We have been pursuing this case since we came into government in 2007. I am particularly pleased to speak in this debate because this reform is especially important for the many innovative companies in my electorate, the bulk of which are located in the Macquarie Park Corridor. More than 30,000 people work there, the vast majority of them in research driven industries. There is also the Macquarie University campus, so it is a very exciting hub. The City of Ryde's own economic development strategy says the total floor space of the corridor could accommodate in the future as many as 18,000 workers. This corridor is an important and growing part of what is sometimes called the northern Sydney global technology corridor. It is also the northernmost tip of what the New South Wales and Metropolitan Strategy calls the state's global economic corridor, often described as the powerhouse of the Australian economy, and with good reason. There are also major pharmaceutical companies, the likes of Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis, and Astra Zeneca. Pfizer's head office is on the other side of Bennelong, down at West Ryde. In Macquarie Park you have major information technology companies-Microsoft, Oracle, CA, CSC and Compuware. There are also some of the giants of consumer electronicslate last Sony, Toshiba, Philips and Canonincluding Canon Information Systems Research Australia. They had their 20th anniversary recently and I was given a guided tour of the marvellous facility on Thomas Holt Drive. That was by the managing director Dr Kenji Kobayashi and director Dr Jim Metcalfe. In telecommunications, Optus also has its corporate headquarters there. This is all by way of saying that really there are few parts of Sydney, let alone the rest of the country, which boast such a rich concentration of research dependent industries. It is certainly the case that not all of them manufacture or research in this country. That is true, but Bennelong certainly has a strong case to make that it is the hub of Australian research and development-which leads me of course to these bills and the new R&D tax credit. What we are creating with this new system is a fairer, more efficient system that will provide greater incentives to foster research and development activity. It is a system that is already rated the world's best tem for providing R&D incentives. I will come back to that in a little more detail. First, I want to explain a bit about the technimillion cal details of this legislation. The new R&D tax incentive replaces the existing R&D tax concession. There will be a 45 per cent refundable tax credit for companies turning over less than $20 million and a 40 per cent non-refundable credit for larger corporations. This doubles the base rate of existing support for small and medium enterprises, restoring support to pre-1996 levels. It also raises the base rate for larger firms by one-third. Instead of receiving 7.5 cents for every dollar, small and medium enterprises will get 15 cents of every dollar and larger firms will receive 10 cents for every dollar. That will apply for all income years starting on or after 1 July this year. Certainly for people on this side of the chamber the most important consideration when it comes to matters of taxation and incentives is the concept of fairness. This concept of fairness is at the heart of everything that we attempt to do on this side of the chamber: fairness for workers when it comes to our changes to the former government's unfair dismissal laws; fairness for all Australians in across-the-board investments in schools and in our health facilities; fairness for young parents in our universal 18-week paid parental leave scheme that I spoke on just a week or so ago; and fairness for all Australians by boosting our retirement savings through the important tax reform debate going on right now over the resource super profits tax. Importantly, the new refundable R&D tax offset provisions make upfront cash support available to many more smalland medium-sized companies. It is a fairer system. The new refundable tax offset will be available to corporations with a turnover of under $20 million. Under the current law, a refundable tax offset is available only to corsys- porations with an annual group turnover of less than $5 million where the group aggregate R&D expenditure is not more than $2 a year. There are two million businesses in Australia and only about 8,000 of these benefit from the current R&D tax concession. The Rudd government's intention is for these higher rates of reward under the new incentive to attract more firms to the program. We are widening the net, and I think that is fair. It is a major step towards lifting Australia's R&D performance through increasing the number of businesses undertaking R&D. We are also improving efficiency. The new administrative arrangements that this legislation puts in place will be a lot simpler. As many have noted, Australia is very good at designing efficient tax measures. Tax credits are already in use in the United States, in Japan and in many parts of Europe. The new system will be familiar to international firms headquartered in those places. However, the existing scheme is allowing some companies to use taxpayer dollars to subsidise businessas-usual activities rather than what we call genuine research and development activities. Last financial year, a record number of companies registered for the tax concession, but the majority of the funding went to only 100 of the 7,754 companies approved for the concession. The government has a responsibility to deliver value for money for taxpayers through better targeting of the scheme, and this has been achieved in the new legislation through a more focused definition of eligible R&D activities. So let us be clear about this: we want to fund business innovation, not business as usual. The new definition of core R&D activity still covers both R&D activities, but it will weed out companies taking advantage of the scheme for business-asusual activities for which they receive normal business deductions. I note that the Cutler review mentions whole-of-project claims using the R&D tax concession. The report from the review described this phenomenon in the following terms: In recent years several firms have been successful in the aggressive use of the R&D Tax Concession to make claims for a very large share of expenditure in large one-off projects like mines and civil engineering. These claims have demonstrated that some aspect of the project is new and technically risky. This having been done it has been possible, despite the efforts of the Australian Taxation Office, to claim as much as 80 percent or more of all investment expenditures in the project. The Panel appreciates that such ventures are both risky and innovative. At the same time it is clear that such ‘whole of mine' claims are gaining for themselves a degree of assistance disproportionate to the benefits available to many other innovative projects. While they are also being undertaken by firms with very good access to capital, it is also true that capital markets are averse to in long term technology projects. This is an issue which needs to be addressed in its own right and not by default through a general tax concession. That was the problem identified in 2008. Further, in comments about Labor's new R&D tax credit to the Adelaide Advertiser last month, Dr Leanna Read, the head of TGR BioSciences and a former member of the Industry Research and Development Board, had this to say: Certainly some claims from some of the big companies … were based largely on supporting activities rather than core, so something might be 99.9 per cent for supporting activity but because it supported some tiddlywink of R&D it got through. Our legislation will promote real innovation by closing that loophole. There are, I am afraid, some other examples of loopholes that show how far the funding has been stretched in the past. Funding has been made available to companies to construct a new building to test air conditioning, for instance, and to upgrade a processing plant and install a computer system in a large bank. All these are activities with inherent worth, but they are not research driven. Clearly we can do better than we are doing to reward real innovation. I mentioned earlier that the R&D tax credit system is already acknowledged as the world's best system of its kind. As part of their Competitive alternatives 2010 report into international business costs, the consultants KPMG studied general tax competitiveness across 95 cities in 10 major countries. The countries in the study were Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, and the United States. The report details just how competitive Australia's R&D sector is. In the section of the report on R&D, Australia is the runaway winner at No. 1, and on the strength of Labor's new R&D tax credit we moved from risks fifth place to first in the rankings. Further into the KPMG report, it is also interesting to see the city rankings. Melbourne and Sydney are first and third respectively. It is not that I subscribe to the old supremacy arguments, but I think we might see Sydney climbing back up to No. 1 there. Those rankings are well ahead of other global cities such as London and New York, and this endorsement by KPMG is unsolicited. Earlier this month the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr, who has been driving all these changes to deliver the new R&D tax credit, welcomed KPMG's conclusions. He observed that they place our new tax credit ahead of other, similar offerings by Canada, the United States, France, Italy, Japan and Mexico. In fact, it also ranks higher than the R&D assistance provided in the Netherlands and the UK. The minister then went on to describe KPMG's unsolicited endorsement as ‘one of the strongest possible vindications of the Australian government's new R&D support measures', and I concur with that wholeheartedly. Getting praise from the experts is good, but getting praise from the industries involved is even better. I am confident that, when we are able to cut company tax to 28 per cent as part of the implementation of the resource super profits tax, the R&D environment in Australia will become that much more competitive. Labor's R&D tax credit has also already won glowing endorsements from several major players in the R&D sector. Dr Brendan Shaw, the Chief Executive of Medicines Australia, said: This could be a massive opportunity for the pharmaceutical and biotech industries in this country … All indications are that the new program will help bring global investment in pharmaceuticals R&D to Australia, in large part by reducing the cost of conducting eligible R&D in this country. The bottom line is that this new program will reduce the net cost of undertaking R&D in Australia and make us more globally competitive. We look forward to continue working with Government to ensure this program delivers tangible benefits to companies who bring R&D investment to Australia. I look forward to continuing to work with Dr Shaw, because he and many of his members know that they can rely on me as their local member to be a strong voice for the interests of the pharmaceutical sector and ensure they get a good hearing. I bump into Dr Shaw on a fairly regular basis up on ‘Pill Hill', as it known in my area. I was with him recently at the official opening of the new permanent Australian office of the global biopharmaceutical company Shire, which is on Waterloo Road in North Ryde. They had a terrific gathering there in April. Shire is a company that specialises in lifesaving treatments for very rare or, as they say, ‘orphan' genetic disorders in which there are few or no therapeutic options. Shire employed 11 permanent full-time staff and four people as contract part-timers in the last year, and they intend hiring another seven permanent full-timers over the next year. Their general manager, Dominic Barnes, tells me they have about three treatments availabletwo are currently being reviewed by the TGA-and they are intending to submit four more to the TGA this coming year. I mention this because this is precisely the kind of company I am sure is keen to take advantage of the government's R&D tax credit. So are other pharma companies like Johnson&Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline. The J&J family of companies is headquartered in North Ryde. Their pharmaceutical company Janssen-Cilag Australia is built on research and development. GSK has its division in Melbourne, but it has its healthcare division in Ermington in my electorate. I am emphasising all this, Madam Deputy Speaker, because many roads lead back to Bennelong. What do these companies have in common and what are they like? There are several things. The fact is that ongoing compliance with this new system will be much simpler. The fact is that this legislation takes into account variable levels of investment from year to year. The fact is that it makes Australia as competitive as other companies or divisions of the same R&D companies in the US or the UK. In the case of Janssen-Cilag, this change to an R&D tax credit system will assist them to attract and employ more reis searchers to carry out early-stage pharmaceutical research on new molecules in diseases in areas like cancer and virology. It will mean more demand for local clinicians and allow R&D companies to at least maintain and possibly increase research in hospitals across the country. These companies have been supportive of a move to a tax credit for a number of years. They know that a tax credit is a better way of supporting real R&D and that many parts of our health sector will benefit-more so than under the previous scheme. Dr Anna Lavelle, the CEO of AusBiotech, is certainly on the record in this regard. Dr Lavelle represents around 3,000 member organisations in the Australian biotechnology sector. She has said this legislation is ‘good for the biotech sector and good for small innovative Australian companies'. In her submission to the Senate Economics Committee, Dr Lavelle said the following: Cognisant of the unique business model required by biotechnology, where significant funds are required often over many years and up-front before any return can be realised, the tax credit, especially the refundable credit, is vital if tions and the start-up biotechnology industry are to thrive in Australia. The biotechnology, medical technology and pharmaceutical industries all believe the move to the tax credit is the right government policy, and best for Australian innovation - with spillover benefits to the Australia community in terms of jobs, economic growth and access to technological developments. Dr Lavelle went on to observe: … the move from the tax concession, which is not working for the industry as a whole, to the tax credit … will provide a much-needed lifeline. I note as well that in Dr Lavelle's submission she said that her sector had lost 16 of its 128 listed biotech companies between 2008 and 2009-the height of the global financial crisis. She said: Any further delay will mean young innovative companies will not be able to access the refundable creditand that would have adverse consequences. So biotech is undoubtedly our future, and the sector needs the support of the credit tax to replace the tax concession now. The Rudd government has no intention of jeopardising this vital sector-quite the contrary. Through these proposals we are providing much needed support. Let there be no misunderstanding about these incentives. They do not exclude R&D activities carried out in a production environment. It is not true that production trials are effectively excluded by the dominant purpose test. Manufacturers will still be able to claim core R&D activities that fall within the definition of an experiment generated for the purpose of acquiring new knowledge, and the dominant purpose test only applies to supporting R&D activities that are production activities. So the government have undertaken an extensive consultation process. We invited public submissions and there were two exposure drafts of the legislation. As a result of all of innovathis, the government has made some significant changes. (Time expired)",60
25,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I rise on this Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 and will be joining my colleagues in opposing it. It is a clear demonstration of this government's inability to consult with key stakeholders, including smalland medium-sized businesses, and there are a couple of areas in my electorate that I want to discuss. I listened to the parliamentary secretary, and she seemed to be focusing on the very big end of town-international companies with their head offices located in other parts of the world rather than Australian companies, smalland medium-sized businesses. It is these businesses that I will focus on in my contribution. There is a lot of confusion and uncertainty with this legislation, and that has been a typical feature that we have observed of this government. There has always been little consultation with affected stakeholders. The exposure drafts were ushered through in the weeks before Christmas and Easter, but with this legislation going through the House this week, firms, companies and businesses will have just two weeks to read and understand the legislation and how it pertains to their process and industry before the new rules come into place on 1 July. There simply has not been enough consultation, information or education about what the new rules are and how they will be applied. That is why we are asking that the implementation date be delayed until at least July 2011 so that there is an adequate time for consultation with community, particularly with small businesses and of course the key stakeholders. Industry needs that time to deal with the impracticalities and the realities of how this legislation would apply, and the legislation does need to be amended. Perhaps the most blatant and adverse implication of this legislation is how it will erode incentives for R&D. Concerns have been raised by stakeholders that these legislative changes will be a disincentive to undertake R&D here in Australia; instead, it could well encourage a shift of R&D offshore. The dairy industry is just one stakeholder group which has voiced its concern. In my own electorate of Maranoa there is a significant dairy industry. This legislation is more about research than development and it will have a punitive impact on those companies which, through innovation, can refine and improve an existing product and make a better product. The bill limits R&D eligibility to the creation of new knowledge, which was acknowledged by the Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, rather than applied research and development. Let me touch on some issues that were raised by the Australian Dairy Products Federation, a very reputable body. As you would know, Madam Deputy Speaker Moylan, the dairy industry has been through massive deregulation, but it has always been at the forefront, moving forward, and R&D has been a key factor in bringing new products to the market. I will read into the Hansard some of the federation's concerns, as outlined in its submission to the exposure draft of the legislation: Many different R&D outcomes are sought, for example new dairy products, new pharmaceutical applications of extracted milk factors and compounds, new processes and techniques to extract and process milk, milk by-products and fractions, environmental and sustainability driven developments, herd, pasture and on-farm development … This occurs across a range of products including … milk powder and cheese products, products such as infant formulas and specialised products including functional food products … and cosmeceutical products. These factors will complicate the application of new concepts, particularly where uncertainty exists. The submission goes on to say: The use of the term ‘directly related' is ambiguous, and potentially creates an extensive nexus. Much of the (successful) R&D undertaken in the dairy industry will eventually lead to a viable commercial outcome, most likely in the form of a new or improved dairy product, or production process/technique that leads to improved dairy products, at some stage. Often this will not be readily discernable at the time of early stage R&D activities, (i.e. the results and/or likely success is not yet known). How direct the connection with the ultimate production needs to be is unclear and requires more clarity. That is an example of the uncertainty. An industry such as the dairy industry cannot decipher how this would apply. They understand the existing rules and they have worked with the existing rules. I put their concerns on the record. The Minerals Council of Australia wrote in its submission to Treasury on the exposure draft: Some innovations are revolutionary; others are marked shifts in what has gone before … Yet the government is dismissing that reality. The legislation significantly alters the definitions of ‘core' and ‘supporting' R&D. With its narrow definition of what constitutes genuine R&D, this bill will disqualify from assistance many forms of R&D undertaken by Australian businesses. I would like to give an example of a small business based in Dalby, in my electorate of Maranoa, which has voiced concerns about how the change to the legislation will affect its R&D projects. Dingo Australia is a privately owned manufacturer that has designed a very impressive mini-digger, the Dingo, that is sold not only in Australia but in many markets around the world, from the Middle East to North America. It is a product that has been developed through R&D in the town of Dalby. In its submission to Treasury on the first exposure draft of the legislation, Dingo used an example of a specific R&D project for putting tracks on the Dingo machine that would have qualified for the tax concession under the current legislation. The project involves innovative design amendments and testing to ensure that the product can perform in different conditions. It is important to be able to test a product before put onto the market-but even before you get to the test stage you have to do the R&D to see whether the innovation will work on the product in a practical sense. However, because it is not really considered ‘novel' or ‘new', it may be excluded from the assistance. The Dingo company has been in operation for 20 years and has produced over 7½ thousand machines in various forms. The machine has progressed over the years. Dingo has refined and developed it using R&D to create a safer and more efficient product that is very widely sought. But they have not stopped at that. It is just like the modern motor car. Manufacturers have not stopped developing the piston driven engine. Look at Toyota. It received R&D money from this federal government to produce a hybrid Camry here in Australia. I think the technology was developed in Japan, so the money went to Japan. The car may be manufactured here, but the R&D work was done offshore in another country. Dingo Australia, in Dalby, employ 90 people. When you consider the multiplier effect of 90 people, you have another 500 or 600 people who are employed because of those initial 90 jobs. Dingo have relied on investment in R&D. They spend something like 2½ per cent of their annual turnover on R&D. The other point they raised with me was that, with a turnover of $28 million, they regard themselves as an SME-a small and medium enterprise. The limit of $20 million on a smalland medium-sized enterprise they say is a joke and should be increased to at least $40 million. As I said, they are a small company that employs 90 people. There should be a distinction between a publicly listed company and privately owned companies with a turnover of less than $40 million. That is a classic example in a rural community of people with an idea putting it into a product and employing local people. it is They have been successful for 20 years. They are genuine in their concern about this legislation. It does require more time for consultation with key stakeholders. That is just one example, quite apart from the dairy industry's concerns-and we all know just how the dairy industry has been under a lot of pressure from imports, particularly from New Zealand. Let's make sure we keep our dairy industry at the forefront of new R&D and make sure that we in Australia, through our dairy farmers, are at the cutting edge of research and leading that research to make sure we stay in front of the game. So I put it to the minister: this legislation does not need to be rammed through before 1 July this year. Many of us on this side of the House see it as nothing more than a revenue grab. We should be making sure that industry has time to consult and put their points to government. It is, after all, the businesses that take the risks. Let us make sure we encourage innovation and let us make sure we encourage Australian companies to be the innovators. Let us ensure that the benefits of this tax concession go to these Australian companies that are going to do that research right here in Australia so that we own the research and those companies are able to make sure that the products they make are not only competitive and more innovative and meeting a market need in Australia but also have the potential to be exported and be at the cutting edge always against our competitors who would want some of the markets that our exporters have been so successful over many years in getting a foothold into. In conclusion, I will be supporting my colleagues on this side of the House calling for more time and more consultation with the industry and key stakeholders. As it is drafted, I cannot support this legislation and I will be voting against it when it comes up for a vote today.",64
26,Ms BIRD,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the bills before today-the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010. I understand that several speakers on the other side have raised, as the member for Maranoa did, issues around their desire to see more time for consultation. In the detail of my speech I will go through the quiet extensive process that has been put in place to reach this point. I just make the observation that it seems to be a consistent theme from the other side these days to say that we need more time for consultation when really they just do not want to support reform. There is a clear indication, and the govthe ernment strongly believes, that innovation is the primary driver of sustainable growth as well social well-being and therefore should be a priority for any government, as it is for this government. The bills before us are an important component of the government's broader innovation agenda. The first schedule of the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill implements a more generous research and development tax incentive benefit for eligible activities, and it is better targeted towards research and development that benefits Australia than the existing tax concession system. Importantly, it should also be noted that the new scheme is also substantially simpler and is supported by improved administrative arrangements to make it more efficient. At the heart of the new incentives are two core components: the first is a 45 per cent refundable research and development tax offset for eligible entities with a turnover of less than $20 million; and the second is a nonrefundable 40 per cent research and development tax offset for all other eligible entities. These changed rates are supported by a delivery mechanism that is clearer and by a us better targeted definition of the eligible research and development activities. That will ensure that the incentive is available in the circumstances, consistent with the underlying rationale for government intervention, and that it delivers value for money for taxpayers. It is the intention of the government that the new research and development incentive will start on 1 July 2010 so that the benefits can be delivered as soon as possible. To this end the government has provided $38 million in the 2009-10 budget to ensure that AusIndustry and the ATO are equipped to assist taxpayers in adjusting to the new scheme as it comes into force. These new incentives are targeted at stimulating productivity growth and innovation throughout the Australian economy with the aim of building prosperity and competitiveness for the long term. The new 45 per cent refundable tax credit is equivalent to a 150 per cent tax duction and is therefore a doubling of the current base incentive for smaller entities to expend money on research and development. This is important, as in so many parts of the country, including my own in the Illawarra, smaller and medium-sized businesses are often the driving force for growth in jobs and opportunities in our regions. The Treasurer and the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research indicated in announcing the reforms that approximately 5,500 small business firms could benefit from the incentive. The 40 per cent non-refundable tax credit is equivalent to a 133 per cent tax deduction and therefore raises the current base incentive for larger entities by one-third. These bills are extensive inquiries, as I indicated at the beginning of my comments, into building an effective incentive scheme to appropriately support research and development activities across the economy. In 2007-nearly three years ago now-the Productivity Commission released a research report entitled Public support for science and innovation. This report identified some issues with the existing scheme that hampered its effectiveness. Prior to that time, in the previous government, when I was a member of the House Economics Committee we took evidence from across industry about concerns they had about the effectiveness of the scheme as it existed. The Productivity Commission report identified that the criteria the basic 125 per cent tax concession was not successful in screening out research and development that would have happened anyway, that the benefits of the existing incentive were not large and could in effect be negative, and that the net pay off from the concession could be substantially improved by maintaining access to the concession for small entities only. This report was followed in 2008 by the de- Cutler review. On 22 January 2008, Minister Carr announced a review of Australia's innovation system and appointed Dr Terry Cutler to undertake the review. The report was released in August 2008 and was titled Venturous Australia: building strength in innovation. The Cutler review made several findings, including that the existing incentive should be changed from a tax deduction to a tax credit, that a 40 per cent tax credit should be available to larger entities and a refundable 50 per cent tax credit to smaller entities, that all research and development undertaken in Australia that meets the relevant definitions be eligible for tax credit and that research and development expenditure undertaken in Australia by foreign owned entities based on be eligible for the tax credit. On 12 May 2009 the government released its response to the Cutler review. The response outlined the government's long-term innovation policy agenda and was titled Powering ideas: an innovation agenda for the 21st century. The government broadly accepted the intentions of the findings of the Cutler review and consequently announced the proposed new incentive, which was included as a budget measure in the 2010-11 budget. In announcing the government's response the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Kim Carr, outlined that the government's support for innovation and for competitiveness in our industries and companies was even more significant and for important through the period of international instability that was the global financial crisis. As part of the overall innovation changes that this government has put in place, we have started an annual Australian innovation system report, which is intended to be an ongoing annual series providing information on the state of innovation in Australia. The first report has been published-for the 2010 year. The report makes the very important point about the integration of the innovation system in Australia. This bill goes to the issues around private companies investing in innovation and development supported through, appropriately, government programs. The report indicates the great importance of integration between the public and private sectors and also collaboration between them. I think it is worth repeating a comment made in the report under the heading ‘Research capacity and skill base': Australia's innovation performance is underpinned by its research capacity and skills base. Research in the public and private sectors creates new ideas which fuel innovation, while skilled workers drive innovation by turning ideas into new products, services and processes for the benefit of the economy and society. Indeed, these bills sit within that overall structure. I want to highlight in my contribution to this debate some real-life examples of that in my own area of the Illawarra. I am pleased to see in here Parliamentary Secretary Marles, who has played a significant role in the announcement of some of these. I have been very pleased to welcome him to the Illawarra. I will first outline for the House a program that is a tremendous example of the collaborative model, and that is the Cooperative Research Centres Program. The parliamentary secretary recently attended the Innovation Campus at the University of Wollongong with me and members not only of the university but also of industry to launch the Energy Pipelines CRC. This is a particularly exciting initiative. At that launching we had people from industry not only from across Australia but from industry internationally. This particular CRC will be located at the University of Wollongong. It is important to note that the CRC will receive $17.48 million over the 10 years of its operation. That will be complemented by significant partner cash from the private sector of around $70.6 million-a great example of the government and the private sector working together. The CRC's aim is to deliver long-term safety and security for Australia's energy sector, a task that could hardly be more important as we look around the world and see nations dealing with energy security and energy efficiency issues. Some of those from industry who were in attendance on the day said to me thatsadly-pipelines, because they generally are under the ground, out of sight, tend to be out of mind. It would be a great failing for a nation to take that view, because the reliability and security of our pipelines is so important to the provision of energy throughout the nation. In my own area, only very recently we saw an example of how disruptive a failure in the pipelines can be when we had a failure in the gas pipelines to the Southern Highlands area. The local ABC radio station had people ringing in and giving quite innovative feedback, I have to say, on how they were managing to get a shower or to make a cup of coffee. People were commenting on how much we take for granted our energy supply and how disruptive it is when it is no longer there. The cooperative research centre at the University of Wollongong will be working specifically around metals and materials development in order to provide not only cheaper, more efficient pipeline but also more reliable and secure pipeline. The development of that sort of expertise in Australia would be hugely valuable and no doubt important in placing us competitively on the international scene in this area as well. So I was very pleased. It is no surprise that in the Illawarra we combine the great development of manufacturing knowledge and skills from our years and years of involvement in the manufacturing sectorincluding and epitomised by BlueScope Steel, a tremendous corporate citizen in our area-with that driving house of research and innovation, Wollongong university. Marrying those two in such an initiative seems to me a tremendous outcome and something that will indeed place us nationally very well in innovation. The second development locally that I wanted to outline to the House was this. In March this year I participated in a groundbreaking ceremony at another facility, the Innovation Campus of the University of Wollongong. This was to establish the Australian Institute for Innovative Materials Processing and Devices Facility, funded by the federal government with a $50 million grant. That is another critically important facility contributing to innovating and working closely with industry in order to well position the country on innovation and commercialisation. Currently there are no facilities available in Australia to produce multifunctional materials at the scale and quantity required to bridge what the university describes as ‘the valley of death' to commercialisation. The new facility that my colleague Jennie George and I turned the sod for at the Innovation Campus of the Wollongong university is due to be completed by March 2011. I would like to indicate that the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research), Professor Judy Raper, has been quoted as saying about this facility: Australia now has the opportunity to transform multifunctional materials research and be the world leader in this research and also in mercialisation. The piece went on: Multifunctional materials (such as electromaterials that generate and/or transfer electric chargean area where UOW is a recognised international leader-have the potential to solve many of the world's health and technology problems. However, many such advanced multifunctional materials cannot be processed using conventional methods. Professor Raper said the challenge nowfor the universitywas to take these materials from fundamental research, through the proof of concept stage and into real world applications, novel fabrication, processing and to develop manufacturing methods. This is a truly fantastic initiative and I think it epitomises the intention of not only the university but the broader Wollongong community for the Innovation Campus and, indeed, for Wollongong to be a city of innovation. It is a really important outcome for our region but also for the nation as it builds upon those partnerships of meaningful research and engaging with industry. Only last Friday I again was over at the Innovation Campus to announce that $25 million had been granted by the federal government to establish a new facility. It will be titled the Retrofitting for Resilient and Sustainable Buildings facility. It is a really important initiative, where the university will be working to do research and, again, product development in partnership with Illawarra TAFE around the retrofitting of buildings for a more efficient energy future. This will be a tremendous new facility. It will develop evidence based practice in sustainable building technologies and design for Southern Hemisphere environments. This is really important in developing efficient methods for our environment rather than just taking its comNorthern Hemisphere developed solutions, which may not always translate over particularly well. I was very pleased to attend the Innovation Campus. They assure me they still have more blocks of land available. Whilst we have had a tremendous investment over at that Innovation Campus in the 2½ years of the Rudd government, I look forward to more in the future. I want to conclude my comments in this debate by indicating that all of this fits together into an integrated approach by this government to innovation. Our world and the future of our nation in a highly competitive global economy will be heavily reliant on capacity in the development of knowledge and technology and pressured by emerging social and environmental issues. This will require us to ensure an efficient and effective national system that fosters and supports innovation across and between the public and private sectors. In the minister's publication referred to earlier, Powering ideas, this government identified a number of critically important initiatives to best position our nation. The Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council steers a whole-ofgovernment approach to ensure integration of policy developments. This work will be supported by the research workforce strategy, which is currently under development, and the Innovation Metrics Framework to provide an evidence base for policy and review. These bills sit, importantly, within that comprehensive framework of innovation and, after a significant number of years of consultation and development, they should be supported by this parliament as an important part of our innovation future. I commend the bills to the House.",67
27,Mr MARLES,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Corio-Parliamentary Secretary for Innovation and Industry) (12.58 pm)-Can I start by thanking the members who have contributed to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010. In summing up, I would like to start by saying that in the innovation and research and development space we need to look at what the Rudd government inherited after 11½ years of the Howard government. At the end of the Howard government, what we found in this country was a level of public expenditure on research and development that was simply inadequate and that was growing slowly. We had seen the private spend on research and development hit significantly by the reduction in the tax concession that was introduced at the outset of the Howard government, which meant that for the first few years of the Howard government we actually saw the private spend on R&D decline in Australia. Whilst it started to grow again in the latter part of the Howard government, by the time of its end we still found that the private spend on R&D in Australia was less than the OECD average. When you look at collaboration, which is regarded as the key driver of innovation, at the end of the Howard government we had a collaboration situation in Australia that was simply pathetic. Throughout the period from 2004 to 2006 Australia ranked stone motherless last within the OECD in terms of the level of collaboration between the private sector and the public research institutions. When you look at the spend on national knowledge, which is a statistic kept by the OECD, at the end of the Howard government Australia was spending about 3.9 per cent of GDP against the OECD average of 4.9 per cent. Again, between 1998 and 2003 that spend grew by a much smaller rate than what was occurring in the rest of the OECD. All of this was painting a picture of Australia being a cut-price, low-tech economy, which was driving wages down and taking Australia away from being a modern developed economy. On coming to government the very first thing that the Rudd government did in this area, as has been mentioned by a number of speakers in this debate, was to implement the Cutler review of Australia's innovation system. That led to the policy statement of the government last year entitled Powering Ideas, which set forth a 10year strategy on innovation within Australia. That was backed up by a significant increase in our spend in this area during the 2009-10 budget. We saw a 25 per cent increase in the spend on innovation, industry, science and research in Australia-the single largest increase in expenditure that this area has ever seen. We saw the raw figures go from a spend of $6.88 billion to $8.58 billion in that budget. When you look at the levels of public research, we see in the 2009-10 budget $1.2 billion more being spent than was spent in the 2007-08 budget. We see areas of activity to try to promote collaboration. For example, the Researchers in Business program, which forms part of Enterprise Connect, places in businesses young researchers at the cutting edge of technology so that collaboration and that sharing can occur. When you look at trying to improve the private spend on R&D, we have this raft of legislation, which deals with R&D tax credits. This is a critical plank in the strategy improve the private spend on research and development in Australia. The very first aspect of this bill will cut out the wasteful penditure which is going on in the current R&D tax concession program, which was implemented by the Howard government. A lot of what is being funded under that program is actually business-as-usual activities. It is not R&D in the sense of creating new knowledge or developing new products; it is just expenditure that would have occurred if there were no tax incentive at all. Take for example the customising of an existing software platform for your business. On purchasing the software program you would do that even if there were no R&D tax incentive. Clearly, that is not an efficient way to spend public money. What we seek to do through the R&D tax credits is make sure the expenditure is clearly focused on genuine R&D activities and not on business-as-usual activities. There have been assertions made from the other side that in tightening that definition the new scheme will not adequately cover development as opposed to research activities. That is simply not true. The object clause includes both research and development activities and refers to activities undertaken for the purpose of generating new knowledge in either a general or applied form. The development aspect of R&D is captured by the term ‘applied', which is consistent with the approach taken in the Frascati Manual. The definition of ‘core R&D activities' includes experimental activities ‘conducted for the purpose of generating new knowledge (including about the creation of new or improved materials, products, devices, processes or services)'. The expression ‘improved' within ‘new or improved' means experimental developmental activities. There has also been some comment on the to dominant purpose test. The dominant purpose test is a well-defined concept that is commonly used in tax law. The explanatory ex- memorandum states that ‘dominant purpose' means ‘the prevailing or most influential purpose'. It is consistent with the terms used throughout tax law. Following the passage of this bill AusIndustry will produce an abundance of guidance material to assist firms to prepare their registration, including guidance on how the application of the dominant purpose test applies. In tightening this definition we have provided a much closer connection between core R&D research and this policy that supports that R&D activity so that at the end of the day what is being supported is genuine research and development. With the savings that come from that tightening of the definition we will be able to increase the base rate provided to those companies which are engaging in R&D activities in a very significant way. It will be 45 per cent for small businesses-businesses that have a turnover of less than $20 million-effectively doubling the rate of assistance from 7½c to 15c, and 40 per cent for other companies, which increases by a third, from 7½c to 10c, the effective rate of government assistance. It has been said by those opposite that in effect what is going on here is a revenueraising measure. It has been asserted by the shadow Assistant Treasurer. That is patently ridiculous. The Treasury has costed the changes to the R&D tax credit and made clear that this is a proposal which is revenue neutral. Indeed, that was confirmed in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee's report on this bill. That report absolutely took into account each of the key aspects of this bill: the increase in the base rates and estimated change in the take-up of the R&D tax credit, as well as the abolition of the 175 per cent incremental tax concession and the tightening of the eligibility criteria. The R&D tax credit has a particular focus on small business by having the small business threshold. Under the old R&D tax concession scheme we had a situation where there were two million businesses that could potentially have availed themselves of a form of R&D and yet only 8,000 were doing so. We need to see more R&D conducted in small businesses, hence the focus on small business. We have also made sure that this is an R&D tax credit, that there is a credit nature to this proposal, which means that those businesses in a tax loss situation will still be able to get a credit in respect of the R&D activity they are undertaking. That is really important because quite often the R&D activity is taken at the beginning of the development of a product, when a profit may not necessarily be turned. Again, there have been assertions from the opposition in relation to the level of consultation around the R&D tax credit legislation. That is simply unfounded. The changes to the existing R&D tax concession were first canvassed in the independent review of the National Innovation System back in 2008. There has been an extensive program of consultation over the last 12 months. Industry has had numerous opportunities, including three rounds of public consultation and a Senate committee process, to participate. The government received over 380 submissions during these three rounds of consultation and held public hearings attended by 550 people. The government has made some significant changes where stakeholders have been able to make constructive suggestions for improvement. The coalition has also referred to drafting the errors as a reason for delaying the passage of the bill. The Senate committee report did not identify any legislative drafting errors. A number of minor referencing errors in the explanatory memorandum were identified, and these have already been addressed in a correction to the explanatory memorandum tabled in this chamber back on 2 June. I will conclude in summing up by referring to a recent report by KPMG which ranked Australia as No. 1 in the world for incentives which foster R&D activity. The report states: This change is a result of Australia adopting a new R&D tax credit as of July 1st, 2010 … It goes on to state: For many R&D operations, such as spin-offs from larger firms or university research projects, the potentially refundable nature of these tax credits will represent a powerful incentive to structure within the defined revenue limits. The same report ranks Melbourne and Sydney as, respectively, the No. 1 and No. 3 cities in the world for their R&D tax competitiveness. In doing so, it places them ahead of places such as London and New York. This is a clear point of difference between the government and the opposition. We see the role of innovation as utterly critical to improving productivity within the workplace in Australia. Indeed, if you look at the history of productivity growth in Australia, which has inevitably been driven by Labor policies, this is the new frontier. Having a vibrant innovation space is what will see the next leap in productivity within this country. That is something that we are committed to; that is something that the Howard government utterly ignored and that the opposition are continuing to ignore. But it is critical for the development of our country's economy, and a key plank in that is these bills. I commend them to the House. Question put: That this bill be now read a second time.

30,Mr DUTTON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the National Health Amendment (Continence Aids Payment Scheme) Bill 2010. Whilst serious health and quality of life impacts of incontinence may not be widely recognised, it is an important area of health that has deservedly received government support over many years. The coalition government, in 1998, established and funded the National Continence Management Strategy. This important initiative provided funding for research and service development programs aimed at prevention and treatment. The Continence Aids Assistance Scheme, which the government will amend with this bill, has provided funding to assist Australians with permanent and severe incontinence to purchase continence products. The previous coalition government invested to expand the program on a number of occasions. Most recently, in July 2007, the coalition expanded the scheme to provide access to subsidised continence products for an additional 54,000 Australians with permanent incontinence. The 2007 budget measure expanded the program for people aged five to 15 years and those aged 65 years and over with a neurological condition causing incontinence as well as pensioner concession card holders and their dependants in those age groups with non-neurological causes of permanent incontinence such as dementia and prostate disease. Previously, the program had been available only to people of working age with a neurological cause of incontinence. The coalition's expansion of the program trebled the number of people receiving assistance for continence products and provided those affected with the opportunity to remain active in their homes and communities. As a result of the changes in 2007, the coalition provided an additional $98.5 million over the forward estimates to assist Australians to access continence products. The bill before us today enacts the 200910 budget measure and provides a saving of $10.7 million over the forward estimates in the area of continence aids assistance. The bill amends the National Health Act to provide the minister with the legislative authority to create a scheme by means of legislative instrument that provides payments to eligible persons to assist with the costs of incontinence management products. The Continence Aids Payment Scheme will replace the Continence Aids Assistance Scheme. Under the assistance scheme, products up to the value of $489, indexed annually, were provided to eligible people with severe and permanent incontinence by a single supplier on behalf of the Department of Health and Ageing. Under the government's new scheme, those eligible will now receive a direct payment into their nominated bank account and it is to be administered by Medicare Australia. According to the explanatory memorandum, the amount of the payment will be specified in the legislative instrument. The Department of Health and Ageing fact sheet indicates that the payment will equate to the current value available under CAAS-that is, $489 indexed annually. The government argues that the new scheme will provide greater choice to consumers, enhance competition and reduce administrative costs. For a person receiving assistance directly before the commencement date of 1 July 2010, under proposed section 3(3) of the legislation that person is entitled to receive a payment under the CAP Scheme for the financial year starting 1 July 2010, provided they supply the requisite details by 30 November. After 1 July 2011 the Medicare Australia CEO will be entitled to make eligibility decisions regarding the CAP Scheme. I note the department's fact sheet states that the eligibility for the CAP Scheme will remain the same as it is now, and this is an essential point to underscore. It is claimed that people who are five years of age or older and have permanent and severe incontinence due to a neurological condition or caused by another specified condition will continue to be eligible. Unfortunately, this government has a terrible history of backflipping on major health promises and, understandably, many people are concerned about the government's intentions beyond 1 July 2011 as specified in this legislation. According to the government, 55 per cent of people accessing support under the existing program are over 65 years of age. Many of these people will clearly remember the actions of the Minister for Health and Ageing on the cataract rebate and the Rudd government's attempt to rip millions of dollars out of Medicare through a savage 50 per cent rebate cut. The people affected by the change to the National Health Act under this legislation will also recall it was Minister Roxon who on 26 September stated: Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private health Insurance rebates … As we know, they have now tried on multiple occasions to rip $2 billion out of health through changes to the rebate. Patients affected by this legislation are also in age groups affected by the Rudd government's proposed and enacted caps to the Medicare safety net for macular degeneration. Varicose vein treatment and cataract treatment are part of the Rudd government's attempt to rip another $450 million out of Medicare. Of course it was then opposition leader, Kevin Rudd, and health spokesperson, Nicola Roxon, who gave the iron-clad promise on 22 September: With about one million people each year receiving some cost relief from the safety net, federal Labor will not put more pressure on family budgets by taking that assistance away. These are just some of the reasons why the Rudd government, and this minister in particular, have lost the trust of the Australian people when it comes to their promises and in particular their promises in relation to health. It is certainly the case-and the Australian people now realise this-that the Rudd government's word cannot be believed, particularly in relation to measures in the health portfolio. There have been concerns raised regarding the distribution of products and any additional associated costs for those eligible for the scheme. It is argued that increased competition as a result of the new scheme will ensure delivery costs will not be passed on to consumers. This may turn out to be the case but it does seem a big assumption. Also, many people receiving access to the scheme do not live in major metropolitan areas, so it is important that the government is able to give some assurances that their timely access to products will not be disrupted. There is a risk for some people on fixed incomes and pensions that a direct cash payment may be used to offset the rising cost of living in other areas. It would be a terrible situation if people are forced to forgo these important products to pay rising electricity costs or, indeed, basic food items. As I have outlined, the coalition strongly support appropriate assistance for continence products and recognise the important impact it can have on a person's health and quality of life. That was our record when we were in government. That is our record now in opposition. We do have a number of concerns, though, regarding the Rudd government's ability to implement this measure without disadvantaging eligible Australians. So, while we do not oppose this legislation, we will be monitoring very closely the Rudd government's handling of this change and we put them on notice to that effect. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned. Leave granted for second reading debate to resume at a later hour this day. PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with request for amendments. Ordered that the requested amendments be considered immediately. Senate's requested amendmentsSchedule A (1) Clause 6, page 9 (after line 15), after the definition of birth verification form, insert: born prematurely: a child is born prematurely if, at the time of the child's delivery, the child's period of gestation is less than 37 weeks. (2) Clause 31, page 40 (line 8), after “(see Division 3)”, insert “or subsection (4A) applies to the person”. (3) Clause 31, page 40 (line 32), after “(see Division 3)”, insert “or subsection (4A) applies to the person”. (4) Clause 31, page 41 (after line 6), after subclause (4), insert: (4A) This subsection applies to a person if: (a) the person does not satisfy the work test in relation to a child; and (b) the person is the birth mother of the child; and (c) the Secretary is satisfied that either or both of the following subparagraphs apply: (i) the child was born prematurely; (ii) while the person was pregnant with the child, the person had complications or illness related to the pregnancy which prevented the person from performing paid work; and (d) the Secretary is satisfied that the person would have satisfied the work test if either or both of the subparagraphs in paragraph (c) had not applied.",75
31,Ms MACKLIN,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (1.32 pm)-I move: That the requested amendments be made. The Senate has requested that the House make amendments to the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 to modify the work test for women who experience a premature birth and/or are unable to meet the work test due to complications or illness related to their pregnancy. This request was initiated by the government in the Senate in response to concerns raised in the Senate committee inquiry about whether women who have premature births or pregnancy complications that prevent them from working will meet the work test. The government acknowledges submissions made by the National Foundation for Australian Women, the ACTU and the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association on this issue. The Senate committee, in its report, recommended: … that the government examine the eligibility requirements … to ensure that … women who experience unexpected difficulties during pregnancy which may affect their ability to meet the eligibility requirements of the bill are able to access paid parental leave. The government is therefore moving amendments to the Paid Parental Leave Bill to modify the work test for women who experience a premature birth and/or are unable to meet the work test due to complications or illness relating to their pregnancy. These amendments will allow a birth mother to be eligible for parental leave pay where the department secretary is satisfied that she would have met the work test but for the premature birth of her child or pregnancy related complications or illness. The changes will ensure that women in these circumstances are not precluded from the Paid Parental Leave scheme because of unexpected developments in their pregnancy which prevent them from doing the amount of paid work they otherwise would have undertaken. The cost of the amendments is likely to be negligible. Many women experiencing pregnancy related illness or complications will have access to paid leave which already counts as qualifying work for the paid parental leave work test. The new provisions will ensure that the small number of women who may not have met the paid parental leave work test for these reasons will be able to access parental leave pay. It would not be appropriate for women who clearly have a genuine labour market attachment to be made ineligible in these sorts of situations.",78
32,Mr BILSON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I congratulate the minister on bringing these amendments forward. They have the complete and wholehearted support of the coalition. So as not to delay the passage of the bill through the parliamentary process, I will briefly highlight an amendment of particular interest to the small business communitythe government's agreement to the opposition's request to have the department secretary continue to be the pay clerk, effectively, for this arrangement, indefinitely. Ms Macklin interjecting",78
33,Mr BILSON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"That is an issue that we are pleased we have got agreement on in that respect and we are encouraged by that. It is a great comfort to many in the small business community, and I thank the minister for her interest in and willingness to deal with that.",78
34,Dr STONE,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"In relation to these amendments I will just say that we support the inclusion of women who may have those pregnancy difficulties and who do have an attachment to the workplace. We think they are very sensible amendments, and certainly they would be reflected in the paid parental leave plan that the coalition will introduce when we are in government. This is very important, and we commend these amendments to the House.",78
35,Mr BILSON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Dunkley) (1.36 pm)The minister has just corrected me, and I thank her for that. Just to put the record straight, it is the Senate that has so far agreed with the proposition we have put forward, and I would encourage the government in this place to consider embracing that very thoughtful proposition-that, if we are going to set up those systems for six months for the Family Assistance Office, it makes a lot of sense to keep utilising that investment rather than transfer the cost and compliance burden to smaller employers.

36,Mr NEUMANN,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I speak in support of the National Health Amendment (Continence Aids Payment Scheme) Bill 2010. The member for Dickson was critical in his speech of the Rudd government's initiatives in relation to health and aged care, but the problems he mentioned have not been the experience of the constituents in the electorate of Blair, which I have the honour to represent in this House. In our area there has been substantial investment in health and ageing-in the 2008-09 budget, the 2009-10 budget, and the 2010-11 budget, which we have recently passed. Incontinence is a real problem for some of our senior citizens and many in aged-care facilities and, while the member for Dickson was critical of what we are doing in relation to so much of the legislative agenda of the Rudd government, if he were to come to the electorate of Blair he would see in Ipswich and the rural areas outside significant investment in health, particularly in hospitals, such as the Ipswich General Hospital, and in aged-care facilities. We have some fantastic aged-care facilities in the electorate of Blair, such as Cabanda Aged Care at Rosewood, a rural area outside Ipswich City. The Rudd government is supporting 500 jobs in a $1.5 million election commitment to that facility. Another wonderful facility is Elim Village, part of the Queensland Baptist Care facility. Recently I was there to salute their service. There was a flagpole and a memorial set up there. There are many other fine facilities. Colthup Home in Ipswich is another great facility run by Queensland Baptist Care. Many of the residents in our aged-care facilities across Australia suffer from the terrible embarrassment and difficulties of permanent and severe incontinence. This is defined as a frequent and uncontrollable moderate to large loss of urine or faeces which impacts upon a person's quality of life and is unlikely to improve with medical, surgical or clinical treatment regimes. The definition in the new scheme we are establishing is the same as in the old, but the legislation before the House is about improving open markets and flexibility and choice for those poor people who are suffering from this embarrassing problem. All of us in this place have relatives, and all of us in this place have had senior relatives suffering from illness, disease and other ailments. My father, who died earlier this year, suffered this problem significantly in the latter part of his life. He suffered from prostate cancer for seven years before he died in January this year, and I know the embarrassment, the difficulties, the troubles and travails that he had in his personal life as he went through the last 18 months of being bedridden and having problems of incontinence. This is a problem which affects the families, relatives and friends of politicians and all other people in Australia. ous problem for many people in this country. I am pleased that the coalition is supporting this initiative as it deserves bipartisan support. We are introducing the Continence Aids Payment Scheme, which will replace the current Continence Aids Assistance scheme. The bill will allow the Minister for Ageing, the Hon. Justine Elliott, to formulate a Continence Aids Payment Scheme through a legislative instrument, as the member for Dickson said. It will allow the Commonwealth to make payments to eligible persons under that new scheme and will ensure an adequate process is put in place to facilitate the transagenda. fer of clients from one scheme to another and to provide information and news so that people understand what is happening. There will be a transition process. Power is conferred on the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing and the Medicare Australia CEO to request information in relation to the provision of payments under the scheme in order that there be an adequate and appropriate auditing of the scheme. The bill delivers on the commitment we made in the 2009-10 budget. The cost of such a scheme, obviously, has to be demand driven. People do not choose to suffer from this problem, and it causes them significant embarrassment and difficulties in their personal lives. The payment is made through a special standing appropriation under the National Health Act 1953. The National Health Act provides the legislative framework for the provision of services to the Australian public, whether they are medical, dental, pharmaceutical or other types of services. We are seeing a legislative change which will enable a new scheme to be put in place. The funding will be made available through the special appropriation. The CAPS payments will be up to $489.95 for the 2010-11 financial year and will continue to be adjusted, It is a seriobviously, with indexation. We are providing greater flexibility and choice for recipients under this scheme. Currently, they are stuck with simply having to use one particular provider. This will provide more consumer choice. Consumers will be in a better position to control their destiny, and that is a good thing in the circumstances. The minister in her second reading speech made reference to the fact that promotion of consumer choice and control is consistent with the government's Charter of Rights and Responsibilities for Community Care released in 2009. This is also a worthy aspect of the government's legislative framework and There is a bit of mythology perpetuated by those opposite that Labor governments do not promote choice, do not promote competition and do not support open markets. I have never subscribed to that view. I think that is simply nonsense. Labor governments are every bit about improving the power of consumers and their ability to decide their destiny. Independence or autonomy is particularly important for individuals, no matter whether they are young or old, no matter whether they have sickness or injury and no matter whether they enjoy good health. The Continence Aids Payments Scheme is not a reimbursement scheme. Clients of the scheme will not be required to produce receipts. Of course, the CAPS payment will not affect a person's income. Income tax exemption has been approved for CAPS. The Department of Health and Ageing will write directly to all existing clients under the old scheme to ensure that they understand and have information about the transition. Professionals such as doctors and other allied health workers associated with those patients or clients will also be notified. Intouch Direct, which is the sole provider for continence services under the old scheme, will continue to offer their services and products but they will suffer and endure what most other companies and businesses have to go through-that is, they will be faced with competition. Of course, clients can choose to purchase products from Intouch, if they wish to. The CAP Scheme is designed to help people with permanent and severe incontinence meet some of their costs. No government, coalition or Labor, has ever aimed to ensure that the full costs of a client of the scheme would be covered. The scheme provides assistance. It is a helping hand to those people who suffer from this problem. In the Department of Health and Ageing forward estimates on the financial impact of the changes to the scheme, the figures range from approximately $40 million to $46 million per annum over the next four years. I think that is a small price to pay to assist people who are suffering from this problem. This assistance will improve their life and lifestyle. It will allow them to enjoy recreational activities as well as other opportunities at home, outside the home and in the workplace. To provide people with choice and assistance is, I think, a decent and humane thing to do. It is the Australian thing to do. I welcome the fact that the coalition supports this legislation. It will support the lives of thousands of Australians who are suffering from this problem, and it will make a big difference in helping to ensure that they live their lives to the full and that they enjoy an abundant and fruitful retirement and that the years left in their life's journey are also abundant and fruitful.",79
37,Mr HARTSUYKER,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"The Continence Aids Assistance Scheme has proven to be very important in providing the supplies needed to allow people affected by incontinence to live with dignity. Incontinence is a subject that is rarely discussed, despite it affecting a significant number of Australians. Incontinence affects up to four million Australians of varying ages and for a variety of reasons. According to the Continence Foundation of Australia, incontinence affects 20 per cent of Australian men and 37 per cent of Australian women. For many people, this condition is embarrassing and inconvenient. The Continence Aids Assistance Scheme helps to pay for the supplies needed to allow people to manage incontinence. Under the current scheme, eligible people with severe and permanent incontinence may receive up to $489.95 in incontinence products. The products are supplied by a sole provider on behalf of the Department of Health and Ageing. The National Health Amendment (Continence Aids Payment Scheme) Bill 2010 , which is before the House today, will allow the Minister for Health and Ageing to formulate a scheme to provide direct payments to eligible persons as a contribution towards the cost of incontinence products. Medicare will administer the new scheme, which is to be called the Continence Aids Payments Scheme, or CAP Scheme. The CAP Scheme is intended to give recipients more flexibility and choice and to promote competition. The bill also provides for a transition period to allow people currently under the CAAS to move smoothly onto the CAP Scheme. Given the Rudd government's track record in service delivery, I very much doubt that the transition will be as smooth as the minister would have us believe. As a principle, the opposition supports measures that increase competition and that allow individuals to take greater control of their own lives. For many people, this change will be positive. However, I have recently been contacted by a group of local incontinence advisers and stomal therapy nurses who are concerned about the changes. The nurses are mainly concerned that the money provided under the CAP Scheme may not in some cases be spent on incontinence aids. The nurses are also concerned that the changes may lead to some people purchasing incorrect or inappropriate products for their individual circumstances, leading to an increased risk of falls or infections. The nurses also expressed concern about the increased stress and cost for carers who are responsible for managing a person's access to incontinence products. There are also questions about whether the new CAP Scheme will make it more difficult for people to access the New South Wales Program of Appliances for Disabled People. Under the current arrangements, people who are living in New South Wales can access help through the state system once they have exhausted their allowance from the Australian government. The new CAP Scheme will make it more difficult to determine when someone has used their entire entitlement from the Commonwealth and it has the potential to result in some people being denied access to the state system for a period once they have used up their allowance from the Commonwealth. My office has been in contact with the North Coast Area Health Service for advice about how the new CAP Scheme will interact with the New South Wales system. I have been told that the details are yet to be worked out. With the scheme to come into operation shortly, we have a situation where the details are yet to be sorted out. I must say that this government has proven itself not to be good at paying attention to detail. In the overall scheme of the national health budget, this is a relatively minor program worth around $40 million each year, but lack of attention to the detail of this program is not isolated and is being repeated around my electorate. In the Cowper electorate, we have Coffs Harbour Health Campus and Kempsey District Hospital, plus hospitals at Maclean, Bellingen and Macksville and a multipurpose facility at Dorrigo. In the smaller hospitals, we have seen the North Coast Area Health Service continue to downgrade services and cut resources from smaller facilities. This has not only outraged residents from smaller communities but also placed extra pressure on the larger campuses, such as Coffs Harbour, as more patients are transferred there for treatment or care. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the great work of local communities who support their hospitals in Bellingen, Maclean, Kempsey, Macksville, Coffs Harbour and Dorrigo. In Bellingen, the Bellingen Health Action Group is very active and very supportive of their local hospital. I recently organised a meeting between the shadow parliamentary secretary for rural health, Dr Andrew Southcott, and the Bellingen hospital support group. Attending the meeting were Barbara Moore, Fiona Crosskill and Solvieg Larsen from the action group, Dr Deidre Little from the medical staff council, Mayor Mark Troy and council general manager Mike Colreavy. I also joined the Bellingen community in a public rally about the hospital on 15 May. The Bellingen group is genuinely concerned about the ongoing downgrade of services at its local hospital. In recent years we have seen maternity services withdrawn and the executive officer and director of nursing positions scrapped. There have also been ongoing concerns about plans to close the accident and emergency ward from 11 pm until 7 am. That is despite the fact that the emergency department in Bellingen handles around 30 emergencies each year involving triage 1 or triage 2 patients. Such cases require immediate treatment and therefore should not be delayed because the patient has to get to the Coffs Harbour Health Campus some 30 minutes away. As one of the hospital action group members said to me recently, these are lives that could have otherwise been lost. In the past few weeks, the North Coast Area Health Service have pledged not to close the emergency department at night and have flagged that they will restore maternity services. However, whilst these words are welcome, the Bellingen community knows that the fight is not over. Too often in the past we have had plenty of promises but very little action. The removal of maternity services at the hospital has highlighted how the area health service can say one thing and do the complete opposite. At Bellingen we have seen out-of-hours and on-call X-ray services cancelled and the use of the operating theatre severely cut back. The cutbacks and downgrading of services has had a spiral effect on the training and skills base of the staff. In end, staff may have had no choice but to resign or seek work elsewhere. The treatment of the Bellingen community by the local area health service has been nothing short of deplorable. The bottom line with Bellingen hospital is that the Bellingen shire is flood prone. Last year was enormously challenging, with up to six floods in the Bellingen local government area. In many cases, Bellingen was cut off from Coffs Harbour. Having adequate health services at Bellingen hospital was therefore vital to treat those who needed medical assistance. The Bellingen River District Hospital services the Bellingen Valley and Dorrigo communities. For more than 108 years, it has done so in an excellent manner, but despite the growing population services are being eroded. Given the changes to the health system which this government has announced, the very least it could do is to ensure that there are no further services cut or positions abolished. Only last week, there were media reports that a further 80 jobs were being cut across the North Coast Area Health Service. That is why there is real concern that the Rudd government has come up with a political fix rather than reforms that will genuinely improve health services on the North Coast. Recently I called for an immediate cessation of ongoing costcutting in hospitals across the North Coast until the Rudd government explains how health services in the region will be managed in the future. It is clear that local communities are scared about what these changes mean for smaller hospitals. They are worried that the North Coast Area Health Service will continue to slash services and sack staff and that the proposed new hospital networks will only disadvantage smaller health facilities. If these proposed new networks are going to deliver betthe ter outcomes for regional communities, the slashing and burning must cease. That is why I join the Bellingen Hospital Action Group and remain vigilant to ensure vital services are restored and that there are no further downgrades, regardless of what the North Coast Area Health Service says. I know the North Coast community is also concerned that the Prime Minister's health package is going to do nothing more than add another layer of bureaucracy. The recent federal budget set aside an additional $500 million for bureaucrats, which means an expanded federal layer of administration. That is more expenditure on desks than on beds. Instead of investing in beds, the government is investing in desks. Regardless of what the Prime Minister says, we must remember that under his new health agreement state governments retain control of the health-funding pool. We all know that it is the poor management of public hospitals by the state government which is the real reason why health services in New South Wales have descended into such a parlous state. One must question whether this new agreement will actually deliver meaningful outcomes on the ground or whether we are going to see more waste and more mismanagement. I previously touched on the downgrading of Bellingen hospital and its flow-on effect to the workload at Coffs Harbour Health Campus. Almost every day there is a shortage of beds at the Coffs Harbour Health Campus. One of the main reasons for this is that patients are not being treated at their local hospital but rather are being transferred to Coffs Harbour. As a result, the Coffs Harbour Health Campus is bursting at the seams and there is a lack of beds in the medical wards. This flows back into the emergency department where waiting times continue to blow out because the emergency department has nowhere to transfer treated patients. Doctors and nurses are being asked to do more with less and that places unsustainable pressure on our medical staff. In the end, patient care is suffering despite the best efforts of that very dedicated staff. One of the problems with the health bureaucracy is that they are quick tistics and figures which are presented to them by hospital medical professionals, but at the same time they will embrace their own data if it provides some justification for ducing investment in services. For some time now the nurses at Kempsey District Hospital have put forward a logical case, supported by strong statistical evidence, that their emergency department should have an additional registered nurse on each shift. In recent weeks the local area health service has at least acknowledged the problem, but I believe the House should be made aware of the long battle which these nurses have endured just to get to this point. The Kempsey nurses have produced evidence which shows they are not receiving resources which reflect the number of presentations in the emergency department. I acknowledge the work of nurses such as Di Lohman, Jennifer Clarke, Jo Hensler and Linda Weir. I also acknowledge the tireless support of Mayor John Bowell, who has been an active supporter of the hospital for many years. Collectively, these people, along with many other colleagues, do a great job in representing the interests of health services in the Macleay Valley. The North Coast Area Health Service and the Minister for Health and Ageing have consistently ignored these people, despite the strong case that has been put. The area health service is guilty of treating Kempsey as a poor cousin of the Port Macquarie Base Hospital. In Kempsey, the nurses have comparisons of their hospital with similar hospitals where the difference in the number of presentations is 20 per cent yet the difference in the level of resourcing is 300 per cent.",81

40,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to the Prime Minister's commitment that he would take personal control of the supertax negotiations with mining companies. Given that the Prime Minister did not even turn up to yesterday's negotiations with the three largest companies, has leadership on this issue now been handed to the Deputy Prime Minister?",85
41,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition acting for the Leader of the Opposition for the question. Of course, what the government has said consistently about the resource super profits tax that there would be consultation with industry. We are actually in a process that started around two years ago with the Henry tax review and with the extensive consultations undertaken for the formulation of the Henry tax review, including the receipt of around 1,300 submissions. At the moment, there is consultation involving around 80 companies. Each of those consultations is important to the government. There was consultation yesterday involving the Treasurer and the resources minister, who met with the executives of BHP, Rio Tinto and Xstrata. I do not propose to go into any of the details of those discussions as they are confidential, but I note that those discussions continue with the around 80 companies involved in the consultations. The government is seriously engaged in that process. Of course, it is appropriate for the Treasurer and for the resources minisexperienced ter as well as the Prime Minister himself to participate in these consultations and in the various meetings that are occurring. Each of those ministers, including the Prime Minister, is participating. Economy",85
42,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for Education and Minister for Social Inclusion. How does Australia's current economic strength compare with that elsewhere in the world? How are Australians benefiting from this performance and are there any barriers to this continuing?",85
43,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Corangamite for his question-the first sensible one we have heard today. I know that the member for Corangamite, like all members on this side of the House, is desperately concerned that working Australians have the benefit of a strong economy and the benefit is of work. We understand that, when working Australians lose their jobs, it can be a personal tragedy for them and for their families. During the global financial crisis and global recession that threatened this country, the government did what we needed to do to keep the economy going. This month we saw our unemployment rate decrease to 5.2 per cent and our GDP grow by 0.5 per cent in the March quarter. What these figures make clear-and they are particularly clear from the national accounts figures-is that our economic growth is being underpinned by stimulus spending. For example, take the Building the Education Revolution program do alone, which is responsible for around a third of the economic activity in the non-residential building sector to April 2010. We should reflect one moment and compare this with the kind of unemployment rates being overseas-the United States at 9.7 per cent, the eurozone at more than 10 per cent and the UK at almost eight per cent, representing a tragedy for literally millions of working people. As Australians, we know that in times past, when there have been economic difficulties, it has taken a long time for us to climb out of those economic difficulties, particularly a long time for us to see unemployment rates start to fall. In the 1990s unemployment climbed to 10.9 per cent and long-term unemployment peaked at more than 32 per cent. It took around eight years to fall back to pre-recession levels of six per cent. In the recession of the early eighties, the unemployment rate climbed to more than 10 per cent. It took five years to fall down to the pre-recessionary levels of six per cent. In these circumstances, we should be saying to ourselves and to each other that it is great for working families that we are already seeing unemployment fall following the economic downturn brought to this country by the global financial crisis and global recession.",85
44,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,86
45,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, I do not expect the opposition to indicate any interest in the jobs of working Australians, because if we had followed their strategy an extra 200,000 working Australians would have been out of work and we would have seen this nation in a deep recession. In addition to the tragedy of unemployment, there is also the loss of skills and the loss give young Australians a start. If we look at earlier economic downturns-let's look at the early 1980s-we saw a 28.7 per cent drop in the 1980s in apprenticeship commencements and it took five years to recover to pre-recession levels. In the 1990s there was a 35 per cent drop and it took 13 years to get to pre-recession levels. In this economic downturn, on the early data we can say we are already moving to returning to pre-recession levels. We do not want to see a generation of young Australians stranded. If we had taken the advice of the opposition, we would have seen that generation stranded. We would have seen more than 200,000 extra Australians out of work. In terms of analysing this advice from the opposition much has been made of their economic folly and their inability to analyse and respond to what needed to be done in the face of the global financial crisis and global recession. I think there is more at work here than simply that kind of economic folly. There is malice at work because they showed in government their complete indifference to working Australians, their job security and their needs by introducing Work Choices. In opposition, through denying economic stimulus, they continue to show that complete indifference to the needs of working families to have a job. Government",86
46,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to reports that the Minister for Trade has directed bureaucrats in his department to contact bureaucrats in other departments to find out what is going on within the government. Isn't it an amateur hour government when the trade minister has to plead with his own bureaucrats to stay in touch with other bureaucrats because in this government it is the gang of four that makes of the ability to all the decisions?,86
47,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question and note that it is based on the normal level of research the opposition does for question time. That is, they get out the newspapers, have a little read of them, spot an article, get out the scissors, clip it out and then bring it in and base the question on it. It is an act of pure genius that they are capable of reading the newspapers. I do not want to deny the shadow Treasurer an answer to his question based on his cut and paste, so the answer is as follows: the Minister for Trade attended a meeting of senior departmental staff of his department on 10 May in Canberra. He spoke to those staff and addressed a range of policy issues. As part of those remarks I understand that the minister urged the officials of his department to engage more closely with other departments and become more active in the policy development process and that is a good thing. Mr Hockey interjecting",86

49,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The shadow Treasurer may want to just listen for one moment about his cut and paste.

The problem with cut and paste and the lack of original research is once again on display. Hospitals,87
50,Ms RISHWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Will the minister update the House on the latest performances of our public hospitals in delivering more elective surgery and more doctors and nurses? Are there any impediments to this performance?,87
51,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for her question. As a health professional herself she always takes a particular interest in these issues. There is a lot very good news in the latest report that has been released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. It is showing good news for those families and Australians, the very many millions of them, who rely on public hospitals for their treatment, whether it is elective surgery, turning up in emergency departments or for a range of outpatient services. We are proud of the fact that, when the Rudd government was elected, we made commitments which immediately boosted funding to our hospitals. We were repairing an enormous amount of damage that was left by the Leader of the Opposition in his time as the health minister. The latest report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows that hospitals have started to benefit as the funding starts to hit the front line. This report shows that there has been a very big increase in the amount of elective surgery performed. If you want to compare the 2008-09 year of this report with the last year of the former government, 2006-07, when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister, 38,000 additional elective surgery procedures have been undertaken. It surprises me that some of those opposite are murmuring because a large number of those 38,000 people would live in their electorates as they do across the entire country. It means they are not waiting as long as they used to for their surgery. Have a listen to these figures. Public elective surgery increased by 3.1 per cent. This is over and above the previous average increases, which might account for population growth of 1.7 per cent-a very significant increase. Importantly, the number of people who are waiting longer than a year for their surgery, the very long wait patients, has dropped from 4.8 per cent in 2004-05 down to 2.9 per cent in 2008-09. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report notes that this was the first year of the Rudd govof ernment's targeted $600 million election commitment to improve access to elective surgery. That increased the number of Australians who are obtaining their surgery on time. Just as importantly, this report shows another significant jump, which I would have thought all in the House would welcome. This is in the number of doctors and nurses working in our public hospitals. There are now more doctors and nurses than ever before. In 2008-09, there were an additional 2,200 more doctors at work, an eight per cent increase from the previous year. We have also welcomed an additional 4,781 nurses, a 4½ per cent increase from the previous years. These new doctors and nurses are delivering more services to Australian families and to patients across the country. The report also notes-and I think particularly on this side of the House people will be interested-that the Commonwealth's share of hospital funding increased for the first time in the decade in 2007-08 as the Rudd government's election commitments started to pay off in hospital services. Of course, means that our reform plans are starting to deliver more on-time surgery, more doctors and nurses and more funding for the front line.  laide.",87
52,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite might actually start interjecting at this point because they know that this stands in stark contrast to the record of the Leader of the Opposition. He made it harder to access elective surgery. He cut $1 billion from our hospitals, never put a single cent into elective surgery, made it harder for Australians to access GPs by putting a cap on GP training places and left the country with a shortage of 6,000 nurses. Tony Abbott's legacy was to make it harder for Australians to get access to public health services.",88
53,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will refer to members by their parliamentary titles.,88
54,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition's legacy made it harder for Australians to get access to public health services. The most depressing part about this is that the Liberal Party have indicated that we are about to go for another around. They want to cut another billion dollars out of our health services-from primary care, from e-health and now also from diabetes. What today's report makes clear is that, if you do invest strategically, you can turn around some of the statistics of our public hospitals, but if you cut money, which the Liberal Party now say they want to do if they are re-elected, we will just go back to the bad old days. That is a risk Australians cannot afford. Budget",88

It is true that I had a discussion with the department about the importance of interacting more with other departments of government. That is because we take the view that trade has implications beyond just trade negotiations, that we actually understand the economic dynamics of trade and the importance of having engagement across portfolios. That is a statement. I have made on a number of occasions including in this House. I also believe it is important that within the department there is more interaction and engagement with the agencies of the department-with Austrade, AusAID and EFIC.

I might just use this opportunity to say that it is a bit rich, when discipline is being exerted, for others to make it very hard at that time by intervening. It makes it very difficult for action to be taken. The Minister for Trade has the call and as I have said repeatedly throughout this question: a question was asked; the question was in order. The minister has been responding to that question but many people have not been bothered to listen to the response.",90
80,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I just remind the House that the thrust of this question was about the lack of consultation. Let me just remind the House about the Leader of the Opposition being forced to apologise, back in March, to his colleagues for failing to consult them on his plan to tax big business to fund a 26week paid maternity leave scheme. This is the person who is accusing us of putting taxes up, and he not only introduces a tax increase of 1.7 per cent, he fails to consult. What has this got to do with it? It has got to do with the fact that you have no consultation. You are a sclerotic group over there with no creativity and no ideas",90
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will refer his remarks through the chair.,90
82,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and you come into the House accusing us of it! So what was the Leader of the Opposition's statement, then? Mr Abbott, in defence of that failure",90
83,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will refer to members by their parliamentary title.,90
84,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition's answer to his failure to consult is: sometimes it is better to ask forgiveness than permission. The next time he wanted to go into his party room with a proposal for acceptance-this was the $10,000 stay at home payment for mums-rather than showing forgiveness they just rejected him. So do not come into this place and lecture us about lack of consultation. I said the other day that I was consulted in relation to the RSPT. I stand by that. What I do say is that this is a government that is united in the purpose of better returns to this nation of what the nation owns, and that is the resource base. Paid Parental Leave",90
85,Ms KING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. How is the government supporting families to make their own work and family choices?",90
86,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I very much thank the member for Ballarat for her question, because on Tuesday this week 25,000 Australians delivered a very clear message to this parliament. Whether they were nurses, teachers, hospitality workers, construction workers, or students and their mums and dads and grandparents, they all signed a petition calling on each and every one of us-all of their elected representatives-to do the right thing and vote for Australia's first paid parental leave scheme. Australian families have been waiting decades for paid parental leave, and now legislation for Australia's first paid parental leave scheme is in the final stages of passage through this parliament. When the bill passes, Australia will finally catch up with the rest of the developed world and deliver this vital support for families. Under our scheme, eligible families will receive 18 weeks of paid parental leave, paid at the federal minimum wage. It will start on 1 January next year. Of course, the scheme designed by the government is fully costed and fully funded in the budget. It is fair to both businesses and families. This will be a huge win for Australian families. Parents will finally get the support that they need to stay home with their newborn babies. Of course, it means that children will get a better start life. Businesses too will benefit. They will be able to retain their skilled workers and we will see particular advantages for seasonal workers, casual workers, contract workers and the self-employed. They will now get access to paid parental leave. For many of them it will be for the first time. One of the particular advantages of the government scheme is that families will have support to make their own work and family choices. Under our scheme parents will be able to transfer the leave so that mums and dads will have more options for balancing their work and family lives, because on this side of the chamber we recognise that in today's families more and more dads want to be more hands-on at home. This is a historic reform. It has been a very long time coming, and it is this government that is going to deliver Australia's first paid parental leave scheme. Budget",90
87,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,2.29 pm)My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer guarantee that no worker in the mining industry or their family will be worse off as a result of the government's great big new tax on the mining industry?,91
88,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On this side of the House jobs, jobs and jobs go to the heart of our agenda-jobs, jobs and more jobs. If those on that side of the House had had their way last year, this country would have been in recession. But, because we took action to stimulate the economy and to support demand, jobs in this country have grown by 250,000 over the past year-something everybody on this side of the House is proud of. Where would this country be if those opposite had been in control? We would be in recession. When it comes to getting the big ecoin nomic calls right, we on this side of the House got that call right and those on the other side of the House got it dead wrong. When I go to G20 meetings and sit down with finance ministers, they say der: the Treasurer was asked to guarantee that miners and their families would not be worse off.",91
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Sturt will resume his seat. The point of order is on relevance no matter how he puts it, but he will not debate it. The Treasurer is aware of the requirement to relate his answer to the question.",91
90,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Central to the government's reform agenda, central to the modernisation of resource taxation, central to the boost for superannuation, central to the investment in infrastructure and central to the cut in company tax is to support jobs and business in this economy. That is what is central to our agenda. I can absolutely guarantee that the rounds of reform that we are putting in place will grow our economy for the long term. What are we dealing with here? We are dealing with an opposition that mismanaged the last mining boom. As a consequence of their mismanagement, they put upward pressure on inflation and capacity constraints emerged in our economy. We on this side of the House are absolutely intent on making sure that we manage mining boom mark 2 so we maximise all of the opportunities that will flow from that for all of our citizens-and, of course, that includes supporting employment. Let us take the example of small business. If those opposite had had their way during the global financial crisis, tens of thousands of small businesses would have hit the wall and tens of thousands of people would have lost their jobs. What we are going to do now as the economy recovers is put in place a generation of reforms that will support economic growth, that will deal with capacity constraints, that will invest in infrastructure and that will make all of our companies much more competitive. What are those on the other side of the House saying about our proposal? They are saying that the mining companies in this country pay too much tax. Effectively they are arguing for a tax cut for the mining industry, plus they are going to increase the corporate rate by 1.7 per cent for all companies over a certain level. So there is a big tax out there, a very big tax slug from those opposite, for Australian corporates. We are asking some of the very profitable mining companies in this country to pay a fair share of their superprofits to the owners of those resources-the Australian people. As the price of commodities goes through the roof, those opposite have the extraordinary proposition that the Australian people should not get a fair share of it. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. He was asked for a simple guarantee-a simple guarantee.",91
91,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the matter of relevance: the question might be couched in a way so the person asking the question believes that a direct answer or a short answer can be made, but in the past the precedent in this place has been that, because the only standing order that is relevant to answers relates to relevance, if the answer is relevant then it is okay. I wish to stress the point again that allowing a certain degree of debate in the question opens an avenue for things to be opened up. Where either a euphemism or a dysphemism is used for a policy of the government, it does open it up a little bit.",92
92,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We on this side of the House will not sit here and watch those windfall profits walk straight out the door. They have to be used to create employment and support businesses in this country to deal with the challenges that will flow from mining boom mark 2. We will not sit back and let that ripoff continue. We on this side of the House are determined to ensure that a fair system is put in place so we can grow our whole economy, all of our businesses can grow together, we can deal with our capacity constraints and we can support employment, particularly in small business. Infrastructure",92
93,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. Why is investment in regional infrastructure in mining communities important? Is the minister aware of the position of mining companies on this issue?",92
94,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Capricornia for her question and for her ongoing interest in infrastructure in her regional community in Queensland. The Minerals Council of Australia made it very clear when Mitch Hooke said on 26 May 2009: There are significant gaps in Australia's export infrastructure and some of the nation's existing capital is in a state of disrepair … … … … … too often governments in the past have abrogated their responsibility to local communities and thus constrained the investment that private sector has wanted to make. These are issues that are raised with us by state governments, by local governments and indeed by the private sector. We have argued that there is a great need for infrastructure investment, particularly in states such as Western Australia and Queensland. The Leader of the Opposition has argued that that is the job of the private sector-they are doing it all and there is no need for the government's Regional Infrastructure Fund. I am asked about what the attitude is of mining companies. I certainly acknowledge that I receive continual representations. Just this week a letter BHP Billiton wrote to me on 11 June was received in my office, on 15 June. It goes to the heart of both infrastructure need and the government's plan to address that infrastructure need. It says it all about why the Regional Infrastructure Fund is necessary. I will read some of the letter because I think it speaks louder than some of the rhetoric we are hearing in this debate: Dear Minister The purpose of this letter is to outline concerns in relation to an area on the Landsborough Highway that BHP Billiton Cannington Mine believes to be a significant hazard to all motorists. This highway is heavily travelled by large trucks and general motorists as well as the Cannington Mine personnel. It goes on to say: In February this year a Toll North truck carrying Cannington Mine concentrate was involved in a crash at Rutchillo Creek. It further goes on to say: This is the second event that we are aware of where a truck has crashed at this location. The previous event occurred on 28 October 2006 when a Mitchell Corp truck carrying gravel travelling south met another truck travelling north at Rutchillo Creek. Since the event in February this year, BHP Billiton Cannington Mine, working with Toll North, has undertaken research relating to road conditions and crashes in the area. The research indicates that a zone from Nora Creek through to Bull Creek is highly dangerous. And it goes on to say: It is our belief that this area represents a signifiin cant risk to all motorists using the road and that an urgent upgrade is required. It puts some of the debate that we are having at the moment in its proper context: that we know that the resources boom is putting real pressure on infrastructure and that has an impact on all those who work directly in the industry but also those who live around those communities. I acknowledge the fact that these are genuine concerns raised by BHP Billiton, as are other concerns raised by major resource companies and indeed by the trade unions that represent those workers, such as the Mining Division of the CFMEU, and the Australian Workers Union. If anyone was in any doubt whatsoever about the need to make sure we are in a position to invest in infrastructure in those regional mining communities, this letter says it all, in the words of BHP Billiton. I table the letter. Budget",92
95,Mr RAMSEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to this letter to shareholders from OneSteel Chairman Peter Smedley, and I quote from it: The Whyalla and Newcastle businesses in total employ approximately 4,000 employees and contractors. Any adverse impact on OneSteel also has flow on implications for our employees and these local communities in which we operate. Deputy Prime Minister, were you, as part of the kitchen cabinet, and was the Prime Minister, whom you are representing here today, aware of the implications of the superprofits tax on OneSteel's steel-making operation when the Treasurer announced the tax in his budget?",93

As the Prime Minister has made clear, and as the Treasurer has made clear even as recently as his answer to a question question time today, obviously in considering the resource super profits tax we considered what was best for economic reform and economic growth in this country. The member raises with me the circumstances of businesses in his local community. Well, let us actually look at the resource super profits tax package, because the member might like to reflect on this question: is it in ests of businesses in his local community to have a company tax cut? Is it in the interests of business in his local community to have the special tax benefits for small businesses? Mr Ramsey- Mr Speaker, on a point of orderMr Robb interjecting",93

100,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asking whether the member for Grey may have reflected on the benefits for small businesses in his community of the new small business tax writeoff arrangements that are in this package. Of course the government, in designing the resource super profits tax, considered what was appropriate to ensure that the nation benefited from this resources boom, that we still continued to see mining companies grow and make good profits, that we still continued to see working people who work in mining earn good wages and that we could see a fair share for the nation overall, including the companies and small businesses in his electorate as well as the working Australians whose superannuation would grow from nine the interto 12 per cent in his electorate.

108,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We as a nation have always been rich in natural assets. The real issue is our capacity to develop those natural assets by putting the necessary reforms in place. In that context I remind the House that demand for Australia's LNG is set to grow. One of the reasons is the tough debate this government took on 25 years ago about the introduction of a petroleum resource rent tax, which saw the biggest ever investment in Australia's history-the Gorgon project of $43 billion-last year. Similarly, demand for our minerals continues to grow because of the growth in China-and we all have regard for the Indian market that is yet to come on. One of the reasons we are well placed is the key reforms that Labor in government took on in the eighties and the nineties. It was those reforms that well positioned Australia for the challenge that confronts us in the 21st century. Labor has always been up to standing up for reform in Australia. We have lost market share in the last decade because of the failure of the Howard government year in and year out to invest in infrastructure and to invest in the skilling of Australia. Just think about the reforms that set up Australia under the Hawke and Keating governments, reforms quite often opposed by the coalition because they are never interested in Australia's national interests-they continually talk Australia down domestically and internationally. Let us go to some of those reforms: the floating of the dollar; embracing free trade and open markets globally; our engagement with Asia, which has given us the market opportunities in China and India; the issue of introducing productivity bargainingsomething I know a little bit about-and the capacity to negotiate of order. The member for Deakin asked the minister about the outlook of the resources industry in the future. He did not ask about a rewriting of the history of the last 30 years.",94
109,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt will resume his seat. The minister is responding to the question.,95
110,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, Labor in government is proud of its reforming record. I understand why the coalition wants to run away from this debate, because it was never up to the tough debates about reforming Australia. I also remind the House of the importance of the savings and retirement income debate and introducing the superannuation guarantee. It is for those reasons that we have decided to take on another tough process of reform-the issue of Australia fronting up to the debate about a resource super profit tax, a profits based tax system, something that the minerals sector demanded that Australia put in place, something that was on the table for consideration under the Howard government, something that the Howard government ran away from and something that we are prepared to actually take forward to conclusion. This debate is about certainty. It is about fairly rewarding risk and it is about providing the Australian community with a fair return for the nation's resources. Think about the broader aspects of this debate. Yes, it is about a new approach to a profits based tax system in Australia, but it is also about infrastructure. The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government referred earlier today to demands by the Minerals Council of Australia for us as a nation to invest in infrastructure. Infrastructure, to the coalition, was not about fixing the Australian national railway system; it was not about investing moneys in Port Hedland roads; it was not about fixing Esperance port; it was about projects such as Tumbi Creek. We can all remember the ‘Regional Rorts' program and the coalition's approach to infrastructure. There we had a creek that drained itself, but what did the coalition do? It decided to allocate scarce Australian dollars to put in place a so-called draining opportunity.  of order. The minister was asked about the outlook for the resources industry.

Turning for a moment to the suggestion that has been made about the mining tax and housing costs, this is an absolute furphy that is being perpetuated once again by the self-interest of the opposition in league with their bosses, the mining companies-bought and paid for by the Australian mining companies. We know that what is affecting housing affordability is the huge investment that this government has made in ensuring that more homes are built. Half a billion dollars through the Housing Affordability Fund has helped thousands of Australian home buyers buy a more affordable home. Hundreds of thousands of blocks and homes are more affordable because of the Housing Affordability Fund. More than a quarter of a million Australians have been helped into a home of their own by the first home owner boost, seeing the largest proportion of first home buyers entering the market in decades.

Budget",97
132,Ms OWENS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Human Services and the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law. What challenges confront Australian women in building adequate retirement savings and what impact will the government's tax and superannuation reforms have on the retirement incomes of Australian women?",97
133,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Parramatta for her question, and I acknowledge her support for her 55,500 constituents that stand to benefit from this government's superannuation reforms. There is no question that there are challenges confronting Australian women in building adequate retirement incomes. Research released last year showed that the average payout for a woman on retirement was only $73,000 compared to $155,000 for men. As a result of this difference, men hold about 60 per cent of superannuation balances while women hold over 30 per cent. A report issued yesterday by the Melbourne Institute showed that women aged 55 to 59 are expected to live for 21 years in retirement despite having only adequate retirement incomes for two years. That is exactly the reason for the government's reforms to superannuation-to bring in more fairness to the superannuation system in Australia. Our changes will result in increased retirement savings for 4.1 million women across the country, including 2.1 million women on lower incomes and 100,000 Ausyou tralian women over 50 who will be able to access the improved concessions for top-up payments to superannuation. As I said before, the member for Parramatta can report to her constituents that she is supporting 55,000 of those constituents in getting better superannuation payments. But some members elsewhere in Sydney will have a more difficult task. Take, for example, the seat of Hughes. There, the Liberal candidate will need to report to the people of Hughes why he opposes 53,000 of them getting better superannuation benefits. He will need to justify to 27,000 women in Hughes why he stands against them getting better superannuation payments and why he opposes 7,500 women over 50 getting better superannuation benefits through increased superannuation concessions. That is what the Liberal Party will need to justify to the people of Hughes, and that is what the Liberal candidate for Hughes will need to explain to the people-why he stands against them getting better superannuation benefits. I think the impact of the government's superannuation reforms were perhaps best summed up by Fiona Reynolds, Chief Executive of the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, when she said: ‘It's all about building a fair and just society that takes care of those who need it most, and those who say now is the wrong time-they were wrong 25 years ago when we introduced super and they are wrong now.' I am asked about the impact of our tax reforms on people's retirement incomes, and this is something those opposite have been very voluble about. They have been very vocal about the impact on retirement incomes. They have claimed that the resource super profits tax is a tax on the retirement incomes of Australians. I am sure every honourable member welcomed the report last week from the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia which showed that the claims of the opposition are complete dross-complete dross; it hit them for six. As the Australian Financial Review said: … the ASFA position debunks a central claim in the mining industry advertising campaign against the resource super profits tax-that ordinary superannuation investors would suffer if the tax was imposed. So the opposition's arguments that these reforms and this tax would damage retirement savings have been dismissed as scaremongering by those who would know bestthose responsible for superannuation funds in Australia, the trustees and those who run the funds. The opposition say: ‘What would they know? They only run the superannuation industry.' They know better. Well, the superannuation industry has got news for them: they are wrong. They are talking nonsensemore bad news for the opposition and their scare campaign on the resource super profits tax. But there is at least one member opposite who has received some good news. I am sure he is already aware of this, because he would be in his office, looking at his computer, checking it out at the moment-and I know many members on this side are concerned for the welfare of the member for Dickson! I can inform the House that during question time BHP has again been trading for more than it cost on the day the member for Dickson bought his shares. Again, he makes a much better investor than he would a minister, I think it is fair to say",97

144,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and it relates to the funding of aged-care providers and wage rates for aged-care workers. The Deputy Prime Minister would be aware that the Productivity Commission is to carry out an inquiry into aged care. While this inquiry is welcome, I ask: is the Deputy Prime Minister aware that recent increases to the cost of living of 2.9 per cent are not matched by the 1.7 per cent increase in care subsidies? Given that the smaller aged-care providers are currently financially stressed and that aged-care workers are dreadfully underpaid, does the government have any plans to overcome that situation or is it going to wait and delay action until the Productivity Commission reports?",99
145,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for New England for his question and I am sure that his concerns about the circumstances of aged care in his electorate and more broadly are very genuine. I am of course aware of the issue involving the aged-care workforce, including aged-care nurses. As the member may know, the Australian Nurses Federation, very properly, has been raising this issue with members of parliament because it is concerned about the wages and conditions of people who work in aged care. It is also concerned about how these wages and conditions compare with alternative occupations for nurses and, consequently, what that means for the workforce in the aged-care sector. I think the member would acknowledge that these are complex questions, because costs in aged care end up being borne, of course, by government but they also end up being borne by individuals. They end up being borne by government and individuals in a circumstance where, as we all know, our society is ageing, people are living longer, the circumstances in which they want to live the remainder of their lives are changing and the demand, particularly for ever-increasing quality, is high. That means that there are lots of costs and complexities that need to be worked through. That is why we have got the Productivity Commission working on this question. Of course, we will continue to work in dialogue with the Australian Nurses Federation and others who properly raised these issues on behalf of the industry. As a government we have endeavoured to lift some of the pressures in aged care, particularly some of the pressures about the availability of capital, and you would have seen some of the measures that have been taken there in recent budgets. But I understand the member's concern is genuine, and we will be continuing to work with the aged-care industry, including in his electorate. Small Business",99

Minister, how will the government's tax reforms benefit small businesses and independent contractors; and are there any threats to these reforms, particularly for the communities of bayside Brisbane?",99
147,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank my friend and colleague the member for Werriwa for his question and recall fondly working with the Macarthur Business Enterprise Centre and participating in a Werriwa small business forum to engage small businesses in the Building the Education Revolution program and other aspects of the economic stimulus package. In response to the question from the member for Werriwa, under the government's tax reform package 25,000 small businesses on Brisbane's bayside will benefit from the instant write-off of assets valued up to $5,000, giving a very welcome boost in cash flow and a very strong incentive for those 25,000 small businesses to invest in productivity-raising assets. I can also advise the House that the small business companies on Brisbane's bayside will benefit from the head start, the early start, on the reduction in the company tax rate made possible through the tax reform package as funded by the resource super profits tax. We know that anyone with any knowledge of Brisbane would know that the whole area of South-East Queensland is overwhelmingly a small business community. It is driven by small businesses, and nowhere is that more evident than in the side suburbs such as Alexandra Hills, Victoria Point and Wellington Point on Brisbane's east. In that area, covered by the seat of Bowman, I can advise the House that there are no fewer than 11,676 small businesses. I can further advise the House that 96 per cent of all the businesses in that area are in small businesses and that amongst them there are 3,000 tradies. So it begs this question: why won't the member for Bowman stand up for his local small business community? Why will he vote against the Rudd government's small business tax breaks that are being funded by the resource super profits tax? I ask the member for Bowman further: why did he betray his local small business community by voting against our economic stimulus with more than $143 million going into his electorate? He voted against that. He voted against $3.3 million for the Redland City Council for 10 community infrastructure projects. He voted against projects in 34 different schools under the Building the Education Revolution program, including Alexandra Hills State School and Hilliard State School. I can advise the housing minister that he voted against 179 social houses being built in his electorate. I at can tell the roads and infrastructure minister that he voted against fixing a black spot on the Beenleigh-Redland Bay Road. Why would you do that? He voted against jobs for tradies in his electorate. He voted against small businesses in his electorate. Why would you do that? The Liberal Party says that it is the party of small business-‘Look at us, we proudly represent small business'and time and time again the coalition has voted against helping our small businesses, supporting our small businesses. Nowhere is that clearer than in the bayside suburbs of South-East Queensland where the member for Bowman has betrayed those small businesses. Given a choice between supporting bay- Clive Palmer and supporting the 11,000 small businesses in his local electorate, what does the member for Bowman do? He supports Clive Palmer every time. Clive Palmer is a very wealthy man-hello, here's Clive's friend and defender. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a fact point of order on relevance. This personal vilification has nothing to do with the question.",99
148,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. The minister will relate his material to the question. He will now quickly come to a conclusion as well.,100
149,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Clive Palmer is a wealthy man. He owns a very big mining company. Clive Palmer owns a football team. And Clive Palmer owns the Liberal and National parties. That is the truth of the matter.  Speaker.",100
150,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I really believe that this is something that has to be dealt with through other avenues open to members within the chamber, based on analogous situations throughout the history of the place. ",100
151,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt always makes it very difficult. Building the Education Revolution Program,101
152,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education. I refer the minister to a media report that the Reed Group has been awarded a $1 million bonus for building 10 prefabricated libraries, each of which will cost almost twice as much as those built for Catholic schools in New South Wales. Does the minister agree with Kylie Gorton, President of the Parents and Citizens Association at the Stroud Public School, that, ‘We did not get value for money,' and, ‘The government needs to be held accountable for this complete misuse of taxpayers' funds'? Why isn't the minister as angry as Ms Gorton and why do you not take real action to stop the rorts rather than hide behind your toothless task force?",101
153,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. Of course, we are still waiting for her to stand up for her electorate and particularly for the trades training centre that she seeks in Vincentia. Once again, what we are seeing this action from the oppositionexcept, I would have to give it to the shadow Treasurer that at least, when he is going to base his question on newspaper reports, he gets them out of the newspaper reports that day, which probably implies that the shadow Treasurer reads his newspapers every day. But what the member for Gilmore has done is base this question on a newspaper report from a number of days ago. What the member may want to know-and the problem, of course, with just reading the newspaper and then assuming that without any further research one should rely on it and use it for question time-is that the matters in that report have already been dealt with by the New South Wales department. In particular, I am advised that the New South Wales department has made it absolutely clear that the claims in that report that somehow moneythose incentive payments-is being conveyed is not right. Incentive payments are there and they can be paid if projects are brought in in accordance with certain project milestones. The report also has, from my recollection, sources of estimates rather than any other source of information.",101
154,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,101
155,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question has been asked. The Deputy Prime Minister is responding to the question. I would have thought that the House would listen.,101
156,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I indicate to the member that the things that she has asserted in her question as fact are simply not correct. Can I also say to the member: I, like her and like members in her electorate, including the parent representative that she quotes, am very concerned to get value for money. That is why I, as minister, and the Rudd government have appointed the Building the Education Revolution Implementation Taskforce to assist schools with value for money. If the member wishes this matter or any other matter to be dealt by the implementation task force then she is more than welcome to take that course. What I would say to the member in terms of the framing of her question and what I would also say to the shadow minister relating to a report in today's paper is that I do not believe it is appropriate, whatever the opposition might think about the Building the Education Revolution, to have members of the opposition vilifying people serving on the task force and making assumptions about the task force. ",101
157,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Sturt is now warned.,102
158,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The task force is led by a leading Australian businessman, Brad Orgill. He is doing, in my view, a very good job. He was the leader of US. That is a major, major corporate appointment in this country. I think it is pretty cheap indeed, gardless of political persuasion, to be making assertions about the work of Brad Orgill. It was included in the member's question today. It is included in quotes from the shadow minister for education in today's newspaper. I think it is completely inappropriate and quite wrong. So, if the member wants the task force led by a very high calibre Australian to deal with any of these issues, of course she is welcome to do so. Nation Building and Jobs Plan",102
159,Ms GEORGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women. What are the government's housing programs delivering in south-west Sydney? Are there any risks to the delivery of these and other government programs?,102
160,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want to first thank the member for Throsby for her question. I know that she cares deeply about the social housing that is being constructed in her electorate from the stimulus spending in education and community projects because she has been a fierce and effective advocate for the people of the Illawarra. She is a supporter of the new services and the new buildings that are being constructed and, very importantly, the new jobs that go with them in the Illawarra. But she has asked me about south-west Sydney, and I am pleased to be able to say that I was in south-west Sydney the other day, visiting the electorate of Macarthur. I wanted to have a look at some of the terrific new stimulus spending on public housing that is happening in the electorate of Macarthur and particularly in the suburb of Rosemeadow. I had a look at a 57-unit development that is being purpose-built for seniors in Rosemeadow. No doubt the member for Macarthur has seen it. The units have been designed for seniors with all of the features that they need-grab rails in the bathrooms, redetachable hand-held shower heads, wide corridors for walkers and wheelchairs, as well as six-star energy efficiency rating. The cost of living in these properties is lower because the energy bills are lower. Very importantly, this new construction is supporting jobs in the area. We were shown around the site by Steve Fussell, the project manager for Watpac Ltd-a construction company that is working on projects right across New South Wales. Steve told us that on an average day there would be about 60 people working on this site-that is, 60 people who would not be working on that site if the member for Macarthur and all of the members opposite had had their way on stimulus spending. Steve said that he had worked through other downturns and has had to lay people off. He knew the difference between laying people off and putting people on, which is what he had been doing during the downturn. We met Martin Munro, the National General Manager of Watpac, who told us that the stimulus plan had got it right and that, because private construction work had not fully recovered, the work that they were getting from the stimulus package was more important than ever. If you have a look at those ABS statistics that I mentioned to the shadow minister for housing-he is not paying much attention now, obviously-you will see that one in seven of the private dwellings being constructed are either public housing, funded through the stimulus, or private dwellings bought off the plan and also part of the stimulus package. All those jobs would not be there if the opposition had had their way on the stimulus package. When it came to the stimulus, it was not just housing they opposed. Look at what was happening in Macarthur when the member for Macarthur and all of the members opposite opposed all of those other stimulus measures. They did not want the one in seven homes to be constructed. They do not want the 51,000 working people of Macarthur to benefit from the superannuation increases that they would achieve if the resource super profits tax is passed. They do not want the 8,436 small businesses in Macarthur to benefit from the instant write-offs of up to $5,000. They do not want those 8,436 small businesses to benefit from the drop in the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 28 per cent. They did not want the schools of Macarthur to benefit from the 141 projects and the $114.3 million being spent on schoolMr Andrews-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: this was a question from the member for Throsby about housing in south-west Sydney. For the last 30 seconds, this answer has had nothing to do with housing in south-west Sydney. Mr Adams interjecting",102
161,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Lyons is warned. The construction of the question goes to the risk to ‘these and other government programs', which might be considered to allow some wriggle room. However, I do not think that too much comfort should be taken that a minister can, on that basis, talk about every government program. So I would ask that, having got this far, the minister goes to her conclusion.",103
162,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am referring to these programs because they are also part of the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan along with the social housing package. It is distressing that the members opposite not only do not want to hear about what is happening in the electorate of Macarthur but also actually voted against jobs in the electorate of Macarthur. They voted against computers in schools-a thousand computers for the schools of Macarthur. They voted against $1½ million for three black spot projects in the electorate of Macarthur. They voted against 25 community infrastructure projects. Mr Andrews interjecting,103
163,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Menzies will resume his seat and the minister will conclude her answer.,103
164,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am concluding, Mr Speaker",103
165,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,103
166,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and I take advice from the Speaker, not from you. The Liberals opposed all of these projects-these new homes, these computers in schools, these school upgrades, these park upgrades and these road upgrades-and they opposed every single one of the jobs that went with them. Asylum Seekers",103
167,Mrs MARKUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Home Affairs. I refer the minister to the fact that, since the introduction of the assessment freeze for Afghan and Sri Lankan asylum seekers on 9 April, 31 boats and 1,418 people have arrived. Given that boats are arriving at the rate of more than three a week and people at the rate of more than 630 a month since this decision was taken-an increase of more than 200 per cent on last year-does the minister stand by the government's budget forecast of a 60 per cent reduction in boat arrivals in the next financial year?",103
168,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. I am still waiting for the relevant shadow minister to ask me a question on border protection and on this particular issue this year. As the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I said on 9 April, we had been looking at whether there were changed circumstances in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. As a result and based on the advice we had received, the government made the very important decision to suspend the processing of people seeking asylum from those two countries. As was said at the time, we did not suggest that the boats would necessarily stop. We understand-as does the opposition if they are fair dinkum-that this issue is driven primarily by international factors. That is what was said by the previous government and that is the case now. As a result of conflicts around the world and within our region, because of violence in Afghanistan, because of the conflicts within Sri Lanka, we have seen an increased number of vessels seeking to come to our shores. That is why this government has dedicated more resources than any other government when it comes to protecting our borders. As a result of that-here comes big mouth.",103
169,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order that goes to relevance: the minister was asked whether he stood by the 60 per cent decline",104
170,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Cook will resume his seat. Mrs Irwin-If you are going to write the question, why don't you ask the question?",104

172,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The House will come to order. The minister is responding to the question and I indicate that this has traditionchamber. ally been an issue that has seen a lot of emotion in the House. I think that, if people have very firm views on this subject, they should perhaps sit there quietly and take a considered reflection on the matters at hand. The minister has the call.",104
173,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, this government has dedicated more resources to deal with this matter than any previous government. If we were to accept the logic of those opposite that there was an increased number of arrivals as a result of something that was done by this government then one would have to conclude that the Howard government did something in 1999, because the greatest surge of arrivals in our history happened under the previous government. That is the reality. They like to pretend otherwise, but the greatest number of arrivals and the largest year of arrivals, as the former minister for immigration and the former Attorney-General know, happened under the previous government. We know that this is a complex issue. Everybody in this House, if they want to be fair dinkum, knows it is a complex issue. In relation to the question that has been asked, of course we are working very hard with our neighbours within the region. We are working very hard with transit",104

175,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Goldstein knows that he approaches the dispatch box for a point of order; he does no go to the dispatch box to make a point. He will leave the chamber for one hour understanding order 94(a). The member for Goldstein then left the,104
176,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We know this is a very difficult issue. That is why we are working very closely with transit countries and source countries in the region and that is why we have been working very closely, for example, with the Indonesian National Police. I can say that, as far as ducing the flow of those seeking to come to our shores goes, we have had a disruption of almost 5,000 within Indonesia and other countries, preventing them from embarking on perilous journeys. That is because of the good work that was undertaken by the Australian Federal Police in conjunction with Indonesian National Police. We will continue to do whatever we can to tackle this very complex issue. Can I say in conclusion that it is entirely phoney for those opposite to pretend that issue can be resolved with a silver bullet. I know there is a myth that has been perpetuated by the opposition, but the facts are these: the actual decline in numbers that occurred 10 years ago happened because of the greatest repatriation of asylum seekers since World War II, when 4.3 million people returned to Afghanistan in six years and many returned to Iraq as a result of changing cumstances. In the end, this matter will be solved through regional cooperation and global cooperation of transit countries and source countries. That is why I am confident that we will be able to resolve this matter through the efforts of our agencies and the cooperation of those countries within the region. Indigenous Employment",105
177,Mr HALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. How is the Northern Territory cattle industry helping to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians?",105
178,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Solomon for raising what is an important issue. The government's commitment to jobs and job creation goes across every portfolio. Members would be aware of the particular challenges in some of the more remote parts reof the Northern Territory, where for generations people had jobs without fair wages and in recent years fair wages have been available but not many jobs. The commitment from the government, through what has been a relatively modest program delivered in a partnership between my department and the the Indigenous Land Corporation within Minister Macklin's department, has been to work cooperatively with the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association. We have a window of opportunity at the moment where some of this the old stockmen and women are still alive and some of the people who are able to act as mentors for young people coming through are still with us. If we can make the connections with the cattle stations for the training and employment, we can actually close the gap in a way that should have been done many years ago. It is an opportunity that will not necessarily be available in exactly the cir- same way for many more years into the future, with the mentors being available as they are right now. When I was last in the Northern Territory, it coincided with the visit of my Indonesian counterpart, Minister Suswono, who is responsible for receiving many of the cattle in Indonesian ports that are exported out of the Northern Territory. Together we visited Tipperary Station not long after the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government had been there. There were 14 Indigenous young men and women who were being trained by a senior stock handler in a certificate II course and being able to get basic training with a direct connection following that to particular cattle stations. I think the significance of this program in terms of total employment numbers is very modest, but the significance of how it changes the lives of those involved was made clear when one of the participants, Tanya Callanan, spoke to me afterwards. We had a conversation there on the cattle station. I asked her how this was different from other training courses in which she had been involved in the past and she said, ‘Well, normally I get a certificate.' I said, ‘Aren't getting one this time?' and she said, ‘No, no, I'm getting a certificate; on this occasion also getting a job.'",105
179,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"3.38 pm)My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to a report that if the government increased the superprofit threshold on its great big new tax on mining to 12.5 per cent it would represent ‘a very soft concession' and would only reduce overall revenue from the tax from $9 billion to around $8.5 billion a year. Does this confirm that such a move would do next to nothing to reduce the adverse impact of this new tax on new investment and jobs? Further, does the Treasurer believe that he would have attracted a higher bid for his company at the mid-winter ball auction if he had not been saddled with the Prime Minister as part of the package?",106
180,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,106
181,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The last part of the question is out of order. The House will come back to order.,106

183,Ms JACKSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. How is the government investing in our schools and are there any threats to this funding and threats to jobs in particular in Western Australia?",106
184,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. Today I thought it was appropriate, with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Leader of the Opposition's chair, to reflect on a recent visit I had to her electorate in Western Australia. I visyou ited Curtin and there I learned some things about education in Western Australia and I'm about jobs in Western Australia. Curtin is a very nice electorate. I enjoyed my visit there. Budget. I particularly enjoyed finding out about the 19 libraries our Building the Education Revolution program is delivering, the 27 new classrooms that are being delivered, the 16 multipurpose halls and the refurbishment of all of the schools in the electorate of Curtin. I also enjoyed finding out about the new computers that kids in the electorate of Curtin had as a result of this government's computers in schools program. There they are in the electorate of Curtin. We have delivered 1,792 computers. That is very important because under this government there would be more to come to join those computers. Under the opposition, of course, there would be no more computers and no more delivery of Building the Education Revolution. I was also interested to find out that there are 29,757 small businesses in Curtin and these small businesses would be looking forward to the reduction in company tax and the special measures for taxation for small businesses in the government's resource super profits tax package. I believe as well that there would be 42,000 taxpayers in Curtin looking forward to benefiting from the govSchools ernment's superannuation reforms. So I learned a lot about the electorate of Curtin when I was there. I particularly enjoyed a visit to Dalkeith Primary School, and I want to conclude my contribution to question time by marking the moment by indicating I have some gifts for the member for Curtin today. A government member-Always generous!",106
185,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Always generous, that's me. One of the things that I found out there was that people like a fair day's pay when they have done a fair day's work. So, to remind them of Work Choices when that was not the case and to help the member for Curtin in her election campaign where she will be promising Work Choices again, I have brought her a mouse pad to mark the moment, and for the wall of her office I thought she might particularly appreciate the front page of the Cambridge Post in her electorate recording my visit to Dalkeith Primary School under the headline ‘Revolution in Lib land'-a very good headline, a very flattering photo of the children there. They look very attractive. I will let others judge about the photo of me. But the revolution in Lib land I think will go well on the wall of the member for Curtin.",107
186,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I think the Deputy Prime Minister has made her point.,107

190,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Dunkley proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The adverse impact of the Government's Resource Super Profits Tax on small to medium enterprises I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",107
191,Mr BILSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Dunkley) (3.45 pm)The support for this MPI reflects the seriousness with which the coalition views the imbe pact of the mining superprofits tax on small and medium enterprises. We hear a lot in this place from the government talking about it involving Rio, Xstrata and BHP Billiton. What they do not say is that this mining superprofits tax will affect all the small businesses, the family quarrying operations, those mining operations which are in no way huge like the ones the Labor Party would have you believe will be affected. Those small operations will get caught by this mining superprofits tax. The only super they might be involved with is superphosphate or fertilisers that are being extracted to support food production in Australia. Dr Emerson interjecting",107
192,Mr BILSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I welcome the interjection from the shadow minister opposite. Where has his voice been? ,108
193,Mr BILSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He is the minister now, sorry. Some people think he is the shadow minister. Where has he been when the issues of the mining superprofits tax are being discussed by communities and small businesses right across Australia? The Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy is the Marcel Marceau of the mining supertax debate. He will not raise his voice in support of the small businesses in every corner of this vast continent who will be adversely impacted upon by this tax. He will not stand up for their interests. He will not highlight how the Henry tax review said, concerning a whole category of resources mined by small mining operators, by family business quarries, that we should, ‘Take those resources out of the mining superprofits tax.' He will not stand up for the businesses that rely on what is extracted by those mining operations, those involved in building materials that use clay and stone. He will not stand up for the farming enterprises which are involved in extracting superphosphate to fertilise our food production in Australia. He will not even stand up for the small children who use the talcum powder extracted by those small operations. He will not stand up for any small business that is damaged by this tax, and they will be aged quite severely. This is a government budget built on shifting sand, where the government is going to attack the sand which goes into kids sand pits in order to prop up this budget black hole. That is what is going on here. There will be no children's sandpits spared from this government's tax grab as they touch up the mining operators, the small family businesses, on the fringe of metropolitan areas in regions right across Australia which extract that sand. They are not Xstrata. They are not involved in export commodities. They are not involved in humungous profits, which this government wants to tax; they are just going about their business. They are just employing local people. They are supporting the landscapers, the construction industry, they are providing the gravel for the roads and they are getting involved in their local communities-they support the footy club. These are not the huge organisations that Labor would have you believe they are, but you never hear a word about that. You never hear the small business minister talk about their interests. I am betting that in the next few minutes the Marcel Marceau of small business interests, Dr Emerson, will again not say a word about paid parental leave. He will not say a word about the fact that the Senate will send back to this parliament a Senate position which says, ‘Don't fit up small businesses with the administration of those schemes.' You will not see the government support that and you will not see the small business minister stand up for what the small business community wants on paid parental leave; just as you do not hear the small business minister utter a single word about the adverse impacts of this mining supertax on small business involved in the mining sector. You do not hear a word about that. You do not hear a dam- word about the impact and concerns of the cement industry, as Cement Concrete and Aggregates Australia have pointed outabout 80 to 90 per cent of quarried products that are extracted by small enterprises-they currently do not even pay royalties on those things. So we have this idea that we are trying to make sure that royalties are sucked up and somehow compensated for by this great big tax, but what is happening is that this federal Labor government is striking out on these small businesses for more money to fill the black hole in their budget. This is the concern about those people.",108
194,Mr MORRISON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Hoover!,109
195,Mr BILSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They could hoover, but they are actually saying to these small businesses-some with family debts to finance their operations, they use their assets, their houses mortgaged up to the wazoo, their heavy trucks moving goods through their communities-‘On your earnings before interest and tax, we are going to take 40 per cent.' At a time when small businesses are finding it hard to get finance-another issue on which the small business minister is Marcel Marceau-these small businesses are going to be finding it even harder because the opportunity for them to be profitable, to have enough profit to pay for their financing, is going to be sucked out by 40 per cent by this mining supertax. What is it about this government and this minister? Why do they keep doing things that disadvantage the small business community? Why do they not speak up on the clear adverse impacts that this mining supertax is going to have on thousands of small businesses right across Australia and on all of their customers? There are only two possibilities here. The 40 per cent mining supertax on small and family businesses in the quarrying and mining area is going to cause prices to go upwhich we put to the minister for housing today and she seemed disinterested or completely unaware about this impact-and the cost will be passed through to consumers at a time when they are deeply troubled by cost of living pressures everywhere. Everywhere you go, small businesses are saying, ‘Customers are very price sensitive; we just can't push costs on to those people.' Or, if the government says, ‘No, this mining supertax and its impact won't be pushed on to the small business customers,' small businesses are going to suck it up themselves, are they? Are they just going to wear that? They are going to have their viability and prospects for prosperity in their businesses, their opportunity to employ, and their chance to reinvest in their local communities, diminished as the government sucks up 40 per cent of their EBIT just to fill up a hole in their budget. That is what we are faced with here: damage to consumers and cost increases right through the production chain. I have talked about the impact on building materials and construction materials. I have talked about the impact on local governments that have to get gravel for their roads and the impact of fertilizer production on the agriculture industry in the food that we produce in our country-more input costs there-and even on the sandpits and talcum powder consumers of Australia. But do you hear a word?-no, not a word. You do not hear a word. There are two possible reasons you do not hear a word. You certainly do not see this fact captured in the political propaganda exercise-$36 million of political propaganda about this mining supertax-and you do not hear even a squeak about this crucial issue for so many small businesses and family enterprises involved in mining and quarrying. There has not been a squeak. Why? Because to say that they are doing this would add to the concerns, fears and outrage that these small business operators have about this Rudd Labor government. And it would also alert the hundreds of thousands of consumers of these products thatdirectly or indirectly through these minerals and resources being in the production cycle-their costs will go up. It will be one thing or the other. So the government has deliberately not said anything about it in any of the material that is available-in any of the advertisements-and when constituents of mine ring the Prime Minister's office and the Treasurer's office looking for an explanation of this impost on exploration they get the runaround. They end up getting referred to a phone line that no-one answers. So when they are looking for certainty and confidence they get-beep, beep-nothing: no-one at the end of the phone.",109
196,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,How is Hansard going to handle that?,110
197,Mr BILSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What else could be happening here? There is one other possibility that Hansard would probably capture not quite as well as the sound of a phone that noone is answering! There is one other possibility, and that is that the government has already decided to take those resource categories out: to say, ‘Look at us; we've consulted.' That is the other possibility: that they have already made this decision. The mining industry and those at the bigger end of town have learnt that the government is completely uninterested in consultation and will not even discuss the fundamental issues about this tax and its impact on their businesses, on the jobs of thousands and thousands of people, on everyone's superannuation, and on the costs of resources that are used in production in Australia. All those people get ignored. They will not even talk to them about that, but I bet you that in about a week-that would be my tip-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, just before he goes on an overseas trip, will say: ‘I've consulted. I've talked and I've listened. And do you know what we're going to do because we're so consultative and so interested? We're going to take out these resources, because that's just the kind of guys that we are.' That will be what Labor says: ‘Haven't we consulted well?' They will not say that that was what Henry recommended all along. If they had thought this through they would have done that to start with. They will say that it will not have any impact on the budget because there been this problem that if you keep the tax you damage the economy but if you change the tax you ruin their dodgy budget numbers. They will somehow find some new way of saying, ‘Well, it's not going to cost anything because some of these businesses were doing it tough; maybe they weren't going to add that much anyway.' But we know that that is a concern. Small business operators are fearful and quite fatalistic. They are fatalistic because they know the government is not interested. Their circumstances will be used as some kind of political prop-some kind of spin-when what the government should be doing right now is strengthening confidence in those businesses that will be damaged by the tax. The government will use that announcement in the hope that somehow it will strengthen Australians' confidence in the Prime Minister. That is what the government members will do. The Prime Minister will get out there and say, ‘See, I am listening. It is not that I'm difficult to work with and that if you're not in the gang of four no-one is listening.' That is exactly what they will do. That is always what this has been about. This tax has always been about exploration-not exploration of resources but exploration by Labor for a spine for the Prime Minister. They are trying to find him one. They are trying to find him a spine so he will take on a fight with those miners. You have seen the class warfare and the nonsense that has been trundled out here by the Labor Party in backing up what is essentially a tax grab-it is a fight they were looking for-to try and prop up a dodgy set of budget numbers and to make the Prime Minister look as if he believes in something. That is what this is about. Do you think they have thought this through? I think not. I think of Midland Brick in Western Australia. Midland Brick challenged this government-the Customs people on behalf of the Commonwealthabout diesel fuel rebates. They said, ‘We reckon we're involved in mining. Therefore our clay extraction operations in Western Australia should be able to qualify for the diesel fuel rebate.' Do you know what the government said? They said, ‘No, mate. You're not in mining.' And they declined access to the diesel fuel rebate because that clay extraction activity that Midland Brick involved in, according to the law, ing. But do you think this government could be consistent? Do you think they could be honourable in their application of these nical descriptions? Do you think they would think through and see whether they were being consistent? Of course not. So, in one decision they said, ‘No, in terms of you ing a benefit from government policy, you guys taking clay out to make bricks is not mining; it is something else. Uh-uh; you miss out. No money.' But when it comes to copying this government's mining supertax: ‘We know we said you weren't in mining when there were some benefits available but, by golly, you're in mining now. You are a miner now, because we will catch you in that net and we will insist that you are subject that tax.' So there is the inconsistency, the duplicity and the desperation by this Labor government. I think the Australian public is learning more and more about that. But it gets worse. On the Minister nance's rather interesting performance on Meet the Press on 30 May he was quite dismissive-almost arrogantly dismissiveabout concerns about the extreme complexity that this tax will have on businesses left to work with it. He said that concerns about the extreme complexity of the government's mining tax are ‘fallacious'. He went on to say that the impact will be simply ‘dealt with by large companies with sophisticated accounting and computer systems'. Does the finance minister not know that this tax is going to land on small and family businesses operating local gravel, sand and fertilizer operations? Is he ignorant of the Henry recommendations to exclude those resources, or does he just not care? He is supposed to be one of the gang of four; he is supposed to be part of where all these big decisions are made. That is where the locus of knowledge now sits. But when it comes to the implicais tions on small and medium enterprises he is is not mincompletely indifferent. This is yet another example-and we saw it with the great big ETS tax-of everyone techgetting compensation except small businesses. We have seen it in relation to paid parental leave: ‘We don't even worry about the administrative burden we're going to fit gainyou up with. We'll ignore that for small business.' This great big mining tax is supposed to land only on big companies that have shareholders in pinstriped suits on the other side of the world. That is completely wrong to start with. They have a complete blind spot because this lands on familyoperated and local small businesses that are a part of their community right across Australia from Warwick in Queensland, where they to are deeply concerned, down to Dunkley in southern Victoria, where the local sandpits in some cases dip into their profits to provide charitable contributions. They are going to be done over by this, and this government for Fi- does not care. (Time expired)",110

199,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Jagajaga-Minister for consti- Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (4.01 pm)-I thank the opposition for providing this opportunity to deal with the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 at this point. I indicate to the House that the government proposes that amendments (1), (15) and (23) be agreed to and that amendments (2) to (14) and (16) to (22) be disagreed to. I suggest, therefore, it may suit convenience of the House if we first consider amendments (1), (15) and (23), which are the ones we are going to agree to, and when those have been disposed of then consider amendments (2) to (14) and (16) to (22). Therefore, I move: That Senate amendments (1), (15) and (23) be agreed to. I will briefly explain the implications of what the government proposes. The Senate has returned to the House the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 and the Paid Parental Leave (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010 with a series of amendments. The government moved a number of these amendments in the Senate in response to the recommendations of the Senate inquiry and will obviously be accepting these amendments in this place. These government amendments, firstly, insert an object clause in the bill; secondly, clarify that an employer's obligation to provide parental leave pay under the bill is additional to any other obligation of the employer, in particular an obligation to provide employer funded paid parental leave; and, thirdly, insert a clause to give effect to an existing commitment of the government to have a comprehensive review of the Paid Parental Leave scheme. I indicate to members opposite that these amendments were all agreed to in the Senate when they were debated there. That may help the opposition in their consideration. For the information of those opposite I will also take this opportunity to refer to the amendments that we will not be accepting. We will not be accepting the amendments moved by the opposition in the Senate to remove employer involvement in Paid Parental Leave. Employer involvement is a central element of the Paid Parental Leave scheme and we want paid parental leave to be considered a normal part of employers supporting women after giving birth to take leave the from work to care for their children. The bill's intention is that women maintain their attachment to the workforce while they are having their family. Women will maintain that strong connection by receiving their government funded parental leave pay through their employers as they would receive any other work entitlement. Employers will benefit from the scheme through the retention of skilled staff without having to fund the scheme. Our scheme is government funded, not paid for by an increase in the company tax rate for certain companies. For the information of those opposite, only nine per cent of all businesses and only three per cent of small businesses will be involved in Paid Parental Leave in any given year. To help employers prepare for the scheme, the role of employers in providing government funded parental leave pay will be phased in over the first six months to align with the new financial year. Employers will only be required to pay an employee where they have received sufficient funds. Employers will provide parental leave pay on a business-as-usual basis; they will not be required to lodge regular reports with the Family Assistance Office or establish special bank accounts. Parental leave pay will be paid in accordance with an employer's normal pay practice and the employee's usual pay cycle. There is no payroll tax and no workers compensation payable. Paid parental leave will be implemented in close consultation with employers, including through the Paid Parental Leave Implementation Group. This element of the bill, employer involvement in payment for long-term employees, was recommended by the Productivity Commission as it sends a very strong message that taking leave from work around the time of a birth is a normal part of work and family life. The bill is fair to business and fair to families. The passage of this legislation today is a landmark reform for Australian families. It is the result of a lot of hard work by generations of Australian men and women. Its passage today will be a tribute to each and every one of them. I commend the bill, as amended, to the House.",113
200,Mr BILSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On behalf of the opposition I indicate that we are in agreement with the government on Senate amendments (1), (15) and (23) and acknowledge the government's work and acceptance of those amendments and the purpose of them. Question agreed to.",115

As I have already indicated our reasons I will not speak any further to those amendments.",115
202,Mr BILSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Dunkley) (4.09 pm)This is where the opposition departs from the government's position. The government has made precisely no case whatsoever as to why small employers should be fitted up with the payclerk obligations of administering this scheme. The government has not even attempted to address the very serious, genuine and heartfelt concerns of the small business community that it does not need to be in this role, it does not welcome this role and it sees no justification for this role. Moreover, it finds it bewildering that the Commonwealth would invest in setting up administrative and payment systems for the first six months of the operation of this scheme to be handled by the Family Assistance Office, not requiring small businesses to be the payclerk, and why it should then, having made that investment and established what in every respect is an adequate set of arrangements for the first six months, walk away from that taxpayer investment just to fit up small businesses with that responsibility. It has made no case for that whatsoever. The only justification that could possibly be made is a very dubious and distasteful one, and that is that, having set up the administrative and payment systems that drop small business into a role it has no business being in, the opportunity to top up the payments that are part of the government system will become an obligation to top them up. The risks that small businesses face include the risks of non-compliance in the administration of this scheme, the impact on other operations and the direct expense of varying and updating their payroll and accounting systems. The government has also put forward unconvincing arguments about how these payments would reflect in payroll related obligations that may be present in terms of superannuation, payroll tax and workers compensation. Those are all known risks they face-not to mention the regulatory and red tape burden that small business could well do without as many of them struggle to be viable enterprises in this difficult economic environment-but there is a bigger risk. No case whatsoever has been made to fit up small business with this obligation, but the real risk is that small business will then be fitted up with an obligation to top up these payments. All the systems are being set up to achieve that goal. I say to the government: shame on you for ignoring very considered and legitimate concerns raised by the small business community. Shame on you for not even attempting to make the case as to why this is necessary. Shame on you for investing taxpayers' funding in a perfectly adequate set of arrangements administered by the Family Assistance Office which are going to be abandoned after six months with no justification whatsoever. I would urge you to be clear and very careful about how you use these tools that you are setting up. The small business community and the coalition parties will rise as one to hold you to account and will no doubt point out how duplicitous this process has been if, shortly after it is in place, this payclerk role fitted with the administered obligations becomes a requirement to top up these payments in recognition of the many views around this nation, including in the coalition, that this arrangement is inadequate and does not provide the level of support that families are looking for. The government will say, ‘We've heard that voice, and the employers can stump up the rest of the money,' knowing that the administrative systems are in place. So we will oppose this on the voices in the House of Representatives. We will not hold you up in the Senate because we know your game. We are not about denying the rollout of this program. We have run the argument about why these provisions are unnecessary- (Time expired)",115
203,Dr STONE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In adding my voice to that of the shadow minister for small business, let me say that, in addition to the burden for small businesses that the amendment we put forward would have helped resolve, there is another dimension to this problem. I am concerned that when a small business, particularly a microbusiness with perhaps two or three employees, has to make a choice between two candidates for a new job, a woman of child-bearing age and man, and it knows about the administrative burden that it is going to have to take up with paid parental leave, that will see discrimination against the woman candidate. I do not think that is acceptable. We have already got a lot of discrimination in the Australian workforce in relation to women, with the gender pay equity problems. This reinstates or puts into place additional potential discrimination against women. I cannot understand for a minute why a government which has said that it will for six months have a moratorium on all businesses handling the payroll function cannot extend that, given in particular that the six months up of payroll attention from the Family Assistance Office will continue beyond six months for the employees who do not have an employer who can be readily nominated, like the contract workers, the self-employed and the casual workers. They will continue to have their paid parental leave come through the Family Assistance Office indefinitely, but we are told that, for others, who have an identifiable employer, their payroll moratorium will cease after six months. We think that this is a very serious problem. The good news for Australian business and for Australian women is that when we get into government we will introduce an appropriate scheme which, in particular, will not burden and be a problem for businesses and will give working families every chance to have a good parental leave scheme that is amongst the world's best, not amongst the world's poorest and most inadequate.

208,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (4.20 pm)-I will deliver an abridged version of my address, understanding that it would be most unwise to seek an extension of time beyond the commencement of the normal adjournment debate because my proposal for such an extension would go down in a screaming heap, opposed by both coalition members and my colleagues here on the government side. So I will do the very best I can in the more limited time that I have. I observe that the member for Dunkley, the shadow small business minister, has displayed himself as the Inspector Clouseau of Australian politics. He came to the dispatch box with his magnifying glass. He could see all these conspiracies happening around him. He thought if he could dig a little further he might find under all of the detail what we were really up to with the resource super profits tax. In so doing, the member for Dunkley raised to record heights the scare campaign that has been engaged in by the coalition in relation to the resource super profits tax. Let this day be marked as the day that the coalition has said that the kiddies will not be able to get their sand in their play pits as a result of the resource super profits tax. That is what he came in here and said, as a serious point. I notice the shadow minister opposite, the member for Casey, shaking his head. I agree with him. He should shake his head at this stupid scare campaign of the member for Dunkley. Mr Anthony Smith- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order.",118

211,Dr EMERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is the point I was making: the shadow minister's colleague walked into this chamber and said the kiddies will not be able to get any sand in their sandpits, in their playpits, as a result of the resource super profits tax. He might shake his head again at this one because the shadow minister for small business walked into this chamber and said the kiddies will not get their talcum powder because of the resource super profits tax. This is the absurdity of the scare campaign that has been launched by the coalition in relation to the resource super profits tax. This is a tax reform package and at no time during the contribution of the shadow small business minister did he mention the small business tax breaks. Did he mention the fact that every one of the 2.4 million small businesses in this country would receive a capacity to write off instantly the value of any eligible asset up to the value of $5,000, which would provide a welcome cash flow boost and an incentive to invest in productive assets? All 2.4 million businesses would get that. That would be a great thing for small businesses; but who is opposing that? The shadow small business minister and the coalition parties, especially the Liberal Party, say that they are the party of small business. They think and talk back to Sir Robert Menzies talking about the forgotten people and how the newly formed Liberal Party would represent the forgotten people, the shopkeepers and the small business owners of Australia. And what do they do? They cut their throats. They came into this chamber and said that they are going to oppose legislation that would provide a tax break for der. every one of those 2.4 million small businesses in Australia-that is, sole traders, partnerships and companies. Mr Billson- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I heard from my office a complete untruth from the minister about my remarks. I know he has a habit of being a bit loose with the facts and he is very sensitive about what other people say.",119

They are the forgotten people all right. The Liberal Party have forgotten the small business people, the shopkeepers and small business owners of this country because they want to deny them a tax break. They do not believe in small business. They voted against the stimulus package, they completely opposed the stimulus package, they are against our tradies, are against the shopkeepers and they are against all the small businesses in this country. We had the shadow minister for small business daring me to talk about paid parental leave. I will talk about it because the Leader of the Opposition has come up with a great big new tax on everything you buythat is, a 1.7 per cent increase in the company tax rate for larger businesses which we passed on to every small business in the country, to the 19,242 small businesses in this country-when the member ought to be sticking up for small business. But he is sticking it up small business because he wants to apply the flow-on from that paid parental leave great big new tax on everything you buy to the 19,242 small businesses in this country. He wants to deny every small business company in his electorate a headstart reduction in the company tax rate. All he wants to do is increase taxes on small business. They have the temerity to come in here and say, ‘We are supporting small business.' All you are doing is supporting an increase in taxation on small business. As I said in question time, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves. What happened to the once great Liberal Party that used to stick up for small business and now have abandoned them in their time of need? You are a complete disgrace to this House and a complete disgrace to the traditions of the Liberal Party. It proves yet again that the Rudd Labor government is the best friend that small business has ever had and will be the only friend that small business will ever have if you wantonly abandon the small business community of this country in their hour of need during the global financial recession. Now, when they want a bit of support during the recovery, you are prepared to abandon them yet again. You are a complete disgrace and they should be ashamed of yourselves.

226,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"On 29 October, Day for Daniel 2010 is being held. That has been organised by the Daniel Morcombe Foundation, which was established by Bruce and Denise Morcombe to commemorate the disappearance of their son Daniel in December 2003 on the Sunshine Coast. I am urging all members to wear a red tie in the parliament on 29 October. Those members who are not able to wear a tie for reasons of gender ought to wear something else red. That will highlight our support for the principle of child safety in 2010. I am writing to all members of the federal parliament and of the Queensland state parliament to encourage them to wear a red tie or a red item of clothing on 29 October. My heart goes out to Bruce and Denise Morcombe. To have one's child disappear, as happened to them in December 2003, is an extraordinarily tragic event. What they did was go out and establish this foundation with a view to making sure that other children in Australia are safe. I met with Mrs Morcombe just recently. She is a person of incredible character, fortitude and principle, with an incredible ability to convey the message of the importance of child safety. So I want to encourage all members of parliament to wear some red on 29 October this year. If the election has been held, I tend to write to all new members of parliament to encourage their participation as well. The Day for Daniel is an important opportunity for all of us to indicate our support for the principle of child safety. I think that in Australia in 2010 child safety is something we all support and is a principle which in fact unites us. I would also like to say that recently I a meeting with key stakeholders, including the dive industry and the University of the Sunshine Coast, to support the sinking of the HMAS Tobruk as a dive wreck off the Sunshine Coast when she is decommissioned in 2012. The Brisbane was sunk off the Sunshine Coast in 2005 and since then has become an artificial reef, a magnet for dive tourists from around the world, boosting employment, and of course boosting our marine stock and helping our marine environment. These ships, which have served our nation for decades, will actually serve as artificial dive wrecks for 500 years. So this is a win-win situation. It is a win for the local community because we get additional jobs; it creates work not only in the dive industry but also in the hospitality industry, including restaurants, motels, taxis and so on. It gives us the opportunity to remember the wonderful service these ships like the Brisbane-and, if we get the Tobruk, the Tobruk also-have given to our nation. It is also a win for our marine environment. We would plan to situate the Brisbane and the Tobruk about one nautical mile apart, and that means that dive tourists could come to dive on one ship one day and on the other another day and use the third day to orient themselves in the area. The Adelaide is a ship that has been prepared for sinking off the Central Coast of New South Wales. Some $7 million has been spent on preparing that ship for sinking. I in- understand the ship is off the Central Coast awaiting sinking, but legal action by a local group has prevented that ship from being sunk. I have called for that ship to be moved 1,000 kilometres north to the Sunshine Coast, where we would have her as a companion dive wreck. The dive industry is very important, tourism is important and employment is imporheld tant, and the addition of the Tobruk to the Brisbane as a companion dive wreck will boost the economy, which is very important. If we were to get the Adelaide as well, those ships would make us a world-class dive destination. People would come from right around the world to dive off the Sunshine Coast. That would of course be very important for the Sunshine Coast and for South-East Queensland. It would help us remember the wonderful service these ships have given and at the same time it would boost fish stocks and our marine environment. It really is a win-win situation-all winners, no losers. I encourage the government, whoever the government is at the time, to look favourably on permitting the Tobruk to be sunk off the Sunshine Coast-and, if the Central Coast of New South Wales does not want the Adelaide, we would like that as well. (Time expired) Building the Education Revolution Program",121
227,Mr HAYES,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to start off by talking about this government's commitment to Australian schools and in particular our commitment to the education of our children. It should be no surprise to anyone in this place that I, along with many others, have a deep interest in the education of our kids. It is about giving them a future, and that is very important for kids growing up in my area of south-west Sydney. In the lead-up to the last election, we made very clear that a Labor government would stand for an education revolution, and that is what we embarked upon-a substantial and sustained increase in the quantity of the investment in our education system and in the quality of our education system to deliver a future for our children. They need an education system that they can benefit from and that will take them forward. I would like to focus my comments today on the $2.1 billion National Secondary School Computer Fund, which is a key component of the Digital Education Revolution and which is, crucially, delivering a computer to every secondary school student in years nine to 12. Through the Digital Education Revolution initiative we have already delivered a quarter of a million computers to our schools. In my electorate alone, there were 2,800 computers delivered to 27 schools. That is thousands of kids who might typically not have access to computers generally and certainly not at home. Through this program they now have the opportunity to learn with the tools that they need, and that will equip them for their future in a modern and competitive workforce. Like other members in this place, I take great pride in visiting schools. Recently I was at Sarah Redford High School and the All Saints Catholic Senior College at Casula. The principal of All Saints, Mr Ray Wooby, explained that having computers is developing the innovation now coming about in computer based learning. It is enhancing students' uptake and use of computers as qualitative instruments in improving their education attainments. The students-whether it was put on for me or not-were very engaged and extremely excited. Principals are telling me that the provision of these computers is doing much to address the digital inequity gap that exists between it those students who have access to computers and those who do not. It is a simple fact that, if students are able to take computers home, not only will they have a chance to complete their homework and other tasks with the computer but they will be using instruments of modern technology which will equip them for the future. Rather shockingly, there is a threat to this program. Believe it or not, there are people who actually oppose it. Those people are sitting on the other side of the House. They will slash the programs for computers for our kids. I call upon each of those opposition members, particularly those who operate in the south-west of Sydney, to explain to people why they are happy to see our kids miss out on the important tools that they need to get jobs in the modern competitive workplace of tomorrow. How can they expect our kids to get a 21st century education if they are not going to give the kids the tools necessary? They are happy to have those schools that can provide those tools to kids from wealthy backgrounds-that is fine-but those schools that cannot provide computers are the ones who are going to miss out. That is what the school principals keep referring to as the ‘digital inequity'. The Liberal Party wants to force us back to where kids will only have computers if they can afford them. But they miss out the fundamental issue: this is not only about kids having access to computers but about education being based around this modern technology as well. It should be known that, of the 21,000 computers that now will not be funded because of the opposition, 1,000 are intended for schools in need in Werriwa. It is about time the coalition got up and explained, not simply in a throwaway line in a reply to a budget reply but in an articulate way, why they are happy to see these young kids who want a future being deprived of the tools they need to be able to get there. I am proud to be a member of a government that has taken the vital steps towards creating a first class education system in this country and delivering the education revolution. (Time expired) MCPherson Electorate: Senior Citizens",123
228,Mrs MAY,ADJOURNMENT,"MCPherson) (4.40 pm)Today I would like to place on record my congratulations to four of my constituents who have reached some very special milestones. Mrs Eileen Caton celebrated her 100th birthday in April. Mrs Ivy Maynard celebrated her 100th birthday in April. Mrs Mabel Watson celebrated her 105th birthday in May. Mr Frank Malcolm Gray will be celebrating his 100th birthday on 9 July, but also celebrated with Marcia, his wife, their 70th wedding anniversary in April. I would just like to put on the record a little bit each of these people, because I have found it really interesting to read about them and their contributions to their communities. Mrs Caton was born in Longreach on 18 April 1910 and, after completing her education, she joined the Qantas office in Longreach. She was only the second female on staff at Qantas when she joined the Longreach office in August 1928 and was employee No. 73. Her name is on the honour roll in the Qantas Founders Museum. Her son, Michael Caton, who I think we all know very well, is the commentator on the documentary at the Qantas Founders Museum. Eileen left Qantas in 1931 and returned to Longreach to be married to her sweetheart, Septimus Caton. She and Sep were married on 19 July 1933 and they had three children, Beverley, Robyn, and Michael. Her husband, Sep, had been working with steam engines but, with these engines being phased out, he began studying as a refrigeration engineer. The family moved on to Biloela and unfortunately he was killed in a tragic work accident in 1945, and Eileen, left a widow, raised their three young children. Mr Speaker, you might be interested to know that, apart from her love of her family and the raising of three children, Eileen was actually a very active member of the Australian Labor Party in Brisbane for a great number of years, before she relocated to the Gold Coast when she turned 90. She is currently living in an aged-care facility at Burleigh Waters in my electorate. Mrs Ivy Maynard was born in April 1910 in Ballarat in country Victoria. She describes herself as an ‘ordinary student' at school who enjoyed playing basketball and going in running races. She left school at 14 and went to work as a shop assistant in a furniture shop. She married, had two boys, took up lawn bowls and was a champion player. Currently, about she spends time at the Kirrahaven Aged Care Facility, where she lives. She is a very popular member of that aged-care facility and loves the get-togethers that happen down there. Mabel Watson was born in Scotland on 25 May 1905. She was the second last daughter born-her sister died in infancy. Her earliest memories include sliding down the hill in winter when she and her siblings were taken on a toboggan track in the snow, and being taken to see the king and queen, George and Mary, when they arrived by train in 1913 in Scotland. She came to Australia in 1922 by boat. She fell in love with ship travel and her last cruise at the age of 94. She married Charlie Watson and they came to Australia for a better life and raised their three sons here. All of them were members of the Kirra Surf Lifesaving Club, which is also in my electorate. Mabel was Secretary of the Coolangatta State School Mothers' Committee and a long-serving office-bearer of the Coolangatta CWA and the South Coast Women's Organisation. Mr Frank Malcolm Gray comes from a long line of Australians. His great grandfather, Samuel Gray, arrived in Adelaide at the age of 18. During his childhood years, Malcolm enjoyed constructing radios, or crystal sets as they were called then. His first job was as a draftsman in the Lands Department in Adelaide and then he applied for a vacancy as a draftsmen in Fiji, with the British government. Mr Speaker, Fiji is a place that I know very well; that is where I was born. Malcolm and Marcia celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary this year and, in July, Malcolm will celebrate his 100th birthday. I think each and every one of those milestones, Mr Speaker, you would agree, is a special milestone. When you look at what these people have achieved in their lives, along with raising their families and contributing to their local communities, you see a little of the history Australia and the important role that they have played in it. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy",124
229,Ms PARKE,ADJOURNMENT,"Next week, American entertainer and comedian Jerry Lewis will be in the parliament in his capacity as international patron for the Muscular Dystrophy Foundation of Australia. I am very grateful for Mr Lewis's visit and his efforts over many years to raise awareness about the difficulties for the children and families coping with muscular dystrophy. had But I do think it is a sad reflection on our society that so often we need a celebrity endorsement of an issue or a cause that really should attract our interest on its own merits. In this context I want to talk about an extraordinary young man, Conor Murphy, who suffers from Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a progressive degenerative muscle disease affecting boys. On average, affected boys lose the ability to walk and become wheelchair-bound before the age of 12 and they generally do not survive beyond their late teens or early 20s. Last Saturday, 12 June, I joined with Conor's many family and friends at the Leeuwin Barracks in East Fremantle to celebrate his 21st birthday, regarded as something of a miracle milestone. Even though Conor's condition has deteriorated to the point where he is on a ventilator 24 hours a day and he needs the assistance of a cough machine to cough, Conor's huge smile showed that he was not going to let these minor inconveniences detract from his birthday celebration. Conor lives over the road from my house in Beaconsfield in Fremantle, with his parents Maurice and Lesley Murphy. Lesley is the Community Support Director of the Muscular Dystrophy Association of WA and she also fundraises and does enormous amounts of volunteer work for the associaof tion, which receives very little government assistance. Last week, Lesley came to my office, together with John Gummer, the CEO of MDAWA, and Dr Hugh Dawkins from the Office of Population Health Genomics in the WA Department of Health. They explained to me that Australia does not have a national registry for muscular dystrophy or for any of the rare neuromuscular conditions such as spinal muscular atrophy. Not having such a registry is hampering the ability of our researchers to attract funds and patients to participate in trials for treatments, since there no collated information about the number and location of sufferers in Australia or their clinical and genetic information. As Lesley said to me: ‘To be brutally frank, the fact that we are the only first world country without a rare disease registry makes us something of a laughing stock.' Dr Hugh Dawkins has worked with a group of experts in the field from across Australia to produce a report for the Clinical, Technical, Ethical Principal Committee of the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council on the need to establish a national Duchenne muscular dystrophy registry. The report notes that ‘although the disorder is comparatively uncommon affecting one in 3,300 live births, the impact is enormous with the burden of disease being grossly disproportionate to its frequency'. Access Economics has estimated this costs $126,000 per affected person per year. The report notes further that in Australia, even though there are several centres involved in the research and management of the disease, there is insufficient coordination on a national level to impart this research into improved patient outcomes. As noted by my colleague Senator Jan MCLucas, the former Parliamentary Secretary for Health, in a comprehensive speech on this issue in February this year, the creation of a national istry for DMD is under consideration by the CTEPC. For the sake of patients like Conor, I hope the committee makes a decision soon so that he and others are able to obtain the best medical treatment that is currently available. It was also noted by Senator MCLucas that until recently there were no treatments available to halt the disease process or to restore muscle function. However, advances in gene technology have facilitated potential treatment options to improve muscle function. is The ABC's Catalyst program reported on 22 April this year that research being conducted by WA scientists Steve Wilton and Sue Fletcher has discovered a form of treatment for genetic diseases, in particular Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which involves engineering a genetic patch for the faulty gene. This has produced some promising results, with a trial in the UK showing that boys who had the patch were able to produce some of the important protein dystrophi. The patients have displayed movement abilities previously unseen in boys with Duchennes. Professor Wilton informs me that the treatment may also have application to other diseases such as cancer. The researchers responsible for this world-first medical research breakthrough are based in Western Australia. It would be an enormous loss to the state and the country if they were forced to go overseas to continue this work. For a relatively small investment, full length DMD gene sequencing components could be created at a specialised laboratory in Perth that would meet the needs of DMD sufferers in Australia and potentially elsewhere. A national registry would allow these new opportunities for treatment to be implemented quickly and effectively, as information would be centralised and would provide an interface between patients, docreg- tors and researchers. As Lesley Murphy said to me last week, as many people as possible should be able to access this amazing breakthrough. Boys like Conor deserve nothing less. Murray-Darling Basin",125
230,Mr BRIGGS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise again in this place to talk about the crisis in the Murray-Darling Basin and the catastrophic conditions faced by the communities in and around the Lower Lakes in my electorate and that of the member for Barker. I apologise, Mr Speaker, as you have heard me speak on this issue in this debate on many occasions. However, I think the issue is so significant that we should continue talking about it so that we do not forget how damaging and catastrophic the conditions are in and around the lower reaches of the Murray-Darling Basin. I know this place cares deeply about it. In the last few years, the issue of the Murray-Darling Basin has been addressed in this parliament, thanks to the work of the former Prime Minister John Howard and the member for Wentworth, who was the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources at the time. He launched groundbreaking reforms in January 2007 to deal with the crisis in the Murray-Darling Basin. This was done in several different ways. The federal government announced for the first time that a national system of water management should exist in this country because the states had failed to properly manage the Murray-Darling Basin for over 100 years. It also announced plans to buy back water licences to put more water back into the Murray-Darling Basin. The coalition did this because we recognise that, over the years, too many licences have been granted and too much has been extracted. So, the then federal government dealt with this very difficult ject. It also allocated significant amounts of money to onand off-farm infrastructure to get more from less. As the member for Wentworth so rightly puts it: we need to continue to grow our own food, but we need to do it with less. The $10 billion announcement included a large allocation to fund onand off-farm infrastructure-to put more water back in the system while still growing our own food. The last element of the package was investment in structural adjustment for those communities which would face challenges because of these difficult, but very necessary, reforms in the Murray-Darling Basin. It was a good plan and it was largely adopted by the Rudd government when they came to office in 2007. However, there were some elements of it which they changed. Some of those changes were for the worse, unfortunately. The worse mistake they have made was the failure to invest in infrastructure needs. The greatest example of that is at Menindee Lakes, where we are now going to see the loss of a massive amount of water because the Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water, Senator Wong, has failed to ensure that the investment in deepening those lakes and reducing the size of them went ahead before water came down from the massive floods in Queensland around Christmas. These meant that the Menindee Lakes got a huge injection of water. We will lose, it has been reported, up to 200 gigalitres of water in the next six months purely through evaporation. This is an excess we cannot afford and Senator Wong's failure in that respect is a real shame. The biggest failure is that of the Rudd government and its state Labor mates failing to come to an agreement on a truly national system. That has been reflected by an ongoing fight over how much water South Australia would get out of these floods in Queensub- sland. We are seeing right now that the chickens have come home to roost. There were big announcements in the state election campaign from Mike Rann and his cohorts in South Australia, but there has been very little action and very little water coming down the system. This highlights again just how hopeless the Rann state Labor government is. On this side of the House, we remain absolutely committed to ongoing and necessary reform in the Murray-Darling Basin. My leader, the Leader of the Opposition, has made it very clear that we are committed to the principles outlined by the member for Wentworth and by the former Prime Minister, in 2007. We will also have a referendum if the states refuse to hand over their powers, because we know it is necessary to have a national system of management for the system. Such a national system of management is essential to get the real reform needed to ensure that the Murray-Darling Basin is restored to health so that we can continue to grow our own food, so that communities can thrive and so our lower lakes at the bottom end, in my electorate and the member for Barker's electorate, can be healthy once again. This is an extremely important reform, a reform that I will continue to fight for. I know my colleagues, particularly those in South Australia who see the worse of this, will continue to fight on- (Time expired) Lowe Electorate: Livvi's Place",126
231,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT,"This afternoon, I provide an update on the great success of a project I brought to the attention of this House late last year. I am referring Australia's first all abilities playground, Livvi's Place at Timbrell Park, Five Dock, in my electorate of Lowe. Since its opening in November last year, Livvi's Place has been a huge success. Livvi's Place has reduced the barriers faced by children with special needs and their families. It has encouraged all chilthe dren to have fun together, regardless of age or ability. I am incredibly pleased to now report that, at the recent Institute of Public Works Engineering Australia engineering excellence awards for 2010 presented by the New South Wales division of the IPWEA, the City of Canada Bay Council received three awards out of nine categories. One of these awards, in the special community awards category, was for the Livvi's Place all abilities playground at Timbrell Park. I understand that this award has only been given on one other occasion in the past decade. I would like to draw the attention of the House to the judges' comments and to the following comment in particular. They said: Once every few years a project comes along that catches our imagination as something that is worthy of special attention because of the uniqueness or importance as a community facility. This playground is just such a facility. I wholeheartedly agree. This is an important initiative and I know it will continue to be of immense value to our community for years to come. I join with the judges in commending the Touched by Olivia Foundation, Canada Bay council staff and the various corporate partners who donated time, expertise and materials to such a worthy community project. I am encouraged by the judges' comments that Livvi's Place is: … a project that could and should be replicated in other areas to provide the means for less able to children to experience the joys of a playground and the opportunity to mix with others. I know too that John and Justine Perkins, from the Touched by Olivia Foundation, will be encouraged by this, as I know one of their aspirations is to have this type of project replicated across all councils to help improve lives of children all over Australia. The great news is that, as a result of this award, Canada Bay council has been approached to assist other councils to deliver such projects. I take the opportunity this afternoon to note two other awards received by Canada Bay council at the IPWEA (NSW Division) Excellence Awards for 2010. I understand the council received a ‘highly commended' recommendation in the environmental enhancement project category for their Powells Creek stormwater harvesting project. The council also won the new or improved techniques category for project management methodology. I have been advised that the project management methodology was developed in-house by Canada Bay council. This methodology sets out various processes which the council decided must be followed to ensure a project is properly planned and delivered. The judges agreed that the methodology developed by Canada Bay council ‘provides a framework for the successful delivery of a project with all parties sharing responsibility for a successful outcome.' Again the judges have recognised Canada Bay council as a leader and suggested that ‘other Councils consider this method of effective delivery of projects contained within their works program.' I agree with the Mayor of Canada Bay, Councillor Angelo Tsirekas, when he says that winning one award at this level is good and that winning two is excellent, but gaining recognition in three areas is extremely rare and a credit to council, council staff and the community partnerships that delivered these projects. I draw to the attention of the House that the Mayor of Canada Bay, Angelo Tsirekas, is in the distinguished visitors' gallery today. Through the speaker, I congratulate you, Angelo, for your leadership and vision. I again congratulate you, Angelo, and Canada Bay council on your great success and you, Angelo, for leading a pioneering council that keeps achieving better outcomes for ratepayers and residents. Well done to Angelo Tsirekas, the Mayor of the City of Canada Bay, to the general manager, Gary Sawyer, and to all his staff. They have done a terrific job.",128
