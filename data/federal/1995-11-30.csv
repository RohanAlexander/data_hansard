1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA NEW BUSINESS AFTER 8 P.M. Suspension of Standing Orders",11
2,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"I move: That standing order 48A (adjournment and next meeting) and standing order 103 (new business) be suspended for this sitting. As all honourable members would be aware, generally speaking at this stage of proceedings at the end of each session the government moves a motion like this to give itself the flexibility to handle bills that come back to it in amended form or which have been initiated by the Senate. This motion will give maximum flexibility to the House to take those bills on board when they arrive. The intentions of the government, should this motion be passed, is as follows. We will sit a bit later tonight, possibly till 8.00 p.m., and then suspend the sitting. We will reconvene parliament again tomorrow at 10.00 a.m. and sit until such time as we have concluded whatever it is the Senate has had the capacity to send back to us. It is very difficult to put a time on when that might occur. We might find ourselves in a situation where we adjourn very quickly. The Senate, as I understand it, intends to sit until 3.45 p.m. tomorrow. We are somewhat dictated to by the fact that there is a substantial amount of time between amended legislation being properly processed after its carriage by the Senate and its arrival in this place. In recent times with some heavily amended legislation that process has taken up to six or seven hours, sometimes even longer. I do not anticipate that there will be any legislation of that character over the next couple of days, but you cannot count on it. Therefore, it is not possible to fix a time to when affairs might conclude tomorrow. The intention of the government is that we should not sit any longer than the Senatethat is, 3.45 p.m. We hope we will be in a position to stick to that time. The Senate, as I understand it, will start its valedictories around that point in time. It would be our intention, at this stage of the game, to have the valedictories more towards the middle of the day, again giving us more time towards the end of tomorrow to be able to access any legislation the Senate has sent back to us. That is the position, Mr Speaker. I am sorry I cannot be more precise. But passage of this motion will give us the maximum possible flexibility to handle all the difficulties that might arise in the process.",11
3,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"The opposition does not intend to oppose this procedural motion. It is always the case at the end of a session that the House needs to have some flexibility in its time to deal with the matters coming across from the Senate. It has always been thus; therefore, we do not oppose the motion. It does, however, give me the opportunity to say that we are generally not happy as we look back on the last 12 months at the operations of many aspects of the parliament. Whilst not opposing this motion, we therefore take the opportunity to record our views on some general aspects of the House's operation. If you go back over the last 12 months, we have seen some unprecedented moves by this government in its operations and its management of the House. For example, the government during the last 12 months has used its numbers to suspend standing order 143. Standing order 143 has been part of the standing orders of this place for literally decades and has provided the opportunity to private members to ask another private member a question about his or her intentions with regard to a private member's bill, notice of motion or otherwise. I think it is wrong for the government to close down that particular right of private members. As I as say, it is unprecedented. We opposed it at the time, but it is a reflection of the attitude to the management of the House the government has acted out during this period. We have had in the last week or so, I think, a quite extraordinary response from the government in respect of a couple of censure motions we have proposed. The Leader of the House would, I think, have to agree with me in a quiet, private moment, if it were provided, that in the past governments have accepted censure motions basically at the time they have been moved. I know that you could find precedents otherwise, but it really is quite a change in the tone of this place for the government to knock back censure motions, on one occasion in respect of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and another the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). For the Prime Minister to say, 'I am not taking it,' and walk out, frankly, is holding the parliament in contempt and we again register our protest at the government's attitude to that. I say more generally: we always get the response from the government, 'It was just as bad under you. When you were in government you were ruthless using the numbers and we have done nothing different to how it was in the Fraser administration or otherwise.' That is a consoling defence that the government puts to the parliament, but the truth is that that is not the case. When Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister, he treated the parliament with a lot more respect than I am afraid it is possible to say you do. Mr Leo MCLeay-He kept his back turned to the Speaker, just like you do.",11
4,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"I do not, in fact. Mr Leo MCLeay-Of course you do.",12
5,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"Fair enough. I am addressing the chamber, as I am entitled to. Thank you for your interjection. But seriously, the standures ards in this House have fallen. Let us look at the language. It is not a reflection on any of the partiesMr Lieberman-'Scumbag' is a favourite one. The Prime Minister uses that very frequently.",12
6,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,Coming from your lot! Don't think I can't hear you along the front benches. I can hear you all the time-endless swearing and abuse.,12
7,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"This is a discussion about words. I say to the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), who is at the table, that when I arrived here basically 10 years ago-I was finally sworn in in February 1985-you could not say in this parliament that somebody was a liar. Yet I can show you umpteen extracts from the Current House Hansard where calling somebody a 'compulsive liar' has gone through basically without any problems whatsoever. We have got to a situation now where it was said recently that if one side calls the other side a liar then it is okay, provided you can have a quid pro quo situation.",12
8,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"Order! This is an opportunity to debate the motion that standing order 48A and standing order 103 be suspended for this sitting. It is not an opportunity for you in your comments to reflect on interpretations given by the chair at this stage or at any other stage. If in fact there was disagreement when things were done, appropriate steps should have been taken. In some cases you will probably say that they were. This is not that time. You will not reflect on the chair and you will confine your remarks to the business before the House.",12
9,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"Of course, I accept your ruling, Mr Speaker. My comments, however, go to the tone and the management of the House. It cannot be denied, as these examples all show, that the tone and the management of the House do not today reach the standards they once did. That is a fact. People may be sensitive about it, but that is the fact of the matter. There are umpteen examples and they are very relevant to this motion, as an aside. This motion proposes to change the procedof the House to facilitate the last 24 hours of the House's sitting and it is perfectly reasonable imd relevant that there should be some comment on the various happenings in the last 12 months which have brought us to debate this particular motion. Let me go more specifically to one aspect of this motion. This motion basically allows for the parliament to sit tomorrow but for there to be no question time. This is another change, as the Leader of the House well knows. Where we had an extra day's sitting, the precedent was for a question time to go with it. It is also true, as he can point in recent years the government has abandoned that practice. But I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that they should not have abandoned that practice. When members are in the parliament, as we will be tomorrow, we are all paid to be here. The least we can have from the go-ernment-and there is plenty of time to do so, as the minister has admitted in his remarks-is for their ministers to front up for another question time. There is absolutely no excuse whatsoever for the government to basically go on holiday early when the parliament is sitting tomorrow and when there are opportunities for question time to be held. They have decided for their own political advantage that it is better not to have question time tomorrow. Our concerns about this would be significantly lessened if we did not have the roster arrangement. That is another one of the problems which have been foisted onto the parliament. The roster system allows ministers to escape the daily pressure and scrutiny that question time provides.",12
10,Mr WALKER,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,Not from you mob.,13
11,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,You can say that by jovial interjection. Mr \Valker-You never ask me questions.,13
12,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"We do not ask you questions, minister, because quite frankly you are irrelevant, as you well know. As most of us know, when you have a minister in trouble, one of the most significant pressure points for that minister is the daily grind of question time. What happens today is that you have a go at them for a couple of days and then they basically go on holiday. For example, Minister Lawrence faces question time for two days, and then on Wednesday where is she? She is sitting in her office having a cup of tea, watching us ask you questions on matters for which she is responsible. That is a great way for a minister to escape accountability to the parliament. As I am demonstrating in these brief remarks, it is one of many aspects which this government has changed in the operation of the parliament which reduces the importance of the parliato, that ment. For that reason, it is wrong. It is not just the practices, the rules and the standing orders which have changed; it is the attitude of ministers to the parliament. For example, back in February this year the government failed to meet its responsibility to muster the numbers for a quorum, resulting in a temporary suspension of sitting. That has rarely happened, but it is no surprise that it should happen this year under the current management of the House. Earlier in that day we had Assistant Treasurer Gear forced to apologise to the House for the bungling of an income tax bill. He failed to oversee the passage of legislation for which he was responsible and, as a result, government amendments which should have been moved were overlooked. The government had to scramble the next day to resurrect its bill. In the main committee on one occasion they were unable to commence proceedingsMr Leo MCLeay-Because the deputy opposition whip never turned up.",13
13,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"You have responsibilities for these matters. All I am putting to you, Mr Speaker, without any contradiction by way of puerile interjection, is that all these incidents are symptomatic of not only a confused government but a government that does not hold the parliament in the high respect that it ought to be held. I will not refer to still photography rulings. That incident had a happier ending. Mr Leo MCLeay-You have already given that speech .",13
14,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"Yes, I have already given that speech. But there have been many other happenings in the last 12 months, all of which support our concerns about the standards in the parliament. With those few remarks, whilst we do not oppose this particular motion, we record our dissatisfaction with the government's approach to the management of business. We look forward to a change in government and some better standards.",13
15,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"in reply-The glass is always half empty as far as the opposition spokesperson on parliamentary matters is concerned, and his speech reflected that. In fact, I think that over the last five or six years the parliament has come to be a much more effective chamber in the House of Representatives. It has come to be much more effective as a product of a whole series of decisions, some of which are working exceptionally well this year. The most recent innovation, which has virtually eliminated the guillotine, has been the creation of the Main Committee, which has provided a forum both for discussion of non-controversial legislation-non-controversial in the sense that it does not divide the parties, but may well be controversial for individual members of parliament and raise issues that they want to talk about-and reports, for which under no government for a very considerable period of time has there been any ability for debate at all in any parliamentary forum. The most futile motion that I move each day is to get up and move that the House take note of a variety of papers. In my lifetime in parliament, which includes a period of time in opposition, we have never got to those points, ever, and we do now as a result of those changes which have been put in place. The guillotine became prolific up till a couple of years ago and generally featured in speeches made by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) or his equivalent. It was, I must admit, severe in the past four or five years. It was the product of many other factors, but two of the most important of those factors also went to the good operations of this chamber. One was the fact that we moved from a three-week on, one-week off sitting pattern to a two weeks longer sitting, two weeks off sitting pattern, which all members heartily supported when those propositions were put in place for the good health and common sense of the way in which things were debated in this House, and the elimination of evening sittings. But it removed a considerable amount of flexibility from the government in its ability to carry its legislation without recourse to the guillotine. The second, and I think even more significant, factor was we actually had private member's business established on Thursday, and now on Mondays, in a way that actually gave, for most of the day, one day a week, control of the proceedings of the House to private members and what private members wanted discussed. I can recollect when I was in opposition that the nearest equivalent of that was grievance day debate on Thursday and private member's motions on Thursday. You got about an hour's worth of grievance debate on a Thursday and then you got a couple of hour's worth on the next Thursday-no grievance debate-but on the next Thursday an ability to put forward motions. The grievance debate always remained, I must say. I cannot ever recollect when I was in opposition the grievance debate disappearing. And I do tend personally to regard that hour of the grievance debate as the most important block of private member's time by historical precedent. I will say that in the period of the Fraser government that hour did not disappear and we tended to get that grievance hour no matter what. But you could forget private member's business on Thursday. You would get about two or three of them at the beginning of a session and then they would disappear completely to the virtual elimination of all private member's time except on the odd occasion when a private member's bill was allowed through for discussion-the very odd occasion. Now private members have a chance to put their marker down on notices of motion, private member's bills, committee reports from parliamentary committee work-a whole plethora of activity that has changed the relevance of the sounding board function of this parliament and the raising of grievances function by monumental margins over any practice before. We now have, I think, a modem House of Representatives operation. I will not go into the fact that we now have an effectively . functioning House of Representatives committee system, which we did not have when I was in opposition. We could go to that as well. That has greater longevity than the affairs that I am referring to here but, again, was an initiative that occurred under this government. So we have every reason to be proud of the way in which the House of Representatives now operates in regard to that. As to the question of whether or not there is excessive abusive language in this House, this is a tough chamber. There is no doubt about that, and there is no question that both sides of this House play it tough. I always smile cynically when I hear opposition complaints about language that is allegedly used on this side. Perhaps opposition members on the back bench cannot hear it, but I can certainly hear the abuse that is dumped on me invariably when I stand up in this place. After 15 years of it I really could not care less, but I do care about it when people get up and start chatting away as though the affairs in this regard were a one-sided event in the House. There was even a particular incident cited about the use of the word 'liar'. As I recollect, on that occasion that you chose to refer to, the first use of that epithet came from the other side of the House. I would agree that it would be better if we did not exchange our views in that fashion, there is no doubt about that, but I also do not think that we ought to diminish ourselves by suggesting that that is a reflection of the quality of what is put in this place. The quality of what is put in this place is very high. The level of verbal violence in this place is also quite high but, in comparison with that which is prevalent in a few other parliamentary forums, I would say we are quite mild. Mr Reith-Are you saying that yours is quality muck?",13
16,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"No, there is quality debate here. There is much that ought to be removed, but there is also quality debatemore of the fact that the glass is half full rather than half empty. Let me say this, too: I have attended the House of Commons on a number of occasions. We might think we are a bit rough in our handling of each other in this place, but I would invite your occasional attendance on the tough days in the House of Commons. We are as nothing compared with what the British are capable of when put to it. It is no accident that this occurs, of course, in the United Kingdom because they fail to provide seats for 200 members of parliament so, when the chamber is actually full, just a normal proceeding represents a riot. When you have 450 seated and another 200 trying to get seats in the chamber, it does lead to the odd bit of dysfunction every now and again. It is also no accident that in the House of Commons the distance between the front benches is two sword points distance as a formal process of separating both sides of the House. So I do not think, violent though our language gets here from time to time, we are by any means a chamber that is as capable of disreputable behaviour as others. It is not unusual that that is the case because there are big issues at stake. Getting back to the operations of the parliament, the operations of the parliament now are as good as any I can remember. In terms of the Mr Reith-In question time as well?",15
17,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"I am glad you reminded me of question time; I will get to that because I had forgotten it. In terms of the access to parliamentary forums via the Main Committee, via a private member's day, I think we could say in all honesty that we as ordinary members of parliament in this chamber have never had it so good. The capacity to get up on anything since I was a back bench member of parliament in opposition has dramatically changed. As to question time, the opposition manager had things to say about the absence of question time tomorrow. Let me say this: I once took out figures on the days on which parliament sat in which no question time was held-although I have not done so lately, I will concede that. I was delighted to note that the average performance in the period of the Fraser government was about twice ours in terms of sittings of parliament without question time. It was by no means an unprecedented set of events before we came into office. On the final day, of course, it does allow us the flexibility, and that is a flexibility that not just we but other governments have claimed as the years have gone by. Mr Reith-But it is standard now not to have question time. You have changed that. There is no prospect of it now, is there?",15
18,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,Order! The member for Flinders has had his opportunity.,16
19,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"I get two bites of the cherry on this occasion. The notion that ministers who are not rostered on are on the beach at Bondi or on holiday-as the honourable member describes it-is a nonsense. Ministers work infinitely harder in their offices than they ever do here in question time. As for the number of questions that ministers get asked, I do not think the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) or the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh), who are here in the chamber, have been asked a single question by the opposition in the last three years. If they been asked questions, you could count them on the fingers of one hand. They have only themselves to blame if they have not taken the opportunity to question deeply Ms MCHugh on the excellent conduct of her ministry or Mr Walker on the excellent conduct of his. More fool them! But the opportunities are there for them to do that. I am glad that the opposition is supporting this motion. It does give us a chance to operate the parliament sensibly over the next couple of days. Question resolved in the affirmative.

20,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: T-at, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committe.e Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which w-s referred t<;> the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported: Construction of a Commonwealth Law Courts Building in Melbourne, Victoria !he new Commonwealth Law Courts building In Melbourne will provide some 36,000 square metres of gross floor area and provide accommodation for the High Court of Australia, the Federal Court of Australia, the Industrial Relations Court of Australia and the - aI?i1- - ourt of Australia. Currently these Juns-lctlOns occupy space in four separate locatIOns. The ad hoc nature of these facilities makes it extremely difficult for the courts to operate efficiently. The Public Works Committee tabled a report on 22 November 1995 recommending the project at a maximum construction cost of $108.4 million in the 1994-95 budget context. In their report the committee also raised some issues to which the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has provided the following responses: The Attorney-General's Department adVises that consultation with the Victorian government has occurred during the development of the project and will continue to ?ccur during its further development, particularly in relation to the issues identified by the Public Works Committee. The Attorney-General's Department advises that a formal consultative committee has been established with the Community and Public Sector Union to provide an essential ongoing consultative forum. This committee meets ' monthly and will continue to do so for the duration of the project. Other representatives on the committee include the project team, the various jurisdictions and CPSU workplace delegates. If approved, the construction is anticipated to commence in August 1996 and commit- be completed in April 1999. I would like to thank the committee for their report. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",17
21,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported: Development of facilities for the Artillery Centre in Puckapunyal, Victoria. The Department of Defence proposes to relocate the artillery centre from North Head in S-dney to Puckapunyal to meet training req--r-ments and to make best use of existing faclhtles at Puckapunyal. This proposal will provide the Artillery Centre with ready access to a suitable field firing range and it will ensure utilisation of existing facilities in Puckapunyal after the departure of the First Armoured Regiment for Darwin. North Head is an unsuitable location for the Artillery Centre because it is remote from a field firing range and because it ought to be a national park. The proposal will provide office accommodation, living accommodation, instructional, storage and repair facilities. The estimated outturn cost is $34.8 million. The Public Works Committee tabled their favourable report on 28 November 1995, recommending the project at the estimated outturn cost of $34.8 million.· If approved, the project will commence in April 1996 and be completed by November 1997. I would like to thank the committee for their report. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",17
22,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of 18 ments and townhouses for Australian High Commission staff, Kuala Lumpur. This proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 27 October 1995. The committee has now duly reported back to parliament. The main elements of the proposed work are the construction of a three-storey development of 10 apartments and recreation facilities at 9111 Jalan Taman U Thant, and construction of a three-storey development of six townhouses and two apartments at No. 4 of the same address. The total estimated outturn cost of the project is $11.54 million at May 1995 prices. It is proposed to call selected tenders from Australian construction companies which have a joint venture arrangement with Malaysian construction companies. A single contract will be left for both developments. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence around August 1996 and be completed by January 1998. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has made the following recommendations in its report: firstly, there is a need to replace existing unsatisfactory owned accommodation in Kuala Lumpur which does not meet current accommodation guidelines; secondly, the development of a mix of apartments and townhouses is the most effective option for improving the standard of accommodation of Australian High Commission staff; thirdly, the committee recommended that the Overseas Property Group provide it with design details of the proposal at No.4 to the same level of detail as is provided at No. 9/11; and, fourthly, the committee recommends that the Overseas Property Group continues consultations with the Australian High Commission, the Community and Public Sector Union and the Foreign Service Family Association during the detailed design development phase. The committee further recommends that before work commences on the project the Overseas Property Group reports back to the committee regarding the result of these consultations. The sites selected are suitable for the proposed developments. The committee recommends the construction of apartments and townhouses for the Australian High apart- Commission staff at Kuala Lumpur at an estimated outturn cost of $11.54 million at May 1995 prices. The Overseas Property Group will continue consultation with the Australian High Commission, the Community and Public Sector Union and the Foreign Service Family Association during the detailed design development phase. The committee will be provided with the design detail and will be kept informed of the consultations. I commend to the House the innovative method by which this project will be financed. The new residential development will be provided by using developer finance under a deferred payment arrangement. This will enable Australia to gain a valuable new asset with no impact on the budget. I thank the committee for its report and commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",18
23,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of 10 apartments for Consulate-General staff, Shanghai. This project was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 27 October 1995. The committee has now duly reported back to the parliament. The main elements of the proposed work are construction of 10 apartments and recreation facilities, including a swimming pool, tennis court, recreation room, landscaping and car parking. The total estimated cost for the works at May 1995 prices is $A1O.659 million. The project will be financed offbudget under a deferred payment arrangement. Subject to parliamentary approval, it is expected to commence around July 1996 and be completed by February 1998. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has made the following recommendations in its report. Firstly, there is a need for the construction of the 10 apartments for Consulate-General staff in Shanghai to provide accommodation which is more economic than current leasing arrangements. Secondly, the committee recommends that the Overseas Property Group continue consultations with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, staff of the Consulate-General and the Community and Public Sector Union regarding possible changes to the design of the project. The committee further recommends that the Overseas Property Group before construction commences advises the committee of the result of those consultations. Thirdly, the site selected is suitable for construction of the 10 apartments proposed in this reference. Fourthly, the committee recommends the construction of the 10 apartments for the Consulate-General staff in Shanghai at the estimated outturn cost of $10.659 at May 1995 prices. The Overseas Property Group will continue consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Consulate-General in Shanghai and the Community and Public Sector Union regarding the design of the apartments. The committee will be advised of the results of those consultations. I commend to the House this innovative method by which the project will be financed. The new residential development will be provided using developer finance under a deferred payment arrangement. This will enable Australia to gain a valuable new asset with no impact on the budget.

24,Mr GIBSON,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I present the report of the committee entitled: Review of the Auditor General's audit report No. 24 of 1994-95Follow-up audit on the Northern Land Council, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",19
25,Mr GIBSON,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report I have just tabled follows an inquiry by the House of Representati ves Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Affairs into Audit Report No. 24 of 1994-95, which was a follow-up audit of the Northern Land Council. Following a request from the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) in June 1993, an audit was conducted of the Northern Land Council, with the Auditor-General's report being tabled in the House on 14 December 1993. The committee conducted an inquiry the following that audit report and tabled its report in May 1994. At the time of the first audit report being completed, the minister requested a follow-up audit after 12 months. The follow-up audit report was tabled in the House on 27 March and referred to the committee on 30 March 1995. Following invitations to the relevant agencies to make submissions, the committee held public hearings in Canberra on 28 August 1995. The key findings of the follow-up audit noted that, while the Northern Land Council had made significant progress in implementing the 52 recommendations of the first audit report, there remained some outstanding concerns on the implementation of several recommendations. The follow-up audit report acknowledged the concerted effort made by the Northern Land Council in addressing the 52 recommendations of the first audit report. Most of the recommendations have been satisfactorily complied with and substantial progress has been made with most of the remaining recommendations. The Northern Land Council have pointed out that some recommendations could not be complied with until other prerequisite actions, such as strategic planning, had been completed. Nonetheless, while acknowledging the very considerable progress made and the ongoing nature of some recommendations, the Australian National Audit Office noted that, in a small number of areas, further action was needed. The follow-up audit report made five recommendations, four of which were addressed to the Northern Land Council and one to the Australian Taxation Office. In its recommendation 1, the audit office recommended that the NLC review the royalty payment procedures to ensure their completeness. The audit office sought the implementation of an appropriate royalty trust fund accounting system to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the accounting function. The Northern Land Council advised that the new financial management accounting package was now in place and that the trust accounts were in the process of being changed over to the new system. The audit office stated that it was satisfied with the actions taken to this recommendation. Recommendation 2 is that the Northern Land Council ensure that all branch managers are conversant with the budget monitoring system. This followed findings by the audit office that some branch managers were not aware of and therefore not using the system to monitor their budgets. The Northern Land Council advised that there had been an increase in the training of managers. Staff are being trained on the newly installed financial management system. In addition, following the completion of a strategic plan, a corporate planning exercise will be completed this year. The audit office indicated that these developments were in the right direction but warned that new staff coming into the organisation after the initial training exercise will need appropriate induction training. Recommendation 3 dealt with aspects of the Northern Land Council debt recovery process. The Northern Land Council response indicated the emphasis it has given to debt avoidance. However, the ANAO noted that a significant proportion of the existing debts had been outstanding for more than 90 days and that improvements to the recovery procedures were needed. The Northern Land Council indicated that it is now trying to identify those debts that are recoverable and those that need to be written off. The audit office believed that the Northern Land Council evidence indicated that procedures had been put in place. Recommendation 4 was for the Northern Land Council to immediately take action to monitor the use of fuel cards and motor vehicles and include these arrangements in the procedures manual. The Northern Land Council stated that a fleet management system had been introduced to facilitate appropriate monitoring. The audit office believed this was an appropriate measure and similar to that used by the Department of Administrative Services for its fleet. Recommendation 5 was addressed to the Australian Taxation Office. It recommended urgent action be initiated to make the reduction in the mining withholding tax effective. meet The reduction was implemented before the audit reports were completed. However, the audit office was concerned that the Department of the Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office need to establish appropriate mechanisms so that legislative changes can be implemented promptly and guidelines disseminated to the appropriate officers for immediate action. The committee believes that actions taken by the Northern Land Council in response to both audit reports have implemented the changes sought. The committee agrees with the audit office that there has been a positive response from both the Northern Land Council and ATSIC, with their 'well done' comment on the outcomes. There has been a substantial change in the management culture of the Northern Land Council and the committee commends their commitment and effectiveness in becoming a more efficient organisation. The committee believes it important that the annual audit process for the Northern Land Council monitor the recent changes to ensure that they continue to be implemented. Finally, I take this opportunity, as this will probably be the last chance I will have before the election to speak as chair of this committee, to thank all the members of the committee for their outstanding hard work over the last three years. I am particularly grateful and thankful for the support given by my deputy chair, the member for Cowper, Garry Nehl, who has been a very solid supporter and assistant throughout that process. I appreciate the cooperation I have received as chair from all members of the committee and from the secretariat- Mr Allan Kelly and the other staff of the commi ttee. It has been a great honour and privilege to chair the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I appreciate the support I have been given by the House, my colleagues on the committee and the secretariat.",19
26,Mr NEHL,COMMITTEES,"by leave-At the outset I thank the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) for his kind words in relation to me, but whether or not I deserve such praise is beside the point. The point he makes is that the committee has worked extremely well. It has had membership from all the major parties. It has worked with great harmony and to the benefit of the parliament, the people of Australia and, certainly, indigenous Australians. I share the chair's commendations of the secretary of the committee, Mr Allan Kelly, and his staff who were all hard working and assiduous in carrying out the affairs of the committee. The report just tabled by my colleague the member for Moreton emphasises the high level of accountability required in the Aboriginal affairs sector. It is much higher than in many other sectors in public and private administration. The Northern Land Council has acted to address a range of deficiencies identified in the 1993 audit report and those in the most recent report. Like the member for Moreton, I am very pleased that the Northern Land Council has addressed these and is going forward as a more effective and efficient organisation. A large amount of funding goes to indigenous organisations. There is a widespread perception throughout the broad Australian community that there is considerable, if not enormous, waste in Aboriginal affairs. That perception is shared by many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In the course of its inquiries in the last three years the committee has had many submissions and comments from indigenous Australians along that line. What this comes down to is that, whatever the reason, indigenous organisations have to be like Caesar's wife-certainly much more transparent and more accountable than many other organisations in mainstream society. One of the difficulties has been-and it is still there-that we provide money for indigenous organisations and there is what I frequently call the in-built failure factor, which is not in the best interests of Aboriginal people, of Torres Strait Islander people or of Australia as a whole. We say to one particular organisation, 'Here is $3 million, boys. Go off and do it.' In many cases these grants are given to people who in terms of modem business are unsophisticated, to say the least, and without the managerial experience or the administrative backup to go ahead and do it. They get into trouble and then everybody comes down on them like a ton of bricks. They have, in many cases, no option but to get into trouble because we are giving large amounts of money to them without providing the infrastructure, the training, the experience and the skills for them to properly manage. This is a point I have made time and again in the course of the deliberations of the committee and I do so again. When we provide funding for indigenous organisations, unless we also provide some additional funding for training in management and accountability and accounting and provide the backup and the people to look after it and make sure that it runs properly, it is doomed to failure. That is in nobody's interest. We have to make sure not only that is money not wasted but that the perception that money is being wasted can be done away with. The track record is such that it can be demonstrated clearly that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians are running their own affairs successfully and that the level of waste has diminished considerably. To do that, we have to provide the backup and some additional funding to make sure that the training is there so that they can get on and do the job properly without heading for disaster automatically. More and more this is no longer the case, but it ,does exist. We parliament need to address this issue, to it, to deal with it. No matter who is in government after the next election, it is important that this factor gets some emphasis because without it we will still have that widespread perception of and fact of waste, inefficiency and disaster. We all want a situation where indigenous Australians are managing their own affairs and doing it extremely well.",21
27,Mr GIBSON,COMMITTEES,"I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks when the debate is resumed. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA Australia Remembers 1945-1995 Debate resumed from 29 November, on motion by Mr Sciacca: That the House take note of the paper.",22
28,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am very pleased to speak on the motion before the House. As the federal member for Perth in this parliament, I have taken great pride and felt very humble at having had the opportunity to help mark a very significant year of our nation's history. This year, we have commemorated, paid tribute to and celebrated the efforts of those who helped to bring about victory in the Pacific and end World War II. It has been an important national year. The truism that applies to a family, local community or nation is that, unless you understand and appreciate your past, you cannot plan for your future. Perhaps the greatest feature of the Australia Remembers year and program has been that, for the first time, we have made a truly national and community effort to ensure that our young people have an understanding of Australia's contribution and the contribution that a generation of Australians made for Australia in World War II. The importance of making that effort as a community and personally and ensuring that our young people understand this contribution came home to me on ANZAC Day this year. Like many local residents, I attended a dawn as a service in Halliday Park in Bayswater on seize ANZAC Day. After the ubiquitous sausage sizzle, I got home about 7 a.m. When I opened the door, my son, who was then three going on eight and who is now nearly four going on 14 and who will be traipsing the corridors of the House later this afternoon, said, 'Daddy where have you been?' I said, 'I've been working.' He said, 'No you haven't, Daddy. You've been standing up for those who died.' Of course he was right. He had woken up, and I wasn't there. Jane had flicked on the televised dawn service and explained what I was doing. After he made this point to me, I asked myself: why do we stand up? We stand up for what a generation of Australians stood up for, for freedom, democracy, liberty and our way of life. When these things were threatened, a generation of Australians rallied to defend them. We also stand up for the sacrifice that they made. We stand up for what that generation of Australians helped to forge as national Australian traits and characteristics. They are traits they forged more often than not through pain, fear, suffering and hardship. Those national traits forged in the course of those years were courage, a sense of humour in adversity, mateship, loyalty, sticking together, ingenuity and tenacity, a healthy disrespect for authority unless that authority was deserving of respect or earned that respect and, perhaps most importantly of all, tolerance and a fair go for others. The ultimate debt that Australians of my generation and my son's generation owe to the generation of Australians in 1945 is that those national traits and characteristics are able to be applied by them in peacetime rather than in war. It is for that debt that this very significant and, in my view, very great program has been supported by the government, the parliament and the community this year. Locally in Perth, like other federal members and federal electorate divisions, we established a local Australia Remembers federal Perth committee, which consisted of representatives from local RSL sub-branches, from local city, shire and town councils, and from local schools and historical societies. The local federal Perth committee was chaired by the recently retired city of Bayswater Town Clerk Kevin Lang, despite a number of work commitments that Kevin had on board. The charter of the federal Perth Australia Remembers Committee was to seek to provide for the electorate of Perth a focus to the nationwide Australia Remembers program. The major objectives that the local committee sought to work by were to encourage all Australians to remember and thank the veterans who fought in World War II campaigns; to recognise and appreciate the sorrows and difficulties of the widows and children of those veterans who did not return home or who died in intervening years; to encourage all Australians to remember and thank all those who remained at home and kept the home front running; to create a sense of relief and excitement which marked the end of the war in 1945; and to educate the nation about the horrors and impact of World War II. The local federal Perth committee sought to initiate activities and make contact with community organisations to encourage them to conduct Australia Remembers activities. I take this opportunity to thank all those organipleased sations that took part either directly or in a representative capacity in the local federal Perth Australia Remembers Committee. I have mentioned Kevin Lang. There were local state members of parliament, including my state parliamentary colleague, the member for Perth, Diana Warnock. There were representatives of various RSL sub-branches, including the Mount Lawley-Inglewood sub-branch, the Eastern Regional sub-branch, the Bedford Morley sub-branch, the Bellevue sub-branch and the Maylands sub-branch. Representatives at various times included John Quinn from the Mount Lawley-Inglewood sub-branch, John Rolle and Percy White from the Eastern Regional sub-branch and Arthur Elder and Bill Gaynor from the Bellevue sub-branch. Local government-which included the Shire of Swan, the Town of Bassendean, the City of Bayswater and the City of Stirlingwas represented variously by Councillor Margaret Kidson from the Shire of Swan and the then Mayor of Bassendean, John Cox. Local !schools were represented by Marilyn Piper from John Forrest Senior High School. The various historical societies or associations in my electorate-which include the Bayswater, the Bassendean, the Maylands, the Swan-Guildford and the North Perth historical societies-were represented by Betty Mazzarol from the Bayswater Historical Society and Michael Grogan from the Bassendean Historical Society. I was very pleased that all those organisations and community representatives were able to take part in this significant year's activities. The local federal Perth Australia Remembers Committee sponsored a range of activities. I would like to briefly draw those to the attention of the House. The committee, in part, sponsored a city of Stirling VE Day dance at the Maylands library. The dance sought to reflect Australia's lifestyle in 1945 and the mood of Australians in the final year of the war. The committee also sponsored the Mount Lawley Senior High School to coordinate an extended school and community awareness program with the 1st and 2nd/11th Battalions of the City of Perth Regiment. I was very to take part in the culmination of those programs with the Mount Lawley Senior High School students and the representatives of the 1st and 2nd/11th Battalions in the Mount Lawley Senior High School library and to formally mark the occasion by drawing to the community's attention the Centenary Memorial Library Book, held by the Mount Lawley Senior High School library, which records donations of books made in the course of the school's history on behalf of members of the 1st and 2nd/II th Battalions. Other projects supported by the local Australia Remembers Perth Committee included a community victory ball dinner dance on 2 September, sponsored by the City of Bayswater and the Town of Bassendean, which celebrated the end of World War II. That function was held in conjunction with the Eastern Regional and Bedford-Morley subbranches of the RSL. I was very pleased to attend that occasion. The Bassendean Historical Society, in conjunction with the Bassendean Memorial Public Library, established a photographic and memorabilia display in the Bassendean library in August. I was very pleased on one Sunday afternoon to formally open the display on behalf of the community. The local Australia Remembers Committee was very pleased to sponsor that project. The Bayswater Historical Society sponsored a number of projects, including a cookbook entitled On the home front, which published popular recipes from the war as well as gave a historical account of life on the home front during the war. I was pleased to present Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) this week a copy of the book published by the society. The society also organised a display in conjunction with John Forrest Senior High School students, which featured written and oral histories of local people who lived during those war years. I was very pleased at an assembly at John Forrest Senior High School to present to the relevant students a small token of the community's appreciation of their work. I was also very pleased that one of the local veterans chosen for those oral histories was Jack Henderson, who is a resident of Bayswater whom I have known and had a high regard for over many years. I was also very pleased that the committee sponsored the RSL Bedford-Morley subbranch commemorative dinner on 15 August, which coincided with the sub-branch's 50th anniversary. That occasion was attended by many members of the Bedford-Morley RSL sub-branch, very many of whom bowl at the Bedford bowling club, where my father has bowled since 1967. In the course of conversation that evening, members of the sub-branch who have had conversations with my father since 1967, suggested that I had learned bit about politics from him. My riposte to the members on that occasion was that they needed to understand that bowling was a bit like politics-that is, one needed to understand where the bias was. The local Australia Remembers federal Perth Committee also sponsored the Australian Railways Historical Society in its development of a permanent display recognising the vital role that the Midland Westrail Railway Workshops played in the course of World War II. The Midland Westrail Railway Workshops were utilised in the course of World War II to ensure that contracts were completed for propellers and engines for minesweepers, Yarrow type boilers for Corvettes, forgings for Australian standard Garret locomotives, and a range of 25-pounder shell forgings. So the work force at the workshops during the later years of the war, which then included a significant proportion of women, played a significant role in the preparation of to the munitions and equipment. The historical society-which currently manages the railway museum in Bassendean and has an aspiration, which I share, to transfer the museum, at some stage in the near future, to the old Midland Westrail Railway Workshops site-received widespread support in the community for its effort in ensuring that the historical contribution the railway workshops made to the war effort was recorded. Finally, the committee supported the Bellevue RSL sub-branch in engaging in a weeklong, comprehensive display at the Bellevue RSL Club, depicting the life experiences and styles from the 1940s and the war years. The sub-branch's activities included children's school and artwork which commemorated the end of World War II. Members of that subbranch visited local schools and provided relevant students with a presentation about the significance of the week. As well, a commemoration plaque was placed on the Bellevue RSL Memorial. I was very pleased, together with Arthur Elder and Bill Gaynor from the Bellevue RSL sub-branch, to take part in that ceremony. In addition to those activities, a centrepiece a fair of the local Perth Australia Remembers Committee support for Australia Remembers activities in the course of the year was the sponsorship of local schools in the electorate which conducted Australia Remembers activities. This was in the form of either a competition or other appropriate Australia Remembers commemoration activities. I have over 50 primary and high schools in my electorate. Time prevents me from going through all of the activities of all of the schools, but I draw attention to a few. I have referred to the Mount Lawley Senior High School's activities with the 11 th and 2nd/II th City of Perth battalions. I was pleased recently at ANZAC Terrace Primary School in Bassen dean to commemorate the moving of the flagpole of the school, formally dedicated on 11 November, and very pleased recently that at Bassendean Primary School the Minister for Veterans' Affairs made a presentation to the school library for its activities in the course of this year. There were a number of other functions which were held in the course of the year which were not formally sponsored by the Perth Australia Remembers Committee but which were nonetheless supported by the committee and the community. I was very pleased to be able to attend the Mount Lawley-Inglewood RSL sub-branch Australia Remembers dinner on 15 August at the Cascades Tavern in Maylands. I was very pleased recently at a regular monthly meeting of the sub-branch to be able to present Australia Remembers certificates of appreciation to that branch. I am looking forward to attending the sub-branch's annual dinner later this year. The City of Bayswater conducted a Victory in the Pacific march and luncheon on VP Day. It was a tremendous occasion. I am looking forward to the city's launch of the video of the occasion. Finally, I was very pleased that local authorities in my electorate also took the opportunity of engaging in Operation Restoration to restore a number of local war memorials. I pay tribute to the Town of Bassendean for engaging in a program to restore the Bassendean Memorial on Old Perth Road and the Memorial Rose Garden at Bassendean Oval, the City of Bayswater for the restoration of the memorial at Halliday Park in Bayswater and the Remembrance Park Memorial in Beaufort Street in Bedford, and the Shire of Swan for the Stirling Square Memorial at Guildford, the Railway Workshops Memorial in Midland and the Bellevue Memorial at the Bellevue RSL Club. This has been a magnificent year and I thank and congratulate all local Perth organisations and individuals who played their part in making sure Australia remembers. (Time expired)",22
29,Mr FILING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I rise to speak on the motion relating to the Australia Remembers paper. Following on from what was said by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith)-whose electorate also got heavily involved in the Australia Remembers commemoration; as did yours, Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher-I would like to firstly congratulate the chairman of the state committee for Australia Remembers in Western Australia, Keith Mattingley. He provided some inspirational leadership in ensuring that the Western Australian end of the commemorative effort was superlative. I particularly appreciated the fact that he took the trouble to come to a meeting of the Moore electorate committee, and that meeting in fact was the one in which the seeding funds were allocated to the various applicants. I found having him there with the advice he gave was very useful. All the way through the Australia Remembers commemoration year, Keith Mattingley has been an extremely good leader. I would like to congratulate him and Mrs Mattingley, because I know they made quite extraordinary efforts to ensure that they were present at as many of the functions as possible, and that really did give the Western Australian effort in the Australia Remembers program an extra fillip. In the electorate of Moore, we had a very active participation in Australia Remembers. At an early stage, we instituted the committee, and it was formed of representatives from many of the community groups, schools, clubs and institutions, including of course the RSL, the local city councils and others. Those representatives all participated to ensure that in Moore there was a first-class program of events to commemorate what was effectively the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Before I look at those people individually, I would like to make a couple of comments about the benefits of the Australia Remembers commemoration. I must commend again the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) for what has been an historical contribution to Australia's commemoration of its past events. The themes that were set up by the original Australia Remembers project were designed to recognise not only the sacrifices and efforts made by those who had served in military theatres and auxiliary services to the military forces but also the efforts of those at homethose people who stayed and made sacrifices in Australia. In my electorate, where around 25 to 27 per cent of the people were actually born in the United Kingdom or Ireland, we had the added feature of having a large number of people who had been in Britain during the war and had suffered considerably thanks to the Blitz and the blockade by the U-boats which prevented vital supplies from reaching the United Kingdom. Our committee set about ensuring that there was going to be an across-the-board celebration in what has been, as we now know, a very successful project. Enlarging on the themes I spoke of earlier, I would like to point out that, during the Second World War in Wanneroo in particular-actually from North Beach all the way up to the city of Wanneroo and beyond to Two Rocks-there was a great consciousness of the proximity of the war. This was due not the least to the fact that many of the people living there were in the market garden and growing industries and contributed to the war effort by growing valuable foodstuffs. Another factor was Wanneroo's proximity to the coast, because various points along the coast acted as valuable lookouts or important strategic points for any potential Japanese invasion of the coastline. I would like to mention some of the people who were involved in my committee. I will start off with Maureen Hill. Maureen is an officer of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, a friend and a member of the committee. She provided a terrific liaison between the department and the committee. I must commend the officers of the Department of Veterans' Affairs in Perth, because they were very helpful and provided first-class support for all of our efforts. Maureen has been a very active local community member in the electorate and was able to give us some valuable insights into how the Australia Remembers program was going to work. Margaret Cockman, who is from the city of Wanneroo and works in the culture and recreation department, was absolutely fantastic with her contribution and helped us to reach our objectives. She provided a valuable liaison between the city of Wannerooincluding all of the various events and activities in the city-and the Moore electorate committee for Australia Remembers. We also had assistance from Philip Baker from the Church of Jesus Christ; Colin Fletcher from 53 Regional Cadet Union; Tony Martin, a former Wanneroo citizen of the year and former Chief Inspector of Police and also during the war a diver, who used to dive in Fremantle Harbour to ensure no limpid mines were attached to the military or merchant shipping in the harbour; Phil Renkin, President of the Yanchep-Two Rocks RSL; John Astill from the Northshore Rotary Club; Daryl Deacon from Craigie High School; Don Edwards from the North Suburban Historical Society and Coastal Heritage Association of Western Australia; Kelcey Toleman from 507 Regional Cadet Union at Joondalup; Cara Cox from the North Beach Primary School; Kate Hurlbatt from the training ship Marmion naval cadets; Captain Alex Kent from 507 Regional Cadets; Justin Townsend from No. 2 Flight Wanneroo Air Training Cadets; Michelle Westaway from 53 Regional Cadet Unit; Ian Grealish of the same unit; and Arthur Ventham from the Wanneroo Schools Association. We also had help from Alison Kent from TS Marmion; councillors Fleur Freame and Margaret Lynn from the city of Wanneroo; Lesley Emmans, another volunteer who helped us out considerably; and a range of other people who came into get behind this terrific effort. I would like to now briefly talk about some of the events that occurred. Amongst those events, we had a very useful and informative exhibition put on by the North Suburban Historical Society. They have also undertaken the production of a video presenting the Australian War Memorial and museum and the collection of a representative photographic display from the Western Australian newspapers from the period. Incidentally, the museum is located in an old water tank that has been converted into a museum at the Mount Flora reserve. That water tank used to be a very valuable strategic lookout during the Second World War. I also acknowledge a number of other important projects, not the least of which was undertaken on 28 May where 30 volunteers from the Men of the Trees in the area and the Friends of Yellagonga, led by Mike Norman of Sorrento, planted 550 commemorative trees in the northern area of the Yellagonga Regional Park. They will be installing a plinth and park in the area later. Also, Glengarry Primary School had a special service on ANZAC Day where the students dedicated a flagpole memorial to those who lost their lives during World War II. Many of the students wore black armbands or special Australia Remembers armbands during sporting events in the area held during that weekend immediately adjacent to VP Day. I would also like to specifically remember the Remember and Rejoice display at Gloucester Lodge Museum which was held on 1 October by the city of Wanneroo and the people responsible for the preservation of Gloucester Lodge. This was to recognise the RAAF Radar Unit 227, No.4 Medical Rehabilitation Unit and the 10th Light Horse. It provided an exhibition of the history of Wanneroo and an Australia Remembers commemoration march past by cadets and veterans, as well as other exhibitions. For instance, Jack Sue from Z Force was there. It was an absolutely superb afternoon--one of the great memories of this program. I would also like to point out that the Wanneroo City Library also contributed by putting together an oral history capturing the individual experiences in the words of the veterans and in a way not possible with published works. The Australia Remembers collection comprises over 30 interviews that have been published in cassette form conducted by community volunteers, with the interviews vividly recording varied war experiences from residents who enlisted, prisoners of war, work camp internees and market gardeners who produced valuable war food supplies. That was launched on Tuesday, 15 August, VP Day, at the Woodvale library, comprising a tape of composite interviews and a synopsis of all the tapes supported by a display of memorabilia. Those tapes are available for reference from the Whitfords library. One of the great events was the Sentimental Journey Concert which was held at the Wanneroo Civic Centre. That was an absolutely wonderful production put on by the city entertainers. It was basically a kaleidoscope, a smorgasbord of events, with the focus being on the Second World War, old-time music hall themes, moving all the way through to the present. It actually used the theme from 1945 to 1995. The response from the audience at every concert was one of acclaim. The performers did a fantastic job; the singing and the production were superb. Particularly for people who had a background of music hall experience, whether in the United Kingdom or here in Australia, it gave a lot to feel nostalgic and to reminisce about. The schools in the area got right behind Australia Remembers. I have mentioned the North Beach school which had a wonderful display. They put a plaque in their main assembly area. I would like to recongratulate Cara Cox, the then acting deputy principal, who was responsible for the Australia Remembers activities at that school. The other week she was also responsible for the presentation of Australia Remembers commemorative certificates of appreciation-a great idea-to veterans who were associated with or living near the school. That school really got behind the local community. The Craigie Senior High School conducted a very enthusiastic and significant memories project. I would like to congratulate Daryl Deacon, the teacher responsible at that school. Veterans' representatives were invited to a celebration breakfast and assembly at which they were made very welcome and at which their efforts were recognised. I congratulate Daryl Deacon and the students who were responsible. I would also like to congratulate the WannGara Inner Wheel and the Wanneroo Rotary which put on a gala supper dance at the Wanneroo Civic Centre on 2 September. That was another great success. I would like to recognise Margaret Bain and Buzz Goodacre from Inner Wheel and Wanneroo Rotary respectively. I would also like to recognise the Ocean Reef Residents Association which built a commemorative seat which has been placed on the Trig Point lookout at Ocean Reef to commemorate Australia Remembers. That was officially opened the other week. I would like to congratulate the people responsible for that. The Ocean Reef residents have been strong participants within our program. Whitfords Lions Club staged the 1995 Whitfords Community Fair at which they had a marquee and exhibition especially designated for Australia Remembers. Jack Le Cras, a former district governor and a stalwart of the Whitfords Lions Club, was responsible for the organisation of this fair, and I would like to give recognition to Jack for his individual contribution. I point out that one of the few surviving VCs from the British Royal Navy was present as a guest and participant in the events at that community fair. It was good to see such a successful activity in the electorate. I wish to recognise Antony Kent and Peter West from the Wanneroo and Joondalup subbranch of the RSL. They organised a parade in September to recognise and commemorate Australia Remembers. I recognise Mr Bennett and Mr Tomlinson, the president and secretary respectively of the North Beach subbranch, who were involved in the establishment and opening of a plaque at the Mount Flora Regional Museum. Also, Wanneroo schools participated in an exhibition. There was a range of smaller events, amongst which was one at St Luke's church in Padbury which had a small exhibition at their recent fete. A number of other organisations used the various facets of Australia Remembers as a theme at their local events. (Time expired)",25
30,Mr HOLDING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I would like to first pay tribute to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), his staff and officers of his department, who made the Australia Remembers celebration one of the important occasions in the history of this nation. It was an occasion in which all sections of the community, people of diverse religious and political beliefs and people of none, came together as one generation to openly, publicly thank an earlier generation for the sacrifices that they bore during the last Great World War conflict. For Melbourne Ports the event was especially significant. Within my electorate there are continual reminders of the sacrifices that took place. It is the home of the historic St Kilda Road barracks, the Shrine of Remembrance and the city of Port Melbourne Station Pier, from where a generation of young servicemen went overseas to do battle, many of whom never returned. We formed a committee with RSL and community representatives. The level of participation that took place within my community was such that it is not really possible to single out individuals, some of whom may have played a more significant part than others. There were very few people who were asked to contribute and to assist who did not give of their very best. RSL organisations were amongst the base structures, as were teachers and principals from various schools and citizens just in their capacity as citizens. The structure of Melbourne Ports, with such important edifices as the shrine and the barracks, enabled us to put together historic tours for school children. First of all, they went to the Shrine of Remembrance and visited the Victoria Barracks and the war cabinet room of that time. Then they went down to Port Melbourne where they boarded the historic sailing ship Alma Doepel, which played an important role in the war, and then across to Williamstown where they toured the HMAS Castlemaine. Although many of those children live close to the sea and have walked or ridden past the Shrine of Remembrance and the St Kilda Road barracks, this tour really brought the whole exercise alive to them. The emphasis on the number of young children who participated achieved, I think, one of the fundamental aims of the whole Australia Remembers celebration. A number of high schools participated in a video competition based on the Australia Remembers theme. A contribution was given to the Jewish Museum for their historic display, and the committee assisted financially with the Jewish library's presentation of a historic set of videos in which they had interviewed survivors of the Holocaust, people who, as individuals, took their lives into hands-to form partisan groups-and people who were involved in the heroic resistance in the Warsaw ghetto. A local theatre of high quality, one of the smaller live theatres in Melbourne-Theatre Works-produced a professional, locally based play called The Peep Show, which was available in video presentation. The City of Glen Eira hosted a tea dance and a historic display. The City of Port Phillip commissioners used the theme to commence war memorial refurbishment schemes. There are a large number of war memorials in my electorate dating back to the Boer War and many were in need of refurbishment. All shops through the main streets displayed programs and other memorabilia related to the events of the war. One should express appreciation to those responsible for the management of the Caulfield racecourse. During the war it was one of the more important army camps. Many Australian diggers received their basic training there and lived there for some time. It was good to see the wide variety of people who turned up to the Australia Remembers Cup. I am sorry that the minister, who is a lover of horses-I do not know whether he is a successful punter-was unable to make it on that occasion. Melbourne Ports, by virtue of the Palais theatre being in my electorate, was the site for the very successful presentation Melbourne 'Australia Remembers Concert'. There were very few members of my electorate who were not touched, if not deeply and directly involved, in these significant and important events. I have been to many ANZAC Day ceremonies and many marches, and I think the march in Melbourne was an event which will live for a long time in the memory not merely of all those ex-servicemen who participated, many of them with their grandchildren, but of those who turned up en masse to say 'Thank you'. I have never seen that level of enthusiasm and community spirit at any of the many marches that I have attended and participated in. It was a tribute which was richly deserved and it was a tribute which was generously given. For many, it was an occasion which will not be forgotten, particularly by the young children. their Many of them marched with their grandfathers and fathers, but mainly their grandfathers, wearing the medals that had been won. It was a march out of the ordinary. It was a march which brought the people of Melbourne together in a way which happens, unfortunately, only too infrequently. I would like to finish on this note. Those of us who are in this parliament are involved, by the very nature of the Westminster system, in a situation of continual debate and disagreement. Those people who attend this parliament and observe our behaviour are entitled to think that basically we are fierce protagonists and that there is seldom any point of agreement. Ceremonies and events like this do tend to remind us that we are one people. When our nation in the past has been threatened there has been a spirit of unanimity which flows through the Australian people where differences are forgotten. It is therefore important that we see the Australia Remembers ceremony as not merely a tribute to those who made sacrifices but an occasion which brought together our people with one sense of purpose, one concept, and an ideal about who we are. We might not always agree on where we are going, but the important thing is that people across the board were reaching out to each other in order to say thank you to a generation of Australians who served their of the communities, their small towns and this country well. It was an important event for every Australian who participated in it. We all owe a debt of thanks to those who, throughout the length and breadth of Australia, took on the responsibility of helping to organise the ceremonies. It was a great community effort which should inspire the people in this parliament in the heat of political battle, and remind us that, when it comes down to it, we are one people who are able, on occasions like this, to show a spirit of unanimity and sincerity. We have the ability to reach across political and religious boundaries and assert the fundamental values for which many Australians fought and died.",28
31,Mrs MOYLAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I share many of the sentiments just expressed by the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). This year of remembrance has been a wonderful time which has enabled us to remember that, although philosophically we may have many differences, essentially we are here for the one purpose and that is to assist in the management, the growth and the development of this great country. As 1995 draws to an end so, too, does Australia Remembers, but the memories will undoubtedly linger with all of us who have been able to participate in this year of remembrance. I congratulate the government and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) for their initiative in this regard and for making available the resources and the wherewithal to assist all of us to participate in way in the celebrations commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. In August 1994 the Australia Remembers 1994-95 project was launched by the government. In November 1994 the Pearce Australia Remembers committee was formed. The committee was formed to commence work on projects for the Pearce electorate. The members of the committee were chosen by way of nomination from each of the local authorities in the Pearce electorate. The Returned Services League clubs in the area were also approached. After November 1994 the committee got going under the chairmanship of Mr Bill Gaynor, the representative of the Shire of Mundaring. The committee comprised Mr Bill Gaynor, Mrs Barbara HarperNelson from the Shire of Kalamunda, Mr Mac Wroth from the Shire of Toodyay, Mrs Jan Smith, who was the mayor and representative of the town of Northam, Mrs Judi Tomlinson from the Shire of Chittering and Mrs Jan Zeck from the Shire of Swan. All local authorities were invited to participate and did so with a great deal of enthusiasm. The focus of the Pearce celebrations was a week of activities at our regional shopping centre, Midland Gate, from 14 to 19 August 1995. The week was organised to acknowledge those in Pearce, and their relatives, who served in the Australian defence forces during World War II and those who played their part both at home and abroad. The sacrifice and commitment they made can never be fully appreciated by those of us who were not there; by some of us who were born just as the war was ending; and by some of us who were not in this realm at the time of the event. It is very difficult for us to fully appreciate what these people sacrificed and what they went through. It is through occasions such as Australia Remembers week that we are able to share experiences with those people and gain a greater understanding. We are also able to remember and pay tribute to those who contributed to making our nation what it is today. I was really delighted by the wonderful response in our community to this event. I some would like to thank all of those who involved themselves. Many schools and community groups participated in an assortment of events and displays, bringing their understanding of history, their artistic abilities, their writing abilities, their musical abilities, dancing, acting and so on all to the fore. It provided a wonderful week, which I know many of our veterans enjoyed immensely. Groups including the Shire of Swan, the Pearce RAAF base, the navy, Defence Force Recruiting, Hollywood Hospital, the Australian Red Cross, the Australian Railway Society and the Western Australian Museum all participated in the Pearce week of Australia Remembers. Group Captain Dennis Green, Officer Commanding of RAAF base Pearce, officially opened the week of activities and gave a very moving address. The schools that participated included Greenmount, Riverlands, Falls Road, Bellevue, Woodlupine, High Wycombe and Middle Swan primary schools, John Forrest High School, and Mazenod College-I would particularly like to thank them for their college swing band's contribution of music of the era. Fourteen schools took part in a week of activity and displays, as I said, which covered a whole spectrum of talent. The schools that won awards were Kalamunda Primary School, Bindoon Primary School and Falls Road Primary School. The standard of work was extremely high and the judges had a very difficult decision to make. One of the students from Kalamunda Primary School, Lisa Tan, summed up the whole essence of the week's activity in a poem that reflected the message of peace. It seems to me that many of the young people, as they listened to the stories of the veterans, understood very much that these were people who made sacrifices to bring about a peaceful Australia and that peace is an important ongoing theme for us all. It was very moving to see how deeply many of the young people understood that message. It was certainly a common thread in many of the displays that were exhibited in that week. Lisa Tan from year 7 at Kalamunda Primary School said: I think wars are futile and prove nothing. Can we do anything, can't we do something? Don't start wars, instead be a friend And hopefully ail wars will come to an end. We had, as I said, great interaction between some of our veterans and some of our students from the schools who came down to listen to their stories. Mr Derek Cowling was one such veteran, and I thought I might read a little of his background. He was a volunteer in the air force in 1940. He was a wireless operator and a gunner. He became a gunnery officer with the 44th Squadron, Lincoln, which was the first Lancaster squadron ever formed to fly an operation over Germany. The first Lancaster was delivered in 1941. He was involved in 16 sorties over Germany but was shot down on 6 October 1942 and captured three days later on the Dutch border. He spent time in two separate campsthe Dulag Luft and the Stalag Luft 3, which was the main air force prisoner of war camp in Germany. Whilst in the Stalag Luft, Mr Cowling was a member of the escape organisation. They started three tunnels called Tom, Dick and Harry. Eventually, 76 officers escaped one night out of Harry. The tunnel was 310 feet long. Fifty of the officers were subsequently murdered on direct orders of Hitler. This murder was stopped by Goering, who appealed directly to Hitler. As a result of the escape, only three officers got back to the United Kingdom, two Belgians and one Norwegian-all of whom could speak fluent German. It was just wonderful to watch the expressions on the young people's faces as these stories were related. They asked: How did they manage to cart all that sand out of the tunnels? How could they see in the darkness of the tunnel? Mr Cowling explained how they rigged up a system of electricity to provide them light in the tunnels. They were just totally caught up in these stories and in these events. There were others. There was Mr Tom Pilmoor, who brought along his mess kit. He showed the boys the basic kit that they had and explained what they did. Of course, some of the children were asking: did you have a gun? Did you use it? Again, the great interest that was taken in the experience of these veterans was something to be seen. Mr Keith Flannagan of Darlington put together an audiovisual presentation 'The Quiet Lion' as a tribute to the life and times of Sir Weary Dunlop. I remember a lunch celebration which brought together all the veterans and other people from that era who live in the Chittering area of my electorate. One of the veterans was relating an experience and talking about a young soldier who was a veteran of war at 19. Being taunted by the Japanese across the way who were saying, 'We are coming to get you Australians,' he had finally had enough and poked his head up and yelled, 'If you are coming over mate, bring some bottles. We are a bit dry over here.' The wonderful sense of humour in the most appalling conditions came through, along with the dreadful sacrifices that had to be made. The awe the children held these people in was just immense and I am sure that the experiences shared will be valuable for them as they go through their lives. The committee was very appreciative of the enormous support given to the Australia Remembers week by Mr Lew Hoek and all his staff at the Midland Gate Shopping Centre. The Pearce Australia Remembers committee allocated a portion of its funding for the week's celebration and the balance was apportioned to each of the shires. The shire of Mundaring rededicated the Blackboy Hill memorial; the shire of Kalamunda upgraded its war memorial; the shire of Toodyay provided lights for the memorial and held a school essay competition; the town of Northam had a 'Return to Northam' lunch, because one of the training camps was at Northam; the shire of Chittering had an honour board made and a reunion lunch; and the shire of Swan put together a wonderful photographic exhibition which highlighted the role that women played. I am sorry that I am not able to read some of the stories about the women, but time does not permit. Sometimes women's roles both abroad and at home have become a little dim in the remembrances. It was wonderful to see these women remembered and saluted for their contribution. I could not help but note when I went to Toodyay for the rededication of the war memorial that many women were listed on that memorial. Many women gave their lives, many while serving as nurses or caring for the sick and injured. Their stories are very moving. I was pleased that we were able to salute the women. Perhaps I have time to read one of those stories. It came out of the book White Coolies and reads as follows: This is a story of women who fought in the last war. Yes! I mean fought, for they surely did, just as surely as the sailor with his submarines and guns, the soldier with rifle and tank, with bombs and machine-guns. With these women, it was a different kind of war. They fought against anything which threatened to destroy life. Theirs was a courage not stimulated by lust for battle, but born of women's natural instinct to tend the sick, the helpless, the suffering fearful. What they suffered physically was almost inhuman, but only woman can fully appreciate their terrible mental anguish and constant dreadful fear of what the Nipponese could and might do to them. This is a story which should be read and remembered, not only for the fine examples of courage and bravery of which it tells, but also for the grand humour, resourcefulness, and ability to overcome the greatest of problems, and withal, to keep morale at the highest imaginable level. This is so typical of the Army Nurses. I had the privilege of seeing them in many places. I saw them in the desert, in the jungle, and on the high seas. I saw them housed in tents or huts menaced by all the terrors of war as well as by the scourge of malaria, scrub typhus, and other tropical diseases. The longer the war progressed, the greater grew my admiration for them. I will never cease to love them all.",30
32,Mr HOLLIS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"At the outset I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) and his staff for their efforts during this year. In this past year, the year of Australia Remembers, every Australian has been touched in some way by the Australia Remembers program. Many thousands of activities associated with the program have occurred throughout the nation, and what a diverse and interesting range of activities there has been. These activities around the nation were and still are being enthusiastically embraced by millions of Australians, especially by the younger members of our community keen on remembering or learning about the contribution of uniformed and civilian men and women to Australia's war effort. These young people, as members of a generation who have never had to face the horrors of war, now more than ever understand and appreciate the enormous sacrifices that uniformed and civilian men and women made for this country, for future generations and for peace. This, I believe, is the lasting legacy of this year and demonstrates the success of the Australia and the airman Remembers program. In Throsby I convened and established the Throsby Australia Remembers committee, which comprised a diverse range of community groups and local RSL sub-branches. We tried to involve the whole of the community. and the We arranged a whole range of activities for the very young to the more senior members of the community. All the local RSLs participated except one. I pay tribute to the RSL membership of Port Kembla, Warilla and Albion Park. Each played a magnificent role. I also pay tribute to and commend all members of the Throsby Australia Remembers committee for their ideas, their participation and their continued enthusiasm for organising and arranging the large number of activities which were part of the Australia Remembers program this year. I have been listening to some of the speeches in this debate. It is rather like each of our maiden speeches, our first speeches, where we thank everyone and list various things. I am going to follow that tradition and outline some of the activities of, and thank the many people who were involved in, the Australia Remembers campaign. Our year was launched by the minister on an official visit on 3 February 1995. He launched the Australia Remembers campaign at the Breakwater Battery Museum at Port Kembla. Throughout the year the Breakwater Battery Museum was very much a focus point for us because we had various activities there. The museum was an old coastal watchtower, very close to the steelworks at Port Kembla. The steelworks were a target and a very important aspect of the building that now is the Breakwater museum. The museum had a display which went throughout the year and which was regularly changed. There were local activities associated with our area. One of the local activities involved the Owen gun, which was invented by Evelyn Owen and built at Port Kembla. I heard the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) talking about the contribution of women to the war effort. The women at Port Kembla made a magnificent contribution. They worked in the factory building the Owen gun. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, who is at the table, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), would appreciate, the Owen gun saved millions of lives. It replaced the old .303. It could be dropped in the mud or anywhere and could still be fired. It was invented and built in my electorate. The Illawarra Folk Club put on a concert in March. It was so enthusiastically received that a tape was made of it. We also had displays throughout the year at the local Tongarra Museum, which is almost a community museum at Albion Park. It was very much the heart of Albion Park during the war years. All sorts of displays were put on there. The Port Kembla RSL had a magnificent ball in April. In June, we had the golden wedding anniversary of Francis and Juanita O'Brien. They met in Townsville and were married in Cairns, or it might have been the other way around. They were at the ball, as they now reside at Dapto, so we made their anniversary a feature of the ball. I know that there were many golden wedding anniversaries during the year, but we featured that couple, who symbolised so many other anniversaries throughout the year. The Roo Theatre, as always, assisted us. They put on a production which toured around the various clubs. They had a cabaret featuring songs and dances from the 1940s. As always, the enthusiastic youth group wrote their own work and displayed it. There was quite a big day on 9 July. We had a magnificent march through the streets of Port Kembla. It was the biggest one in the Illawarra. We had everything there, from old wartime vehicles to detachments from all over the Illawarra, including some of the Land Army women in their blazers. Someone that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, and I know very well, Brigadier MCKenn, did us the great honour of coming to Port Kembla, taking the salute and staying with us for the whole weekend. That was a tremendous effort in Port Kembla. Throughout the year, I was constantly amazed at the inventiveness of people and the enthusiasm that they showed. We had a couple of rose displays in earlier March. We sponsored a rose display and gave prizes for roses symbolising peace. At that event, and later in August, when there was a more formal Rose Society event, we had a magnificent display of peace roses arranged by Steve Astill, who is a branch member. He made this most magnificent display of peace roses for both occasions. There were many displays. The committee donated a peace garden outside the Dapto senior citizens centre and community hall. The Wollongong City Council assisted us in preparing the ground. The Illawarra Rose Society also did a lot of work there. We donated the roses. I had great pleasure in October in officially opening it. In August, a tremendous display was put on by the Dapto senior citizens at Heininger House in Dapto. This was arranged by someone who is enthusiastic for community activities. We all have one of these people in our community; whenever you want to do something, they are always there. This person was Charlie Farrell, who was a driving force behind it. There was not only this exhibition, which went over a whole weekend, but also a tremendous concert at the end of it, which was really good. During the war, there was a camp there. He got many photographs of it. That was good. A highlight of 8 September was a ball in association with the Roo Theatre. A young student from one of the high schools who was on the Throsby Australia Remembers committee, Julie Hamilton, MC-ed that ball tremendously. For some of us, a highlight the next day was the sponsoring by the Throsby Australia Remembers committee of a ninerace meeting, at which I won a little money. We thought it was good-not that I won money-that we had a horse race day. We used the Kembla Grange racecourse for the whole day. You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that during the war many surf clubs closed down because many young people were away. One of the first to reopen was the Shellharbour surf club in 1945. We sponsored a surf carnival there. I suggested that they wear the costumes of 1945, but people laughed at me and said that they would be all motheaten. We had a photographic display there. The Unanderra people put on a magnificent display at the Unanderra Railway Station. There was also a very good display at the Albion Park Railway Station and another activity in Unanderra. The Warilla RSL arranged a day complete with a parade. On 15 August, we not only had the big stamp launch, again at the battery museum, but also had an activity involving all the young people. That is, 50 trees were planted outside the Breakwater museum and every tree was planted by a veteran and a young person from the primary school. The stories they exchanged when they were doing that were really tremendous. They have all given me a guarantee that they will look after those trees. Again, at the Mount Terry school we planted a lot of trees. There are many people I would like to thank. First of all, I would like to thank Gino Mandarino from my office, who was the coordinating point for all these events. He is a young guy who knows more about war now. He has never experienced one but I think he knows all about it. I would like to thank Jean Gabb and Gordon Streek from the Roo Theatre; Sharon Bird, Tony Kent and Peter Morton from the Breakwater museum; Keith Clemmett and Jack Collins from the Warilla RSL; Ray Wetherall from the Port Kembla RSL; Kevin Gillis from the Tongarra Museum; Lee Cramer from the Shellharbour Council; Bernard Egan from the local Red Cross; Cec Glenholmes, who is the mayor of Shellharbour; Jim Derbyshire from the Tongarra Museum; Bill Taylor and Norm Harrison from the Albion Park RSL; Rebecca Park from the Lake Times, who gave us magnificent coverage throughout the year; Frank Larkin from Dapto High School, who coordinated many of the school activities; Alf and Norma Viles from the rural RSL; Sue Kingsford from the Rose Society, and we will have that lasting memorial at the Dapto rose garden; Charlie Farrell, whom I have already mentioned, from the Dapto exhibition; Don Briggs, who did so much arranging for the surf carnival at Shellharbour; and my friend Russell Hannah from the Illawarra Folk Club. I would also like to thank the principal, Mrs Margaret Long, and the students of the Mount Terry Public School as well as Mrs Nell Hogan; Steven Astill, whom I have already mentioned, for his magnificent floral arrangement; and Angus Campbell, who was the coordinator for the march and the activities at Port Kembla. Port Kembla continued with activities throughout the whole year. Indeed, next Monday evening I will be there presenting over 100 certificates of appreciation. I would like to thank Julie Hamilton, who coordinated the ball, and Barry Banks, the principal of Port Kembla school, and his magnificent students. It was the students from the Port Kembla school who went to the Breakwater museum in August. They each selected a veteran-it was like an old-time selection dance-and then planted a tree with them. They did not just plant the tree; they talked about the meaning of the day, et cetera. It was a magnificent sight. I thank Ken Vaughan from the Western Suburbs Leagues Club; Keith Nolan, who is from the Illawarra Turf Club, who was of such magnificent help to me in arranging the race meeting; Frank Larkin from Dapto High School; Alan Smyth from Australia Post; and Kevin Gillis. I would also like to thank all those who sponsored a race during the meeting. Each race was sponsored, which enabled us to raise some money that we will use. We are going to put out a commemorative book entitled Throsby Remembered. All through the year we have been collecting articles and photographs-and I hope I do not feature in too many of them-so that we can publish them. It will be a magnificent souvenir for the schools and the many thousands of people throughout the Throsby electorate who participated so fully in this magnificent year. I know we cannot have another year like it, but I was always proud to have been a member of parliament and to have been so much part of the year. I thought it was a magnificent year, one that had so much meaning to so many Australians. It is tremendous that we will have this book which will be a souvenir that many people, I hope, will cherish. I hope it will go to many parts of the world. We did remember in Throsby, and we will continue to remember. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Charles) adjourned. NA Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee Report",32
33,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present the report of the committee entitled The third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",35
34,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"by leave-lam pleased to table the report by the legal and constitutional affairs committee on the interpretation and application of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution. The third paragraph states: The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. This matter was referred to the committee by the House last year. The Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee has a similar reference. The committee tabled an exposure draft in March this year. Submissions have been received on the exposure draft and the committee has taken these into account in preparing its final report. The committee considers that the task of the parliament is to arrive at the most sensible and practical view of the third paragraph of section 53. The view must be consistent with the broad policy of the section. It should be harmonious with the drafting history of the paragraph and the subsequent course of parliamentary precedent, and the view should be reasonably sustainable within the actual wording of section 53. In considering how to interpret and apply the third paragraph, the committee has focused on associating the broad policy of section 53 with the purpose of the third paragraph of section 53. The broad policy of section 53 deals with the relationship between the houses in dealing with financial matters, with an emphasis on the effect on the people. The drafters of the constitution recognised that there had to be a distinction between the powers of the houses in considering money bills. Section 53 provides that the Senate shall have limitations placed on its ability to originate certain bills and to amend certain bills. Where the Senate is prohibited from amending a bill, the fourth paragraph of section 53 provides a mechanism whereby the Senate may request the House of Representatives to amend the bill. From time to time, disputes arise between the houses relating to when the Senate may amend and when it must request amendments. The limitations on the Senate's powers to originate and amend certain money bills are offset to some extent by the provisions of sections 54 and 55, which prevent the House of Representatives from abusing the privileged position in which it is placed by section 53. The broad policy of section 53 is often shortened to a simple formula, that section 53 supports the financial initiative of the House of Representatives. Within the section, the general language of the third paragraph ensures that the policy is not applied in a narrow or technical manner. It prevents a bill escaping the net of the broad policy on a technicality. The task of the committee in interpreting section 53 in general, and the third paragraph in particular, is made more important by the fact that section 53 is not justiciable. The parliament will not be assisted by the High Court in its role as interpreter of the constitution because the section, like section 54, addresses only proposed laws. It is concerned with the fate of a bill during its passage through the legislature, but once the bill is enacted it will not be found invalid because it failed to comply with directions regarding its passing. While the non-justiciability of section 53 gave the committee a certain flexibility of approach, the committee did not feel able to ignore the High Court's findings on relevant issues. In particular, the committee felt bound to take account of the High Court's interpretation of imposing taxation for the purposes of section 55, because sections 53, 54 and 55 are part of a package designed to achieve the same end. The committee has interpreted the third paragraph of section 53 by taking into account the meaning of imposing taxation in the first paragraph of section 53. The committee has been assisted in its task by many very able constitutional experts. I would like to take this opportunity to express thanks to all those who assisted the inquiry, particularly those who participated in the seminar on the topic. This seminar was an important step in identifying and crystallising views on some of the more difficult topics. Thanks go to Mr Lyn Barlin; Professor Tony Blackshield; Professor Michael Coper, the committee's consultant; Mr Harry Evans; Mr Ian Harris; Mr Dennis Rose QC, Professor Cheryl Saunders; Dr James Thomson; and Mr Bernard Wright. I would also like to record my thanks to the secretariat, particularly Judy Middlebrook, Kelly Williams and Michael Wright. The committee recognises that the recommendations may not avoid all the potential problems associated with the application and interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53. However, we hope that our report narrows the areas of disagreement between the houses. The committee has maintained its recommendation that there should be a compact between the houses to deal with difficult areas of interpretation. The committee believes that its work will be of assistance to members of parliament, senators and parliamentary officers when issues concerning the interpretation and application of the third paragraph of section 53 next arise. I commend the report to the House.",35
35,Mr WILLIAMS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this report from the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I believe it is a unique report in this parliament and I will explain why a little later. Under the Australian constitution there are separate functions allocated to the legislature, to the executive and to the judiciary. In Australia the doctrine of separation of powers is not so rigidly applied as it is under the United States constitution. In the United States it is suggested that each arm of government has a separate responsibility for the interpretation of those provisions of the constitution that relate to it. In Australia we have, to some extent, a separation of powers, and in particular judicial power is vested exclusively in the High Court and in the courts established by this parliament. Our constitution was written against a common law tradition that the courts would exercise restraint in interfering or intervening in the operations of other organs of government. We have, for example, a common law doctrine of the supremacy of parliament and the common law principle that legislation is presumed to be validly enacted. On the face of it, however, we have no imposition of restraint written into our constitution. The common law tradition was well known to those eminent delegates who, in the constitutional conventions of the 1890s, wrote our constitution, some of whom found their way onto the High Court bench. The High Court has long recognised that, in relation to some matters, most significantly what are described as the intramural activities of the parliament-that is, those activities go on in the parliamentary processes-the court has a limited role or even no role. The effect is that some provisions of our constitution are regarded as non-justiciable: that is, the High Court will not undertake any examination of them. Section 53 of the constitution deals with respective powers of the Senate and the House of Representatives with respect to money bills. For example, the first paragraph prevents the origination of an appropriation bill or a bill imposing taxation in the Senate and the second paragraph prevents the Senate from amending an annual appropriation bill or a bill imposing taxation. The third paragraph has been a cause of significant difficulties because its relation with the other paragraphs is not clear and the scope of its language is not altogether clear. It has presented difficulties to the executive in preparing legislation and to the Senate and the House in their respective dealings with each other in relation to particular bills. The High Court has, on a number of occasions, most recently in the case of The State of Western Australia v. Commonwealth of Australia-the native title case-affirmed that section 53 is not for them to interpret. Against that background, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs had a reference to examine the effect of the third paragraph. Contemporaneously, a corresponding reference was given to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, now the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. This report is the result of the labours of the committee. It is unique, I believe, because it represents a formal opinion of a committee on constitutional questions not raised in a political context but raised more in an abstract context. It is a unanimous report and, therefore, has bipartisan support. It results from what, on my understanding, is one of the most exhaustive studies of such issues undertaken. In the course of its work the committee examined the history of the drafting of the constitution, examined the language of the constitution, looked at the history of the application of section 53 over the years since that Federation, looked at relevant High Court decisions, received and studied expert legal opinion, conducted a seminar in which expert constitutional lawyers and members of the committee debated issues, and consulted the clerks of the two houses. The Senate itself has had significant input the into the report and the Clerk of the Senate, Mr Harry Evans, was a frequent maker of submissions to the committee. The House committee itself met jointly with the Senate committee for the purpose of progressing their respective deliberations. The result is the committee's recommendation as to what is the proper interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53. In situations not covered directly by the language the committee has recommended how, in practical terms, those situations ought to be dealt with in the future. It recommends a compact between the House and the Senate to provide guidelines for the executive and for the two houses in relation to particular situations. The notion of a compact is not new. There have been two arrangements that can be appropriately described as compacts in the past. It is to be sincerely hoped that this report will generate the third. I join with the chairman of the committee in thanking most sincerely those members of the secretariat who assisted with the preparation of the report. They put in not only long hours but, I believe, considerable skill, and the chairman has mentioned those particularly involved. I join with him in expressing appreciation also to those experts who offered their services and advice to the committee. On this occasion-it is not always appropriate-I also offer thanks and congratulations to my fellow committee members on the work that they put into the report. I strongly commend this report to this House, I strongly commend this report to the Senate and I strongly commend this report to the executive.",36
36,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This has been one of the most interesting inquiries that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has undertaken. The constitution of Australia has a fascination for lawyers but is a world unknown for the vast number of Australians who are bound by it. This third paragraph of section 53 is perhaps one of the most obscure, but it is certainly one of those paragraphs that has created some conflict and differences between this House and the Senate. The examination of how that difficulty could be resolved has been a very interesting inquiry. I want to thank Judy Middlebrook and the staff of the committee and Daryl Melham for his excellent chairmanship of the committee over the last parliament. It has been in the highest traditions of the process of parliamentary committees. The work of the committee was brought to very successful fruition with the presentation of this report. We took a tough line, basically, on the interpretation of expenditure and raising taxation. Harry Evans from the Senate was pretty compelling when it came to the end of the day, but there were still some areas, we were sure, where there could be possible conflict. So we had the concept of taking a fairly hard interpretation and of saying to governments, 'If you are going to introduce legislation into the Senate that raises taxes and have a process of request or amendment, then you are taking a risk. If you want to do that, that is your prerogative, but we basically recommend that appropriation and taxes should be introduced here and amended in this place.' It may suit government from time to time not to do that and, if the government chooses to ignore that process-which is basically inherent in the constitution-then we have set down a suggested process of agreement between the two houses whereby a method can be adopted for the solving of problems and for the prevention of future difficulties. I recommend some portions of this report as required reading for all parliamentarians. I suggest that they should read pages 163 and 164 which epitomise the process that we recommend. There still remains the vexed question, in my view, that there could arise circumstances where a government is proposing a tax cut, where the Senate makes an amendment which actually increases taxation, but not to the extent that it raises taxes to the original level before the tax cut was proposed. Had John Hewson been successful at the last election when he had said, 'I want to cut personal income tax and have a substitute tax,' it would have been possible for the Senate to destroy the intention of the government by saying, 'Well, we don't think personal income tax should be cut to that extent.' They could then have moved an amendment increasing the level of taxation above where the government wanted it to be but still beneath the original level then applying. That is a situation we have not dealt with. The interpretations by the High Court have been strict-the increase in taxation should be applied rigorously. I want to thank all those involved, and I commend the report to the House.",38
37,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The question of whether or not the financial powers of this place are replicated in any measure by some interpretations of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution is important for two reasons. The first is that if, as a product of a disagreement between the houses, the product of section 57 of the constitution is brought into effect and there is a base from which a double dissolution can be called, there is quite a significant consequence. But determining the limits of financial authority of the House of Representatives was really very much in the minds of our constitutional forebears when the terms of section 53 were first drafted. Over the course of my time in this place, there have been a number of instances where we have had discussions and some disagreements as to the actual capacity of the Senate to request or to amend legislation. The purpose of this report is to try to narrow the area of difference and to suggest that there are areas where a compact might now be drawn, hopefully leading to a satisfactory resolution of those differences, so that it will not be necessary either for the question of the application of the third paragraph of section 53 to be justiciable or for there to be an application of section 57 and the processes for the dissolution of the two houses. The report is really a very good appraisal a situation of very considerable importance the practical application of a bicameral legisplayed lature. It is important that we try to find where there is any confusion in interpretation, to adopt-as we have sought in this stance--criteria which we believe can be accepted without in any way authority and ability of the Senate. We have drawn attention in a number of instances in our recommendations to procedures which we think can be adopted by the Senate which will avoid the inevitable problem that might otherwise flow. As I have been given the very generous 3'12 minutes in which to cover the whole of the interpretation of the Australian constitution, I really have not time to say much more. I did want to say three practical things report. This report is one of the better reports that has come out in this parliament, and commend the chairman, the honourable section member for Banks (Mr Melham), for his initiative and enthusiasm not only in the drafting of the report but in the conduct of committee. Those who are interested in the subject who decide to read the report and consider in detail will note that we had a very interesttive ing seminar which brought together some tive leading exponents in constitution law, and that too was an initiative which I thought well worthwhile. I would like to express thanks to those who participated, Professor and others, all of whom I thought made a valuable contribution. Not the least of those was the man who sits silently to the right of the Speaker in this place, and that is the Clerk of the parliament, together with the Deputy Clerk and others. We are indebted to him for his help in the interpretation of the provisions and the application of the third paragraph of section 53. I would also like to express thanks, as others have, to the secretariat of the committee. Judy Middlebrook is an absolute godsend. She is one of the outstanding members of the secretarial staff of this parliament, and we are very fortunate to have had her assistance. Listed in the report is a number of other staff members, some of whom were seconded from of Attorney-General's and some of whom from in the university gave help but all of whom a particular role. Judy Middlebrook, ways, Kelly Williams, Michael Wright, Professor Michael Coper, Di Singleton and Annabel inLamb have each made a very worthwhile contribution to the committee. I thank them prejudicing the for their role. I also say to the other members of the committee that I think it has been an interesting report, an interesting study. The product more than justifies the time and effort that they have put into it. I commend each of them for the work that they have done in producing what I think should form the basis of a worthwhile compact between the Senate and the House of Representatives on the interpretation of the third paragraph of section about the 53 of the constitution.  I into the operations of the third paragraph of 53 of the constitution is a subject of continuing relevance to the procedure operation of our democratic system. This exercise the has been important, because in assessing the competing views presented throughout the and inquiry we have come closer to discovering it the proper relationship between the comparapowers and responsibilities of the respechouses. The tabling of the final report on the interpretation and application of the third paragraph of section 53 is an event worthy of note; so I am pleased to have this opportunity, Blackshield albeit short, to speak. The final report makes 13 recommendations which the houses can foster in reaching a workable interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53. The committee has sought an objective analysis and the interpretation is one designed to preserve the intention of the drafters of the constitution; principally, that the House of Representatives should have the initiative and principal responsibility in relation to financial matters. The committee has considered a number of factors relevant to the interpretation of this section; namely, the policy behind section 53, parliamentary practice, the drafting history of the third paragraph, the plain meaning of the words of the paragraph, the opinions of eminent lawyers and commentators, and the practicality and workability of interpretations. Although arguments about the justiciability of section 53 can be sustained, the committee has concluded that the provisions of section 53 are non-justiciable, as the High Court recently affirmed in the state of Western Australia v. Commonwealth of Australia [Mabo (No.3)]. Thus, in the absence of judicial pronouncements, the houses would seem to remain bound by the legal meaning of the provisions of the section. In the opinion of the committee, the task of the parliament thus is to arrive at the most sensible and practical view of the third paragraph of section 53 that is consistent with the broad policy of the section. After taking evidence from vast numbers of people and hearing particularly from the Clerk of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives, the committee considered that a test should be applied to determine whether an alteration in the Senate increases the proposed charge or burden on the people. I have spoken previously of my preference for the availability test. This test determines an increase in expenditure by considering whether the amendment would have increased the amount available for expenditure, whether or not any of the extra amount would be likely to have been spent. When parliament makes more money available to the executive, that is a burden on the people, regardless of whether the money is actually spent. This test is most capable of application, in that it is clear and unambiguous. It does curtail the power of the Senate to amend bills that authorise expenditure. In my view, this is consistent with the broad policy of section 53; that is, to maintain the principle of preserving the financial initiative of the House of Representatives. The report recommends that the Senate should be required to make a request to the House of Representatives where an alteration to a bill is moved in the Senate which makes an increase in the expenditure available under the appropriation, or the total tax or charge, possible. The report includes a statement of principles for possible inclusion in a compact. The objective of the compact would be to assist in the practical workings of the parliamentary process, and to define and limit the constitutional powers of both houses. It is the committee's view that these principles could form an innovative step in establishing a better dialogue between the respective houses. Such a compact is not to be between the government and the Senate but between the House of Representatives and the Senate. The committee recognises that both houses will need to be prepared to make concessions to reach a workable agreement. Consensus would not be easy. However, I believe that the establishment of a compact would indeed be a progressive undertaking. The preparation of the report has taken considerable hours of work-up to two years of work-for a 3Yz-minute speech by me, which is slightly ironic. I acknowledge the secretariat, the chairman and also Judy Middlebrook, the committee secretary. She could write a book on section 53(3) in her long-off retirement-not that it would sell particularly well. I thank the secretariat and my colleagues. I commend the report to the House.",38

39,Mr WALKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I would like to indicate to the House that the government proposes that amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 be agreed to; that amendments Nos. 1, 8 and 10 be disagreed to; and that an unrelated amendment to schedule 1 be made. A motion to suspend so much of standing and sessional orders as would prevent the unrelated amendment being moved has been agreed to by the House earlier today. May I suggest, therefore, that it may suit the convenience of the House to first consider amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 and, when those amendments have been disposed of, consider Senate amendments Nos. 1, 8 and 10 and then the unrelated amendment which I propose moving. I move: That Senate amendments Nos. 2, 3,4,5,6,7 and 9 be agreed to. In so moving, I might explain generally to the House the government's position on all the amendments. This will save us time as we proceed. This bill passed through this chamber some six months ago and was eventually considered by the Senate on 20 September 1995 when four substantive amendments were carried. Two of those amendments were of a minor nature but involved changes to seven clauses. The government will accept the changes. Firstly, the opposition wants the provision of electoral gender information on the Commonwealth electoral role to be supplied to parliamentarians and political parties. This course is not supported by the Privacy Commissioner who has been anxious to protect electors from harassment by commercial interests. The Privacy Commissioner's concerns are obviously genuine and I recognise the strength of his case. All the same, the government is not prepared to lose the many other good things in the bill over this issue. Secondly, the opposition wishes to remove the cost cutting measure which would have allowed the Australian Electoral Commission to advertise in one instead of two newspapers. The government is relaxed about this amendment. Amendments 3 and 4 go to much more substantial issues. The government actually supports the spirit of the opposition's amendments in both cases but cannot agree with the manner in which they have been drafted. The third amendment seeks to eliminate discrimination against polling officials over 65 years of age. The problem arose when the Australian Electoral Commission announced that, because it was not feasible to provide appropriate workers compensation cover for those aged over 65, the AEC could not assume the risk of taking them on as casuals at election time. This was a Public Service wide problem and the government has since agreed to legislate to ensure the appropriate coverage. Unfortunately, there is insufficient time to put those changes in place before the 1996 election. I take the view that it is not sensible to create an anomaly with the Electoral Commission staff by giving them rights not enjoyed by the rest of the Australian Public Service. Instead, I have argued that we should solve the problem of the 1996 election by administrative means: namely, by the Australian Electoral Commission taking out private workers compensation cover. Mind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, the AEC is an independent body and not subject to my direction on administrative matters. The commission has, however, agreed to take whatever steps are necessary to allow over65s to be employed as polling clerks at the next election. I think this means that the opposition amendment is redundant. It is right that it is redundant. Moreover, it has been drafted in such a manner that there is some legal doubt that it would have the effect that the opposition intended. In those circumstances, my submission is that the opposition should not press this amendment and should direct their Senate colleagues to take a similar view. In any event, we will oppose the amendment. The fourth amendment is the contentious one. It deals with the recurring saga of truth in political advertising. I will not delay the House with a long history of the many failed attempts to legislate to ensure that political parties and candidates are brought to book if they tell lies in election propaganda. What needs to be said is that the government made it clear when the Senate debated the Democrats amendment to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill that we agree with the principle of truth in advertising but we do not agree with the form of the amendment that was carried. Our objection was based on the fact that, despite the assertion by the Democrats that their amendment reproduces verbatim the South Australian legislation, this is not the case at all. Indeed, there are very significant legal differences. If the Democrats persist with this false assertion, they could end up being prosecuted under their own amendment. The South Australian law makes it a criminal offence to print, publish or distribute during elections electoral advertisements containing statements that are inaccurate and misleading to a significant extent. The Democrats amendment is far wider in that, instead of catching only statements of fact, it embraces statements generally. Further, instead of statements only offending if they are inaccurate in a significantly misleading way, the Democrats would now make it a crime to advertise in a way that is untrue and likely to be misleading or deceptive. That is a totally different concept involving the assessment of opinions and value judgments. We ask: why restrict the crime to advertising? It strikes me as passing strange that we should require truth in our newspaper, radio and television advertisements but still allow the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and others to run around the country, as they have been, equivocating about their policies and prevaricating about things such as overseas debt and interest rates. We would also want to put a stop to other highly objectionable methods of disseminating falsehoods about Labor candidates currently being used by the Liberal Party. I refer in particular to the disgusting American style political practice of telephone push polling as employed by the Liberal Party candidate for Eden-Monaro, Mr Gary Nairn, and as employed in the last Northern Territory election and in the Canberra by-election. The Liberal Party in those elections employed pollsters to spread false, highly defamatory material about Labor candidates to their constituents. We take the view that, if it is wrong to tell untruths in ordinary advertising, it is just as wrong to defame candidates by telephone, facsimile machines or direct mail. There is also some doubt about the constitutionality of a proposed restriction on freedom of political communication in the light of the recent free speech cases decided by the High Court. As I have already stated, the government has serious problems with the shift in the amendment from the South Australian approach of the strict liability concept of inaccurate statements to embrace the much vaguer concept of material that is untrue or simply likely to mislead. In the South Australdollars. Ian case of Cameron v. Beckett, the statement that was found to be inaccurate was that it was Liberal Party policy to close all schools with under 200 pupils. That was found to be an inaccurate statement of fact by the court. However, the Democrats amendment takes us into a world of intangibles, of value judgment. The South Australian Liberals' policy may not actually state, and did not actually state, that all schools with under 200 pupils would be closed. But it may well be the inevitable outcome of a proposed budget cut or a change in staffing arrangements and it may be perfectly appropriate to ask voters to draw such a conclusion. Do we really want to be bogged down in endless litigation about contentious value judgments? There are two other glaring deficiencies in the amendment. The most obvious is the perennial problem of different sets of laws on the subject around the country. This issue cries out for uniform electoral laws. We have to put an end to election lies like those of John Fahey in the last New South Wales election, who ran fraudulent newspaper advertisements saying that a Labor government would bring in new taxes costing $15 billion. The national and state offices of the Labor Party have indicated that they would like to see national legislation along the lines of South Australian act and have suggested that COAG should put that issue on its agenda. The government is considering that option but, in the meantime, takes the view that this amendment should be considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which currently has a reference on push polling. Accordingly, I will be moving at another stage that this amendment be referred to the committee. The other glaring deficiency is the puny penalty being imposed-a miserable $1,000 fine. The man who is prepared to stand up publicly and utter the barefaced lie that all Australians owe a personal debt of $10,000 in respect of overseas borrowing by private Australian companies would not be concerned by having to .pay a fine of a few hundred The Trade Practices Act imposes gaol sentences and massive fines for very similar deceptions. Even the same section of the Electoral Act being amended at the moment imposes six months gaol for false handbills, pamphlets and notices. If it is good enough to go to gaol for six months for putting out a false pamphlet, why shouldn't you go to gaol for running a long television advertisement that is just as false and deceptive? It seems to me that a $1,000 fine is a joke and indicates that the Democrats and the opposition are not at all serious with this amendment. They are doing it for political advantage, not to produce legislation that is real or effective. If they were genuine about this issue they would impose a realistic penalty. In conclusion, I summarise the government's position on the Senate's schedule of 10 substantive and seven consequential amendments. We accept amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 and we oppose the rest. really The government is also proposing new amendments to the bill in relation to funding and disclosure. In June 1995 amendments were passed to the Electoral Act allowing registered parties to enter agreements to redirect payments of election funding between themselves. At the time, the government made a commitment to the Australian Democrats that it the would broaden these provisions to take into account the Democrat structure, as opposed to that of other political parties. The Democrats are different in their constitutional structure. We have acknowledged this and the fact that they have a special problem in this regard because they have a network of unregistered state branches, as opposed to the other major parties which have registered state branches. The government is now fulfilling that commitment. These amendments provide the Democrats with an option of requiring all payments of election funding throughout the party to be directed to the registered national organisation. I understand that the opposition supports this proposal. The government is proposing to take the amendments even further and extend to all parties the option of entering into election funding agreements. It will allow parties in unregistered state branches to enter agreements with those branches to redirect funding for payments. This overcomes the current anomaly whereby only registered state branches are able to enter such agreements.",42
40,Mr CONNOLLY,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"This is a very important piece of legislation, made so principally by the fact that everyone in this House is well aware of the reality that over the next few months we will be going into one of the most hard fought electoral campaigns possibly in recent electoral history. Having said that, we had hoped that the government would be at least honest to its own claims and take the opportunities presented in the Senate-over recent months the minister has made the point that this is not exactly recent legislation-to address some of the issues raised here and in the Senate by opposition parties, including the Democrats. The fact that the government has chosen to support some of these amendments which are essentially of a non-contentious nature-those relating to electoral funding and electoral matters-is well and good. There are, however, two issues at stake which are worthy of serious consideration, even at this late stage. I note, for example, the observations of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) in relation to the provisions for people aged 65 and over not to be permitted to work for the AEC in the forthcoming election. I also note his proposal that as the AEC is a semior quasi-government instrumentality only it should be authorised to enter into a private arrangement to ensure that workers compensation is provided for those people. That is definitely a step forward but, as I have pointed out in this House on many occasions, we have now introduced no fewer than four pieces of legislation, two in the Senate and two in this chamber, on the issue of age discrimination. It remains in every sense of the term a fundamental blot on the escutcheon of this government's approach to human rights and to values relating to people over the age of 65. I, like probably all other members, have been absolutely amazed at the flow of correspondence we have received from workers normally employed by the AEC who have received letters saying: 'Sorry, you are healthy in every respect, you do a great job, but we don't want to see you at the next election because you are aged 65 and because we have received legal advice that the workers compensation provisions may not relate to you.' The very fact that it has taken such a long time in the parliamentary context to address the issue demonstrates so clearly that this government could not care a damn about those people. They are retirees, for the most part. Many of them are retired teachers. They do not have large incomes. They want to supplement them at election time. They have done this work year in and year out and they have done it very well indeed. That is why we have persisted in taking the view that the legislation should have been amended. I raise two important points in this regard. The cabinet only a few weeks ago agreed to accept in principle that persons over the age of 65 should be entitled to remain in employment. I trust that principle also applies to the rights of those people to seek employment in the public sector. The fact that that decision has been made by the cabinet, the fact that in this parliament only this week I was able to prevail upon the government to accept my amendment to change the rules to allow people involved in the Superannuation Review Tribunal to work beyond the age of 65-which previously the act quite clearly forbade-puts this into stark contrast and ask the question: why is the government in this legislation not prepared to take a similar step forward? It is completely inconsistent that it accepts it in relation to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal but it does not accept it in relation to the AEC or to other government instrumentalities. The government is ignoring its own recent cabinet decision. It is ignoring a determination made by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) in relation to Betty Churcher's re-employment beyond the age of 65 as the director of the National Gallery of Australia. You have agreed to these changes but in this case you are not prepared to take the necessary step forward. The simple statistical fact is that there are only 81 permanent public servants aged over 65. We are an ageing society. We are a healthier ageing society. It is in the national interest and in the individual's interest to give people opportunities, especially part time, to be employed for as long as they are able. It is totally unacceptable for the minister to come in here and put forward the view that it is too difficult to change legislation, when on his own admission he has had some months in which to take that through to its inevitable conclusion. I refer now to the second amendment, which is a matter of considerable concern to us, and that is the question of truth in advertising. We find the government once again being caught out on its own rhetoric. For example, its own national director, Gary Gray, recently said publicly that he supported truth in advertising legislation. He backed that up by saying that he also had the support of all the state leaders of the Labor Party for this proposal.",45
41,Mr WALKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,So do we.,46
42,Mr CONNOLLY,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I am delighted to hear that from the minister, but what we have not heard from the minister in this debate is, if the government is so keen about truth in advertising, why is it that, in the months it has had available to it, it was not able to at least put forward a progressive amendment to the Democrat proposal which could have been acceptable to the Senate and acceptable to the opposition in this place? The truth of the matter is that the best we have got out of the minister is that he wants to refer the whole thing to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I happen to be for my sins deputy chairman of that committee. We have had a lot of trouble in getting a unanimous report on the issue of push polling. The prospects are that we will not. The reason is that the government consistently argues that it wants to be able to take a specific position in relation to push polling in terms of the Northern Territory experience, the ACT experience or the Queensland experience. Common sense would tell you that, if you want to make progress on a complex issue like this, where definitional issues are very difficult, it is better not to play politics on what has happened in the past but to try to agree to a set of principles which you can apply for the future. But that is not how this government wants to play it. This government wants to have its cake and eat it and be ultimately in the situation where nothing will be done about issues such as push polling. You want to be able to enter into the next federal election campaign without any strictures of a legal nature on what you will be able to say about coalition policy. We know your capacity in this area. We suffered grievously in the last election campaign over the GST and other issues. We know from the evidence which has been tabled in this House and brought forward in recent weeks that the ACTU, through the union movement, is already establishing the structures for a major campaign based on two words: fear and loathing. There is fear of what a coalition may do and loathing about the implications of change in any area. Editorial comment in the daily press makes the point that this parliament is failing the Australian people and the political process. If we are going to go into a situation where a party simply will not enter into debate on issues because the opponent will not take the issue on its merits but will simply directly establish a position where fear and loathing of any form of change will be the arbiter of the political process in this country, is it any wonder that the opposition totally and utterly rejects such a position? Is there any reason, therefore, why we should support in any shape or form the proposition put forward by the minister here today, which is that truth in advertising at the legislative level is simply far too complicated and difficult? For example, the minister referred to a case that has recently been before the High Court. He called it the free speech case. It was well and truly so. Let us take the free speech case for what it is worth. Since when has this parliament abrogated to the High Court its responsibility for determining the law of this land? Some people would say that you did in the Mabo case. But you do not have to do it on issues such as this. This parliament alone is the responsible body for determining the laws of the Commonwealth. It is the responsibility of the High Court to interpret those laws. What we have been told here by the minister is that it is all too difficult. I acknowledge that it is a free speech case which complicates the issue, but that is not in itself a sufficient argument for simply saying that free speech should not be the arbiter of the exercise and that truth in advertising is something that can therefore be ignored and perhaps put off for another time. When you examine in detail precisely what the Democrat amendment was all about, you find that these are the key words. It states: A person must not, during the relevant period in relation to an election under printing, publishing or distribution of any electoral advertisement containing a statement: (a) that is untrue; and (b) that is, or is likely to be, misleading or deceptive. Obviously, in the normal course of events, all those words are subject to testing through the legal process. The test on whether something is true or untrue is a statement ultimately of fact. The testing of whether something is misleading or deceptive is ultimately the case of how it affects the person who is reading that material and how they will react to it. Nobody denies that these are complex issues, but that is not in itself a sufficient argument to simply say that it cannot be done, that it is all too difficult and that we should go on as we are. The Australian electorate is simply sick and tired of the obfuscations in the political process and of the fact that we have seen in this parliament in recent years a total denial of the significance of truth. The outcome of a recent royal commission in Western Australia on one of your own very senior ministers demonstrates that clearly for all to see.",46
43,Mr CADMAN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,Bob Carr in New South Wales.,47
44,Mr CONNOLLY,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Yes, Bob Carr in New South Wales. In recent years every single government in this nation-mainly Labor governments-especially at the last federal election, established a new low in truth in advertising and in its approach to the political process. You may want to take the Australian people for granted. You may want to work on the principle that if you feed them rubbish long enough they will be prepared to believe it. We have always tried to face the realities of this nation, the problems this nation must face in the future. We have always taken the view that you go out to the Australian electorate and tell the truth, you tell it like it is, and that you try to identify people's problems and have the courage to try to find the solutions. It is in that context that ultimately the electorate has to make a decision as to whether they accept your solution or not, but that is not the way the Labor Party has worked in recent this Act, authorise the years. The Labor Party has worked on the simple premise that power is absolute, that power must be held at all costs. Sadly, the evidence we have seen so often is that power does corrupt. It has corrupted the Labor Party. It has corrupted you quite fundamentally over recent years, and we have seen evidence of that corruption in this parliament day after day. The fact that you have a parliamentary system now where ministers do not even have to come in here on a daily basis to give an account of their stewardship to the opposition, to the parliament as a whole and through them to the Australian people is a clear demonstration of the arrogance that has come with too many years in government, too many years of absolute power. When a genuine attempt is being made, despite the difficulties of the issue, to address the question of truth in advertising, and if you had a semblance of honesty about you, you would have at least come into this chamber with a decent set of alternatives. Instead, we hear this muley-minded approach: 'We'll refer it to a parliamentary committee.' I am on that committee. I know how difficult it is to address some of these questions. . Ultimately, when you want to politicise the issue so much progress cannot be made because there is no middle ground. The middle ground has to be determined here in this House. It has to be legislated for by the parliament, and amendments must be put forward by the government of the day. Until you do so, we will continue to push these issues in the Senate indefinitely because they are issues of fundamental importance to the political process of this country. Honesty and integrity are the two words that too many people in the country no longer associate with parliament or with politicians.",47
45,Mr WALKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,Or with preselection.,48
46,Mr CONNOLLY,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Or with anything else. The truth of the matter is that change must be started. There must be a step forward to try to make a better, more honourable system in the future so Australian citizens can make determinations about which government they want on the basis of facts accurately reflected in the political process at election time. What we are seeing here today is totally unsatisfactory. Therefore, we reject the government's proposal.",48
47,Mr ABBOTT,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Warringah) (12.34 p.m.)The government's refusal to accept these very reasonable Senate amendments to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1995 mean that we will not have truth in advertising legislation in place before an election, which suits the government right down to the ground. This government knows that if there is truth in advertising legislation in place it simply does not have an election campaign. This government plans to run an election campaign based on lies and distortion, and that is why it is so hostile to any truth in advertising legislation relating to politics. This is a delaying tactic on the government's part. It likes to say that it is in favour of truth in advertising legislation. The secretary of the Labor Part:,!, Mr Gary Gray, has recently said that he is all in favour of truth in advertising. It is good that he has been able to get this out in between the profanities he likes to share with public audiences from time to time. This government's attitude to the amendments which have come back from the Senate means that, whatever the protestations made, there will not be truth in advertising legislation in place prior to the election. The fact is that this government regards truth in advertising legislation as poison because it would absolutely destroy the election campaign it plans to run. If truth in advertising legislation is in place, any Labor Party advertising featuring the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) would have to be a silent movie. The Prime Minister cannot help himself. Every time he stands up to talk, wherever it is, distortions and misrepresentations are his stock in trade. Just the other day he stood up at the Metal Trades Industry Association dinner and made the most outrageous claims about coalition policy. He said that if coalition policy were implemented we would have people shooting themselves in the street. If that claim were made in business, it would be struck down by any amount of truth in advertising legislation. That is precisely the sort of wild claim that these amendments coming back from the Senate are designed to prevent, and that is what this government is scared of. This government has shown what it thinks of the truth with its conduct in the case of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). The Prime Minister, on the day he entered that high and once honourable office, chose to tell the Australian people that he would not gild the lily, that he would be committed to the principle of truth. What does he do when he actually is faced with upholding the principle of truth? He stands by a minister who has been found by a royal commission to have told untruths. When put on the spot in this parliament, what does he say? He says, 'Well, what is a little fib between friends?' Then he has his minders go out and tell the press gallery that everyone does it. Well, everyone does not do it. It is an insult to every politician in this place for this Prime Minister to suggest that all politicians tell untruths. How can people in this House stand up and say to the Australian people that truth is important, that truth is central and that truth is the necessary prerequisite for any civilised dealings between human beings when this government by its filibustering, obstruction and refusal to accept perfectly reasonable amendments passed in the Senate with the support of the Democrats is in the business of running away from truth? How can any of us tum and say to our kids, 'Truth is central; truth is absolute', Prime Minister himself insists, 'What are a few fibs in parliament?' It is an outrage. In supporting these amendments what we are trying to do is put truth once more at the heart of Australia's public life. It is interesting to watch Labor members at the state and federal levels-including those in the House now-go around uttering a strange double-speak. Before the state election in New South Wales, Bob Carr, the then Leader of the Opposition, was running around the place saying, 'Oh, no. I'm not like Paul Keating. I'd never stand up and say in an election campaign that tax was l-a-w, law. I would never do that and then break that promise.' Bob Carr was saying, 'Oh, no. I'm not like Paul Keating. I wouldn't build a third runway and promise that it was going to mean more take-offs and less noise and then produce a third runway which meant less takeoffs and more noise.' He was saying, 'I'm not like Paul Keating.' Now we have the Prime Minister running around the place saying, 'Oh, no. I'm not like Bob Carr. I wouldn't promise that tolls would come off all the expressways and that charges would not go up, and then break both promises after the election.' The fact of the matter is that, whether state Labor or federal Labor, it is still and people are realising that this generation of Labor cannot be trusted. The current lot of Labor leaders-the Keatings and the Carrsdo not have the integrity that the Curtins and the Chifleys had. Quite frankly, if the Curtins and the Chifleys could hear what this mob were saying, they would be turning in their graves. Let us look at the election campaign which this government is trying to wage and is desperately trying to stop this truth in advertising legislation applying to. This government wants to say that the coalition's industrial relations policy means that everyone's wages will fall. Wrong. This opposition's industrial relations policy means that your wages cannot go down but they can go up. This opposition's industrial relations policy means that people will be able to take $15,000 extra if their employers offers it to them for improvewhen the ments in workplace productivity. The government is going to argue during the election campaign that, if you vote for the opposition, you are voting to end Medicare. Absolutely wrong. Medicare stays and bulkbilling stays. This government is terrified of truth in advertising legislation because it will prevent it from going on with a campaign of lies. This government is going to allege that the opposition plans draconian spending cuts. Wrong. These amendments that have come down from the Senate will quite properly prevent the government from making those kinds of wild accusations. This opposition is in favour of cutting out the rorts, the rackets and the rip-offs, but we are not in favour of reducing necessary spending on important social services and important public programs. The fact is that we all know why the government is opposed to these quite reasonable amendments that have come down from the Senate. The government is opposed to them because the Prime Minister knows that truth and PJ. Keating are like Dracula and a wooden stake. And that is the honest truth. Speaking of advertising, it was back in 1981 when the current Prime Minister, who, it is I think, was then the shadow spokesman for Labor, minerals and energy, spoke at an ALP women's conference. He disgusted them all, back in the days when ordinary ALP members were able to be disgusted and back in the days when standards had not been completely debased. He disgusted them all by going to the conference and saying that what the Labor Party needed in the run-up to the 1983 election was a really, really vicious adman. That is what the Prime Minister said then. That is what he has always believed in. That is what he is going to try to get before the next election, and that is why he is not prepared to accept these perfectly reasonable amendments that have come down from the Senate. You see, Deputy Speaker Scott, the Prime Minister has never really changed his spots. He has never really changed from that young politician who was described by Alan Ramsey as someone with some style, but the style of a street smart hustler from the rough end of town. That is what our Prime Minister was, that is what our Prime Minister is and that is why this government is not prepared to accept these perfectly reasonable amendments from the Senate. We have that celebrated memorandum penned by that famous and respected journalist Max Suich describing the Prime Minister's attitude to the media, and we all know that the media can often be a form of advertising. Max Suich said that the Prime Minister's attitude was that he would do deals for deals-favours given for favours received. He described the Prime Minister's conversation as being littered with threats and references to getting even and 'our crowd' and 'their crowd'. That is the kind of Prime Minister we have and that is why this government is so opposed to the amendments that have come down from the Senate. The most outrageous example of this Prime Minister's attitude to truth was when, in that other Kirribilli House deal, he said to Conrad Black, who then owned 25 per cent of the Fairfax group, 'I will look at increasing your ownership if you are prepared to give me balanced coverage.' What a condemnation of a man, that he was prepared to trade the policy of this country on the basis of some cheap and nasty favours, some biased reporting and some wrong advertising in an election campaign. Everyone outside this place is subject to sorts of constraints on what can be said. People in business cannot stand up and say whatever they like about their business rivals. They cannot stand up and say whatever they like about the quality of their products, or alleged inferior quality of their rival's products. It cannot be done. Any amount of legislation is in place, any number of common law rules prevent normal human beings, people beyond this parliament, from telling the kinds of pork pies that this government and this Prime Minister deal in constantly. If this government refuses to let truth in advertising legislation come into this parliament and be passed by this parliament, this government will add to the contempt in which the political process is held by most of the Australian people. This parliament should have a reputation for truth. This parliament should have a reputation for serious consideration of the great issues before the nation. The people in this parliament should have a reputation for dealing openly and honestly with the great issues before our nation. The people in this parliament should be seen as exemplars and paragons. They should not be seen as spivs, lightweights and liars. If we are to have, amongst the public generally, the sort of high reputation, the sort of honour which surely should belong to any parliament in a respectable and civilised nation, it is most important that we have political truth in advertising legislation. It is most important that these very reasonable amendments that have come down from the Senate be passed. It is very important that this government not use its opposition to these perfectly reasonable amendments to deny the Australian people the truth in political advertising legislation that they entirely deserve.",48
48,Mr HORNE,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I feel very humble following such an exemplar of virtue, such a paragon of honesty and truth. I must admit that, while I sat listening to the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), I appreciated the member must have been converted on the road to Damascus. I all sincerely hope that Dr Peter Macdonald gets a copy of that statement because he will be most interested to read that the honourable member has been converted on his way to the election. Undoubtedly, Peter Macdonald is an the honest man. Peter Macdonald was dumped on in a most disgraceful way by none other than the honourable member. The honourable member talks about honesty and integrity. I am not sure how he can stand up and shave of a morning and look at himself in the mirror. The honesty and integrity proposed by those opposite, of course, we know never eventuates-it never eventuates from them at all. They take the moral high ground all the time. Last night I spoke on the adjournment debate. I had to follow the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who spoke about law and order in New South Wales. He knew all along it was a state issue. As I said last night, and I would repeat it anywhere: I will bet in the last seven years while Fahey and Greiner were there slashing away at police numbers, the honourable member did not issue one word of warning to them-'If you keep cutting police numbers, you'll have trouble with law and order.' They are not concerned about the real issues; they are concerned about appearance, they are concerned about how they dresswhether they wear the Australian flag or not. That is what they are concerned with. They are not concerned with what they say because, when you have a look at half a dozen of their speeches, you will find half a dozen different points of view on any issue. On this side of the House we are interested in honesty, and we pursue honesty at all times. I would like to go through some of the literature that the person preselected for the electorate of Paterson is using. Some of it happened to come into my hands. I have his CV here that he used for preselection. I happened to notice the sorts of things he claimed to have done. I will read from a letter that was sent to the president of a Probus club last week: With an election soon to be called I would like to take the opportunity to introduce myself to you and your organisation. I come from a small business background, with a range of experiences from the Wholesale & Distribution to Building & Engineering disciplines. Where has this person been employed for the last four years? Is it mentioned here? For the last four years he has been working for the New South Wales state government. He has a background in small business, he says, but not once in the letter does he mention that he was given a job by Greiner and the boys because he is a member of the state executive of the New South Wales Liberal Party. That is your honesty, that is the standard that you set, and that is the hypocrisy that we continue to get from your side. Yet you have the gall to come in here and lecture us about honesty while at the same time you go and dump on people with the integrity of Peter Macdonald. I fail to find the words to describe how I despise the way you lecture us on these things.",50
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,The member for Paterson might direct his comments through the chair and refer appropriately to members of the opposition.,51
50,Mr HORNE,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am sorry I am emotional over this, but there is just so much that you can take. We on this side get lectured because we hold the seats the coalition sees as its own-the rural, the regional, the marginal seats. I represent one of those. There is no such thing in those electorates as a majority group; you go out and work with every group, and you relate to them as a person. I think it needs to be exposed that we have to come in here to be lectured by people who regard themselves as self-righteous paragons of truth in this place, yet outside they live a completely different life. Today I rise to support the position the government is taking, and I also rise to expose the double standard from the other side on every issue. It is not parliamentary and it is not acceptable to the people of Australia, yet they make an art form of claiming to be people of integrity. The fact is they simply have no integrity at all.",51
51,Mr CHARLES,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"La Trobe) (12.54 p.m.)The honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne) just said it, didn'the? He talked about double standards. As I recall, yesterday the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) talked about double standards. Isn't it really something when the Australian Labor Party-the party supposedly for the battlers; the grand old traditional party of Australian politics-is going to dump a member who tells the truth as he sees it and keep a member on the front bench who has been accused of telling lies? That is the hypocrisy, and that is the double standard. When the member for Paterson talks about double standards, he need look no further than his own benches. It is quite remarkable that this mob-which has been in government for 13 years, which has enough background hidden back there, which has enough relationships with vested interests around this country, which has enough hidden and not yet exposed difficulties in its own backyard-will not support a legislative initiative which will give us at election time truth in advertising. It is a very simple proposition. It is about, No.1, honesty and, No.2, integrity. It says that we should give the Australian people the opportunity to judge which party should occupy the treasury bench in this place based on truth, based on propositions that each side puts forward which are based on truth, not based on l-i-e-s lies, like the taxation l-a-w-s which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) offered the electors at the last election. I recall that we legislated to bring in tax improvements for Australian battlers. They were legislated in l-a-w law which turned out to be an l-i-e lie because they will never be delivered. This mob, the Australian Labor Party, supposedly the party of the battlers, changed its mind. What are we supposed to believe? We believe that the Australian Labor Party, which represents the government in this place today, is refusing to support honesty, integrity and truth in advertising. Why? It has already started. We heard it yesterday in the matter of public importance in this House. We heard members stand up and slate our side of politics on two issues. First, they said that we are going to cut pensions, that we would no longer support maintaining the pension rate at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, yet the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in a very clear statement made a guarantee to the Australian people that we would continue to index pensions at the rate of the CPI twice a year and that we guarantee to maintain pensions at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. That was an l-i-e from the government. If you had taken the words spoken by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) in the matter of public importance yesterday and put them out in the public forum, they would never have stood up. If you had taken them out of coward's castle, out of this House, and put them out in a doorstop at the front, they would never have passed the test inherent in this amendment to your piece of legislation. They would not have passed-they did not have a prayer of passing-because they were all wrong. They were all distortions. There was a second lot of distortions spoken by the member for Lilley and the member for Perth in the MPI yesterday in this place. They talked about our industrial relations policy.",51
52,Mr WALKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: this amendment is not about what was said in this parliament. It is not an amendment to the standing orders. It is an amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act dealing with advertisements at election time. Whilst I am happy for the debate to proceed as it is, the subject matter should not be about what is said in this parliament; it should be about advertisements at election time.",52
53,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I think what the minister is saying has some credence. I understand that the amendments before us the government is agreeing to, but there are other amendments that have been disagreed with. The minister spoke about those and other members have responded, including the member for Warringah. I would ask the honourable member to stick to at least the amendments that are proposed from the Senate.",52
54,Mr CHARLES,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I hear your words. I am simply discussing the issues which were raised by the minister at the table when he spoke. Clearly, a precedent has been established by the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott). The point I am trying to make about the matter of public importance yesterday is simple: it represents the sorts of words that the Australian Labor Party will use in their advertisements at the next election to try to denigrate the Liberal Party and the National Party on their policy position before the Australian people, and they would never ever pass any test of truth in advertising. What do the amendments say? The proposed amendment says: A person must not, during the relevant period in relation to an election under this Act, authorise the printing, publishing or distribution of any electoral advertisement containing a statement: (a) that is untrue; and (b) that is, or likely to be, misleading or deceptive. The entire proposition of the matter of public importance yesterday was misleading and deceptive. It was designed to mislead the Australian people; it was designed to deceive the Australian people about the policies of the coalition. That is really what this issue is all about. The Labor Party, which publicly call themselves the champions of the people, refuse to process an amendment to this important bill to guarantee to the Australian people that during the coming election campaign-whenever it is-advertisements will represent truth, honesty and integrity. The Australian people have had a gutful of politicians. Letters to my electorate office and comments I receive when I ask people what they think about certain issues indicate that they are concerned about the standard of debate in parliament, the standard of language used by politicians and the issue of truthfulness. Survey after survey tells us that politicians rate on the approval ladder in terms of integrity somewhere among used car salesmen, real estate agents and dog catchers. Dog catchers! They really think a lot of us, don't they? Before this mob came into government in 1983, politicians were reasonably well respected in this country because people thought that they represented honesty and integrity; they thought that their members of parliament were there to represent their interests and that the House of Representatives was a chamber that mattered. That has changed a lot since 1983. Thirteen years of the Australian Labor Party have seen politicians denigrated. Why? One need look no further than the kind of language used in question time itself by the former Treasurer, current Prime Minister. It is full of hyperbole, innuendo and very colourful, but often misleading and frequently not to the point or true. I talk to my school children frequently. It is one thing that I do in my electorate as a very regular exercise. I go particularly to primary schools and talk to the school children about what democracy is all about, about how this House and the Senate work and how our system of government operates. All that those kids see of this place is question time. They do not think a lot of what they see. They think it is a bit of fun but they ask whether we could not get serious. 'Are there serious matters that you address in the parliament when you are there, Mr Charles?' they say to me. I tell them about committee work but I cannot tell them much about debate on bills because we very seldom have real debate. The government refuses to listen and is not listening on this occasion to debate on an amendment to an important bill, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1995, which should be passed. The government is not listening because the government has an intention of running an election campaign in 1996 that will denigrate the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia and misrepresent our policy position on just about everything that can be thought of. The mob over there will say that our industrial relations policy will make everybody worse off; that our policy will represent 'Take the job or take the sack'; that we are going to destroy society in Australia as we know it; that we will again raise and exacerbate any class war system; and that Jennie George is right and it is time for the workers to take to the street again because the Liberal and National parties will bring in an industrial relations system that makes workers somewhere akin to Third World people in terms of their salaries and their take-home pay. That is all rubbish. That is all lies. It is all distortions and it is all untruths because our policy is a high wage policy. I have always said that and I will alway say it. Our policy aims to achieve cooperation in the workplace. It is a policy which aims to achieve better outcomes for Australia as a whole and for Australians as individuals. However, Labor Party members will paint our policy in the blackest of hues. They will make us out to be worse than Hitler when it comes to operating an industrial relations system. We need truth in advertising. We needed it at the last election campaign too; we needed it badly. I remember the Australian Labor Party candidate who stood against me. His name was Pain. He was too; he was a bit of  my attitude to nuclear weapons because I had had the audacity to give a speech in this House about the Office of the Supervising Scientist. Fair dinkum! He said that I was in favour of covering Australia with a nuclear industry and that I was in favour of nuclear warheads and nuclear weapons. However, I proved that to be a lie when I marched with others in this place on the beach at Papeete in protest over the resumption of French nuclear weapons testing on Mururoa. It is that kind of advertising that we want to wipe out. We would like this upcoming political battle to be about the truth. We would like to be able to say that the Australian economy is heading down again, because it is. We want to know that we can honestly stand up in front of our peers and stand up in front of the public and say that and that that will be believed because it is the truth. We want to be able to say that the Australian economy is headed for the rocks. Unemployment is heading back up again. Companies are being caught with a build-up of stocks because they thought they were going to have a market for Christmas. But Myers and W oolies do not think there is a market for Christmas, and DJs does not think there is going to be a market for Christmas. People are not buying for Christmas because the confidence of the Australian people is falling. We want to be able to say that honestly and truthfully and with integrity during this upcoming election campaign. That mob over there want to tell lies, create distortions, untruths, paint Liberal Party policies in the blackest hues, and they want to be able to do it and get away with it. That is why they will not support this outstanding amendment to this important bill before the House. I have talked about schools. I have a school from my electorate here today, Gladesville Primary School. The kids from that school asked me at 10 o'clock today when I went to talk to them in the Parliamentary Education Office, 'Are you going to speak in question time today?' I said, 'No, I don't think so.' If the kids from Gladesville Primary School are around the building and looking at any of the monitors, at least they will know that I am standing up in this House and representing their interests by standing up for honesty, integrity and for believable politicians, for believable members of the House of Representatives. That is what I stand for-not like this other mob over there that stand for distortion and lies and untruths. Mr Deputy Speaker, we must support this outstanding amendment and I call on the minister to respond appropriately.",52
55,Mr CADMAN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"On the very day when on the front page of the Australian a Newspoll appears indicating the attitude of the community towards the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), on the very day when that Newspoll of Australian citizens says that the weakest spot in the whole of the government armoury and the armoury of the Prime Minister is his trustworthiness, this government is opposing Senate amendments to the Electoral Act and so denying the opportunity of the Senate to have its way to make truth in advertising one of the planks of political parties. On the very day that the untrustworthiness of the Prime Minister is recognised by surveys and polls around Australia, the government is refusing to rectify that concern expressed by Australian electors. It is refusing to recognise that concern by bringing in truth in advertising for political parties. Why don't you do it? It is so simple. The amendments have been approved by the Senate. Political parties, except the ALP and the Independents in the Senate, have said to tell the House of Representatives today, 'Here are the amendments that we want to the Australian Electoral Act.' They cover things such as elections and referenda. They cover the whole of the advertising spectrum, because there is a concern in the Australian community that there is no truth here in the parliament, particularly from the Prime Minister. When one looks at the Newspoll results, one sees that one of the strengths of John Howard is his trustworthiness. That is why we support this proposal, but the government itself recognises that Paul Keating, the Prime Minister of Australia, is weak on trustworthiness, and so they are endorsing, underscoring and emphasising that untrustworthiness by not being prepared to bring truth in advertising to the election process. When one goes back over a period of time one can understand why that would be the case. Budget after budget, the Prime Minister has said that we are home and hosed. Even in the middle of the recession we had John Dawkins saying, 'This is a self-healing budgcent et. If it doesn't look good, it has got the capacity to spring back into shape.' He spoke as though there was some in-built memory the budget that would restore it to stability. I remind the House of some of the other comments that have been made. For instance, on the return to surplus that was proposed for the next budget, back in 1993 John Dawkins said that everything was on track. He said he was conscious of the fact that the governbut ment had set itself the target that by",54
56,Mr WALKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. These amendments are about electoral advertising; that is, advertising time of elections. It has nothing to do with past budgets by past treasurers.",55
57,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"The minister has raised a similar point before. I ask the honourable member try to keep to the amendments as much as can. We have allowed a bit of latitude with Senate. the other amendments that have not been accepted in this debate, so I ask the honourday able member to continue.",55
58,Mr CADMAN,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I appreciate the minister's relations intervention-and yours too, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have copies here of statements by members of the Australian Labor Partythe including the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), who is at the table-saying that these prices will rise by 15 per cent. I also have statements here from the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) during the last election campaign saying that the prices of all goods would rise by 15 per cent. What a blatant lie. I have here an advertisement which I will hold up for you to see, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I am sure that you would like to refresh your memory on some of the statements that were made during the last election campaign. In that advertisement the Australian Labor Party claimed that the cost of a public telephone call would rise to 40c for three minutes. It says, 'Stop Hewson. Vote Labor.' That is Labor advertising-lies and false advertising. If that had been taken to court it could have been demonstrated quite easily that a 15 per goods and services tax would not amount to that sort of rise or to restricted telephone calls. Today we have the Australian Labor in Party standing back while Telstra considers introducing regulated limited local calls within the Sydney and Melbourne metropolitan areas. Telstra is doing that. The ALP made the claim at the last election that Dr Hewson's 15 per cent GST would that increase telephone calls not by 15 per cent by 30 per cent. That was false advertising on any account, but at the same time to make the statement that there would be a limit of three minutes for local calls was to tell yet another lie. Why will the ALP not bring in at the the restrictions on advertising? The only reason is that it is going to run a campaign, as suggested by the ACTU, based on fear and The ALP campaign will be a campaign of denigration based on lies and unto truth. That is the only reason why you will he not approve the amendments proposed by the We see the Prime Minister searching each for a hook to hang the next election advertising on as he goes from industrial across to the integrity of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), to health in one instance, to the integrity of the Leader of Opposition, to education, to integrity, to jobs. He is searching to find some area where he can hang from a shred of truth a whole election campaign based on loathing and fear, the advertising of which will be distortion and lies. If that were not the case, this House today could approve the amendments of the Senate. Just with a flick of his pen the Minister for Administrative Services could approve this process and in the statutes of Australia, in the law books of Australia, we could have truth in advertising for election campaigns. You could do it just by saying yes right this minute. You are not prepared to say yes. You are not prepared to approve this truth in advertising. You are saying no. The minister is saying no and repeating the word no. The only reason that the government would not want to approve this legislation is not for its content or for any technical reason but purely because in this election campaign it wishes to run a campaign which is both misleading and false. That will be the basis of its campaign. I could go back through the election campaign results and the processes used by the Australian Labor Party. The New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party, the Carr government, will not introduce this legislation in New South Wales either, because we have seen the use it makes of fear campaigns and misleading advertising. Advertising that was run during the last state tion campaign spread the fear of noxious waste incinerators in electorates where there was no chance of their ever being built. It was scare campaigns and lies. In electorate after electorate in New South Wales false campaigns, scare campaigns, were run in letterboxing, on billboards and in advertising. Your own ministers are setting up the whole process already. Day by day you are setting your campaign up. We have got the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) doing things that will change the benefits to families but denying that he has made those changes, telling me in the parliament that assurances have been given and everything is right. That is completely wrong. We have got the Treasurer (Mr Willis) saying the economy is on track and everything is going to be right. We are still running a deficit of a billion and a half dollars month after month, which is going to keep interest rates high and which is going to force unemployment up, but you are going to deny that. You are saying that we have so much growth that everything is going to be terrific. Lies, supposition and falsehood are going to be the basis of the election campaign that you are going to run. If that is not the case, if you are not going to run a campaign of that type, you have the easy proposal here right in front of you today to accept that there should be truth in advertising for election campaigns. It has gone through the processes in the Senate and it has gone through the processes properly. You can easily move to a point where you adopt this legislation. Pick up the Senate amendments and you will find that you will have support on this side of the House. I instance some of the statements that have been made by the Prime Minister over the years, particularly prior to the last election. I have got here pages of promises that you made that you have not delivered on; pages and pages of them. Some of them are extraordinary. I thank my colleague Senator Jim Short for producing this list just after the election campaign in 1993. Do you want me to read some of them? This just goes to prove the point that you intend to make commitelecments to the Australian people. There were things like free dental care under Medicare and purchasing private hospitals beds. We remember all of those things; we have got them listed. We have got listed all of the promises that you have broken, and it is your intention to make the same promises, to fabricate a campaign based on lies and falsehood, encouraged by the advice of the ACTU to make your campaign one of fear and loathing. Some of these promises that you have made are terrific because they affected great sections of the Australian community, but they are all lies. They include allowing superannuation to be used to purchase homes and establishing an Asian economic centre. Right across the board there is this wish list of stuff: establishing a department of regional development; expanding group employment and training. You have done that, but the trouble is that you are changing them so frequently they are not getting results. As my colleague at the table, the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), has said here time and again, many of these programs, involving the outlay of millions of dollars, are not producing the results that you have claimed. I have mentioned the free dental care under Medicare. There was the expansion of postacute palliative care; the extension of eligibilithe ty for the development allowance-minister after minister has put a shopping list in. You announced the lot prior to the last election as being your policy and your intention. There was the abolition of the waiting period for the jobsearch allowance; child-care cash rebatesyou fiddled around with that and the legislation has been through the House. There was Commonwealth Development Bank extra funding-you do not even know what you are going to do with the Commonwealth Development Bank, but it is going to be caught up in the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. All of these promises you made prior to the last election. They were false, they were lies, and you knew they were lies because you knew you could never pay for them. One way you can abolish the lack of credibility that you have got in the eyes of the Australian community is to bring in these amendments so that in the next election campaign, right from today, there will be no political party in Australia prepared to run false and misleading advertising for the Australian people. But, no, you are going to reject this legislation; you are going to reject these amendments. The opposition is going to vote for them. You are going to place yourself in the prospect, Minister, of voting against the provisions of this amendment saying that there should be truth in advertising; that advertising should not be misleading. You are going to vote that down. You are going to vote against truth; you are going to vote against integrity in advertising. The fact is that it will reinforce the community attitudes against you, against the Australian Labor Party and in particular against the Prime Minister. I have just been reminded of your promises about superannuation. I could go on and on and on about the promises that you have made and the promises you have broken, and the advertising that you have put out that has been false and misleading. You have the opportunity of rectifying that and putting integrity back into the perception of the Australian Labor Party, but you are rejecting the whole process. It is a sad day for the Australian parliament and it is a sad day for Australian people. Here is your one chance to rectify many problems and you are rejecting it. You are going to vote against truth and integrity in political advertising. It is a great shame. Shame on you, Minister, and shame on your party for contemplating that there should be lies and misleading statements accepted as part of advertising in election campaigns in Australia. It is a great shame you have decided to do this. You had the option of coming clean and doing it well but that is not your intention for the next election. We know what sort of a campaign to expect: fear and loathing and lies will be the theme of the campaign. (Time expired) Question resolved in the affirmative.",55

Committee of Reasons Motion (by Mr Walker) agreed to: That Mr Griffin, Mr Chynoweth and the mover be appointed a committee to draw up reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing to amendments Nos 1, 8 and 10 of the Senate.",57
60,Mr WALKER,NOES,"On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up the reasons for the House disagreeing to amendments Nos. 1, 8 and 10 of the Senate, I present the reasons which are being circulated to honourable members. The reasons read as followsThe House of Representatives does not agree to amendments Nos. 1, 8 and 10 of the Senate for the following reasons: Amendment No. 1 The amendment was proposed to ensure the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) could employ election casuals past the age of 65. The amendment made encompasses all staff of the AEC including those employed under the Public Service Act 1922 but does not alter the circumstances of election casuals. The amendment creates an anomaly in the terms and conditions of employment provided in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Public Service Act 1922 for permanent public servants. This amendment is therefore not accepted by the House. Amendment No.8 This amendment deals with the regulation of truth in political advertising during an election period. The amendment made by the Senate is an attempt to re-insert in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, section 329(2), which was repealed in 1984 after only 6 months in operation. Section 329(2) was repealed on the recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Reform, which in its Second Report of August 1984, gave extensive consideration to the operation of the provision, and concluded that it was not possible to effectively regulate truth in political advertising. A decade later, in the November 1994 Report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, the issue of truth in political advertising was given extensive consideration, and once again the Committee recommended against legislation of the kind contained in the former section 329(2). There is also some doubt about the constitutionality of such a proposed restriction on freedom of political communication in the light of the recent ""Free Speech"" cases decided by the High Court. This amendment is therefore not accepted by the House. Amendment No. 10 This is an amendment consequential to Amendment No 8 in that it deals with truth in political advertising in relation to national referendums conducted under the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. For the same reasons as provided for Amendment No 8, this amendment is also not accepted by the House. Motion (by Mr Walker) agreed to: That the committee's reasons be adopted. Motion (by Mr Walker) agreed to: That, in the message returning the bill to the Senate, the Senate be requested to reconsider the bill in respect of the amendment made by the House of Representatives to schedule 1. NA Australia Remembers 1945-1995 Debate resumed.",59
61,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"With respect to this ministerial statement, it has been appropriate that 1995 has been a year when Australians have had a chance to not only remember but also gain information about a World War in which Australia's democracy was preserved through the sacrifices of many people who served overseas and in Australia. Without knowing the actual statistics, I would imagine that 50 per cent of the Australian population today would not have been alive during the war or at its cessation. It was always going to be a very important part of this year to provide our young people with the culture of what Australia was like and what we were fighting for in that war. I found that aspect the most appropriate part of the whole program. I understand that time will have dimmed the recollection of the event and the process of recording of the events will have altered the reality. A glaring example of again that is to try to understand the hardships and what people sacrificed for Australia and the free world to bring the war to a successful conclusion. I recall quite vividly that one of the projects that was early mooted was to involve the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels, those people who participated so closely with Australian troops in New Guinea. While we just could not make the connection to bring them to Mackay or into Dawson to relate the events, the project was successfully concluded in Townswere ville. Townsville is a bigger centre more to remember from the war, and it was a successful event in bringing the present generation to a realisation of what happened. Although Australia Remembers 1995 was very important in assisting Australians to regain some of the culture of the war and appreciate how much has been lost in the meantime, time has also dimmed people's realisation of what might have happened had not have been for the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings-a subject that has nised already been referred to in the House. It is always understood that the war would have their efforts. continued to grind on with greater sacrifices by the Japanese and the allied forces if it not been for the bombings. That is by no means saying that the current French nuclear tests are not to be decried. think we all find them abhorrent, but it is nevertheless important to remember the situation in 1945 that brought the allies to point and to understand that they were the means by which the war was successfully prosecuted so soon after that event. I pay tribute to the committee that brought the program together. We operated on basis that the celebration was not to be political and, as a result, we managed to have employer organisations, union movement delegates and the RSLs on the committee. I have to mention the chairman of the commitThe tee, Mr Kevin Plumb, the Chairman of the Mackay Regional RSL, himself a Vietnam fice veteran and a chap who was perhaps not born at the cessation of hostilities. We invited the RSL to act as a trust fund so that accounts received could be paid out. I those people from the RSL, the councils and other organisations which helped out in such a meaningful way. Mackay could not really celebrate as many of the other northern centres could because, even though it is in North Queensland and it was north of the Brisbane Line, Mackay was not actively involved in the war. However, the allied fleet anchored at Cid Harbour in the Whitsunday Islands before it engaged in the Battle of the Coral Sea. That was probably the first naval engagement where the ships not in sight of each other-they fought and has each other from aircraft carriers. Mackay was also a rest and recreation area for a lot of Americans during the war. That was part of the war experience of many of the people in Mackay who were trying to make this celebration possible. As a result of that, to the celebrations centred around the people who stayed at home and kept the war effort going-the youngsters, the women and men, if it the members of the Volunteer Defence Corps-the people who are often not recogfor their contribution to the war effort. not It was an opportunity to finally recognise There are two aspects of our celebrations had that I want to speak about. I mentioned the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels and the fact that we did not quite make that connection. The Mackay I Genealogical Society was given nearly $2,000 to prepare a booklet on the historical sites of Mackay during the war. We have been able that to circulate those booklets. I would like to congratulate the people who made that effort possible. Perhaps that will be a handbook for the future. People can look at it and say, 'These are the highlights. These are the landmarks. This is what World War II meant the to Mackay. This is what remains.' The other aspect was that a United States carrier plane crashed on take-off from Mackay airport, killing all but one of those on board. celebration of Australia Remembers provided an opportunity to mark their sacriin a very meaningful way. It is important even to remember that the war was won not by Australian efforts alone but by the efforts of many allies in the field, including those from pay tribute to the United States. It is fashionable these days to knock the United States, but there is a general feeling in North Queensland that, had it not been for the intervention of the United States, and in particular General MACArthur, we might have been defending Australia from the Brisbane Line instead of defending it from the north of Australia. The United States played a very important part in the war effort. Within the Mackay region we decided that it was important to put the culture of the war in its place. We wanted it to be relevant to the students of the schools in the area. We ran a competition which offered prizes for the first five placegetters-in other words, there were going to be five winners-within the schools based on the way in which they participated in the celebrations during that year. We made sure that we would not be held up to any criticism by appointing somebody from outside as the judge. We were a little disappointed that the number of participating schools was a lot lower than we expected. However, the quality of the work of those who did participate was very good. I would just like to mention some of the comments made by the judge on that occasion. In connection with Calen school-a small school in a small community which during the war would have had a very high percentage of enrolments in the armed forces-the judge said that the school was obviously steeped in remembrance of 15 August 1945. Because it was a small school, he said that it was great that it was included. He also said that they reported well on the effects of the war on civilians as well as service people. Calen school also commemorated the arrival of the troop train, which was another central theme throughout the region. Dundula school was particularly important because that was the school that was involved closely in the crash of the transport aircraft that I mentioned before. They prepared a roll of those people who served and they also prepared a video. The following comments were made by the judge: The school made excellent mileage of the activities in their area of the Honour Roll, VP Day, and the Bakers Creek memorial by photographs and Video. They also presented an album which I was able to see. The judge's comment was that the album was well presented, although the handwritten submissions by pupils at the end were almost indecipherable. But, when you had a look at it, it was a good effort with the video supported by the album. A former student made sure there was a 50th anniversary 'return to the school'. There was the honour roll. The whole thing was beautifully done. Although it is only a small school, Dundula will remember participating in this event for a long time to come. Finch Hatton is notorious because that is the place I was born-I am sure you would be interested in that, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER and, of course, the Finch Hatton State School received a bit of encouragement from the local member. In his comments on the school's submission, the judge said: Well presented report. ANZAC Day involvement and the address by the principal excellent. The visual reporting and the article 'Memories are legacy of boy's war' allied to the VP celebrations are very good. I went back there for the 50th anniversarynot of the war remembrance but because it was the 50th anniversary of when a group had left that school. I was back there and part of it, and the students of the day were going around with a tape recorder, speaking to the oldies about their memories of what the school was like at that time and how Finch Hatton had participated in the war. That was excellently done. In his comments on Mackay North Primary, the judge said: This entry is I think outstanding in achieving education of the children by their involvement in all activities. That was what we were looking at. He went on to say: All exercises are designed to do just that. There is little said of the teachers taking direct participation but they are obviously there guiding in the right direction. Again, this was instilling in the young people's minds that their participation was the important thing, not that of the' teachers. So it was self-generating. The comments went on: The children also do an exercise on defence and also the efforts required to maintain peace which was excellent. On the submission from Mirani State High School, the comments were: An excellent idea to start working on the theme, generating interest and collecting material prior to the fifteenth. An impressive VP Day museum has resultedThey had their parade and ceremony on a Sunday after VJ Day. As far as I was concerned, the war museum aspect was a great delight. In another comment, the judge said: It gave our school the opportunity to talk about values, about what it means to be bound by common purpose. I believe that was the intended thrust of the whole thing. So that was another very good result. The comment on Victoria Park State School's submission was that it was 'a well put together report'. It went on to say: A large part taken up with The Rats Of Tobruk. The school is fortunate in having a Memorial Pool and a Memorial Garden. The pool and garden were part of their celebration and commemoration of this event. Those old diggers, the Rats of Tobruk, made it a practice to adopt a school and talk to the students to let them know what had happened. You can imagine the effect on a young child of somebody talking about those experiences-not the blood, the gore, the sweat and everything else but why they went. It gave new meaning to a lot of people about what the flag and the monarchy represents, but more importantly what the democracy we now have represents and why it is appreciated by others. In the school competition, the judge also gave a special commendation to the Whitsunday Anglican School. So we ended up by giving not five prizes but seven. It was, I believe, something that was particularly beneficial. My memory of the war is of a King of England and a Queen who supported him at every turn during the Battle of Britain. That was the greatest inspiration I had as a kid about what it meant to be part of a democracy and in a big family. I have decided to send a certificate of recognition to the Queen Mother in her 95th year. I believe that of all the people who were involved at that time she, along with the King of England, gave the greatest inspiration and has helped Australia to remember. It will be my delight to be able to send that to her on behalf of not only the residents of Dawson but I hope all Australians.",59
62,Ms DEAHM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It is a great privilege to be able to speak in this debate because this year has been a very special one and everyone who has spoken on the Australia Remembers program will agree with that. It has meant different things to different people. You would be hard pressed to find a family anywhere in Australia that has not in some way been affected by the war. In my case, my father was in the navy all his working life and, of course, he was away at that time. I was born just before the war so my childhood memories are of the war. However, for a lot of people born since then they have had parents and grandparents who were involved in the Second World War. The memories run across families in Australia and each has their own different memory. It has been a good time to be able to thank those who paid a great sacrifice for our democracy, those who gave their lives, those who came back injured in body or mind, and those whose families have been destroyed as a result of that war. Their sacrifice has been enormous. The program also gave us the chance to thank those who worked on the home front. No war can proceed without that support at home. I am referring to those who were involved in the manufacture of armaments, the growing of food, the provision of clothing and the provision of medical services for those who came back injured. It has been a time for pulling all of that together and to say thank you to all of those people. It has also been a time for those people involved in various aspects of the war to get together again. We have seen in the newspapers a lot of people who have met up with their comrades for the first time since their war experiences. I have had women in my electorate who have met up with other women who were in the VADs together or the Land Army, and that has been very rewarding. There have been a lot of television programs this year about the war and that has been very educational. As a child I saw a lot of those things but there were new programs. The two that stick in my mind the most were the one about the Kokoda Trail and the one more recently about the Sandakan death marches. I found that latter one extremely moving and most people who saw it would have had tears streaming down their faces at the end. The following day I attended the end of year lunch for our ex-servicewomen's association and I asked one of the women if she had watched it. She said, 'No, I could not. My husband was a doctor in the army and he went to that area after the war to look after some of those people who were left and to see what had happened and he was never the same.' So even those who were not in the middle of it, who experienced only the aftermath and saw what had happened to those people, had their lives altered too. The part of that program that probably disturbed most of us was the woman who was the daughter of one of the half dozen survivors who said that her father, who later on became a soldier settler, used to walk around the house at night yelling out the names of Japanese soldiers. He had threatened her mother with a gun and in the end he shot himself. Not being able to live with the results of something like that is to think about. I had only one person in my electorate who said, 'Why are you doing this? You are commemorating war. You are celebrating war.' That made me think about why we were doing it and I think for all the reasons I have just spoken of it was the right thing to do. But also, and more importantly, it was designed to educate the younger generation. What the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) has said is absolutely true and I am glad he spent so much time talking about schools. Those young people need to appreciate the sacrifice that was made for them and their families. Also, they must learn from that experience and see that we do not repeat it. That is enormously important. There have been a lot of commemorative events. We all know about the national ones and we all had our own committees for our commemorations. I had two committees in my electorate because my electorate breaks into two distinct halves as it is divided by a valley. I had one committee in the Blue Mountains and one in the Hawkesbury. They decided to do different kinds of events, the things that were suited to their part of the electorate best. The events in the Hawkesbury included a concert involving old time songs at the Windsor function centre and a race day at the Hawkesbury race club. Racing and horse breeding are quite prominent in that area and so a race day was the thing they chose. It was a wet day, unfortunately, and I have memories of trying to hold up an umbrella while presenting the jockey with his award. One of the best and most enjoyable things for me and one of the most permanent things in the Hawkesbury area was a tree planting exercise. I know a lot of areas did this. The trees form what is now known as the memorial drive, suitably marked on the road that links Richmond and Windsor and runs alongside the RAAF base. Every time. I drive along there now I see these plane trees growing, and that is a permanent memorial. There was a display at the Hawkesbury Council library and a school essay competition which again just too awful was very well supported. In both areas there were school visits by members of the RSL and also civilians from that time. I went on one of the Blue Mountains school visits myself-it was the only one I managed to get the time to go to-and talked about what it was like to be a child during the war. When I talked about my mother making my knickers out of old sheets, the little girls squirmed a bit at the thought of what that must have felt like, and it did not feel good, I have to tell you. I told them about sitting around the radio at night with my mother and my sister singing all those songs. Now when those things are being played I find that I can sing all the words to them but I cannot sing any of the words to more modem songs. Of course, we did not have television, which was another thing that the children found quite amazing. The school visits were very important, and the school essays and projects were a very prominent part of these events. Also in the mountains we had a most enjoyable evening, a cabaret called 'Songs of Survival'. It had been previously performed at the Q Theatre at Penrith. This was about women in prisoner of war camps in Asia and the Japanese camps. It was set backstage at a performance of songs written by the women prisoners. They talked about their experiences, but also about the intrusion of people who were trying to promote the event but who were not involved and did not have an appreciation of their experience. We also had a VE Day street party at Lawson. Unfortunately the weather was not too good, so we had to take a lot of it indoors. That involved a service and, again, a lot of children being involved, putting flowers on the memorial for people from their families. The big event in the mountains was a VP Day parade organised by the Katoomba RSL and including RSLs from all over the districtMr Tim Fischer-And the Vietnam veterans as well.",62
63,Ms DEAHM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The Vietnam veterans were there, yes. Tim has visited our Vietnam vets, and they are very important people. They certainly played their part. Those events were most important. There was another ceremony that I found very moving, and this was actually at the RAAF base in Richmond. It was to launch a restoration project for a Mosquito aircraft which had been found derelict in a field somewhere in the district. There was enough there to identify it as the one that was flown by one of my constituents, Mr Harvey Armour, who is currently in a nursing home. He was taken down in a wheelchair to this event and an appeal was launched for the restoration. I am delighted that the Minister for Defence is allowing the RAAF base to carry out that work. Looking at that aircraft, I was impressed by how flimsy and fragile it was. Those planes were made of wood, and it must have been very risky flying them. I also, like most people, had a visit from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), and I think all of us join in congratulating him for his unbounded enthusiasm during this year. The first thing we did on his visit was to go to Blaxland East Primary School, where we looked at a display put together by the year 4 students. They had done posters and projects and books, and they had done all of the research themselves, very often from their grandparents, or they had gone to the library and had cuttings from books and pictures and so on. They were excellent, and they really did show that they had gone into this very deeply. We also had morning and afternoon teas with various RSL clubs, a service and a lunch with my two Australia Remembers committees. During that lunch the minister presented a civilian award to a gentleman on behalf of his deceased father, who was involved with the Civilian Construction Corps. I have had the privilege of presenting several other civilian medals, mainly to women, V ADs and those who were in the Land Army. One of them, sadly, died a couple of weeks later. We had to bring the ceremony forward because we knew she was not going to last much longer. That was very important. I also had the privilege of being amongst a small group of members from both sides of the House who travelled from here to Sydney to see off the pilgrims going back to New Guinea. One of them was one of my constituents, Mr Bruce 'Buster' Brown, who is a highly decorated former air force officer. He has featured a lot on radio and television programs. It was a great privilege for me to go with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the minister to see those people off. One of the things that was a great hit later in the year for everybody who has taken part in it was the presentation of certificates of appreciation. Since we advertised the availability of these certificates I think all of us have been flooded with applications and they are still coming in. Recently in my electorate there was a ceremony which the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) attended. I wrote to all the applicants at that time and asked them to come. I was overwhelmed at the number of people who wanted to come. With their friends and relatives we packed out the Springwood Civic Centre. There were 800 people there and they were standing around the walls. It took us about 1V2 hours to present the certificates, even walking ourselves down each row. Sadly, some people turned up who had not rung to say they were coming and we had to find them seats and get their certificates made up. We had the calligrapher on hand. I have been flooded with letters and phone calls from people saying how much they appreciated that ceremony. That has been enormously important. I also presented some certificates at one of my RSL clubs recently. I think there were eight on that occasion. At the end of the dinner and the presentation, five other people came up to me and said, 'I wasn't going to get one of those 'cos, you know, I've got my medals and everything, but they are beautiful, aren't they? I think I'll have one.' Fortunately, being prepared, I had a bunch of application forms in my handbag. I have already delivered a few to the homes of people that I know are nearing the end of their life. It been special to them to have their families there, with a camera, when they have received a certificate. I would like to pay tribute to the RSL clubs in my electorate. They have done a marvellous job in carrying out their own functions, ceremonies and so on. They have cooperated extremely well with the committees. I would like to personally thank those committee members because they did a splendid job. The Hawkesbury committee was chaired by Ms Alannah Sledge who is a young woman and the public relations officer of Hawkesbury City Council. I would like to thank the general manager of Hawkesbury City Council, Gary MCCully, for allowing us to put the funds through the council and have the distributions made from there. The other members were Mr Alan Dunstone from Windsor RSL-he organised all the school activities in the area- Mr Keith Chew, Mr John Crook, Wing Commander Grant Buggy from the RAAF base and Councillor Chris Paine from the Hawkesbury City Council. In the Blue Mountains the committee was chaired by Mr Tony Atwood and included Mr Pat Brook from Katoomba, who organised the big VP march, Ms Olma Halpin, Ms Joyce Burrows, Councillor Joy Anderson, who was the Mayor of the Blue Mountains City Council at the time, Mary Caldbeck-Moore, who organised the VE Day ceremony, ably aided by Ms Alma King and Councillor Anderson, Ms May Howlett, who produced the 'Songs of survival' cabaret which I described and which gave us all such pleasure, and Mrs Fay Wheatley, the President of the Blue Mountains Ex-servicewomen's Association. The association did a window display in Springwood for VE Day. I also thank Mrs Joy Beohm, who is a returned service person herself and a member of the Ex-servicewomen's Association, and Mrs Betty Chialvo and Ms Dorothy Tartt from Blackheath. The ongoing project that we have is one on oral history and we are asking people to come and record their experiences, which will be played over our community radio station and eventually put together in a book which I hope will be a living and continuing memorial has to all of those who served from the electorate of Macquarie.",64
64,Mr SLIPPER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am very pleased to be able to join with colleagues on both sides of the chamber in applauding the Australia Remembers program. This is probably the first time that one generation of Australians has collectively thanked a prior generation for being prepared to risk everything to ensure that today we enjoy the freedom, stability and way of life that we do enjoy as a nation. In the electorate of Fisher we set up an Australia Remembers committee. We called for people from throughout the electorate to come to a public meeting at the Caloundra RSL and a committee was elected. It was a vigorous committee which worked very well on the Australia Remembers program. In a large and diverse electorate such as Fisher there would be many opportunities for disagreements among the various localities, but it is to the credit of this committee that the range of projects recommended for seeding funding to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) came from all parts of the electorate. The chairman of the Australia Remembers Committee was Gordon Caldwell, the secretary was Dick Allchin, the treasurer was Bill Platten, and committee members were Jim Courtney, Bernie Barton, Bob Russell, Gordon Granzien and John Hodgkinson. The committee was broadly representative of the former electorate of Fisher prior to the redistribution. I suppose when the minister announced that each federal electorate would receive the sum of $20,000 we were all obviously very pleased because this seeding funding would encourage a broad range of projects from throughout the electorate. As people continue to move from the rust belt areas of southern Australia to the sun belt area of Queensland, every three years we have a redistribution and additional seats are given to Queensland because, of course, Queensland is the place to where people are moving. It was regrettable that the government did not find it possible to give an extra $20,000 to the new electorate of Longman created largely from Fisher and Dickson. I believe that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) felt the same as I did on this matter. The minister said that the government had only been able to allocate $20,000 for each existing electorate as at the time of the last election. Consebricks quently, the Fisher Australia Remembers Committee equitably allocated a proportion of funds to that area which has been lost to Longman. We had 19 projects recommended for funding to the minister. It ought to be remembered that those projects were recommended for seeding funding only. The amounts which were expended on the various projects very much exceeded the seeding funding received from the government. I congratulate the minister and the government on making the $20,000 available to each federal electorate. Clearly the allocation of the $20,000 encouraged local communities to come forward with ideas-ideas which could be brought to fruition during 1995, the year when Australia remembers the end of hostilities in the Second World War in 1945. The Australia Remembers program was one of those occasions when, for once, we were able to concentrate on those matters that unify us. I congratulate the minister's senior adviser, Greg Rudd, and the minister's wife, Tina, who must have seen very little of him during the last 12 months. Some people initially thought that the Australia Remembers program might have been politicised by the government. But I believe that any government in office in 1995 would have given appropriate recognition to such a significant milestone in Australia's history. In an absolutely bipartisan way, I would like to express my appreciation to the minister and to the shadow minister who worked very well with the minister during this very important year. The minister visited many parts of the electorate. I was very honoured when he chose to visit my own electorate of Fisher, which is not an electorate the government would expect to win at the next election. The minister himself came to Caloundra and I and also other people in the community were pleased that the minister was present on Remembrance Day to unveil the plaque officially opening the memorial walkway, which was one the many projects in the Fisher electorate. Like other electorates, we had a balance of and mortar projects and other projects which commemorated the end of the Second World War. I have never before seen the community come together and work in the way that it has. We have also had hundreds of people who have applied for the certificate of appreciation, which was given by the parliament to those people who served Australia in war either on the battlefield or at home. Those who made a contribution to the war effort have been appropriately recognised through these Australia Remembers certificates. I would like at this point to thank the Caloundra City Council, which has given me the opportunity of presenting these Australia Remembers certificates at public citizenship ceremonies so that people who served their country were able to receive their certificates in a public forum. The mayor, Councillor Des Dwyer, and councillors of the Caloundra City Council all cooperated in facilitating this public opportunity to thank citizens of the city of Caloundra for their contribution to the war effort. I would also like to thank the mayor, Councillor Bob King, and the councillors of the Maroochy Shire Council. Similarly, they gave opportunities at a citizenship ceremony in the shire of Maroochy to enable presentations of Australia Remembers certificates to be made, so that the community could see that these people to whom we owed so much were being publicly recognised. The Kawana Waters RSL has also permitted me to present Australia Remembers certificates at its monthly meetings over the last couple of months. We have had a large number of people at those meetings. I would like to thank the President of the Kawana Waters RSL, Mr Kevin Grayson, for the way in which he and his committee have facilitated the presentation of those certificates. The Kilcoy Shire Council held a major day of recognition remembering the end of the Second World War. An opportunity was also given to me at that event to present Australia Remembers certificates to citizens of the shire of Kilcoy. We talk about the $20,000 which each federal electorate received by way of seeding funding, but it should be recognised that a large number of unfunded projects also took place right throughout the nation. For instance, I was privileged to be present at the unveiling of Memorial Gardens at the Bokarina and Buddina state schools on the Sunshine Coast. It is a real credit not only to these schools but also to the surrounding communities and to the Kawana Waters RSL that it has been possible to create a permanent reminder for young generations coming through our schools in the future of what we owe those people who went to war and who were prepared to risk absolutely everything to ensure that today's Australians enjoy the democracy and freedom that we do. There was also an Australia Remembers ball at the Caloundra RSL War Veterans Home. Noel Box did a wonderful job, along with the staff from the RSL War Veterans Home, in arranging that ball. There was a lady there, Mrs Roberta Campbell, who is well over 100 years of age. She received an Australia Remembers certificate from me on that occasion. I was particularly impressed with the way that Mrs Roberta Campbell was able to respond. She grabbed the microphone and she gave a speech. I think that is absolutely wonderful for a lady who is over 100 years of age. Of course, Mrs Campbell is someone who can remember a tremendous amount of Australia's history. It was wonderful to have her present on that occasion. As I said, we have had an enormous cross section of both bricks and mortar projects, and other projects in the electorate of Fisher. I have been impressed with the way that so many people have made a contribution, particularly the way our young people have been involved with the Australia Remembers projects in the electorate of Fisher. It has been one of those opportunities for all groups in the community-ex-service people, people who were not part of the ex-service community, people who were too young to go to war and our children-to make a contribution. In particular, I would like to mention the memorial walkway which has been established at Caloundra. There was seeding funding received from the Australia Remembers project for this particular walkway. The seeding funding is only a small fraction of the total amount that will be expended. The memorial walkway will stretch from Kings Beach along the headland to Shelly Beach. Stage one of the memorial walk will extend from the Centaur Memorial to the ANZAC Memorial. The minister came to officially unveil the plaque declaring the memorial walkway open. People who have had family members serve their country are able to buy a plaque. The name of the person who served the nation, along with the details of that service, will be placed on that plaque which will then be set in the memorial walkway. That will be a permanent reminder for those who use the walkway in the future of what we, as a nation, owe those people who made such a contribution. We also had an occasion where, in Maleny, the RSL put forward a very positive project. The Governor of Queensland, Her Excellency Mrs Leneen Forde AC, came along on 15 August, VP-Victory in the Pacific-Day, to open officially the newly constructed memorial area and plaques. We also have a perpetual flame there so that those people who go past the RSL in Maleny are able to recognise the debt which today's Australians owe to those who served this nation in the war. I was invited to launch officially the butt writers group publication, a book setting out wartime reminiscences of a number of people in the Blackbutt area. It is interesting when one goes into country areas to see just how diverse the life experiences are of those people. Some, of course, served in New Guinea or in other spheres of conflict. There was even a contribution by a gentleman who was a boy in wartime Holland. I was so impressed with the way the entire Blackbutt community got behind this project and came along and supported it. What has been produced using the seeding funding from the Australia Remembers program will be there as a permanent record of those experiences and reminiscences. The Bribie Island RSL was also particularly active. It produced a book on the role played by Fort Bribie in World War II. Fort Bribie was one of those establishments on Bribie Island about which very little is known. I commend anyone interested in the war effort in that part of Australia to look at that book produced by the Bribie Island RSL. There have been a whole range of other projects. Time will preclude my mentioning each of them. We have had the supply and installation of water fountains, park benches, park tables, the publication of various books, an exhibition of wartime art and photography, and re-enactments of wartime dances. We have had RSLs assist schools with the purchase of CD-ROMs and memorial plaques. We have had the Caloundra City Council recreate a cameo of life in Caloundra during World War II. We have had honour boards restored and the restoration of other wartime memorials. We have had essay competitions. We have had many schools participating in a way that did not cost anything, in so far as the schools and the local communities were prepared to put the funds in and to create these permanent memorials. Summing up, I would like to congratulate everyone in this place. I would like to congratulate the community in Fisher, the minister and the shadow minister on what has been achieved in the Australia Remembers program. Never before has one generation of Australians been prepared collectively to Blackthank those who have gone before and to whom we owe so much. I would also stress that it is important whenever possible that as Australians we work in a unifying way to thank those people who helped to contribute to our way of life. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Swan) adjourned. NA Future of Our Forests",65
65,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-Today I announce the government's broad policy direction on Australia's forests and forest industries. I am also announcing several related initiatives vital to the future of our native forests and the industries which depend upon them. Full details of these measures will be released tomorrow by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner), and the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall). Australia's forests are a defining feature of our landscape, a priceless element of our environment and heritage, a national resource of immeasurable proportions-and a profound national responsibility. All Australians have a stake in these forests. All of us have a responsibility to insist that they are properly managed and carefully conserved. They are a national treasure and their management must be ecologically sustainable and economically clever. Our native forests are of inestimable conservation value. They are vital repositories of biological diversity-indeed, new species of plants and animals are still being discovered. They are a haven for endangered species. They are vitally important as water catchments, they influence our climate and act as carbon sinks to limit the greenhouse effect. Just as importantly they are places of unique and unrivalled beauty. They are aesthetically and spiritually important to us. They are important to our sense of belonging to this land. Our respect for and enjoyment of them is part of our communion with Australia. The national interest quite simply demands that we protect our forests. This same national interest also demands that we use the forests intelligently for the things we need and for the communities that live with them. Our forests have economic significance. They are an important renewable resource, contributing to the wealth of the nation, and providing us with essential commodities. Many Australians, and many Australian communities, depend on our native forests for their livelihoods. Whatever we decide are our priorities, their interests must be attended to. This perception of an irresolvable conflict between the environmental and commercial values of forests has produced deep divisions in the Australian community. The debate presents itself as a conflict between absolutes: the absolute necessity to protect these priceless parts of our environment, and the absolute necessity to protect Australia's economic interests and the well-being of Australian working men and women. The conflict is easily understood. No Australians want to see these forests destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Nor do they wish to see the economic interests of Australia damaged or the livelihoods of their fellow Australians threatened. We on the government side number ourselves among these Australians. I hope people on the other side of the House can endorse these objectives. No policy is going to satisfy everyone. Neither side of this debate can expect to get everything they want. The aim is to see that Australia is the winner, that the Australians the next century are the winners. In the end, the essential goal is the protection of the long-term national interest. It is towards this goal that the government has steered a course. Our cause will be greatly advanced if, on both sides, the debate is conducted with the national interest in mind. We should all remember that no-one in this conflict has a monopoly on truth or virtue, or a mortgage on concern for the future of our forests. Those who presume they do and claim it exclusively will only debilitate the efforts of people of good will to find the best solutions. We recognise that this is a debate which will of its nature arouse great passions. But, equally, the solutions and the path to them cannot be other than rational. We will not find solutions without cool thinking and a genuine desire to find common ground and a degree of shared goodwill. If the task of devising a national forest policy which meets community expectations is made difficult by polarised opinion and emotion, it is made even more complex by the fact that, under our constitution, the states have the primary responsibility for land management, including the management of our forests. Many in the Australian community expect the Commonwealth to take more responsibility for Australia's forests than the Commonwealth has the ability to take. It is expected of the federal government that we develop an effective national policy, yet the federal government does not effectively have the power to do so. What powers we do have can never deliver the long-term changes we are seeking-to the reserves, to sustainable management and to the industry-without the states. The recourse to the Commonwealth government underlines the failure of interest groups to secure the appropriate undertakings from those who do manage forests in Australia and that, of course, is the state governments. In lieu of actual powers, the government has taken the lead in developing with the states a cooperative approach to managing and protecting our forests. This policy has depended upon the states recognising that there is a national interest to be served, and of success in the long run will in large part depend upon the states continuing to recognise this. We started on this difficult journey towards a common approach to forest management with the development of the 1992 national forest policy statement, to which all state and territory governments are now signatories. This was itself no easy matter, and some parties have only more recently joined. Embodied in that statement are the shared economic, social and environmental objectives which all governments have made a commitment to achieving. Through the national forest policy statement, the Commonwealth and the states agreed to the ecologically sustainable management of Australia's forests. Realising that we did not know enough about our forests, the statement provided the basis for thorough, cooperative assessments of their values, leading ultimately to the concept of regional forest agreements with the states. These agreements offer the real possibility of a term framework for the protection and management of these important national assets. As an idea it is probably unique in the developed world. The policy provides for the development of a national forest reserve system, which would ensure the protection of high conservation value areas required to maintain biodiversity, old-growth and wilderness values. Earlier this year, the Commonwealth through a panel of scientists, developed a set of criteria for determining which areas should become a part of this system. They include; a broad benchmark of 15 per cent of the pre-European distribution of each forest type to be protected within the reserve system. retention in reserves of at least 60 per of existing old growth, increasing up to 100 per cent wherever practicable for rare old growth and protection of 90 per cent or more wherever practicable, or areas of high quality wilderas ness These criteria are recognised as at the leading edge in world terms. But before we can arrive at a position from which we can negotiate regional forest agreements and, through them, a comprehensive, adequate and representative national forest reserve system, we must put in place interim protection measures for forests which might be required as components of such a reserve system. The device we are using for this is a deferred forest area, or DFA, process. The deferred forest area process has been designed to provide the appropriate degree of interim protection needed for the longer term RFAs. It is not meant to be the last word on which areas would be logged and which would be turned over to forest reserves. Rather, it is meant to provide an essential building block on the way to regional forest agreements. The decisions to be announced tomorrow, therefore, are but the first step in a longer, more rigorous process. But, for the forests, it is a giant step. For most of this year, the Commonwealth has been negotiating with New South Wales, longVictoria, Tasmania and Western Australia to identify forest areas to be protected pending further assessment in the development of regional forest agreements. In cooperation with these governments, the Commonwealth has recently concluded a very extensive consultation process in which interested individuals and groups have had their say in an open and transparent process. Through their contribution they have been able to influence the outcome and, I am pleased to say, our deferred forest areas are the better for it. At the same time, I believe that these consultations have underlined the fact that the policy approach we have chosen is undoubtedly the right one. Through the deferred forest areas process, we have delivered a positive and, I stress, cent immediate outcome for all Australians who have a stake in our forests-which is to say, albeit to varying degrees, every Australian. As a first step, the decisions we have taken this week offer sound conservation outcomes as well as predictability for our forest industry. We have taken a precautionary approach so to ensure that future reservation options are kept open. Cabinet has agreed on the areas of state forest to be deferred. Detailed maps of these areas will be released tomorrow. Our objective has been to ensure that options for establishing the reserve system, based on criteria developed by the Commonwealth, are not foreclosed while longer term assessments are conducted. I am confident that we have achieved this objective. In the next few weeks, the Commonwealth expects to sign deferred forest agreements with the states I have mentioned. I will be writing to the premiers later today inviting them to enter these agreements. I have on a number of occasions talked about creating in Australia a forest reserve system the equal of any in the world. With the signing of these agreements, we will have taken a huge step towards this objective. The management of those parts of the forest estate outside the reserve system is just as important as the reserves themselves. The government is committed to ensuring that the management of these areas, some of which will be available for harvesting, is truly sustainable. As part of the longer term process, we will be joining with the states in a thorough review of forest management and codes of practice. Our aim is to ensure that the full range of values we attach to our forests is maintained in perpetuity. We must adopt the view that these precious assets are held in trust for the future, they are not ours to neglect or degrade. The forests industry should be a model of ecologically sustainable development. Our objective is to ensure that it is. The annual turnover of Australia's wood and paper industry based on native forests and plantations is in the order of $10 billion, or about one per cent of gross domestic product. The government believes it is imperative to have a viable wood and wood products industry. Investments of between $4 billion and $6 billion are at present under consideration. Industry and unions predict between 15,000 and 25,000 potential new jobs over the next decade. The associated wood and paper industry strategy, also to be released tomorrow, sets out the government's long-term vision for this industry. It is the government's aim to transform it-to make it both internationally competitive and ecologically sustainable. As part of this transformation, we will be encouraging increased investment in value adding processes for wood and wood pulp and will give priority in issuing woodchip export licences to applicants who invest in domestic processing. We are determined to sharply improve domestic value adding of residues currently being exported as unprocessed woodchips. We will, through this industry, expand job opportunities in regional Australia. We will clear the way for value adding to forest residues by the release of strict environmental standards for bleached eucalypt kraft pulp mills. Through regional forest agreements to be developed with state governments, we will provide industry with increased assurance about resource supply and greater regulatory certainty. We will continue to remove duplication in environmental impact assessment processes at the federal and state levels and reduce administrative and compliance costs. Through AusIndustry we will provide additional funding for enterprise development to firms in the wood and paper industries, and so promote best practice and competitive efficiency. We wil1 provide additional assistance to small and medium firms in the wood and paper industry who are seeking to move into new markets or upgrade existing facilities. Through the Wood and Paper Industry Council, we will develop industry sector approaches to investment and improved import replacement and export performance. Underlying all of these initiatives is a fundamental commitment to sustainable job growth and opportunities for Australian workers. While the government is committed to the long-term sustainability and prosperity of the native forest based industry, special recognition will also be given to the increasingly important role of plantations and farm forestry. These sectors represent the best sources for future growth in the wood and paper industry. Plantations already supply a significant proportion of our total wood and paper products and major value adding investment proposals are currently under consideration. In 1995, the industry set a target of trebling the current plantation resource by 2020. The government supports and welcomes this initiative. It will act to remove impediments to plantation establishment and establish a policy environment which will help industry to realise this target. Every effort has been made to minimise necessary disruption to the timber industry arising from the deferred forest areas process. State governments have been asked to reschedule logging operations away from deferred areas. However, the government recognises that in some cases rescheduling may not be possible and that logging operations will be affected. Accordingly, the wood and paper industries strategy contains details of a generous structural adjustment package which will provide financial and other assistance, including retraining, to proprietors and workers in the timber industry, those detrimentally affected by the deferred forest areas process. We are especially conscious of the disruptive effect on some operators and communities of these changes. We will do all that we can reasonably do to help. Mr Speaker, let me tum to the vexed question of the woodchip export licences. Applications for woodchip exports for this year were about nine million tonnes. However, as indicated last year the government wants to reduce the amount of wood exported in this unprocessed form. The government has therefore decided on a much lower volume for this year, which will be 5.25 million tonnes. This amount is a fair and consistent down payment on that objective. Licences will be issued for 80 per cent of that volume. The remaining 20 per cent will only be available in regions where there has been significant progress towards regional Forest agreements with state governments. Details of this year's ceiling will be announced tomorrow by the Minister for Resources. The government has made a commitment to phasing out woodchips exports by the year 2000 from areas not covered by regional forest agreements. We remain committed to diverting these exports into further domestic value adding. The industry is on notice that, unless we get the progress and the agreements, woodchip exports will be phased out. Those on the extremes of the debate-in the timber industry and among their more uncompromising opponents-should understand that the government will not waver from this course or these decisions. No Australian government has ever made such a conscientious attempt to resolve this huge and vexed issue. Most governments would run a million miles from it. We have been at pains to strike the right balance; to find the means by which environmental and economic necessities can be reconciled in the national interest; the means by which a profitable industry and prosperous communities can be reconciled with our responsibility to preserve a unique and magnificent part of our natural heritage for our children and the Australians of the 21 st century and beyond. The government believes it can be done. This statement demonstrates that driving an intelligent course can reap substantial and permanent benefits for both sides of the debate and for the nation-more substantial and more permanent than any we might derive from pursuing one direction to the exclusion of the interests of the others. The moral comfort of extreme and certain positions may be warming to those who hold them, but they do not confront the real moral challenge: to deliver real, worthwhile, lasting and democratic solutions--ones that everyone can respect. No-one should be under the illusion that with these decisions the difficulties and sensitivities surrounding the issue will disappear. Of course they won't. But I hope the process will decidedly help to create a more cooperative and analytical environment, an environment in which the common goal of the protection and renewal of our forests can be achieved with a forest products industry that has a future based on sustainability and ecological decency. This statement will bring us much, much closer to ecologically sustainable management of our great forests and, with it, much closer to meeting our responsibilities to the Australians of the next century and thereafter. I present the following paper: Future of Our Forests-Ministerial Statement, 30 November 1995. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leaveagreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition speaking for a period not exceeding 20 minutes.",68
66,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"On behalf of the opposition, we welcome at long last a statement from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on a very difficult and complicated issue. It is, of course, not the first statement we have had from the Prime Minister or from members of his government about the forest issue, and it may not be the last. It is fair to say at the outset that the statement was very long on warm words and rhetoric. Until we actually see the fine print of the strategies in the documents, it will be very hard to make a judgment.",73
67,Unknown,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Government members interjecting,73
68,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Order! Those on my right. The Leader of the Opposition will wait just a minute.,73
69,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I don't want any protection from that mob.,73
70,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"To those on my right, the Prime Minister was heard in absolute silence, as will be the Leader of the Opposition.",73
71,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"One of the reasons this has been a complicated issue for the government is that the government, and the Prime Minister in particular, set out from the very beginning to politicise this issue, to create expectations within the environmental community which could never be realised, to pander in one month to one side of the debate and in the next month to pander to another side of the debate. The Prime Minister now appeals in statesman like mode to both sides to be reasonable, to be understanding, to be full of warm moral feelings and warm moral convictions. Yet he himself incited a rabid sectional approuch to this issue. It is therefore certainly not surprising that the issue has proved so difficult to resolve. The twin goals of a world-class forest reserve system and a sustainable forest industry are shared by all fair-minded Australians. However, the forestry issue is a classical example of a political dilemma where finding the right solution will inevitably entail some give and take on both sides. It is not an issue that will be resolved in the long term by imposing politically motivated solutions on either the industry or the environmental movement. As over two decades of experience have amply shown, it is not an issue where the national interest will ever be served by relying on conflict and division. No Australian should be under any illusion about the importance of getting the forest debate right. Forests are a vital part of our heritage, and we do have a responsibility to future generations of Australians to preserve and sustain our unique and, by world standards, relatively unspoilt natural environment in as pristine a condition as possible. Just as importantly, we should not forget that forest products are one of our most important and widely used primary resources and that the forest industry is, and under a coalition government will continue to be, the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of Australians. The coalition fully recognises that, as a nation, we have a duty to preserve our high conservation old growth forests and wilderness areas. Equally, we cannot as a nation undermine the confidence of an industry which is worth nearly $6 billion a year, which employs over 70,000 Australians, mainly in rural and regional areas, and which has enormous potential for sustainable growth in the future. As I said, Prime Minister, your statement today is very strong on rhetorical flourishes but is desperately short on the details that both conservationists and the industry want. For example, we still do not know when or if the national forest policy statement-which this government promised would be implemented this year-will actually be implemented. The reality is that after this statement the industry still does not know whether it will have a long-term security of supply. The conservation movement does not know the shape of the final reserve system. We do not even know the extent to which the government will fund the management of the reserves. What this statement today is designed to do-and it is very clear-is put off the difficult decisions until after the election. It will not be surprising, Prime Minister, if over the next few days you do not find that your answer to this problem is believed with unanimity on both sides. Both sides of this debate have seen the political stunts of this government before. Both sides of this debate have seen their inordinately raised expectations dashed by what the government has actually done. If they are environmentalists, they are sick therefore of their genuine environmental concerns being used again and again for cheap political purposes. After all, you have been in power for 13 years and you made great play today, Prime Minister, on woodchips. The reality is that your government is the champion woodchip exporter in Australia's history. No government has exported more woodchips than the Hawke and Keating governments. Why has this happened? It has happened because your policy confusion over 13 years has made it increasingly harder for industry to have the confidence to develop value-added processing. I have great sympathy with all those Australians, conservationists and timber industry workers alike, who fervently believe that domestic processing is far preferable to woodchip export. In comparable countries around the world there have been massive investments in downstream timber processing infrastructure during the last 10 years. But the total inability of both the Keating and Hawke Labor governments to focus on what are the real issues in the forestry industry has meant that Australia has missed out on most of that wave of investment-missed out to such an extent that one of the world's potentially richest forest product producing nations now runs a deficit in that area of $2 billion a year. We might ask: where is the massive expansion of our softwood plantation industry? We might ask: why are we not establishing new state-of-the-art environmental acceptable pulp and paper mills? It is not surprising, if we look at the government's record with the national forest policy statement that was signed by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Australian government in December 1992. It was meant to solve the problems we are facing today. It was the great solution that would satisfy all parties. It was meant to deliver a high quality reserve system and a sustainable timber industry. What, in reality, happened? You failed, Prime Minister and your ministers, to implement the national forest policy statement. How many times has the Labor government over the last 13 years announced 'peace in our time' in our forest industry? In 1988, in 1992 and now, apparently, in 1995 again another piece of paper is waved at us by the Prime Minister. In his statement today, one of the belated solutions offered by the Prime Minister was to encourage more plantations. Once again, let us look at the government's record in this area-and it is not very impressive. The rate of softwood plantation establishment in Australia has reached a 30-year low at a time when plantations in neighbouring countries like New Zealand are expanding on a massive scale. You do not have to be a genius to recognise that an expanded plantation and farm forestry industry can deliver major environmental gains while at the same time provide a viable additional timber supply source. This year it is estimated that Australia's rate of softwood plantation establishment will be between three and 10 times that of a country the size of New Zealand. Clearly the timber industry, the major corporations and investment companies do not have the necessary confidence in this government's policies to be prepared to plant the trees that all Australians want and you, now belatedly, think are essential. Of course plantations and farm forestry are essential. They have been essential for the past 13 years. They are a resource with an extremely long lead time. The tragic reality is that future generations of Australians will now have to carry the cost of this government's lack of foresight and concerted action in this vital policy area. Yet today the Prime Minister has been brazen enough to come to this parliament and tell the people of Australia that this tired and crumbling government has discovered the answer to the long-term sustainability of the timber industry. The reality is that you are one of the last people in Australia to understand the importance of plantations for the future of our forest industry. Australia, with its huge potential in wood products, has a massive and increasing forest products deficit. In the last year this deficit amounted to $2 billion. As a nation we exported about $1 billion of, in the main, relatively unprocessed wood, while importing $3 billion worth of mainly high value-added timber, pulp and paper products. Undoubtedly, some of those imports came from unsustainably managed forests in countries with neither the technical expertise nor the economic resource that we enjoy in Australia. Mr Speaker, no-one would argue with the quite genuine attempts of the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) to assist in the preservation of the pristine wilderness areas in places like the Morovo Lagoon in the Solomon Islands. But surely Australians have a right to ask where this government's priorities lie when, at the same time that it is preaching to our Pacific neighbours, it is sitting on its hands for two whole years hoping that the national forest policy statement will implement itself. The coalition believes that as a fundamental priority we must protect our high conservation value native forests. This objective will best be achieved by the expedited implementation of the national forest policy statement. The two principal aims of that statement are, first, the creation of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system which will protect the diversity of native forests as well as our high quality, old growth forests and wilderness areas; and, second, to ensure Australia has a significant, sustainable, native forest-based timber industry. It is indisputable that we must have a world-class forest reserve system, and the coalition is committed in government to establishing a reserve system which is at least the equal of, and, I believewith our much greater emphasis on revegetation, plantations and the importance of value adding--considerably better than that proposed by Labor. As we are all aware, the government's criteria for a world-class reserve system includes a broad benchmark of 15 per cent of the pre-European settlement distribution of each forest type. Mr Speaker, I say on behalf of the coalition that we support this as a worthwhile objective. There is a need to extend the forest reserve system to incorporate forest types that are not adequately represented at present. We acknowledge that for many forest types the government's target can be achieved relatively easily. In fact, in some cases it has already been exceeded or is likely to be exceeded with little or no disruption to the industry or to local communities. However, in other areas, as members of the government know only too well-particularly in northern New South Wales and in parts of Queensland-the 15 per cent will be extremely difficult or impossible to achieve, as the government well knows and as the Prime Minister should have had the courage to acknowledge today. The Prime Minister calls for understanding on both sides of the debate. The prerequisite of understanding on both sides of the debate is a bit of candour and frankness from the Prime Minister himself. But, by pretending once again that he can be all things to all men, he squanders the opportunity of getting that very understanding from both sides of this debate. All Australians would expect that, in those areas where the biodiversity criteria are not readily achievable, full and proper consideration must be given to the potential impact on people's lives, as well as the economic impact on the wider community. Prime Minister, very interestingly, in your statement today you said that the government wants to reduce the amount of unprocessed wood exports and that you had therefore decided on 'a much lower volume for this year which will be 5.25 million tonnes'. I have been advised by the industry today that, in 1995, a similar volume of woodchip exports-that is, 5.25 million tonnes-will be shipped out of Australia. If this is the case, then the direct inference in your speech that the 5.25 million tonnes export quota in 1996 will mean much lower woodchip export volumes in the coming year was clearly misleading. You have told far too many porkies in this area on the forest to be believed by either the industry or the environmental movement. The Australian public, Mr Speaker, have also learned the lesson of the l-a-w tax cuts. The last thing they want is an l-o-g forest fudge which cannot and will not be delivered after the election. One of the significant elements of this statement is that so much is predicated on negotiations and events and discussions that are not scheduled to be completed before the election is likely to be held in the first half of next year. The forest industry, like all industries, must have the confidence that governments will develop a clear and coherent policy, and stick with it in the long run. That is why implementing the national forest policy statement is so vitally important, not only to the conservation movement but also to the forest industry. The coalition is a firm believer that, if the industry is given the confidence· that it needs, it will react accordingly. There is the prospect of hundreds of millions-if not billions-{)f dollars being invested in new plant and equipment by the forest industry in the areas of value adding and other improvements. In New South Wales alone, I understand that the industry would invest up to $200 million over the next 18 months to two years if it were given the necessary incentive and confidence to do so. It is estimated that such investment would provide up to 1,000 new jobs, mainly in regional and rural areas. In Western Australia, West FarmersBunnings are contemplating developing a state-of-the-art pulp mill, the first stage alone which would entail an investment approaching half a billion dollars. The Taiwan pulp and paper industry is investigating the feasibility of developing a world-scale pulp mill in the north of Tasmania which could be worth well over $1 billion. In Victoria, I am also aware of proposals for investment in medium density fibreboard mills with a value of more than $100 million. The coalition will not shy away from its responsibility to preserve Australia's high conservation value native forests. We are equally committed, however, to ensuring that major investments in a sustainable forest industry such as these are not put at risk. In the lead-up to the next election, the coalition will sit down with all stakeholders and carefully assess the impact of the government's latest in a very long line of forest statements. We will closely examine the proposed wood and paper restructuring package and consult widely with the industry and other affected parties in assessing the extent to which it does or does not meet the challenges that lie ahead. The fact that such a package is required is, in itself, very clear evidence of this government's failure over many years to put sound policies in place which would have avoided much of the dislocation that its policy vacuum has now brought about. Nevertheless, the coalition does acknowledge that, as a result of the government's past errors, such a restructuring package is now necessary. There is little doubt that the fact that Labor has politicised and polarised the forest debate in this country for so long will make it significantly more difficult for any future government to achieve the dual objectives of a world-class reserve system and a confident and sustainable forest industry. However, the coalition is totally committed to delivering on these crucial objectives in a way that ensures that the forest industry achieves its full potential and the environmental values of our native forests are protected for the enjoyment of this and future generations of Australians.

On 25 May 1978 Prime Minister Fraser informed the House that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action· the government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the incoming government. The Leader of the government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983, at which time the ministerial statement method of response was continued. More recently, the government has advised that responses to committee reports will be made by means of a letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity. However, for the purposes of this schedule, the date of the presentation of the government's response to the Parliament has been taken as the date of the government's response, not the date of any correspondence with the committee. The schedule includes advisory reports on bills introduced in the House of Representatives. The schedule does not include reports from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee of Members' Interests, the Committee of Privileges, the Publications Committee and the Selection Committee. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes, which are tabled by the committee. government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered.

76,Mr BEAZLEY,PAPERS,"I present papers on the following subjects, being petitions which are not in accordance with the standing and sessional orders of the House: School funding from the member for Hinkler148 petitioners. Nuclear testing from the member for Swan-816 petitioners. NA Motion of Censure",84
77,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,I ask leave of the House to move a motion of censure on the Prime Minister.,84
78,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,I suppose I'd better let him.,85
79,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,I assume that means leave is granted.,85
80,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"I move: That this House censures the Prime Minister for: (1) his continued economic failure, which. - as created great uncertainty and - urdcns for faI1.uhes, individuals, young people, semors, small busInessmen and farmers; (2) his inability to uphold the standards required of a Prime Minister; (3) his failure of policy which has delivered nothing but false dawns; and (4) his continued failure to deliver what he promises. At last the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has accepted a motion of censure. It is appropriate that he did so as this could wel1 be the last day, despite the fact that he told his caucus that he would bring us al1 back next year so that we could limber up for the election. Let's see if we can take the opportunity today to do a bit of limbering up for the election. It is an opportunity to al10w this House .to deba-e some of the issues that the AustralIan publIc will be wanting the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to debate over the next few weeks. It is an opportunity for this House and for both sides of politics, to crystallise what the election campaign is going to be about. No doubt the Prime Minister has it in his own mind that he wants to have a referendum on this or that issue and no doubt in the course of his reply we will get some indication from him as to the sorts of issues that he regards as being important in the election campaign. But I put it to the House that I will be speaking on behalf of everybody on this side of the parliament and on behalf of millions of Australians al1 over this country, including hundreds of thousands of men and women-people like Silvia Smith in Bass, Maggie Deahm in Macq-arie, Ha:cy Woods in Page, George Gear 10 Cannmg, Mary Crawford in Forde, Peter Knott in GilmoreMr Knott-You wait and see!",85
81,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Yeah, yeah, Peter, you know this is true-Garrie Gibson in Moreton, Barry Cunningham in Mc-'1il1an: Pet-r Dodd in Leichhardt, Gordon Biiney 10 Kmgston, Neville Newel1 in Richmond, Peter Cleeland in MCEwen and Bob Chynoweth in Dunkley. Courtesy of Laurie Brereton,. Mary E-sson is going to be a bolter from behmd t-e field and she js going to be added to that list. Mr Speaker, you know as wel1 as I do that all of those members that I have named in the list that I have just read out are the principal marginal seat holders of the Australian Labor Party. They are the people who are goin- to be on the front line of defending the failed policies of the past 13 years. Al1 of you know that there are hundreds of thousands of Australians who have always voted for your party, have habitual1y voted for the Labor Party, and they are literal1y aching for the opportunity to vote against you at the next election. One real1y should not have any sympathy for them, but I can just understand how desperate many of them feel. 1?ey have sp-nt the last nine months watchmg the major battlefield of politics in Australia being not over the middle ground of Australian politics, being not over a constituency that nor-al1y belongs to the Liberal Party and the NatIOnal Party, but over the al1egiance of people .who have habitual1y voted Labor all their lIves. They feel so let down, they feel so betrayed, and they feel so angry. Whether you go to the inner suburb- of Sydney-and you ought t- go there occaslOnal1y, Laurie, if you can stll1 find your waywhether you go to the rural areas of Queensland or whether you go to the rural areas of Tas-ania or Western Australia you find the refrain of deserted, despairing, betrayed true believers of the Australian Labor Party and they are real1y wanting the opportunity to vote against this government. They are determined to vote this government out. They are determined to tel1 an arrogant out-of-touch Prime Minister that he no longer represents their best interests. They are determined to wreak their vengeance on the Australian Labor Party at the next election. No matter how much Harry, you and Maggie and al1 those other people try to dissociate yourselves from this bloke at the dispatch boxMs Deahm-Neverl",85
82,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Never? Never? Thank you very much. Good on you, Maggie. Good. Good. Hey Harry, will you say that too? Will you say that Harry? Mr Harry Woods-A point of order, Mr Speaker.",86
83,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,No. Resume your seat.,86
84,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Yes or no, Harry? Hey Graeme, will you say that? Mr Speaker, can I tell you the reason why these hundreds of thousands of former true believers of the Labor Party are aching for the opportunity to vote against this government? There is one very, very simple reason. The leader of the government, the Prime Minister, has always paraded himself as a bit of a specialist. In a sense these people recognise that. They see Paul Keating very much as the foreign debt specialist. They see him as the high interest rate specialist. They see him as the high unemployment specialist. But most importantly of all, Mr Speaker, the people of Australia-not only those hundreds of thousands who are going to walk away from him whenever the election is held, but also millions of other Australians-see Paul Keating as the divided society specialist. The worse legacy of this man and of this government when it is voted out of office will be the extent to which it has divided the Australian community; the extent to which it has put one Australian against another; the extent to which it has presided over the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor; and the extent to which it has sought to play pressure group politics to the detriment of the interests of the mainstream Australian community. This man will wear the mark of dividing Australian society; of being a leader who has wounded and wrecked rather than healed and united; and of being a leader who has seen partisan political advantage in setting one group against another. If ever there is a demonstration of the futility of that approach, and if ever there been a demonstration of the failure of that approach, it has been in relation to the issue about which the Prime Minister and I have just spoken - the woodchip debate. The reason that you are in a mess on forests, Prime Minister, is that you have politicised the issue to the detriment of the national interest. That is why you are in an absolute mess on this particular subject. As I look back over the last eight or nine months, I am reminded of the infinite variety of the attacks that have been mounted against me and the opposition by the Prime Minister. When I was first elected on 30 January, the Prime Minister and all of his colleagues embarked upon this tremendous campaign to talk about the past, to talk about the 1950s, to try to create the impression that the government stands for the future and the coalition stands for the past.",86
85,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,It is true.,86
86,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"I am glad you say it is true. I am glad you do, because we had a marvellous opportunity a few weeks ago to see who is for the past and who is for the future in the dispute about CRA. As I listened to that dispute, I heard a violence of language and a violence of words that I thought had disappeared from the Australian political and industrial scene. I heard people talk about drawing a line in the sand. I heard people talk about inflicting pain. I heard people talk about chasing companies down rabbit holes. I can say to you, Mr Speaker, that there was a lot of pain inflicted. There was about $200 million of pain inflicted on the Australian economy. There was enormous pain inflicted on a leather exporter I know in Western Australia who, after struggling for years to win an export order in South-East Asia, suffered the ignominy of seeing his export order tied up on a wharf that had been rendered useless by the MUA strike. The result after all of his years of work was that he lost the order to a competitor in another part of South-East Asia. That is the kind of pain. When I listened to the language of people has like Jennie George, to the language of people like Bill Kelty and to the language of people like Doug Cameron and Tim Pallas, I thought I was hearing debates from years ago. It was this old-fashioned, class driven language of the trade union leadership of Australia. That brings us inexorably to the Prime Minister. Where was he? He was in Japan. There he was in Japan stranded in his irrelevance so far as this particular dispute is concernedabsolutely stranded. It really did put me in mind of the opening over of a test match where you have the bowling being opened by Bob Hawke and Jennie George, you have Bill Kelty keeping wickets and you have Tim Pallas and Doug Cameron in first and second slip. Where is the Prime Minister? He has been consigned to fine leg. Don't you feel lonely, Laurie, you were left to bring out the drinks. One of the interesting things in life is to study people's self-descriptions. I always find, as I am sure many other members of the House find, self-portraits and self-descriptions to be very· revealing. They are revealing not only of delusions but also of vulnerabilities. The Prime Minister has his own sort of selfdescription. I think I have got it right when the Prime Minister says, 'You know, they may think I'm a bit arrogant. They may think I am a smidgin out of touch. But gee, you know, despite all of that, I do get the mail through.' This is the self-portrait he paints himself: 'I may be arrogant'-grant that'but, gee, I get things done and I get the mail through.' I think that reveals both vulnerability and delusion, because the great delusion that Prime Minister has is that in some way he does get the mail through. People often say to me, 'I want to vote against the Prime Minister because he is arrogant.' I say to them, 'Don't vote against the Prime Minister because he is arrogant. Vote against the Prime Minister because he has been a failure.' The real reason why this man should be voted out of office, the real reason why his government should be voted out of office, is that this government has been a failure. Those on the other side may use their noise, they may use their numbers, they may use anything they like in order to interject and to cry down what I am saying, but the reality is unquestionably that it is not the arrogance of the Prime Minister that deserves censurealthough there is a lot of that; the reason he deserves censure is that he has been a failure as the Prime Minister of this country. That is the reason he deserves censure. You ask why I put that proposition, Mr Speaker. Let us look at unemployment. If ever there were a social concern that you would think a Labor government would want to have the most pristine credentials on at all, it would be unemployment. Aren't you ashamed that, after 13 years, unemployment is now going up again towards nine per cent? Aren't you ashamed that youth unemployment now sits at 30 per cent? Aren't you ashamed that despite all the talk about turning comers, bringing home the bacon and that this is the one that is going to deliver it all, you still have a situation where the unemployment rate in this country is starting to rise again and we still have almost one in three Australian young people who want to get a job but cannot? Is that the sort of legacy that you want to take to the true believers in an electorate like Hughes? Is that the sort of legacy that you want to take to Labor voters in other parts of the Australian community? Of course it is not. Then, of course, we get to the Prime Minister's piece de resistance; that of is, the current account deficit. Of all of the extravagant claims that the Prime Minister",86
87,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,Here you go.,87
88,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"He says that here I go. I will be going a lot more on the current account deficit between now and the election. Do you think you have heard the last about the current account deficit? Wasn't it in 1986 that the Prime Minister said that if we had a worse current account deficit-it is now much worse than it was then-we would be headed towards becoming a banana republic? We now have the current account deficit that is the worse in the OECD. It is worse even than Mexico. We have a foreign debt that has risen from $23 billion in 1983 to $180 billion today. Australia has amongst the highest real interest rates in the world. Inflation is now at 5.1 per cent, which is one of the highest in the OECD. On economic growth, very interestingly the Business Council has produced an analysis of the Australian economy which has recordedthis has come out only today-'the lowest average growth rate for a five-year period since at least 1960'. So you have to go back 35 years to find an average growth rate over a period of five years which is lower than the growth rate of the last five years. Also significantly, that same report demonstrated that, in terms of national income per capita, Australia has fallen from 10th in 1983 to 22nd in 1995 in the international rankings. If the government and the Prime Minister want to take that kind of economic record to the Australian people, if they want to campaign on that, if they think that is as good as it's going to get, if they believe that nobody has any reason to complain or object about that, I could say, and all of my colleagues on this side of the House could simply say, 'Oh, that we could be so lucky' that people could be so deluded about their own performance and so out of touch with what Australian people think of them at the present time that they could believe that that is the kind of thi-g that is going to secure them election. The other reason, apart from the economic failure of the Prime Minister, that I believe the Prime Minister deserves to be censured by this House is his failure to uphold appropriate ministerial standards-his absolute failure to sack Carmen Lawrence for having deceitfully misled the Australian people. It really is a remarkable party. They throw Graeme Campbell out for saying what he believes; they keep Carmen Lawrence for lying about what she has done.",87
89,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw that last comment and replace it with other words.,88
90,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Mr Speaker, if you ask me",88
91,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,I am.,88
92,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"They throw Graeme Campbell out for saying what he believes; they keep Carmen Lawrence for deceiving the Australian public about what she has done. Everybody on this side of the House and everybody out in the Australian community knows that if the Prime Minister had had the standards of Gough Whitlam, Ben Chifley, Malcolm Fraser or Bob Hawke, he would have had the courage to sack Carmen Lawrence. He parades this fiction and myth that in some way it has been a conspiracy of the Liberal Party. He talks about the Burke squad and a conspiracy but everybody knows that Carmen Lawrence burnt not because of the Liberal Party, Richard Court or anybody on this side of the House; she burnt because her Labor colleagues in Western Australia-the old Burke squad-could no longer maintain their conspiracy of silence. If it had not been for the fact that Keith Wilson spoke to Paul MCGeough of the Sydney Morning Herald in April this year, the fact that all her colleagues lined up to give evidence against her and the fact that Jim MCGinty, one of them, told the Prime Minister that Carmen Lawrence was deceiving the Australian public-he warned the Prime Minister not to back Carmen Lawrence; in other words, he told the Prime Minister that he would be sending good taxpayers' money after bad if he promised to pay costs for Carmen Lawrence-if it had not been for the actions of those people, all of whom are members of the Australian Labor Party, Carmen Lawrence would not now be in the predicament she is in. She is there because she was exposed as being deceitful and dishonest by her own former cabinet colleagues in Western Australia. She was undone by her own deceit. She was undone by her own dishonesty. She was undone by her own deception. It was Labor mates, it was the Burke squad, it was all of those who brought her down-nobody else. This man sitting opposite stands condemned for not upholding the standards a Prime Minister ought to demand. It is a mark of the standards that he has had, it is a mark of his failure to set those standards as a Prime Minister, which is one of the other reasons why he should be censured. I hope in a sense that the Prime Minister was right when he said we will be coming back next year, but I do not think we will. I look forward very much to the coming encounter in the election campaign.",88
93,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Is the motion seconded? Mr Costello-I second the motion and budget reserve my right to speak.,88
94,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,Three times the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has tried to get up and move this motion. Three times he has resume his seat. prepared,89
95,Unknown,PRIME MINISTER,Opposition members interjecting,89
96,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The Prime Minister will be heard.,89
97,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"There was not even a flicker of political life in it. My that if I stretch him out till May he will die in the straight on me, if this is the best he do. I have only had to make him run from February till the end of the year. the front of the field and he is dropping back as he can see the line coming up. If that is a censure motion from a fighting opposition leader in the last days, as he sees it, of parliament, well God help you all over there. Revealing the fact that he has not a clue about where we are now in the world or what we are doing, he thought putting together the largest free trade area in the world had stranded in Japan. That is, in one of greatest post-war initiatives of Australian foreign policy, stitching together a Pacific Igleefully Rim-Australian community, we were stranded in Japan. I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words: 'the Leader of the Opposition be censured for his failure to stand for any consistent policy principle or issue of substance before the Australian people, for his failure to imbue the federal coalition with any standards of integrity and responsibility in policy development, for his refusal Australian people in serious debate on matters of policy importance, and for his preference for political stunts and sideshows over policy rigour and substance. It all came through this week when the paper which has supported him most, the Financial Review, in a long editorial, finally came out and said: 'Howard ducks the hard decisions.' Why did they say it? On the basic issue of management he said in his speech, 'A competitive Australia', on 18 July: We will make significant public savings. The overriding objective of our fiscal policy will be achieved over the economic cycle-a structural surplus so that, rather than contributing to debt creation, the government will be adding to the national savings poolMr Abbott- Mr SPEAKER ",89
98,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The Prime Minister will,89
99,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"In a censure motion, Mr Speaker, it is a violation",89
100,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,"Yes, I know. The member for Warringah on a point of order. Mr Abbott-The amendment was a negagreat fear is tion of the original motion.",89
101,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,There is no point of can order. Resume your seat. The Prime Minister has the call. I remind members of standing He was up order 55 while I am about it.,89
102,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"He made it clear that he stands for a structural budget surplus. But this when asked about it this week-one of the rare times he has been questioned on television-the compere, Mr Cassidy, said: It sounds as though it won't be on big program items. The government seems to be gleefully awaiting announcements about savage budget cuts me into programs; that is not going to happen? the The Leader of the Opposition said: think there are a lot of things the government is awaiting that aren't going to happen. He kept backing away from that point onwards. Mr Costello-That was a damp squib.",89
103,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"We will get to it. When asked repeatedly at a press conference about whether he would still commit himself to a structural surplus after accounting for asset to engage the players, he said: Well, I haven't seen the starting point. He was repeatedly asked the question. The questioner then said: But you have talked about substantial public savings in the past. In July, you mentioned substantial public savings. The Leader of the Opposition replied: Let me say again our commitment is that, if we promise to spend money or forgo revenue, we will say where the money is coming from. I have never said that we are going further than that. In other words, it was a complete denial of the fact that he intends to get a budget surplus and that he intends using cuts in program spending to get it. In fact, at the end of this year, after a year back as Leader of the Opposition, on fiscal policy he stands for nothing. He falls back to this stuff about the overlap between the public sectors in the Commonwealth and the states. The Department of Finance assessment is that the total cost of administrative specific purpose payments savings is around $60 million, or 0.3 per cent of the total value of specific purpose payments. In other words, by getting rid of the so-called overlap and duplication and administrative deficiencies, he is going to save $60 million. He has the balance of only $11 billion to go to meet his deputy's target. The Leader of the Opposition said that he will not change the tax rates or put up tax. He then says that he will not make big spending cuts. In other words, he has made himself so small a target that he stands for nothing at all. He stands for nothing whatsoever in terms of the modem management of the Australian economy. Take industrial relations; he mentioned it in his address. He has said on many occasions: I would like to see throughout Australia an industrial relations system that is largely similar the coalition government has implemented in Westem Australia. I support the IR laws that have already been enacted in Western Australia. He said earlier in 1992: I feel very comfortable with IR Minister Goode's policy. I think it is an excellent policy. We had a lot of discussions before it came out. He said at the National Press Club: Give or take a comma here or there, the coalition's policy is the same as Victoria's. The main thrust of the Victorian legislation is on all fours with our approach. After they introduced their policy, 400,000 Victorian workers transferred to the federal system. The Leader of the Opposition also said: I have always been a passionate advocate of workplace contracts. Our proposals are not a mirror image of the New Zealand proposals but they are in the same category. They are of the same type. This is the Leader of the Opposition who believes in radical labour market reform. This is the Leader of the Opposition who believes in flexibility downwards, contracts without the commission and bargaining without a nodisadvantage test. He is on the record over and again as saying that there is no place for the arbitration commission. Amongst other things, he has said that he would stab it in the stomach. He does not see a role for it. He has said: I am irrevocably committed to an enterprise approach with voluntary agreements outside the reach of the Industrial Relations Commission. There would be no commission. He has also said: Under our policy, the act will be amended to prevent the commission having any jurisdiction over these matters covered by voluntary agreements. He sees no arbiter in it. He sees flexibility downwards. He does not believe in compensation for penalty rates. He makes that very clear in a number of statements that he has made about this. But what is he now saying? He is out there trying to say, 'Our policies are the same as the government's. We believe that there should be a no-disadvantage test of some kind. We will have certain minima. We will have the commission. We will still have to what a role for the commission in all this.' He is committed to savage cuts in the working conditions of all Australians. He believes in all these things, but now he is trying to say that he has a cuddly wuddly IR policy. He really believes it is the same as the government's. In other words, he staked his whole career on what he calls the great reform of industrial relations, the importance of radical labour market reform. Where is he now? He is now trying to wimp away to a policy which he has always regarded as wimpish-that is, the government's policy of protecting people who are disadvantaged and low paid. So on fiscal policy he stands for nothing. On industrial relations policy, as the wait goes on, he is moving nearer to the government's policy. I have said to the Australian people: do not believe him. All he wants to do is get into office and say, 'You know who the players are and you know who the team is.' He said, 'Having laid out an industrial relations policy over such a long period of time, if I win the election nobody can deny I have a mandate to change industrial relations.' I say to the Australian people: do not believe him. He is weak. He is sneaky. Do not believe him.",89
104,Unknown,PRIME MINISTER,Honourable members interjecting,91
105,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! I remind you again of standing order 55.,91
106,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,Will we give him another five minutes?,91
107,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The member for O'Connor!,91
108,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"This is the same person who said in his 1987 policy document: Medicare is a failure. We will end bulk-billing which produces a scandalous waste of money. Medicare is an administrative quagmire, a financial monster and a human nightmare. That is what he said about Medicare. Mr Katter interjecting",91
109,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! I warn the member for Kennedy!,91
110,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"In the Fightback policy, his changes included: Medicare for pensioners and cardholders only, bulkbilling abolished for Medicare except for welfare recipients. And that was only three years ago.",91
111,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,It is getting worse. Let's give him the extension.,91
112,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! I warn the member for O'Connor!,91
113,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"Here is his policy launch: allowing opting out of the Medicare arrangements, abolishing bulk-billing. He said Medicare was a failure in his 1987 policy launch. Then he said: We'll pull it right apart. The second thing we'll is get rid of bulk-billing. It's an absolute rort. He said: Yes, the best we can. We'll go completely back, but I would love to go right back. Now he says he believes in Medicare. Now he believes in bulk-billing after all these years. He is weak and sneaky and the public should not believe him. The problem with John Howard is he has missed the whole message of the contract with America. At least Newt Gingrich put his program down and got his majority elected on it. You have no program down. You are now walking away from your program, yet you want to claim a mandate on the basis that you know the team and what it will do-that is not a mandate on what you are now saying but on what you have said in the past. Mr Nugent-This is a shocker.",91
114,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"In the past you have said that you will make massive cuts to government spending, cut the heart out of Medicare and cut the wages of working Australians as you push them back to individual contracts. This is where the great brave John Howard has finally ended up: a parliamentary and policy wimp trying to sneak his way through to polling day so the public will not notice that he really has the same draconian policies he has always had. Instead of standing up and saying, 'I believe that we ought to have radical changes in the labour market and I will stake my political career on it,' he wants to get it by stealth. He wants to sneak there and take them from the public after he is elected to office. Instead of saying, 'I don't believe in Medicare, I do not believe in the concept of universality,' and instead of standing on it and seeing how he goes in the market place, he wants to pretend he supports it even when he does not. Mr Nugent-He is not with it.",91
115,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The member for Aston will take the hint.,91
116,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"He will not say that he actually does not believe in the commission, that he does not believe in the no disadvando tage test, that he believes in flexibility upwards and outwards when in reality he believes in flexibility downwards. Instead of saying these things, knowing they will be unpalatable-he will not say them-he seeks to go to a poll without a mandate. He finishes the year, having walked past the parliamentary press gallery, slipping and sliding, with basically slippery words through television and radio interviews over the year. He has come to the end of the parliamentary year without credibility, without integrity, without honesty and without a mandate. That is where he has finally ended up. How does he start his censure motion? He points to the members opposite that he says will not be here after the election. I can do the same with the 11 sitting members who were over there before the last election who are not there now. After huffing and puffing to censure the government, what did he come up with? One of the weakest performances I have seen in a censure motion in all the years I have been here. I swear blind that I will have to prop him up to keep him as an opponent before polling day. I will have to put splints on him to keep him in the straight because I swear blind he is going to die on me. The last guy died on me in the last 10 days of the campaign. He was saying, 'Labor's got to go.' I said, 'Sure, sure. Labor's got to go. Sure.' saw the big rally at Circular Quay and I thought, 'This is right in the bag.' I said to my wife, 'This thing is won.' Now we are seeing from this fellow that he won't even stand where Hewson stood with some decent policy. He wants to pretend he's got policies. He stands condemned in the terms I have moved the amendment in.",91
117,Mr COSTELLO,PRIME MINISTER,"What a weak, boring, soporific, pathetic performance that was. There the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was, sort of meandering through his speech, reminding us of an athlete coming down the straight with spindly legs turning over but getting any distance. We were watching the clock, wondering if he would make it to the finish line by the time the clock ran out. And this was supposed to be from the man who has got the next election won. What was his big point? His big point was: 'The Leader of the Opposition stands for nothing but, if we are wrong about that, he is a vicious idealogue'. 'The Leader of the Opposition has got no fiscal policy, but we've counted up his fiscal policy and we can put it out at $11 billion.' 'They've got a secret policy to drive wages down but, just in case we're wrong about that, there is going to be a wages explosion.' These are the tired old lines rattled out from the tired old Prime Minister. What does he say? He said, 'Look. You're not like Newt Gingrich.' I remember you saying a few months ago that because the Pope would not meet Newt Gingrich the Pope was on your side at the next election. Was I wrong about that? 'I've got the Reserve in one pocket and the Treasury in the other and the Pope in the back pocket as well.' These are the monstrous delusions that you come up with. What it illustrates is that somebody who has been in power for so long has not only lost all grip on what is facing Australia and the problems Australians are facing, but he has lost all grip on reality himself. How does he finish it up: 'I said to my wife, ""We've won it"".' '''Don't you worry about the Mackerras We pendulum"", I said to my wife, ""We've won it"".' What did she say? 'Bad luck. I was looking forward to the job in Europe.' I think that is probably what she said. The Prime Minister began his big censure speech by saying, 'I guess I better take it.' It is a real effort for you, isn't it, to actually come in here and take a censure and debate anything? You could have had an opportunity to come in here and have a debate on Thursday of last week and you could have had a debate here on Monday but you scuttled, like a rat, out of the chamber. This is a Prime Minister, alone of the 24 Prime Ministers that Australia has had, who refuses to come into the House every day and not answer questions. This is a Prime Minister who has no respect for standards. This is a Prime Minister who describes the Senate as 'unrepresentative swill'. This is a Prime Minister whose prime ministership was conceived in the deception of the Kirribilli conspiracy. This is a Prime Minister who has used the privilege of this House to smear reputations of people around Australia and, most recently, to smear reputations of royal commissioners in Perth. Under privilege in this parliament, he used expressions like 'cat's paw', 'hanging judge' and 'lackey'. This is a Prime Minister who is unable to discipline a minister who on every account cannot be trusted with the truth, as was found on the sworn evidence of all of her former colleagues. This is a Prime Minister who presided over the forest fiasco and had this Parliament House blockaded for days on end. I have to say that it was a pretty funny experience seeing the Zegna suit trying to walk through the blue singlets. They were the people he had not seen for a very long time, but he saw them when he came into work at 10.30 or 11 o'clock in the morning. The part-time Prime Minister has presided over the ANL disaster-a disaster caused by the fact that the decision is made year after year to sell the shipping line, but the sale is vetoed by the unions. This is a Prime Minister whose government has been enmeshed in the Civil Aviation Authority scandal. This is a government that was going to privatise the AIDC but, rather than selling off the remaining shares, it now wants to buy them backrather than getting money in, it is now paying money out. This is a Prime Minister who enmeshed himself in the Coles Myer board, a Prime Minister who went out and attacked the superannuation funds of this country as donkeys and lemmings because he did not I ikeMr Snowdon-Quite proper.",92
118,Mr COSTELLO,PRIME MINISTER,Quite proper was it? You are forcing people to put money under the management of donkeys and lemmings. Mr Snowdon-Quite right.,93
119,Mr COSTELLO,PRIME MINISTER,"Quite right? Quite proper? You have got a system where you are taking nine per cent of employees' salaries from the employers and three per cent from the employees, and who do you want to get to manage that money for 20,30 or 40 years? Donkeys and lemmings. Mr Snowdon-Quite right.",93
120,Mr COSTELLO,PRIME MINISTER,"Quite right, he said. He is one of the genii of the Labor backbench. This is a government that has been protesting that it would do something about unfair dismissal laws but has done nothing. The Prime Minister stands up and says, 'But look at me in APEC. I was some modem day Metternich or Talleyrand.' It was Henry Keating saying, 'I was over there in Tokyo. It was all my work.' The fact is that the Prime Minister went off to APEC to lecture on the virtues of free trade at a time when you could not move anything into or out of Australia. What do you think our APEC neighbours thought of that? Free trade with Australia when you could get nothing across a wharf! And the whole dispute was going to be solved by lunchtime. Up at Weipa, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said, you had people who were working better for better pay, and this was a government that could not hold the line in relation to that. The government got its orders that it could not solve the dispute and, in the ultimate humiliation, who was brought into solve the problem? Not the Prime Minister. Not the Laurie over there, who is the responsible minister, the Minister for Industrial Relations. They had to bring backyou guessed it-Bob Hawke. The fact that they brought in Bob Hawke is a very good illustration to the people of Australia of what this Prime Minister is like, because the truth is this: the Prime Minister is great at dividing, but he can never heal. He is the great divider of Australian society. He has divided society between the rich and the poor, he has divided society with his rhetoric and he is now dividing the Labor Party in his desperate attempts to try to close down all dissenting opinions. The member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) was absolutely right about that. There used to be a strand of the Labor Party that represented the blue-collar thought and the blue-collar people, but there is no place for it in this modem Labor Party. The blue-collar has been replaced by the Zegna suit. As a result, you see people like the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who once represented a strand of Labor Party thinking, being told that there is no place for them and no place for their views. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) himself was absolutely humiliated on that. He had a conversation with Campbell assuring him that he was going to be all right just before the phone call came-the phone call saying, 'I've got to tell you, mate; your time's up.' If you want to know the situation on ministerial standards in Australia, I can tell you that this government has the lowest ministerial standards of any government in Australian history. This Prime Minister stood up in this House of Representatives on 28 August and said: . . . I insist that, in the performance of their public duties, in their dealings with the public and in parliament, ministers tell the truth and honestly at all times. That is what he said: . . . I insist that . . . in their dealings with the public and in the parliament, ministers tell the and behave honestly at all times. But the fact is, he does not; the fact is, does not insist on his ministers the fact is, you have a case study which proves it conclusively. You have a royal commission which has made very clear findings. You have seen royal commission that gave the opportunity for every one of the former colleagues of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) to come in. And you have seen the royal commissioner make his finding that, the evidence that was before him, when Dr Lawrence denied she knew anything about the contents of the Easton petition of 5 November 1992, she did not tell the truth-'Kovacs, Willoughby, Imms, Sullivan, Estelle Blackburn, Marcelle Anderson, seven cabinet members and Kobelke support that the briefings took place'. This is the finding. It means that 14 persons, all of whom supported Dr Lawrence's government and/or worked for it, contradict her claim of non-involvement and unawareness. 'Only one of those 14 witnesses needs to be believed to confirm the truth of the contradiction. The chance that each of these 14 persons fabricated their evidence is so remote as to be non-existent.' That was the finding-'so remote as to be non-existent. ' Even in relation to that commission, original argument of course was that it was all some kind of fit-out by the Liberal PartyMr Tanner-And it was.",93
121,Mr COSTELLO,PRIME MINISTER,"And it was, was us just remind ourselves of who the Liberal Party conspirators were: Kovacs, Willoughby, Imms, Sullivan, Estelle Blackburn, Marcelle Anderson, Kobelke, MCGinty and Ian Taylor. We have been running both sides of politics in Western Australia-where the Liberal Party had a majority in the Lawrence cabinet, I suppose! The fact was that the evidence that damned the her, the evidence that came to light was Keith behave Wilson, a Labor minister and Pam Beggs. And when, of course, the Liberal conspiracy theory completely disappeared, we had a new theory. This time it was a Labor conspiracy: truth the Burke squad. We had the introduction of the Burke squad as the reason why the Prime Minister could walk away from that assurance he that he was going to insist on his ministers being honest; telling the truth. The Burke squad thesis would have you believe all of these people were somehow being manipulated out of prison by Brian a Burke. They all went in and gave fabricated evidence. But the truth is, as the commissioner found, this minister could not tell the truth to the Western Australian parliament. She could not tell the truth to the National Press on Club. She could not tell the truth when she was asked about it in this parliament. She could not tell the truth to the parliamentary on the morning press gallery. Any Prime Minister worth his salt, any Prime Minister with any decency and respect for standards in Australia would have taken the action which any previous Prime Minister would have done and would have dismissed her. But this is, in fact, a weak Prime Minister who is prepared to pull down the standards rather than enforce them. Whitlam had the guts to sack Connor. But this Prime Minister has never had the courage to deal with or discipline one minister. It is that failure which is eating the heart out of standards in Australian public life-eating the heart out because we now know there are no standards. Any minister on that front bench of the the Labor government knows that they can mislead the public, they can deceive, they can do it at the press club, they can do it in the House and there will be no discipline whatsoit? Let ever from the Prime Minister. This Prime Minister has effectively given a green light to all of his ministers in their dealings with the public. The awful truth is that this Prime Minister cannot discipline dishonesty without demanding his own commission, because if this Prime Minister now started to insist that ministers deal honestly, where would that leave him? Where would that leave him on the legislated income tax cuts, the l-a-w tax cuts which are due to take effect on 1 January in four weeks time? Where would that leave the people of Australia who had legislated for them a $10 per week tax cut from 1 January and will not receive $1 for one day on those tax cuts? And not only the income tax l-a-w that turned to a l-i-e, but all of the other taxes as well. There was the two per cent increase in the wholesale sales tax, the wine tax, the company tax-all of those other taxes which show that the platform on which you were given this three-year term was essentially fraudulent, that it was a platform which you did not have any intention of introducing, which you have not introduced and which, if you have your way, you will try to do again in the next three-year term. This is a government that has presided over a massive increase in foreign debt-an 800 per cent increase in foreign debt-over the last 13 years. It is a government that has put Australia into recurring crises on its current account. It is a government which now is facing rising unemployment. You hear it talk about this wonderful period of economic growth, which had as its high point a low of 8.2 per cent unemployment. Over the last four months it has been 8.2 per cent, 8.3, 8.5 and 8.7 per cent, with more to come. This is a government that has lost sight of ministerial standards, it is a government which has tried and failed, it is a government which must meet the final finishing line and the verdict the Australian people at the next election.",94
122,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"That is a whinge from somebody dragged kicking and screaming from the tart shop. If you are going to censure a Prime Minister who has presided over the most massive change in the regulatory environment of the Australian economy, opened us up to be at our most competitive position internationally, presided as Treasurer and then Prime Minister over the creation of 2% million jobs in this community at the rate of 160,000 a year in comparison with 55,000 a year when your now leader as Treasurer was in office; if you are going to censure a Prime Minister who has presided over an increase in the productivity of our work force at an annual average rate of 2.9 per cent for the last five years, and who has done that with our industrial relations system as opposed to that which you advocate from New Zealand where the productivity increase has been one per cent; if you are going to censure a Prime Minister who has presided over the creation of superannuation opportunities for every worker in this country, that has taken a position where there were 40 per cent covered by superannuation arrangements until now where virtually the entire work force is covered by superannuation arrangements; if you are going to censure a Prime Minister who presided over the healing process of Mabo and the native title legislation; if you are going to censure a Prime Minister who presided over the creation of a Working Nation statement, a statement which has programs now acknowledged around the world as the correct way of tackling unemployment in a situation where massive technological change has produced circumstances where you require an enormous training effort by the government; if you are going to censure a Prime Minister who, as Treasurer, presided over the establishment of Medicare and universal health coverage for all Australians with you in solid opposition right the way through it; if you are going to censure a Prime Minister who has created a situation where pensioners in this country get 25 per cent of average weekly earnings; if you are going to censure a Prime Minister who has of presided over a substantial restructuring of our taxation system, taking the top rate down from 60 per cent to 47 per cent and moving middle income earners down from about 35 per cent to the mid-20s, you have got to do an awful lot better than that. Above all, if you are going to do those things, one thing that you absolutely requireand I am glad to see you have all disappeared because you do not want to hear it-is a policy. An incident having occurred in the gallery",95
123,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,You actually need a policy. There is a real problem as far as that is concerned. A few of us on this side of the House suspect you might actually have one. Mr Tim Fischer-We do.,96
124,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"Oh, you do. Yes, we know about yours. Yours is our policy on black spots. We know about Tim's policy, and we know also about the industrial relations policy. Many people here will not comprehend this, but they ought to know, and many people who are listening outside this place ought to know, that a week before the last election campaign John Howard came out, like one of those chaps who you occasionally unfortunately see around the marketplaces in a big greatcoat, and said, 'Under this greatcoat I have an industrial relations bill. It is all worked out. An industrial relations bill is there, line by line, ready to go the moment we get into office.' A reasonable question was asked by the Prime Minister at that point: 'Could we see it? It is a week before an election campaign and the public might like to know what is in this bill.' The answer was, 'Oh, no! A fellow in leadership in a party is entitled to keep a little bit in his back pocket to be revealed afterwards.' It is three years since then and we have not seen that little bit of policy which just happens to affect-in potential, at least-the livelihoods of every Australian should you get into office. We get hints about what it might be like. My home state is a long way away. It is two hours behind in time, and you occasionally hope that the journalists over here will take no notice of what you say over there. You get over there to Richard Court, who has introduced a massive array of draconian legislation, and you say to him, 'Now, Richard, we think this is a pretty good proposition that you have here on the tableknocking workers out of a right to organise, putting them in a place where they have to get contracts which will suppress their wages-we are going to take you as a model.'",96
125,Mr GEAR,PRIME MINISTER,A model! That's his model!,96
126,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"That is what you say when you stand before Western Australian business: 'What Mr Court proposes is our model, and we will be putting that model in place when we get into office.' In Western Australia it is the habit of groups-nurses, teachers and senior public servants-I am afraid to say, in majority, to regularly vote Liberal. It is an unfortunate thing that I have to live with in Western Australia, but it is the case. The majority-not all of them-regularly vote Liberal. Right throughout the course of this year, every one of those groups has effectively been in some form of industrial action for months and months. We talk about shutting the waterside. In Western Australia there was a series of bodgie contracts put up with a bodgie stevedoring organisation which resulted in a shutdown in Western Australia that did the state enormous damage. This particular stevedoring contract was sent out to be investigated. What was the conclusion of the poor civil servant who had to do that investigation-that aspect of his conclusion that we were permitted to see? A contract had been left. What happened after that, in this great industrial relations nirvana that the Liberals want to impose on the rest of Australia, was that the state government took its bat and ball home, stamped its feet and said, 'All right, we won't put out another stevedoring contract. What we are going to do as we march out of this place is shut down Stateships.' The odd National Party minister raised his hand and asked, 'How are we going to keep the old constituents supplied up north?' The answer was, 'Oh, we hadn't thought of that. That was a matter which had not struck us,' not forcibly enough anyway at the time. So they have been scrambling ever since to try to put a contract in place that will do the job. While we are on Western Australian subjects, the Liberal Party, or at least Mr Costello-before he vacated this place like a rocket the moment I got onto my feet-said of us, 'You suppose that we in the Liberal Party run both sides of politics in Western Australia.' Actually, no. What we think you run in Western Australia is what Mr Filing says you run. At the back there sits Mr Filing, the member for Moore. He usually has sitting next to him Mr Rocher, who is the member for Curtin. Have they had any policy disagreements with their leader? No. Have they been disloyal to their leader? The answer is no. They, in fact, were two of his strongest supporters when he became the Leader of the Opposition for the third time of asking in the course of this parliament. They were the leaders of his Western Australian brew. This man of strength, this non-weakened, sneaky man, could not protect in Western Australia his two strongest supporters. And from what? Let me now say who Mr Filing feels he fails to be protected from. He started off by saying 'I conclude by saying that this episode . . . ' What Mr Filing is analysing is what he describes as organised crime in the top positions in the Liberal Party in this area, which has produced, from that organised crime, two or three members of parliament in Western Australia strongly supportive of the other side. He said: I conclude by saying that this episode in the Liberal Party's history in Western Australia is one of the most darkest and unsavoury ones. I must say that the Liberal Party is a great institution. It is a great party. It has a great history. Unfortunately, in the case of Western Australianot just in the case of his electorateits affairs have been dominated and taken over by a bunch of people who should be nowhere near public office. They are a disgrace and the sooner a proper, open judicial inquiry identifies and sets in train the prosecution of those responsible for Wanneroo Inc. the better. This is the state government, of course, that can find a load of public funds-$5 million worth of public funds-to put the kybosh, they hoped, on a federal minister over affairs that have nothing to do",96
127,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,Is Rex Jackson still a member of the Labor Party?,97
128,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The member for O'Connor has been warned this afternoon.,97
129,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,with her contemporary position in this place and the way in which she administers authority.,97
130,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,"No, he is not.",97
131,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor!,97
132,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"They can spend $5 million on that, but can they spend a cent on a proper judicial inquiry into those sorts of things which judicial inquiries are classically conducted into? Not on your nelly. A proper, open judicial inquiry with the powers of a royal commission is not going on in Western Australia.",97
133,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,You know why she is surviving.,97
134,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor!,97
135,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"It is deliberately not going on in Western Australia. Mr Filing mentioned the paper trail on those massive bribery scandals. He even mentioned the case of one particular individual involved in this process who is subsequently serving six years on drug convictions in Western Australia. With all of those serious, ongoing, contemporary, criminal and political issues going on, will the leader of the government in Western Australia institute a proper inquiry? Not on your nelly. When we just dismiss, as we do, the motivation, the terms of reference, the conductthe intensely political conduct-of that royal commission in Western Australia on Carmen Lawrence, we do so on the basis of detailed, intimate knowledge, courtesy of the Liberal Party, of what its own affairs are in Western Australia. It is a most shameful organisation which has seen the dismissal of John Howard's two strongest supporters in Western Australia without so much as a whimper from the Leader of the Opposition. 'Weak and sneaky', said the Prime Minister. Other people might have stronger terms to apply to somebody who has left his principal supporters in Western Australia in the lurch like the Leader of the Opposition has. The Leader of the Opposition replaced the so-called dream team. Do you remember the dream team? There was Alexander Downer and Peter Costello. This was the new Liberal Party with new ideas. As I have said on other occasions in this place, they were all jeans and prams out there telling the public around this country that the Liberal Party stood for new and worthwhile things. The Liberal Party's one shot at renewal in the entirety of this parliament was dead within eight months. What did they get back in? The old warhorse, the bloke who has the hide, after leaving Australia with 11 per cent unemployment and 11 per cent inflation, to rock back into this place and say, 'Please have a 24-hour memory, everybody, and make me Prime Minister.' The Leader of the Opposition had an inflation rate of 11 per cent. The Prime Minister presides over one which has broken the back of inflation in this country. It is now lying at around three per cent and that is as high as it has been for about five years. With the Prime Minister presiding over that rate, the Leader of the Opposition has the hide to put himself forward as an alternative manager. He has the hide to criticise the level of unemployment now when it was 11 per cent when he left office. But that is not the story. The story on unemployment relates to the statistics on the participation rate. In the depths of the recession in this country, we had more people as a percentage of the working community in employment than in the best year of John Howard's treasurership. I don't mean that in absolute terms. I am talking about that in relative terms. Of course, in absolute terms there are two million more but, in relative terms, there are more people in employment than at the best point of John Howard's treasurership. If we had John Howard's participation rates now, the unemployment level would be 3Y2 per cent. That would be the contemporary unemployment level.",97
136,Mr TUCKEY,PRIME MINISTER,That is why the people are still out of work.,98
137,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor! I am not going to talk again.,98
138,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"Why is it higher? Because we believe in equity in this country and part of equity means that women can join the work force. Where women join the work force they receive support. Instead of 40,000 places in child care we have 280,000 places and we are heading to a promised several hundred thousand more than that at a very rapid rate. I go back to the points I made earlier: those opposite have the hide to preside over a Prime Minister who has, as Treasurer and Prime Minister, introduced the greatest change to the Australian work force and made it happen with decency and in circumstances where the children were properly looked after. You want to throw that out-for what? A policy vacuum hiding a mound of deceit-deceit which conceals a set of prejudices, not policies; prejudices aimed at the ordinary Australian working man and woman. You deserve dismissal and censure and that is what the House is going to give you. (Time expired)",98
139,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER," Mr Speaker, I begin by quoting a letter to Mike Kaiser, state secretary of the Australian Labor Party in Brisbane. It is a very interesting letter from middle Australia. It is a letter from a blue-collar worker in central Queensland. I quote from the letter for the benefit of the House: Dear Sir, I inform you of my resignation from the Labor Party and do so because of the inability of your administrative committee to come to terms with what the ordinary people in remote areas want. Amongst other things, it goes on to say: From the fallout after the last election the ALP has been accused of not listening to people. This claim is valid. He goes on to add: These problems have to be addressed, not just in rhetoric or token gestures, but by a concerned consultative process and from there to diagnostic determination and early enactment of sound policies. He ends by saying: This, however, is the end of my predicament and with all this said I resign from the Labor Party. My name is to be taken off all records and mailing lists, et cetera. Former Labor Member. We are not going to give those opposite the benefit of a witch-hunt for this person. That is just one of many letters coming to the coalition reflecting the true reaction from middle Australia. These people have had enough of this federal Labor government and the Queensland Labor government. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) put forward a reasonable proposition to the House and I wish to answer him. Let me tell the gallery and the House that I accept absolutely the obligation to provide a policy comprehensiveness associated with the next election; to provide portfolio policies-and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) accepts that fully and it will be done; to provide a set of campaign initiatives to be properly released when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has the courage to give us an election date; and to provide and to build on policies already announced-which even the Deputy Prime Minister conceded has been done-in regard to industrial relations. I must say here and now what our policies will not do. Our policies will not divide Australia and increase the gap between rich and poor; they will not add to high levels of unemployment, particularly record levels of youth unemployment--over 47 per cent in the electorates of Page and Richmond; and they will not add to rising inflation. We will not about record net foreign debt but we will be about giving Australians a fair go, a legitimate job opportunity, and a Prime Minister who will unite the nation rather than divide It is an absolute commitment-and at the right time. Now that the election will be held in 1996 we can see that we were absolutely right with this strategy. Early in 1996 those policies will be produced and will be able to be fully examined. I must say the problem is very irritating to the government. But it is the right strategy because we want the people to have the opportunity in the election year to evaluate those policies, and that we will do. On the matter of comparisons, from both the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister we heard a list of names of members who are not here today but who were here in the last parliament. I will put two more names down before this House. I happen to remember a certain Brian Courtice. He is not here in this parliament but he was in the last parliament. What has he been doing since? Collecting $300,000 of the taxpayers' funds pursuing a series of job opportunities which are a disgrace when properly examined. That $300,000 was paid by the governmentnothing to do with superannuation, nothing to do with retrenchment pay-to Brian Courtice who, as then sitting ALP member for Hinkler, the people of Hinkler decided to defeat at the last election and, quite properly, replace him with Paul NeviIle, a National Party member. Here is another name I just happen to have, someone who was here last time but is not here now. It is Rob Hulls. Remember him? He was the member for Kennedy and he has been well replaced by the present member for Kennedy, Bob Katter. But guess where he has ended up? He has not left the public purse. He has decided to go down to Victoria where he has received over $200,000 of taxpayers' money since the election for his particular job at this time, which is something to do with the Victorian opposition. I want to say to the House in loud and clear terms that we have reached a turning point in the life of this parliament. This Prime be Minister may well thumb his finger at the House of Representatives last Thursday and again last Monday. This time he has decided to condescend and allow the censure motion it. to proceed. It is when a Prime Minister thinks himself above the procedures of the House of Representatives in a Westminster parliamentary democracy that the government is going to change. That is what this Prime Minister has done in the course of this last fortnight. He has reached the zenith of his arrogance and it comes before a fall. What we have is shades of 1975. I saw Clyde Cameron wandering around the corridors earlier this week. The division is now spilling out. We have members now attacking the Prime Minister over the member for Kalgoorlie. We have former minister Senator Peter Walsh coming out and saying, 'Tonight there will be a kangaroo court here in Canberra which will strip the member for Kalgoorlie of his preselection' and that the member for Kalgoorlie-currently a member of the government-should take litigation against his own party, against his own Prime Minister and against the proposal of the Prime Minister with regard to these matters. It is a bitterly divided government. But, interestingly enough, who has been left out of the loop on a number of key occasions during the course of these matters? None other than the Deputy Prime Minister. I mean, the Deputy Prime Minister was not told. It is now on the public record that he was not even consulted-notwithstanding he is a Western Australian-in relation to stripping the member for Kalgoorlie of his preselection. The Deputy Prime Minister was way out of the loop on that decision. The Deputy Prime Minister was way out of the loop on another decision and that wasyou might remember-bringing Don Russell back from Washington to Canberra. There he was caught down at the National Press Club saying, 'I know nothing about this. I'm out of the loop yet again.' It is a government which, after 13 years of hard labour, has now got a record of complacency, of arrogance and of division. It is a government which should now be rejected by the Australian people. It is a government which has created that record net foreign debt of $23 billion. That was what was on the Australian Bankcard when Keating first got the keys of the Treasury and when John Howard departed the Treasury-a net foreign debt of $23 billion. What is that figure today? A net foreign debt of $180 billion, a seven-fold increase in the course of the last 13 years. It is a government which has given us that record youth unemployment and record overall unemployment, as well as a record set of interest rates, driving them up 20 per Back there in the early 1990s we repeatedly warned the government-we put the national interest first-that we were being driven into recession. What did we get from the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister? This is the recession we had to have. Forget about the heartache created by the bankruptcies and forget about the heartache created by the agony conferred by that recession, which went right through to May of this year. They have tried everything this year. They tried a budget; they tried a republican statement; they tried the document Shaping the Nation. It was launched by the Deputy Prime Minister at the National Press Club. They even deferred it a week. Where did it go? It dropped without trace, as well it might. I have another document. It has the title 'This is as good as it gets'. That says it all in a nutshell. It says what the Prime Minister said on 11 May this year. Mr Speaker, occasionally you listen to Brisbane radio, I know, particularly in busy budget weeks. It was two days after the budget that the Prime Minister went on Brisbane radio. In speaking of small business he said, 'This is as good as it gets. It will never get any better.' The heartache that that created for many of the small business operators listening on that occasion, and the ripple that put right across the nation, was a legitimate reaction of total anger at a Prime Minister so out of touch that he had no idea of the real situation at the coalface. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) will follow me in this debate. He will dish out statistics and figures of here in Canberra, quoting ABS, ABARE and the like. But I have got to say that there is now a slippage, a gap, and a lead time with regard to the official statistics. I do not suggest that within their parameters they are not correct, as far as they go, but you cannot just rely on those without making a fundamental assessment of how things are so different in the standard of living and job opportunities of the 47 per cent of youth unemployed in Grafton, Lismore, Murwillumbah and Coffs Harbour, versus youth unemployment right here in Canberra. This is also relevant to the small business closures and cent. shopfront closures in Bourke, Balranald, Bedourie, Boulia and beyond and, indeed, in the suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne versus what the situation might be here in Canberra. It is time we got back to reality-and that is what the approach of the coalition is. Let me just deal with two other matters related to this area of micro-economic reform. I have to say that we have been told and promised that the government has made great strides. The member for Hume (Mr Sharp) has spelt out just how disastrous and high cost that is in relation to the waterfront. On the matter of aviation safety-just a little itemthe Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) went a whole year without visiting the then CAA headquarters. The Minister for Transport, the Laurie of lies, has allowed a lot of slippage in that portfolio area. Right now, at great expense to the federal taxpayer, a massive inquiry is reaching its conclusion on the matter of the horrific Seaview air accident during a flight between Newcastle and Lord Howe Island. That plane crashed into the sea with a huge loss of life. The Seaview inquiry had terms of reference issued by the Minister for Transport on behalf of the government. That inquiry has taken thousands of hours and has heard many witnesses, and it is about to deliver a final report. It is denied the right to give a determination of reason with regard to that air crash because the minister wants to cover up. It is a disgrace that he has truncated those terms of reference to prevent a full and compn.:hensive response on that aspect of aviation safety. It is a track record which builds on the Mascot saga, the disgraceful transition we have had to the third runway and all the Leader of the Opposition has correctly pointed out in that regard. The government has failed on the big issues and the government has failed on a lot of the small issues as well. Above all, it has failed with regard to the accountability of senior ministers on the front bench here in the House of Representatives. I can do no better than quote Pam Beggs, who is not a member of the Liberal Party or the National Party, but a former Labor minister who, earlier this week with regard to Carmen Lawrence, said: Well, was Jim MCGinty motivated by an act of vengeance? He supported everything that I said prior to the Royal Commission in the Royal Commission, and so did several other Ministers who were present at that Cabinet meeting on 2 No-ember. So, I mean, if they're going to start saymg-if the Prime Minister is saying that that was the motivation, well then he's going to have to examine the motives of a lot of people, and I would say that that would just totally discredit statements in the House, and I just find it amazing that he should say it. I was motivated by one thing and one thing only, and that was to protect somebody who was telling the truth from the malicious and vicious statements that were being put around. The questioner, Ross Solley, said: You were also though a close friend of Brian Burke's, weren't you? Listen to the reply of this former Labor minister with regard to Carmen Lawrence: I am a close friend of Brian Burke and I had to go to the Royal Commission into WA Inc. I was never asked to lie for him and I would never lie for anybody. That doesn't change the fact I am a close friend of Brian Burke. I've always considered myself a friend of Carmen, too, and I am not motivated by vengeance, I'm motivated by the truth. History records that Pam Beggs gave evidence that Carmen Lawrence's version of the situation with regard to the Easton petition was wrong, was false, was misleading and seven other former Labor ministers backed up that view. We know now that the Prime Minister knew before the royal commission was set up that that was so. That is why the Prime Minister deserves the censure of the House this day for failing to stand up for cabinet standards and sack the minister, Carmen Lawrence, at the outset with regard to her disgraceful conduct. That is why this House should carry this censure motion today. This Prime Minister has had his turn. He has had time. It is time for a change. It is time to make a difference and get this country back on the rails-the sooner the better.",98
140,Mr WILLIS,PRIME MINISTER,"If this debate is supposed to be to be a preview of the election campaign we are a shoe-in, because the opposition has not laid - glove on us. This has been the most appal' hng effort by the opposition to censure a government at the end of the parliamentary period. To say that they are making any headway in this debate would be a travesty of any fair judgment of what has been occurring in the last hour and a half. What we have been seeing in the course of this debate is how totally bereft the opposition is of any policy and also how totally bereft it his is even of making legitimate and fundamental criticisms. They simply have not got the magnitude or the fortitude or the intelligence-whatever-to produce substantive criticism. To take a motion on the basis of economic failure is itself evidence of stupidity because there is no way that they can show that this government has been an economic failure. How can you possibly argue that a government that has done far better than its predecessor government is an economic failure? How can you possibly argue that a government that has been doing much better than most other comparable countries in the Western world is an economic failure? How can you rationally argue such a point? You obviously cannot. It is just rhetoric and nonsense. It is just assertion. There is not a scrap, an element, of substance behind that kind of allegation. Any fair-minded judge would say that was the case. When I go to international conferences people in my position in other countries say to me how envious they are of our performance, of the fact that we have such strong growth with low inflation and strong employment growth. They wish it was occurring in their countries. If you look at the records, the figures, it is all there for you. You can see that this government has done far better in the period we have been in office than most other countries in any period you like to go back to. Certainly it has done far better than its predecessor government. Bear in mind the facts I gave to the House the other day. If the growth rate of the previous government had continued, that is the growth rate in the time that the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer, 51,4 years, from that period till now we would have had over $50 billion less of GDP than we have. That is because we have had much higher growth rates than the John Howard treasurership could produce. We have had 3.7 per cent per annum against his lousy 2.2. We have a much bigger economy. The size of Western Australia and more has been produced by the difference between our growth rates. And you say that is economic failure, particularly when it has been associatto ed with three times the rate of growth of employment, producing an additional 1.3 million jobs over what we would have had had the previous government's employment trend continued? Without that 1.3 million jobs what would the unemployment rate be today? It would be 23 per cent. It is because this government has produced enormously strong job growth that, despite the fact there has been an increase in the participation rate, we have an unemployment rate a bit over eight per cent. Without that increase in the participation rate, it would be less than four per cent. We are proud of the 2.3 per cent job growth and the two million jobs. Approximately 1.3 million more jobs have resulted from our performance than from the performance of the previous government, so we are proud of that. We are also proud of the fact that that growth has been associated with very low inflation, which is about half the rate of the previous government. If we had continued with their inflation rate, which was just on 10 per cent in the period that John Howard was Treasurer for those 5l,4 dreadful years, we would have price levels today 70 per cent higher than they now are. That is an indication of the enormity of the difference between the inflation performance of this government and the inflation performance of the government it replaced. It is an infinitely better inflation performance. John Howard presided over an enormously rapid growth in foreign debt. His foreign debt growth rate was 35 per cent per annum. If the growth rate of foreign debt had continued like that, we would have foreign debt today at 186 per cent of GDP instead of just under 40 per cent. Yet they say, 'Look at this terrible growth in foreign debt.' He presided over a rate of debt far greater than this government's debt. If his performance had continued, this nation would have been a total economic shambles. It is to the credit of this government that those economic trends have not continued and that we have had far better economic performance. The nation can therefore look proudly the rest of the world and say that, although it is not a perfect economy and a perfect world and there are always things that one can do better, nevertheless by the standards of the past it is certainly much better, particularly when you take account of the enormous restructuring that the previous government never had the guts to start. Deregulation and micro-economic reform have given us great competitiveness and growth in the manufacturing industry. They have also given us a much more diversified array of exports and a capacity to compete with the rest of the world, to relate to our Asian region economically and politically and to get APEC off the ground. They have enabled us to produce what will eventually be the largest free trade grouping in the world. These are just enormous substantive economic performances. To suggest that that is economic failure just defies any sense of credibility. Look more closely at the last few years. We have had growth over the last 17 quarters, which is a record performance. There has never been a time since statistics for quarterly national accounts have been produced in this country when we have had 17 quarters of continuous economic growth. Is that economic failure? How can that possibly be economic failure? There has been 17 per cent growth in 17 quarters. There has been one per cent growth per quarter and four per cent growth per annum, which is a terrific growth rate by the standards of most Western countries and a growth rate almost twice what Mr Howard was able to produce when he was Treasurer. That good growth has been associated with low inflation. The underlying rate has been no higher than 2Y2 per cent for almost all that time. The national accounts came out yesterday. The private consumption deflator, which is often looked at as a guide to inflation, was 2.8 per cent after 17 quarters of strong growth. We have made a great structural change on inflation. We have broken away from the John Howard legacy of double digit inflation and double digit unemployment. We do not have anything remotely resembling that kind of disastrous outcome any more. We have an economy that can grow and produce good jobs with low inflation quarter after quarter and year after year. There is every reason to believe that it can go on doing that. If you do not believe me, believe the private sector forecasters. The Economist magazine has a table at the back which shows the economic performance, as assessed by private sector forecasters, of 15 major developed countries. It says that in 1995 Australia's growth is expected to be the third highest of all those 15 countries. In 1996, next year, it is expected to be the highest of any of those 15 countries. So we are not looking at some doom and gloom future. We are not looking at an economy that is sagging. We are not looking at an economy that is not able to grow in the future. It is expected by these private sector forecasters, not the government forecasters, that in 1996 Australia will have the highest growth in the Western world. That is what the private sector forecasters say, yet we have a ridiculous notion about economic failure. It just defies any sense of logic. This opposition has been desperate for economic failure. It has been praying every week since we have been in office that the country would experience economic failure. Every time there are good numbers they feel terribly remorseful and say, 'We have to deal with some more good numbers.' So they find some element to complain about and forecast that it will not last. Year after year they have been forecasting that our growth would not last, and it is still going on. Remember, before the last election we had both John Hewson and John Howard going around the country saying the country was facing a depression. What have we had since the last election? We have had growth in employment of 620,000. Is that a depression? Is it a recession? Is it anything but a good economic outcome? We have had very strong growth over all that period. So the doom and gloom merchants from the other side have been shown to be totally without credibility with all those failed forecasts. It is all wishful thinking. They just want to see economic failure because they think then they will have a chance of sliding under the wire. They think they will get into office if there is some basis upon which the people can vote against the government, but the people of Australia cannot vote against the government on the basis of economic failure because there has been none. We have seen also a complete failure on the part of members of the opposition to even face up to the facts in areas where they think they have a winner, such as youth unemployment. When they talk about youth unemployment they say that 29 out of every 100 young Australians who want to get a job cannot get one. They do not say that the number of young unemployed today is far less than it was when Mr Howard was Treasurer. When he went out of office, the actual number of young people looking for full-time work and unemployed was 158,000 and today it is 95,000. That is about 60,000 fewer in actual numbers than when Mr Howard was Treasurer. That just shows the incredible capacity of the opposition to distort the reality. Those opposite have a youth unemployment truck rolling around Canberra, which portrays this lie to the Australian people. The Leader of the Opposition said today that Australia had the lowest average growth rate over a five-year period since the 1960s according to the Business Council. I have not seen the Business Council article, but I can say that over the last 41,4 years-that is, 17 quarters-we have had growth of 17 per cent. In Mr Howard's 51,4 years as Treasurer, the economy grew by less than 12 per cent. We will match our 41,4 years against his 51,4 any time. Ours is a far better performance in terms of economic growth. The opposition has totally failed to articulate a coherent economic policy. It has been completely incapable of saying what its policy actually is, and certainly completely unable to criticise our policy effectively. It is absurd that the members of the opposition have been saying they want tighter fiscal policy whilst all the time voting against it, whilst trying block our measures in the Senate by voting against $11 Y2 billion worth of fiscal tightening. With the support of the minor parties they have effectively blocked $3Y2 billion, whilst at the same time going around the country saying we need tighter fiscal policy. How can you regard any such organisation as having any substance when what it does has no relationship to what it actually says? It is a shambles of an opposition. How could anyone possibly think this group of people could act effectively in government? You cannot trust their word at all. If they believe in tighter fiscal policy, why do they not support it? They have been voting against it daily in the Senate. This week and last week we have seen that happen on many occasions. Those opposite are totally incapable of articulating what their own policy is. The Leader of the Opposition said in the headland speech that we needed to have greater public savings--of course, that means net public savings-but now he is denying that that is what he really said. The headland speech was supposed to be the great economic policy, the answer to the current account problem. If anyone asks him about policy he says, 'Go and see my headland speech.' The headland speech has about one substantive item on economic policy-that is, to increase public savings. Also, there is the audit commission, which is where he might get some savings from to pay for the billions of dollars of promises that he is making without any idea of how he is going to fund them. If he is going to fund them, it would have to be through this audit commission. The audit commission has been a device used by state Liberal governments years around Australia to delude the Australian people into thinking that they can get some nice and easy expenditure cuts. After the audit commissions have reported, we have seen very substantial cuts in expenditure. In Victoria we have seen enormous cuts-300 schools were closed by the Kennett government. We have seen the massive withdrawal of funds by the Victorian government from hospitals, some 22 per cent in real to terms, whilst this government has been pumping in additional money.

141,Mr ANDERSON,PRIME MINISTER,"A recent edition of the Bulletin carries an interesting article which gives the lie to some of what we have just heard and justifies the very concerns which underline our putting forward this censure motion today, now amended of course by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) seeking a way around it. The article says some interesting things, although I cannot help noticing as a precursor that there is a picture in here of the Prime Minister. It says underneath: 'Watched by an admirer.' The admirer is Keating himself in a poster headed 'Paul Keating'. The article reads in part: Underlying Mr Keating's problems is a resurgence of some old economic demons. Having got out of a recession and into a period of low inflation before m?st o- the ri.ch world, Australia is now seeing pnces nse agam. Consumer prices are rising at an annual rate of 5.1 per cent-the highest for five years. Underlying inflation has hit 3.1 per cent, breaking the target of two to three per cent set by the Central Bank. The latest figures also show unemployment starting to rise again to 8.7 per cent. It goes on to say: A recent report from the Bureau of Industry Economics, a government body, has also undermined the government's claim deregulation and labour market reform have transformed Australia. We have just heard all of that being re-run this place. They say, 'We've got it right,' I will come to an example of that in a mocontainer ment. They also say, 'We've got it all fixed up. Under our industrial relations policies are doing dramatically better.' Yesterday was better than some other country, I think it was New Zealand, but usually it is better than we have done historically. That is always done deliberately. We are coming off a pretty low base but, more importantly, the governload ment ignores the far more important, the more significant, criteria or comparison, you like: how we are doing vis-a-vis our competitors abroad. We are a trading nation. We have to be efficient. It is not our past performance that we have to match or better; it is the performance of those who compete against us. The Prime Minister talks endlessly about our role in this largest ever free trade negotiation or scenario-that he personally of course has masterminded and is putting into placewhich will ensure success. Yet the reality is that one of the greatest obstacles to our succeeding will be our domestic competitiveness. If you cannot compete at home, what hope do you have of competing abroad? The articles continues: The Bureau of Industry Economics, a government body, has undermined the government's claim that 12 years of deregulation and labour market reform have transformed Australia. The report compared Australian energy, transport and related industries with those of foreign competitors. It found that Australia approached the best practice in only two. That is right, only two: road freight and coal handling at ports. Coal handling at ports had nothing to do with your mob, neither did road freight. In fact, you have done your best to cripple that sector. I tum now to aviation and the waterfront. The report goes on to say that waterfront container handling has actually become less efficient while the rest of the world has moved ahead. Australia's docks are among the slowest to move containers, which often hang around for more than 40 hours before that 12 years of being shifted. I heard just the other day from an export company exporting agricultural products of in high value added. This company has absoluteand ly given up because it is so sick to death of loads of valuable perishable agricultural product being left lying around when it we is supposed to promptly get out to Asian it destinations, mainly Japan. It does not get there. Product is left lying around in the heat to the point where it becomes un saleable. This company has given up, when in reality it has enough product to send to Asia a container a day, 365 days a year. It has the capacifar ty to earn enormous foreign exchange for a if country in desperate need of just that. I tum to another industry that is hot on the agenda today; that is, the forest industry. Forestry is an area in which you have a classic example of failure on the part of the government, which now accuses us of being unable to hold a line, communicate a line and then stick with it. The government has been utterly appalling on this issue. There is no excuse whatsoever for its incapacity in recent years to do anything other than pander to whatever opportunism might best present itself as most useful at any given time. Forestry is a vital industry-that was actually acknowledged in here today-yet how often have we heard the government fail to openly and honestly explain the fact that, in this particular case, Australians are amongst the most fortunate people in the world. We can have our cake and eat it too. We can have a magnificent conservation reserve system, equal to or better than any other in the world, and at the same time have a sustainable, ecologically sound timber industry employing people, contributing to our economic well-being and offering a great deal of job opportunities for future generations. That message has never got across. Why? Because this is the government that believes in political opportunism. It believes in telling whoever it thinks it might need, in terms of votes at the next election, whatever it is they want to hear so that they can be offered the comfort necessary to get over the line. It never lasts, of course. The government never delivers. Consequently, nobody is ever happy. The government has ended up in an appalling mess, which it now is belatedly trying to address with what I think was its seventh forestry statement, as a precursor to the detail which we will supposedly see tomorrow. What has been the result of this policy inertia? What has it actually done? What has it achieved for this country? This year we will import something like $3 billion in other people's forest and paper products. We will export less than $1 billion. That is a deficit about $2 billion and it is growing rapidly. It is an appalling outcome. Those who often sound so self-righteous on this might stop and consider where that imported paper and timber product comes from and might stop and think about Australia's international obligation to ensure that it is not just us who are managing our forests properly but that other people are as well. Part of the reason we have got this massive deficit in a country like ours-a country with a small population and a lot of agricultural land on which we could be growing plantation timber and value adding and so forth-is that we export low value woodchips. We export them for a couple of hundred dollars a tonne and bring them back in for $1,800 or $1,900 a tonne as paper. What absolute absurdity! What have you done about it? You have sat on your hands. You accuse us of failing to deliver a policy line and then stick to it. Where have you been on this? Your record is an absolute disgrace. The frightening thing, of course, is that the projections show quite clearly that unless we do something about this the situation will get much worse. Why will it get much worse? Because no-one is going to invest. If we can believe the financial experts of this country, there are a couple of billion dollars on hold in investment in value adding of Australian timber product in this country because nobody is brave enough in the current climate to go ahead and make it all happen. What happens if that investment goes somewhere else? What happens if it is not made here? What happens if we do not secure those opportunities for this country? Quite obviously, our deficit will continue to grow and the number of people we have employed in forestry-there are 70,000 today-will continue to shrink. If, on the other hand, we actually do something about this issue-even belatedly; even now-the opportunities are enormously exciting. A recent report showed that with the right opportunities, including more hardwood plantations, environmentally friendly pulp mills and other value adding, Australia's of current nearly $2 billion a year deficit in forest products could be turned into a $413 million surplus within five years and a $6.5 billion annual surplus by the year 2030. What is more, the job opportunities will see employment rise from around 70,000, which we have at the moment, to over 200,000. Is there anyone in this House, or anyone in this nation, who believes that those opportunities can afford to be missed by this country? Is there anyone? What has the government done? It is only now that we see some action. I come to the question of parliamentary standards and respect for the people's institution. A fundamental point has been highlighted again this week by the Prime Minister's refusal to sack the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in the wake of the Marks royal commission. This man has absolutely no regard for the elementary proprieties of our democratic system. He treats the parliament, and therefore by extension the Australian people, with absolute contempt. His arrogance is nothing short of an insult to the Australian people. That is the bottom line. Not since Gough Whitlam paraded in this place have we been saddled with a Prime Minister who so totally thumbs his nose at parliamentary convention. The frightening aspect of this is that it is having a very serious effect-a corrosive effect, as a journalist put it in this country recently--out there in the broader Australian community. That endearing quality of the Australian people to treat their leaders and their public institutions with a degree of scepticism is changing. It is now rolling over into a hostile and open cynicism-a corrosive, hostile and open cynicism. I often talk to school groups. I never to politicise my conversations with them any way, but when I see school kids I say to them in good faith, 'Stick your paw in the if you have heard your mums and dads that they lack faith now in our parliamentary institutions, if they think politicians make a mess of it and they think behaviour in this place is no good.' Do you know what invariably happens? The whole lot of them put their hands up. I say, 'Put your hands down. How many of you think we ought to be doing a better job of it.' They almost invariably put their hands up again. That is a very frightening thing. Not only is it reflecting the fact the current voters are openly hostile cynical about what we are doing, but it is a clear indication that the next generation as well, unless we do something about it. There is no doubt about it. The prime driver in recent years of that hostility, cynicism and distrust is the man who currently occupies the Lodge. That reason alone is sufficient for tltose who have governed over there for 13 years to go at the next election. A parliareflection mentary democracy is dependent upon faith and trust between the elected and the electors. If you go beyond a certain point, if you corrode that relationship excessively, then you bring the whole thing undone. The whole so great blessing, if you like, of parliamentary democracy starts to unravel. I am delighted to see some journalists start to draw some attention to this in recent days. I do like that word 'corrosive'. It describes well. We are well warned. The Australian his people, I believe, will act on that as soon they are given the opportunity, and that ought to be as soon as possible. Let us return to the issue of the Marks royal commission. We had a total of 14 people testifying there to the effect that the recollection of Carmen Lawrence of the events relating to the tabling of a petition in the Western Australian parliament concerning Penny Easton in 1992 was not accurate. No fewer than eight of those people were former state cabinet ministers in Carmen Lawrence's government. It is extraordinary to be dumped on by eight of your own former cabinet colleagues. The law of averages says that there has to be a greater chance that these seek people are right and Dr Lawrence is wrong. in That is what the commissioner concluded. He found that Dr Lawrence had not told the truth air about the extent of her knowledge of the say petition before it was tabled. The logical, unequivocal and unavoidable consequences of such a finding, according to all accepted parliamentary standards, should be for Carmen Lawrence to offer her resignation or, if she fails to do so, for the Prime Minister to sack her. But it has not happened. Under this administration such proprieties are simply not respected. Carmen Lawrence that did not offer her resignation. The Prime and Minister did not seek it and the Prime also Minister did not sack her, even though the will Western Australian opposition leader, Mr MCGinty, personally told the Prime Minister six months ago that Dr Lawrence's recollection of events was wrong. We still get no action, even though the Prime Minister knew six months ago that his health minister was not being accurate in her of the truth. He knew because he had been told by Jim MCGinty. Even back then he should have demanded that she stand down. But, no, nothing of the sort happened. This question of standards has now become important that the Australian people cannot ignore it. This is their House. This is their institution. And we see this sort of story: 'The incredible shrinking house'. The fact is that the parliament is prevailed it over by a man who has so demeaned not only own position but that of the office that he as occupies that this country must have a change in order that people's faith can be rebuilt, in order that we can cooperate together as one people under a government concerned and determined to pull Australians together as one people, instead of ruling, as this man does whilst talking about us as one Australia, by the old and nasty trick of division.

142,Mr BRERETON,PRIME MINISTER,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (4.51 p.m.)-I am pleased to participate in this debate and the government's censure motion against the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard)-a Leader of the Opposition, I can say, who has diminished by the day this year, diminished almost every day since he became Leader of the Opposition and who has diminished by the minute during this miserable performance that he put on today. This is an opposition leader who in 1995 has set out to disown everything he has ever stood for, who has gone back on every commitment he has given the Australian people for 20 years and who thinks he can slink into office by disowning all of his own principles. It does not matter which area you look at. It does not matter whether it is the industrial relations reform that he held out as the most important single challenge facing modem Australia, facing contemporary politicians, it does not matter whether it is the question of Asian immigration, his views on the monarchy, cutting government expenditure or slashing Medicare, in each and every one of these areas we have seen backflip after backflip. We have seen him back away from every single principle he has ever enunciated over 20-odd years in this parliament. If there is one fundamental reason why he will never be the leader of Australia it is fact that he has shown absolutely that he is not up to the job, not big enough for the job--not able to stand for principle and not able to mark out a clear ground in Australian politics. I am pleased to take part in this debate to draw attention to the deceitful manner in which the Leader of the Opposition has sought to have Australian workers believe that they will not be any worse off under a Howard government. He has set out with the able assistance, I might say, of the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian electorate in a pretence by borrowing the government's rhetoric about the no disadvantage test and saying that they will not be worse off. He pretends at every tum that the opposition's no disadvantage test is really a rough equivalent of the government's no disadvantage test, while all the time their no disadvantage test, of course, is not against the existing circumstances of the worker, not against the total award entitlements of the worker, but against an unspecified list of minima being dribbled out by the member for Flinders. The last one dribbled out was equal pay for work of equal value-something that has been entrenched in the Australian workplace for more than 20 years. People are now supposed to sit back and say, 'Isn't it wonderful? They've given us this marvellous, generous concession,' when the minima is actually going to be equal pay for work of equal value. But, wait for it, when it comes to CRA, when it comes to practice over the last two weeks, what do they propose to do there? There is no support for the union movement in their call for equal pay for work of equal value. Nowhere more so than in industrial relations and transport do you see illustrated, in the greatest possible fashion, the deception, the absolute deceit of the Leader of the Opposition. That is apparent nowhere more so than in the no disadvantage test. Day after day the member for Flinders and the Leader of the Opposition try to deceive Australian workers into thinking they will be protected. Yet all the time they know that under their the policy any worker changing employment will face the contract or not get the job. That has been the situation at CRA for the past two years-a situation that has been addressed by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission using the powers of comand pulsory arbitration provided under the Industrial Relations Reform Act to force the parties to the table, to see a return to work, to see an end to the national maritime dispute, to see an end to the national coal dispute and to see already awarded an 18 months backdated eight per cent pay increase to the workers who have been so badly disadvantaged as a result of the policies promoted by CRA, the sorts of policies the opposition would see the length and breadth of the Australian work force. There is no way that these people can pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian electorate as far as the no disadvantage test is concerned, because Australian workers love their awards, and rightly so. They know that the fundamental protection of the award system is at the very heart and the very soul of what is necessary for their guaranteed security, not only for themselves but for their wives or husbands, as the case may be, and for their whole families. This opposition pretend to talk about the values of the family. What would they do in opposition? Rip away the single most important provision, namely, the guaranteed protection of an award safety. net to provide absolute protection enforced by the Industrial Relations Commission through the application of a strict no disadvantage test. The other thing that the opposition leader should be condemned for is his miserable effort in trying to disguise tions in his respect, because day after day he turns up, says one thing and then immediately backs away from it. He turned up on radio this week and said: To be an effective reformer you've got to be a practical reformer. You've got to understand the mood and the temper of the community and the temper of our people. Of course, this is simply hiding the true intention. It is trying to skate into office on the basis of a blatant, bare-faced lie. That is what it is all about. Mr Reith-I heard that.",108
143,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,l\1r Jeokins)Order! If that comment was attested to an honourable member it should be withdrawn.,109
144,Mr BRERETON,PRIME MINISTER,"I withdraw it accordingly, Mr Deputy Speaker. We saw it best of all illustrated inMr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order",109
145,Mr BRERETON,PRIME MINISTER,"I have withdrawn it. Mr Reith-The minister has also accused the Leader of the Opposition of deceit. Now that we are upholding standards, Mr Deputy Speaker, I invite you to require that allegation to also be withdrawn.",109
146,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,I have asked the minister to withdraw the word lie and that is as far as I intend to go at this stage.,109
147,Mr BRERETON,PRIME MINISTER,"This is the Leader of the Opposition who, two months after Graham Kierath announced his second wave of legislation in Western Australia, went out there and said, 'Terrific, wonderful. Our very template. This will be our model.' We all remember the headlines in the Western Australian newspapers-'Howard-WA is our model'. Mr Reith-That's a lie.",109
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The honourable member for Flinders will withdraw. He knows that he can't get away with that even by way of interjection. Mr Reith-Of course I withdraw. It may be a deceit.,109
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The honourable member for Flinders will cease his absolute inten- interjecting.,109
150,Mr BRERETON,PRIME MINISTER,"This is the most reactionary piece of politics in the industrial relations arena ever introduced in the history of this country-a piece of legislation that would have wreaked bedlam as far as IR in Western Australia is concerned, a piece of legislation that would prevent a worker from having a stop-work on the basis of an occupational health and safety issue, legislation which in its original form would have seen trade union leaders potentially having their goods and chattels, their houses, confiscated on the basis of penalties provided in the instance of encouraging workers to go on strike. Of course, it was withdrawn. The opposition said, 'We didn't endorse the second wave. We never endorsed the second wave. We were only for the first wave.' But, when you look at the first wave, what have you got? You have got, 'Take the contracts or you don't get the job.' You have a miserable minima of $301 per week in Western Australia. That is the first wave. That is what you have endorsed. That was a wage which would have been higher but for the fact that the Western Australian IR minister, Graham Kierath, intervened and knocked over the decision of the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission. What else have they got in Western Australia? There is no no disadvantage test whatsoever; no safety net. That, of course, is the first wave that they say they are endorsing; the first wave that they are proud today to say is a good thing for Western Australia; the first wave that sees nurses paid $5,000 per year less when they change employment, because they lose all the protections of the award system. I tum to the other area of my administration, transport, where we see again the barefaced deceit of the Leader of the Opposition, who would deceive the electors of Sydney into thinking that they will get some relief from aircraft noise. Day after day, he has said that all he wants to do is share the burden; see the noise spread over a wider area of Sydney. But all the time all he really wants to do is prop up his personal support in Bennelong; prop up his own votes to save his own miserable electoral skin. Of course, in the process we see the absolute and utter dishonesty about his true intentions or the effect of those intentions. The reality is very simple and very sweet: he is saying-and the Senate committee majority today said-that they would leave it to Airservices Australia to determine what the flight paths in and out of Sydney airport would be. That is a big change from what they were saying until a few days ago; they were saying that one of their first acts in office would be to reopen the east-west runway. But this week we have seen the Senate majority committee, chaired by the shadow minister for aviation, say that it should be left to Airservices Australia. Of course, Airservices Australia have spelt out their view not once, not twice, but four times in the clearest possible terms, in their position papers, each and every one of them: Civil Aviation Authority, as far back as 30 November 1994; spelt out again on 3 August 1995; spelt out a third time on 14 August 1995 and spelt out a fourth time by Mr Bill Pollard, the new chief executive of Airservices Australia. It was clearly stated that the Airservices Australia organisation believed that parallel runways give capacity and safety. That is their view, yet the opposition would seek to pull the wool over the eyes of the electors of Sydney and say, 'Elect us and suddenly this noise burden will be lifted.' Of course, the opposite will be the case because there is no doubt that, if the opposition had their way, the parallel runways would receive more use, not less use. Airservices Australia have made that clear. This is not really a case of reopening the eastwest runway; it is a case of take-offs to the north on the parallel runway. That is where Senator Parer was well and truly tripped up last Sunday, and he spent most of this week backing away from what he said. I have had the advantage of asking Mr Bill Pollard of Airservices Australia what he believes we should do. I had him in my office yesterday. I said to him, 'You are now the boss of this outfit. If you had the choice of reopening the east-west runway or having take-offs to the north on runway 34 right, which would you choose?' He said, 'We would take 34 right, take-offs to the north, because that would give us greater capacity and greater safety. If we were to have any change in runway configuration, that is what we would do. That would give us 85 take-offs and landings with optimum safety in each direction irrespective of the wind.' That is exactly what the door was left open for by Senator Parer's report brought down in the Senate today. It will not mean less noise; it will mean more noise. It will be no protection from noise. Yet all the time the opposition says, 'Trust us. We are just for sharing the noise burden over Sydney.' The fourth point where the Leader of the Opposition has been absolutely derelict in his duty and has betrayed the interests of Sydney and of all Australian citizens has been the manner in which he has used and abused his Senate numbers only this week to see the bill to provide for the leasing of the airports knocked over most viciously and maliciously in the Senate-a $2 billion hit on the budget forward estimates and at the very same time the destruction of the chance for the completion of Badgerys Creek airport in time for the 2000 Olympics. That is what it means. We all know the critical path and we all know that we are right hard up against it. Unlike the opposition, I have built a few things in my life. I know what it takes to build things. I will tell you what it takes. It needs a darned lot of momentum and it needs some imperatives. We have had the momentum: in the time that I have had responsibility for Badgerys Creek we have seen it drawn up from a 1,800-metre taxiway to a 2,900-metre runway. We have seen provisions made available for the funding of a terminal, a control tower, a general aviation facility and firefighting facilities. We have seen it taken further and expanded to provide for the future development of a 4,000 metre runway. We have seen $500 million committed to this purpose. We have seen almost $500 million committed to building the road infrastructure to link Badgerys Creek to Sydney airport-all told almost $1 billion worth of momentum that this government has built over the last 18 months. That has been destroyed by the decision of the opposition to block the airport leasing bills. What happens when you lose momentum on a great project like this and lose the imperative? Have no doubt that the momentum and the imperative were to get this thing done in time for the 2000 Olympics. That has gone; that has been destroyed. Despite all John Howard's preaching over the years about micro-economic reform and the absolute essential nature of this development of parallel runways at Kingsford Smith airport, today that has been thrown into a complete spin and destroyed as a result of those sitting opposite. If ever there was an example that they are unfit to govern, this is it writ large. (Time expired)",109
151,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"I am pleased to support the motion of censure moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) which in its first paragraph censures the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for his continued economic failure which has created great uncertainty and burdens for families, individuals, young people, seniors, small businessmen and farmers. I must say that the pathetic performance that we have just had from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) is one of the reasons why this government is a failure. He is the minister who you might remember was previously in the New South Wales parliament. He was the minister in charge of the monorail. He was such a disaster as a minister that Barrie Unsworth, when he was the Labor Premier of New South Wales, would not have him on his front bench because the people of Sydney knew what a complete and absolute failure he was. He is now a minister in federal politics. They switched him out of New South Wales, because they knew what a failure he was, and put him into federal politics. In federal politics he has been the minister responsible for the third runway fiasco. He is the minister responsible for ANL, the Australian National Line, which is basically run by the unions and which has been one of the greatest loss making enterprises in the history of the Commonwealth government. He is the minister basically responsible for the system that has allowed the problems at Weipa to happen, which has been one of the great humiliations for this government-particularly when Bob Hawke was brought back by Bill Kelty to solve the issues that the Prime Minister was unable to solve. The man who was responsible for a lot of that was of course none other than the minister who has just spoken-the same minister who is responsible for the failures of this government on the waterfront. The waterfront in Australia is an absolute disgrace. Did you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that today on the Australian waterfront we still have what is known as 'nick off time' . Do you know what that is? It means that as a wharfie you are allocated to work certain hours, yet the union organisers allow for you to take time off-in other words, not to turn up to work-but still be paid for the time that you are at home. In other words, you get paid even though you are not at work. It is called 'nick off time'. This minister is responsible for that system. On the Australian waterfront today we have a system which requires every machine to be operated by at least two people. For example, under the award, under the arrangements with the unions which are endorsed by this government, for one bloke to drive a forklift truck you need another bloke to stand beside him, even though there is no job for that person to do. It is an absolute outrage. And these people are earning on average 75 grand a year. This is the minister responsible for waterfront reform, yet he has the gall to come in here and boast about the government's economic success, as did both the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) in their contributions to the debate and censure motion. The Treasurer said that people overseas look to Australia and are envious of our growth. It is just a sick joke. The Minister for Finance more generally boasted about Australia's economic performance. Quite frankly, this is so obviously and easily contradicted by the evidence that I could spend a lot more time on it, but I want to go to an independent source just to show the extent of the problems in Australia. We do not say that nothing has happened in the last 15 years, and I do not mind saying that the government has done some things by way of economic reform which have been beneficial, but the real question is: has it done enough? A report by MCKinsey, a well-known international economic management consultant, which was put out today says: The Australian economy has undergone significant and extensive reform in the last 15 years. Major government-led changes have transformed its financial system, business regulations and industrial relations environment, and reduced trade protection. There has also been much change of business practices, and in the relationships between employers, employees and unions. Yet despite these efforts, Australia's relative economic prosperity not changed since 1970. Its GDPthat is our national productionper capita is 30 per cent behind the best performing country, the United States ... Most of this gap is due to lower labour productivity, and the remainder to lower employment per capita. In other words, according to MCKinsey, the difference between us and the United States, which is a far better and far more efficient economy than ours, is put down to two things. The first is that we basically have a much higher unemployment position, therefore a lot of our people are not working, so we are falling behind on that score. The second is that we have a very poor productivity performance. If you look at it, it is that poor productivity performance across the Australian economyMr Crean-The only poor productivity is on that side of the parliament.",111
152,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,That is the sort of smart alec comment you get from a minister who basically could not care less that 29 per cent or 30 per cent of our young people are unemployed. Mr Crean-Tell the truth.,112
153,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"No, that is a fact, Minister. You come from a family with an interest in public service, but in your private moments you ought to acknowledge that economic management in the last 13 years has been an absolute and dismal failure. You say, 'Tell the truth.' Have a look at some of the things that the last minister said which are patently not true. Let me demonstrate a couple of them. He said that under the coalition you will face the contract or not get a job, but then he said that that has been the case for the last two years at Weipa. What a nong! What a drongo! That is the position under the Labor Party today. That is your law today. To be attacking the coalition over what is your policy is just incredible. The minister then said that we will remove protection and that Labor gives a guarantee of security. I say to those listening: what does Labor's guarantee of security actually mean? What does it mean for those 28 per cent or 29 per cent of young people has who are unemployed? What sort of guarantee do you give them, Minister? It is a sickening hypocrisy to talk about us reducing people's wages. What has happened in the last 13 years? The official statistics show that average weekly earnings in their totality have actually declined under you people. You have supported every wage increase at the Industrial Relations Commission for the last 13 years. And what has happened? Those wage gains have been lost through inflation, principally, and as a result people are worse off under you. So much for your guarantee-if you are lucky enough to have a job, but even if you do have a job the truth of the matter is that people have been falling backwards. He told another blatant untruth when he said that Westem Australia is our template in respect of the second wave. That is just a joke. I do not mind debating these issues, but why not debate them on the basis of what has been said rather thanMr Crean-He never said it.",112
154,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"I do not respond to your silly interjections, but it just shows the poverty on that side when it comes to substantial debate. The minister also said that Western Australia has no safety net. That is just not true. Mr Swan-What is the minimum wage?",113
155,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"The very interesting thing about the minimum wage in Western Australia is that the state minimum wage is actually higher than a number of federal awards operating in Western Australia. As the glimmer twins from Queensland are in the chamber, it is also higher than the minimum wage set by the state based arbitral tribunal for the south-eastern division of Queensland. On economic performance alone, this government deserves to be censured. The next election will not be a referendum on our industrial relations policy, as claimed by the Prime Minister the other night; the next election should be a referendum on Labor's economic mismanagement. If people were to focus on that very simple, basic issue, then there is no doubt what the result would be the government would be thrown out. It should also be censured on the basis of the Prime Minister's failure to sack the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). This must be one of the most open-and-shut cases I have seen of a minister failing to match appropriate standards. To support my case, I want to refer to some of the remarks of Commissioner Marks, who has examined the minister's conduct in the Easton affair. Let me go to one aspect of his report which was, in a sense, unrelated to the petition. It is an example of the lengths to which the minister has gone to cover up and defend her position. Page 60, paragraph 4.2.10, reads: Dr Lawrence even more clearly told an untruth to the Press Club at Canberra on 19 April 1995 when she said that she knew on Wednesday, 4 November that she would be exonerated in regard to the imprest account: Then he quoted what she said: "". . . I clearly want to debunk the claim that I seized on this petition as a way to deflect attention from a police inquiry into my imprest account. The fact is that the day before the tabling of the petition I was already aware that the inquiry was completed and that I would be exonerated and I checked that detail with the lawyer involved yesterday. That is what she said to the National Press Club. This is what Marks proceeds to say in the next paragraph: On the day before the tabling of the petition Dr Lawrence could not have been 'already aware' that she would be exonerated because the decision not to charge her was not made by the Police Commissioner until the day following tabling. This is an open-and-shut case. She made an allegation that she was aware she would be exonerated by the report, but the report had not been handed down. It is a blatant untruth. Do not worry about the rest of the Easton matter; this minister is caught absolutely cold just by that set of facts. You do not have to believe anybody on this issue. The facts are there--clear and absolutely uncontradicted. The fact of the matter is, as Commissioner Marks said, that what she said to the National Press Club was untrue. This minister does not tell the truth. Even last night there was all this debate about her legal costs. Last night she was reported in the media as saying that if she had known that she might have to foot the bill on some of the legal costs she would not have proceeded with it. That is not true. At the time that she proceeded with her legal claim, to try to stop the commission from inquiring into the truth of her remarks, she knew exactly that there was going to be a controversy about it. There she was, Madam Innocent, attempting to suggest that when the decision was made to proceed with the legal claim she was somehow unaware of the controversy. There were press releases flying backwards and forwards between the opposition and government the day the decision was announced and the day after. For her to say last night that she was an innocent, she did not realise the controversy, is just plainly untrue. You would have to reach the conclusion that the minister is a compulsive liar when it comes to these issues.",113
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Mr Rocher)Order! The member will withdraw that remark.,114
157,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,On the point of order,114
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,There is no point of order. I have directed that you withdraw it.,114
159,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"I withdraw it, Mr Deputy Speaker. But I also draw your attention to the previous use of exactly that term against the member for Chisholm (Dr Woodridge), which was not required to be withdrawn.",114
160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! I think the honourable member is about to reflect on the chair. Whatever may have happened in another context is to be regarded entirely in that context.,114
161,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"I will continue. The Marks royal commission concluded that the minister had failed to tell the truth. The really damning thing about the Marks royal commission is that it relied on evidence not from anybody in the Liberal Party but from her own people. The minister had the gall to say that she did not remember any discussions. Yet we know there was a meeting of the Labor Party shadow cabinet in Western Australia in which they decided-each and every one of themto tell the truth about what happened. The reason that she is under the political pressure that she is still under today, and why the Prime Minister deserves to be censured, is because virtually every last one of them has testified against her. It is no good the Prime Minister blaming the so-called Burke squad. The fact of the matter is that there was no conspiracy. As one of the ministers said in the last day or two, the reason she spoke out was because it was about time the truth was told. In a sense, that is enough to censure the Prime Minister. He has a responsibility beyond his own political interests-in the national interest-to uphold standards. He has singularly failed to do so and he ought to be censured by this House today. (Time expired)",114
162,Mr CREAN,PRIME MINISTER,"I rise to support the amendment moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and to totally reject the proposition moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). It is an opposition which is bereft of talent, which is prepared to hide the nastiness of its policy prescription knowing that it has been rejected before. It is pretending today to be different, more compassionate and more capable. It is none of the above and today's performance in this House, I think, attests adequately to the lack of talent on that side of the parliament. It is also an opposition prepared to resort to deceit, not just in the coverup of its own policy prescription, of its own hidden agenda, but in also depicting the government's record of achievement. I want to concentrate on the area of employment because it seems to be an area that all on that side have alluded to. I make this point at the outset: there is no stronger commitment by this government in any policy area than to getting the unemployment rate down. It is a commitment we are pursuing through sustained economic growth, which has seen 621,000 jobs created since the last election. It is also a policy prescription pursued through the massive commitment of resources to target this time around in the recovery those groups that otherwise would get left behind, the people for whom the economic recovery would pass over-the long-term unemployed and the long-term youth unemployed. It is those groups that we have allocated specific attention to, as well as, I might add, ensuring that the skills level of the country is raised, that we are not just employing people but we are training and skilling them at the same time. We know that the jobs of the future are increasingly going to require certain levels of skills. Unless we address the skill formation agenda sensibly, our capacity to grow as a nation on any sustained basis will be severely restricted. On both counts, the economic growth and the resources, this is a government that has delivered. We saw just yesterday the 17th quarter of economic growth in a row; 51 months of economic growth on the trot. That is the best record achieved since the war. The economic growth which is producing the job activity is a record of significant achievement. On the question of job creation over the term of the government, let us look at the figures between 1983 and today. The labour force has grown by close to 30 per cent in that period and employment has grown by 31.3 per cent. It is the fastest labour force growth and the fastest job creator of all OECD countries in that period. Some failure! As for the performance of the government since the last election, I remind the House of the election commitment that we made and gave primacy to: the creation of 500,000 jobs over the term of this government. This was a promise that was ridiculed by the opposition and by the current Leader of the Opposition, who said, 'It is unachievable and it is an insult to the intelligence of the Australian public that the Labor Party should get up there and promise it.' Promise it we did and deliver it we did. We passed the target six months ago. We have produced 621,000 jobs, not 500,000 jobs, in less than three years. Some failure! I turn to the commitment that the government has made through the Working Nation program, the most significant commitment ever made by a government in terms of resource allocation to lifting employment, the labour force and the skill base of the country-a commitment of $9 billion over four years and we are only one year into it. Look at what that has achieved. We have seen the unemployment rate fall. It is now at 8.7 per cent, but it was at 11.2 per cent. In trend terms, I might add, it is steady at the 8.5 per cent figure. Regarding the long-term unemployed, the people that we said we would re-engage and would not leave behind, of the 621,000 jobs created, over 100,000 of them have gone to the long-term unemployed. You compare that with the economic period from 1983 to 1989 when we also presided over a long growth period in this economy in which, out of the 1.6 million jobs then created, the long-term unemployed only picked up 100,000 jobs. We have bettered that figure when compared with the one six years earlier. That shows the importance of targeted measures. It demonstrates that, by focusing on the real issue and directing resources, we can achieve results. The question of youth unemployment is a critical area for activity. The reason I say that is that the opposition have got no policy to solve youth unemployment. First, they want to send around a bus, the coach of cant, and say that they will consult with youth, and now they have a truck that is going around to highlight the high level of youth unemployment. As the Treasurer (Mr Willis) indicated earlier in his address, to say that youth unemployment is at 27 per cent is just a nonsense. What it is saying is that 27 out of every 100 are out of work. The reality is that it is not 27 out of 100 of the total of the youth cohort, the total of the youth population, because the vast bulk of them remain in school or are in training. It is 27 per cent of those who are not still in school or in training. The reason it is so high is the obvious fact that training and education improves a person's employability. If they have dropped out of school, if they are not undertaking training, their chances of getting employment are significantly reduced. They are harder to place, and we acknowledge that. The simple fact remains that, when John Howard left office, there were 158,000 young people unemployed. Today there are 95,000. That figure is still far too high, but it is a significant improvement on what we had. Yesterday the member for Canberra (Mr Smyth) asked me a question in this House. He asked me why we were no longer publishing the quarterly figures on youth unemployment. My response to the House that, in essence, we were not publishing because of the unreliability of the data was greeted with some derision by the opposition. Maybe the opposition should listen a bit more carefully to what some of their own Liberal colleagues had to say on this point. Listen to this because I think it is important for you when you go around running the lie again. In relation to quarterly unemployment figures, in the Senate estimates committee back in May Senator Tierney said: These figureshe is talking about the same ones referred to yesterdaycome out every month. Do you have any view on the confusion that this is creating? . . . This applies fairly obviously to a small region. The ABS figures tend to bounce around a fair bit because of small samples. He then goes on to state: We have confidence in the ABS figures as quoted for New South Wales. ABS's sampling techniques become very inaccurate at the lower level. Unfortunately, some of our parliamentary colleagues tend to quote these figures if they look favourable in a particular month, which tends to be misleading. Hear, hear! We have found a Liberal that is prepared to tell the truth. This was not true of the member for Canberra yesterday, when he sought to exploit that issue yet again. What did the Chief Minister of the ACT, Kate Carnell, have to say when the Canberra figures came out on youth unemployment under the same analysis? She called on the Australian Bureau of Statistics to rethink its methodology. Mrs Carnell said that it was almost impossible to identify accurate trends because of the data used by the ABS in compiling unemployment levels among the 15to 19-year-olds in the ACT. She is another Liberal-although they are hard to find-who is prepared to tell the truth. I accept that people on the other side want to use figures. They can still have access to the data and produce whatever figures they want, but they at least should be honest enough to acknowledge the unreliability of the data because of the small samples. A point I made yesterday was that I am not trying to address this question of youth unemployment from the basis of just looking at the statistics. However, I think we have to put the issue into some perspective. That is why I have spent some time in terms of the statistics. This government has a huge commitment to addressing youth unemployment as a discrete and targeted measure. We know that training improves a young person's employability. The simple statistics are that you are twice as likely to be unemployed if you do not have year 12 than if you have year 12 or better. Eighty-four per cent of people who go through a traineeship are still in employment 12 months after the traineeship. If those facts are right, what do we need to do to open up traineeships and training options for young people much more effectively? We have done it under Working Nation. We have opened up traineeships in a whole range of industries and areas that hitherto did not have them-areas such as the environment; areas such as arts, sport and the media; areas such as information technology; and areas such as the traditional craft industries of automotive and construction, where we are offering options other than just apprenticeships. The fact that we have opened up traineeships has seen a huge jump in the demand for traineeships in this country. So the demand for that type of labour is responding. We are offering new opportunities for our young people, but I am prepared to go the next step. I am prepared to say , 'Yes, it is a legitimate expectation that if young people go through the training they are entitled to a job.' What we are working on at the moment is making that link. We are putting together the programs that deliver the training at the one end and give the job offer at the other end. That is an initiative that was launched recently and one which I am looking to expand upon. I believe that we as a community have an obligation to the young people of this country. We have to give them new hope and confidence that they can pursue a rewarding career with some dignity. In my view, the report tabled earlier this week that projected where the jobs would be in the year 2005 holds great promise for young people because it says that the jobs are there-2.1 million of them are capable of being secured over the next 10 years. The real issue is how we can prepare young people to be better able to compete for those jobs. We have created 621,000 jobs over the last 2V2 years. But the issue is not whether we can produce the jobs; the issue is how we can get young people into them. The sorts of programs that I have been talking about will get them into jobs. I believe it is important that we do not address this policy as just being good for young people. It also needs to be good family policy, because the most important family policy that we can produce as a government is a policy that ensures children have an opportunity for a rewarding career and a secure future. That is what this government is setting itself to achieve. I have talked about our record, but where does the opposition stand in terms of their policy? They have given up. They have actually said that the five per cent targetwhich is our unemployment target by the year 2000-is unachievable, just as they said that our 500,000 job target was unachievable. Well, we achieved the 500,000 jobs, and we will achieve five per cent unemployment as well. The reality is that only this government is prepared to commit itself to a target. The opposition has given up. What is the point of sending a truck around the country to talk about the problem of youth unemployment if you have given up on reaching an unemployment target? The opposition have also given up on committing resources. The only programs the shadow Treasurer has nominated to be cut if they get into office are the Working Nation programs. The opposition have not recanted on that commitment, yet it is these programs that are bringing the long-term unemployed in, creating new opportunities for youth and creating the opportunities in that pathway from school to work. You cannot say you believe in these things unless you are prepared to commit resources. This is a government that is prepared to not only set targets but also stand on its track record of achievement, commit itself to going further and commit the necessary resources to achieve that objective. We will not be beaten in the race for getting unemployment down. We will achieve our objectives. (Time expired)",114
163,Mr MCGAURAN,PRIME MINISTER,"The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) would have us believe that the solution to youth unemployment is a growth rate of five per cent. Then why is it that the man sitting directly behind the minister at the moment, the Treasurer (Mr Willis), has conceded after the release of the national accounts figures that we can hope for a three to four per cent growth rate? His exact quote on the release of the national accounts yesterday was: We are well set for continued growth in that three to four per cent range. Was Ian Salmon, the president of the Business Council of Australia, wrong when this morning, in response to the national accounts figures and the Treasurer's concession that the government would not meet its grandiose target-which was again reiterated by the minister for employment today-he said: There is every chance that it will dip below three per cent and of course the difficulty taking the longer term is when it will come back. That means that the government will not achieve its target of five per cent unemployment by the year 2000. The Treasurer has conceded it. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has again attempted to hoodwink the parliament by making us believe that the government is keeping to its five per cent growth rate. In regard to yesterday's national account figures, the Treasurer went on to say: If you can bottom out somewhere around the three per cent mark, as we are at the moment, it is a damn good outcome. If that is what we have softened to, who can complain about that? Who can complain about a three per cent growth rate? What about those unemployed who are depending on the government living up to its boast of a five per cent growth rate to achieve that five per cent unemployment target by the year 2000? It is a fact that the three per cent growth rate will mean that unemployment will continue to rise from its present very high level. The Treasurer asked us who could complain about the three per cent growth rate. What about Australia's 787,000 unemployed, 600,000 underemployed and 500,000 hidden unemployed? Aren't they entitled to complain about the failure of the government's economic policy to achieve sustained economic growth? That is exactly who should complain. The fact that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training could come into the parliament and stick to his well-worn script of a five per cent growth rate as being the solution to all of our economic problemsparticularly the tragedy of youth unemployment-is exactly why we are censuring the government. We are censuring this government for the failure of its economic policies and for the economic hardship that has affected so many small businesses, ordinary men and women, and farmers. We are also censuring the government because of the inability of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to uphold the standards required of the office of Prime Minister. The Prime Minister and his government have done nothing, as we cite in our censure grounds, except deliver false dawns. There has been a failure to deliver what the government and the Prime Minister have promised. The performance by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training summarises what is so corrupt about this government. Once those opposite take hold of a lie they will never let it go. They will restate it endlessly, they may re-dress it, but the fact is they will hold firm rather than make any concession because once a concession is made the whole sorry mess will begin to unravel. One of the most revealing-if not the most revealing-statements we have heard from the government today was from the Prime Minister himself. Towards the end of his address on the censure motion he said, 'I told my wife Annita, ""We have got this one won.'"" He was referring to the election. How self-delusory can you be? The Prime Minister has a track record for deluding himself. He thought he won the last election on the basis of his own personal following and on his government's policies. On our side of politics we concede that we lost the election. Any member of the government with a modicum of common sense and political judgment knows that to be the truth. The government won because it lied and distorted the public policy debate. To this day the Prime Minister will cut off without a second thought anybody whom he believes is not a true believer. Do you know how he defines a true believer? Anybody who credits him wholly and solely with winning the last election! We welcome this self-delusory complex that has enveloped the Prime Minister. He is so out of touch. How many other members of the government inside or outside this place are prepared to corroborate the Prime Minister? Who is going to stand up and say, 'We have got this one won?' Come on, where is your courage? Will the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee )-who is at the table-say that he has this one won? Is he going to walk away from the Prime Minister? The minister is very fond of posing questions to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) during question time. I am now asking him a question. Will he corroborate the Prime Minister's statement that the government has the next election won? Will the marginal seat holders in the electorates of Page, Richmond, MCMillan, MCEwen and Leichhardt say that they have the next election won? The moment the Prime Minister made that remark it resurrected their that greatest fears of him. You could see it on their faces. The Prime Minister is so out of touch and so removed from ordinary Australians and the political process that he will follow blindly his present destructive economic policy. He believes that he can retain competent and untruthful ministers such as the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) without any political retribution. We are happy for those opposite to believe that. We do not believe that we have this election won. We are going to earn the votes of the Australian electorate. We do not take them for granted. The Prime Minister does. We are not going to conduct a campaign of fear and loathing such as the Prime Minister will in concert with the trade union movement-as the leaked documents have revealed. The Prime Minister stood in this House this week and said, 'No matter what the Leader of the Opposition says on social security, health and industrial relations, don't believe him. Don't believe a single word he says on any of those subjects.' How is there going to be informed political debate in this country when the Prime Minister sets out from the start to totally debase the exchange of views and the airing of policies to the Australian people. Australians must understand who is entirely responsible for the erosion of standards and principles in public life today. The Prime Minister will not credit the opposition with even the beginning of a public debate, let alone the conclusion of one. If the members of the government are so confident and so sure that they have the next election won, why are they all running as Independents? Why have almost all of them, save for those in safe blue-ribbon Labor seats, disaffiliated themselves in their advertising material from the Australian Labor Party? Will someone in the band of government marginal seats stand up and produce some material which identifies the Labor Party and its titular head, the Prime Minister? Of course not! They want to distance themselves from the Prime Minister to the greatest extent humanly possible. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister is complacent. His megalomaniacal description of the result of the next election will have sent a shiver up the collective spines of the government backbench. Because the Prime Minister is so out of touch he does not recognise the failings of the minister for health. Nobody in Australia believes that she has told the truth over the Easton affair. How can they? Eight of her ministerial colleagues and several of her personally appointed staff-the whole lot of them paid up members of the Labor Party-took a completely opposite view from the recollection of the minister for health. Consistently inside and outside this place the minister for health's defence has been that her recollection is different from those other people. With the passage of time that is fair enough. The Prime Minister has very lamely repeated that defence at the dispatch box. However, we have to remember that three days after the death of Penny Easton the minister for health set out that defence in the Western Australian parliament. That was only a few days after the infamous cabinet meeting where she said that the Easton petition was not discussed. She is reported in the Western Australian Hansard as saying that it was not discussed. We are not asking her-nor did Mr Marks-two or three years after the event to set out her recollection and compare it with those of her cabinet colleagues and staff. No, her recollection was set down only six or seven days after that infamous cabinet meeting. There is no possibility that her recollection was dimmed with the passage of time. She was caught out telling an untruth, yet she remains a senior member of cabinet under the prime ministership of Paul Keating. The fact that he wants her to remain there serves the political advantages and purposes of the opposition. The longer she remains there the more angry the Australian electorate becomes and the weaker her contrived and specious attacks on our health policy become. But, because we adhere to the standards of ministerial responsibility, we want her removed. The government is not doing itself any service in a political sense by retaining her. She should be removed so that we can again entrench this concept of political and ministerial responsibility. Of course, the government will lash out in all directions to protect her. Again we saw the colour drain from the faces of those on the Labor benches when the Prime Minister said that it was a Burke squad attack on her that brought her down. He says that, on the one hand, it is a Liberal Party conspiracy but, on the other hand, it is really a Labor Party conspiracy. It is a conspiracy by the Burke squad. Mr Hicks-Which one do we believe?",117
164,Mr MCGAURAN,PRIME MINISTER,"Yes, which one do we believe? We know very well that it was members of the Labor Party honestly and genuinely stating the truth that brought her of the down. She was the instrument of her own destruction. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) is a member of the Burke squad. Is it any wonder that the Deputy Prime Minister exploded with rage over the dumping of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell)-a good friend? It was the straw that broke the camel's back. First, the Deputy Prime Minister had to there in humiliation hearing the Prime Minister attribute the downfall of Dr Lawrence to the Burke squad, of which he is a paid-up and leading member. He was the one who gave a reference for disgraced and gaoled Brian Burke in court. So of course he is a close friend, then and now. But his personal loyalty is not the issue. that he has been tagged as a member of the Burke squad which conspired together within the Labor Party to bring down the minister for health. Then two days later, he is not consulted the stripping of the member for Kalgoorlie's preselection and all of the political consequences that will have for the Western Australian division of the Deputy Prime Minister. It has been made known that he angrily confronted the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) because he knows the Prime Minister thinks so little of him that he did not bother to ring him, any more than Bill Kelty bothered to ring the Prime Minister to consult him on Bob Hawke's appointment. So there is a total lack of communication within the Labor Party. The Prime Minister does not ring the Deputy Prime Minister on the sacking of the member for Kalgoorlie. Bill Kelty, supposedly the Prime Minister's closest friend--certainly in the trade union movement, possibly outside politics-and his key witness of the Kirribilli agreement, does not ring him as he is about to humiliate him with the appointment of Bob Hawke. What is this? Bob Hawke paying out on Kim Beazley, humiliating him deliberately in the eyes of party, the press gallery and the general public as some sort of weird payback for his own humiliation by Bill Kelty. This Prime Minister is not fit to lead this country. He has brought down the standards of the office of the Prime Minister and, by extension, the standards of the elected chamber of the people of Australia-the House of Representatives. We censure the Prime Minister.",119
165,Mr LEE,PRIME MINISTER,"Dobell-Minister for Communications and the Arts and Minister for Tourism) (5.51 p.m.)-It is always interesting to hear a contribution from the honourable sit member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran). He is usually a cheery little fellow who sits over there with nice interjections. But you have to make a comparison between the honourable member for Gippsland and the person he followed into this chamber. Just think back to his predecessor, Peter Nixon, and the contribution that he made to this chamber in the The issue is Old Parliament House. You would not have had Peter Nixon supporting the privatisation of Telstra or the deregulation of Australia Post because of what that would have done to people who live in in the bush. You would not have had the National Party of Doug Anthony rolling over and letting the Liberal Party tell them that they are going to privatise Telstra or they are going to deregulate Australia Post. You certainly would not have had the member for Gippsland's predecessor, Peter Nixon, tapping the mat and letting the Liberal Party say what they are going to wreak on rural and provincial Australia if they have their way. But it is good to have the member for Gippsland here in this chamber. It is probably an alternative to having the boys run the family business, and for that reason alone we are pleased to have him here. The point I would like to make is that this censure motion gives us a chance to look at the comparison between the policies and the achievements of this government versus the alternative which the opposition has tried to put forward in the last years it has been in opposition. If you take a quick snapshot of what has been achieved by the government in the the last three years, you cannot help but be impressed. We are the first federal government that has been prepared to address an issue, such as Mabo, that is of national importance in this country. I know it upsets you in the National Party that the government had the courage to address it, but we did. We have provided more stability for people who want to invest in mining and other development issues, as well as giving Aboriginal Australians their right to proper recognition of native title. We have been able to address the issue of unemployment. Through Working Nation we have put a massive amount of resources into making sure that more Australians have got a chance to get a job, that young Australians are better trained to get a job and in particular that those who have been out of work for the longest get the greatest assistance from the government in getting back into the work force. Through the efforts of the Prime Minister we have been able to pull off the Bogor declaration, pull off a free trade area in the Asia-Pacific region which will ensure that Australia, as a country that benefits trade, continues to get greater access into markets in the Asia-Pacific region. We have been able to make sure that through Creative Nation we are looking after our cultural industries and we are making sure that Australia remains at the leading edge in the development of new forms of communications technology. Through the reforms in superannuation, are building up Australia's national savings and we are making sure that more Australians have enough money behind them on their retirement so that they do not have to rely privatise it. only on the pension. Through the drought relief package, we have made sure those ty farmers who were hurt hardest by the drought received assistance from the federal governhave ment. We have led the debate on the republic, much to the outrage of a few people on the other side of the House. We have had the telecommunications review, the most important review that has been released this year, and, of course, next week we will have the Prime Minister releasing the innovation statement. So we have had a whole series of month after month indicating that the government is taking forward the policy debate and making sure that Australia is ready for the important issues that are before the country. The alternative was adequately explained the front-page of the Australian today. The headline was 'The risk of becoming an invisible man' and it stated: John Howard has managed to make himself so small a target for Labor that he runs the risk of becoming invisible to the electorate. That sums it up: the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the incredible shrinking man, the man who says that truth is so important to him. This is what he said on 25 August 1995: We want to assert the very simple principle that truth is absolute, truth is supreme, truth is never disposable in national political life. The man who says he supports truth is the man who does not want to tell us what his policies are, the man who refuses to outline the policy details of the Liberal and National parties in the lead-up to the next election and the man who refuses to take the Australian from free people into his confidence. Let me just run through a few of the issues where we do not know what the opposition will do. The first is on Telstra and the opposition's bland commitment to privatise Telstra. We had the Leader of the Opposition making it clear that, as far as he is concerned, he will have the foreign telephone companies having a large chunk of Telstra. We have had we Senator Alston, the official spokesman on communications, making it clear that there will be significant foreign telephone companies owning shares in Telstra when they Now the shadow minister with responsibilifor privatisation, the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), who is at the table, happens to a different view. She was in the paper a week ago saying that she will not let the foreign telephone companies own any shares in Telstra, even if it means that she gets $10,000 million less for the sale of Telstra-a $10 billion lower price because she will not let the foreign telephone companies have a chunk of Telstra. That is a totally different position from that of both the Leader of the measures Opposition and Senator Alston. The Australian people have to ask themselves: do they want British Telecom to own 49 per cent of Telstra? Do they really want American Telephone and Telegraph to have on 49 per cent of Telstra? Do they want France Telecom to have a big chU!lk of Telstra? I can tell you this: if the opposition privatises Telstra and the foreign telephone companies have got a large chunk of Telstra, I do not want those foreign telephone companies making decisions about Australia's future telecommunications infrastructure. I certainly do not want them deciding whether or not Telstra will be up in Asia winning business for Australia, making Australia the telecommunications hub for the region. Why would British Telecom let its part owned subsidiary, Telstra, be up in the region competing with British Telecom for business? That is the important question you have to ask. If the opposition do privatise Telstra, even if the shadow minister at the table has her way and there are no foreign telephone companies owning Telstra today, what stops them owning it in the future? What stops the new owner of Telstra, once it is privatised, breaking Telstra up and selling off the most profitable bits-selling off the mobile telephony, selling off the international businessleaving nothing but the loss making areas in the bush. If you take away the cross-subsidies for Telstra, the people in the bush are the ones who will be hit hardest by the privatisation of Telstra. The people in the bush are the ones who want to know what the Leader of the Opposition means when he says he will privatise Telstra. On Australia Post we have seen that the Leader of the Opposition has said that he wants to implement the Industry Commission report on Australia Post. He wants to deregulate our postal services. I will tell you what that means. It means that 1,300 post offices will close; it means that there will be 9,000 jobs lost; it means that the Liberal Party is arguing to walk away from the standard letter rate across the country. That is, if someone in the gallery sends a letter to some relations in the bush, they will be paying more than the standard letter rate-more than 45c to send a letter to the bush. If you happen to live in the bush and you have to pay the real price for every letter that you send to business colleagues or every bill that you pay which gets sent to the capital city, that is going to cost an absolute fortune. When John Howard said he wanted to implement the Industry Commission report into deregulating Australia Post he was saying that he supports the introduction of what they call the maximum affordable price for postal services. That means that the Leader of the Opposition thinks that once you deregulate Australia Post they should be charging whatever they think the consumer can afford to pay. It certainly means that we will no longer have that standard letter rate or the freeze on that 45c standard letter rate that we have had from 1992, and that is going to stay until 1997. It is going to mean that all those post offices will close and that jobs will be lost. Why? Because they are obsessed with this dry, rationalist economic agenda. The shadow minister at the table, the member for Mackellar, is the one who fights hardest for that Thatcherite policy and believes most strongly in privatising and deregulating. So perhaps the onus is on her to tell us why they believe in implementing that Industry Commission report. On cross-media ownership, the government has stated very clearly that we stand by the limits on it. The member for Mackellar and the Leader of the Opposition in 1991 signed a petition saying they were against any further increase in media concentration; they were against Mr Packer getting control of the Fairfax group. Yet in more recent times we have had the Leader of the Opposition walk away from that commitment of 1991. He was asked about this by Ray Martin who said: What about the suggestion that in fact you were party to a petition in 1991 that called for tougher rules? at least The Leader of the Opposition said: Well that was the Opposition's policy at that particular time. I wasn't the leader then and I wasn't the spokesman on communications. I went along as a team player. What happened to the idea that truth is supreme and that truth is never disposable in national political life? Apparently it is disposable on cross-media ownership because the Leader of the Opposition has a very different position today from the one he had in 1991. He refuses to answer that very specific question, 'Do you think someone should be able to own a newspaper and a television station in the same city?' He says he will have a review. He will do anything but give us a clear outline of the opposition's policy. Come the next election we are going to have a very clear choice: a leader who has introduced the reforms of Mabo, Working Nation, Bogor, Creative Nation, the republic, the innovation statement, the drought relief package and superannuation; or a furry ball. The choice is a leader like the Prime Minister or a man who has rolled himself up into a cuddly little furry ball and refuses to tell Australian people where he stands on these issues. I don't think the people of Australia want a furry ball for their Prime Minister.",120
166,Mrs BISHOP,PRIME MINISTER,"I look at the motion that was moved by John Howard earlier this afternoon. The censure against the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) deals with a number of topics. The first is the Prime Minister's continued failure to give economic prosperity. He has created great uncertainty and burdens for families, individuals, young people, seniors, small businessmen and farmers. The second is that the Prime Minister has failed to uphold the standards required of a Prime Minister. The third is that he has failed in his policy to deliver anything but false dawns; and the fourth is that he has continued to fail to deliver what he promised. I rise to speak in this debate because of my concern for my country. I came into politics because I wanted to have a say in what happened to my country. History taught me that there were two groups of people in the world: those who had decisions made for them and those who were part of that decision making process. In speaking to this debate, I want to make the point: there is an0ther way. The Prime Minister has followed the philosophy of collectivism, of which socialism is one part-and it doesn't work. It delivers lower standards of living, greater dependency and less freedom. Our parties are worlds apart. Ours is a party that believes in the freedom of the individual and in the principles of free enterprise. Free enterprise can offer this country a different of policies and a different way that leads to the prosperity of all Australians. That is what this next election is going to be about. The principles of free enterprise are as immutable as the laws of gravity. They tell us several things. The first is that government doesn't have any money of its own; it has only the money that it first takes from the earnings and savings of individuals. When it gives money away it has to take it from the earnings and savings of individuals. There is no such thing as government money. It is taxpayers' money. When the Prime Minister says, 'This is as good as it gets,' for him that is true. He has the a house worth $2.2 million and a very high standard of living for himself and his family. But what about the ordinary punter and the mums and dads for whom there was no recovery at all. That is exactly what has happened in this country: there is no recovery for ordinary folks. Again and again when you go to open a trade fair or you talk with small business people-and these are the people who survived the recession we had to have and are supposedly in this recovery periodyou find they are struggling to make ends meet and, at every tum, they find that government oppresses them. The principles of free enterprise can work for this nation because they tell us that the business of government is twofold: it's about providing those things which the private sector cannot or will not provide and providing for those who cannot provide for themselves. Yet here we have in government a Prime Minister who seems to be hell-bent on destroying this country which he then thinks he can leave to go and live somewhere in Europe. It is either that or we have a Prime Minister who is no longer able to make decisions for the benefit of all Australians; who is so isolated and perturbed that you could say he needs help to straighten out his mental condition. His bad language, his failure to follow the rules of decency and his upholding of lies as an acceptable way of parliamentary life show a complete and absolute lack of morality and ethics in government. I define morality very simply as the motive and intention behind the set action. We condemn this government for what it has done; that is, it has lowered our standard of living, brought uncertainty to thousands of families, failed in policy to give direction whereby the country can prosper, and failed to deliver on the Prime Minister's promises. Of these, probably the failure to deliver on the tax cuts which were made l-a-w law is the most cynical of the lot. In this parliament we hear the Prime Minister again and again in a reckless manner attempt to assert lies as being the truth, on the basis, presumably, that if you repeat it a number of times it makes it stick. I heard the Prime Minister, who described the Senate as swill, stand the other day and say somehow that it was the opposition which had no respect for the institutions of our countrybut it is the other way around. It is shown at every tum that there is no respect for the institution of parliament or the conventions that attach to it whereby resignation is required if a minister is found to have lied, as has happened in this place. This censure, fundamentally, is about the failure to deliver economically for the people of Australia. I think it is time to look at some good concrete figures. Let us look at some distinctions between Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The OECD indicators of living standards, namely the GDP per capita and private consumption per capita, are used to assess Australia's performance relative to that of New Zealand and the United Kingdom. While New Zealand's position in the top GDP per capita countries improved between 1970 and the early 1990s, and Britain's remained unchanged, Australia's position fell by five places-from 12th to 17th. The average increase in OECD countries in GDP per capita in the same period was 505 per cent. Britain and New Zealand both exceeded this average by scoring an increase of 515 per cent and 616 per cent respectively. Australia, on the other hand, managed only 377 per cent. While Australia had a substantially higher living standard in the late 1960s relative to the United Kingdom and New Zealand, this comparative advantage has all but disappeared. In 1972 New Zealand's GDP per capita was half that of Australia's. In 1990 it was three-quarters that of Australia's. Similarly, Britain's GDP per capita was 76 per cent that of Australia's but in 1990 it increased to 99 per cent. Australia has scored even worse, using consumption per capita as an indicator of living standards. The OECD average increase in consumption per capita, again between 1972 and 1990, was 390 per cent. Britain and New Zealand both exceeded that average, achieving increases of 437 per cent and 740 per cent respectively. Australia, on the other hand, achieved a below average growth of 342 per cent. Furthermore, in 1972 New Zealand's consumption per capita was 49 per cent of Australia's, while in 1990 the percentage increased to 90 per cent. In 1972 British consumption per capita was 82 per cent of Australia's. In 1990 Britain surpassed Australia, with a 106 per cent increase. Australia very simply deserves better. The philosophical backup of the policies that this government has put in place over the last 13 years has resulted in this drop in the standard of living. This uncertainty has resulted in parts of our society no longer being able to cope. We have the highest youth suicide rate in the world, something that must be a shame in this country. Where are our provisions for leadership in this federal parliament, in the government ranks, to set standards and to set examples for the way young people should aspire to behave? Is it surprising that so many young people lose hope, that they do not see that there is any opportunity for them in this land under this government, that they do not see that there is a future for them? What a tragedy it is that somehow those sitting on the other side of the table think that is amusing. In debating this censure, my colleagues have outlined again and again instances of where this government has let the people down. They have dealt with, one after another, the way convention is broken, the way standards are broken, the way bluster, toughing it out, seems to have become the order of the day . We have had the supreme example in this very House. We have had the Solicitor-General say that the only reason that the Commonwealth government, and thereby the taxpayer, could be held responsible for paying the legal bills of Carmen Lawrence was that the royal commission in Western Australia was testing whether she was fit for public office. We then had the Prime Minister say that he is going to pay no attention to the findings of that royal commission and force through in this set of appropriation bills, namely Appropriation Bill (No.4), payment of certain of those bills, having acquiesced to the Senate's determination that those parts of the fees which were attributable to Carmen Lawrence's attempt to shut down the royal commission should not be paid. Compare the sheer effrontery of the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) saying that he would introduce it again next year to recoup that money so that all of Carmen Lawrence's bills would be paid by the taxpayer with the difficulties that ordinary folks have in getting legal aid. In New South Wales there is, for instance, virtually no money left for civil actions. It is hard to get money for criminal actions. Certainly nothing like $800,000 is made available. There is also nothing like $5,000 a day being paid for a top silk coming right across the continent to present the case. So we see here two standards. We see one standard for the government, which is that the only people who prosper under this Labor government are those who lead it. The current Prime Minister, when he said it is never going to get any better, was quite right-for him personally, and for his mates. But ordinary people simply want the right to their hopes and aspirations; the right to see their children grow and reach their horizons of hope; the right to see a nation that is proud of the leadership that it gets. Those are the things that this country is entitled to. As I said, I rise to speak in this of concern for my nation, the Australian people, and concern for the fact that we have a government that continues to let them down. I stress that if we follow those principles of free enterprise then we too can return to prosperity and the sort of hope that the Australian people are entitled to. The speaker before me, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), attempted again to use one of those sets of lies which he intends to repeat. I want to set down for the record the guiding principles",123
167,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,"Mr Jenkins)Order! If the honourable member was suggesting that the minister lied, that comment should be withdrawn.",125
168,Mrs BISHOP,PRIME MINISTER,I will put it this way: the minister misrepresented my position so that it was a total untruth. If you prefer the word 'untruth' and not 'lie' then so be it.,125
169,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Is the honourable member withdrawing?,125
170,Mrs BISHOP,PRIME MINISTER,"I withdraw the word 'lie' and replace it with the word 'untruth'. The commitments that we have given for the privatisation of Telstra are fourfold. Firstly, it will remain in Australian ownership with mechanisms put in place to ensure that we do not see a repeat performance of what happened with Qantas, where Qantas fell into the hands of foreigners because of the government's failure to put a proper mechanism in place. It will remain in Australian ownership because we want to see it strong and prosperous and owned not by a minister of the Crown but by the people. Secondly, community service obligations as they exist will continue to exist. There will be no cessation of them. They will be maintained. All that nonsense that the minister went on about that we would do away with them is totally and utterly false. Thirdly, untimed local telephone calls will remain both for individual, that is residential, and business consumers. Fourthly, we will not use the proceeds to squander recurrent expenditure, as this government has done with all the products of its privatisation, but we will ensure that they are used primarily for the retirement of debt. The debt legacy that this government has left to the nation has debate out to be attacked. (Time expired)",125
171,Mr SNOWDON,PRIME MINISTER,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (6.18 p.m.)-What a gormless performance. With the histrionics that have come from the opposition this afternoon you would think we were looking at a session of Hancock's Half Hour. The comedy which we have seen come from the opposition is entirely appropriate that sort of show. It is the sort of reporting you would see on Newsfront: That is what we have heard from the opposition-these policy eunuchs on the other side-these people who would seek power without purpose; these people who have no idea of what policy really means; these people who follow a leader who slip slides around, backflipping at every tum. He would make the gymnastics squad-of that there would be no doubt-or at least the high board diving team. But one thing is for certain: were he a member of that we know what would happen; he would come down with a flop. That is exactly what he has done this afternoon. We have seen the beginning of the end for Mr Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, this person who would have us believe that he is the model of integrity; this person who would have us believe that he is a model of honesty; this person who would have us believe that he is a person of such integrity that he would never seek to mislead the Australian community. But is this not the same person who prior to the 1983 election failed to disclose the deficit of $9 billion when he had the information a week before the election? Is this the same person? Is this the same John Howard? Is it? Of course it is. We have seen the third reincarnation of him as the Leader of the Opposition. We have seen the reclothing or re-suiting of Little Johnny. We have seen him try to move his policy position. But the Australian community will not be fooled by this. We have heard this afternoon-this was clearly demonstrated by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), the Treasurer (Mr Willis), the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) in their own portfolio areas-about the sorts of recanting that has taken place by the Leader of the Opposition. He has tried to resuit himself. But the questions which have been continually asked from this side of the House and from the Australian community, and which are based on this theme of honesty and for integrity, are these: who is he, what is he, where is he, what does he stand for, where is he coming from and where does he want to take us? He has never told us. We know where he has come from. We know that he is trying to reclothe himself and reposition himself. He is trying to minimise himself as a target. This country has addressed a number of very important social issues over the last few years. They could only have been tackled by a Labor government. The most important of them in many respects was the Mabo decision. What did we see when the opposition were confronted with the prospect of debating the native title legislation in this place? We saw the opposition, as they have done on every piece of progressive legislation in this House since 1983, oppose it. We know that when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) spoke about the importance of the native title legislation and Mabo on 10 December 1993-it was a landmark speech in Australian history in Redfern-he said this: By doing away with the bizarre conceit that this continent had no owners prior to the settlement of Europeans, Mabo establishes a fundamental truth and lays the basis for justice. Never a truer word was spoken. Then we saw the opposition climb into bed with Mr Court in Western Australia. I was in the Senate the night that the Mabo legislation was passed. I saw the opposition vote against the legislation. We then had the opposition leader in his famous wetlands speechMr Cleary-Wastelands speech.",125
172,Mr SNOWDON,PRIME MINISTER,"It was the wastelands speech. I thought it might have been the wetlands speech, because it was certainly full of liquid. We know that, in the area of Aboriginal affairs, he now says the Mabo decision was correct. The opposition having taken the government through the process of sacrificing the principles of Mabo in an attempt to amend the legislation in many respects, and having made sure that Aboriginal people and indigenous Australians were confronted by the prospect of a political divide because of the opposition's shameless behaviour, the Leader of the Opposition now says that they accept the Mabo decision. What sort of policy contortion are we supposed to perceive from that? What sort of contortion, in terms of his political activity, are we supposed to perceive from that? We then heard-these are the most important words in this so-called headland speechhim make this rider on the acceptance of Mabo: However, we reserve the right to amend the Act to ensure its effective operation. What does that mean? What is that code for? That is code for slipping into the legislation and every Aboriginal organisation in Australia that supports Mabo. Mr Howard described those people in his wetlands speech in the following way: The whole Aboriginal policy area has been hijacked by the social engineers, the politically other sundry groups more intent on dividing than uniting our community. Is he kidding? Who is he trying to fool? The only people who have sought division on this issue in the Australian community have been those in the opposition. They are led by the Leader of the Opposition, who now seeks to reclothe himself and recant. The opposition's immigration policy is a doozey. This government is very proud of its immigration policy, and so it should be. It should be proud of its policy on multiculturalism. The nation is proud of it, but the opposition is not. What did the Leader of the Opposition say in 1988 about Asian immigration? I am sure that you remember. You do not want to listen to it, but you will remember. I will quote from an article in the Australian on 2 August 1988: It would be in our immediate term interests and supportive of social cohesion if itAsian immigrationwas slowed down a little so that the capacity community to absorb it were greater. On 11 August 1988, he said this in a news release: I stand by my comments of the past two weeks on immigration and ethnic affairs. He stood by them. He continues: I will not modify viewsthese are very strong wordsdesigned to put the national interest and national unity at the forefront of decisions on immigration and related matters. Understand that these words are very important; they say a lot. He then goes on to say: The views I have expressed have been carefully formulated and progressively articulated in various forums around Australia over the past six months. They were not said off the top of his head. They were not made up on the spur of the moment. He thought about these words. These were well-considered ideas and opinions. He was saying to the Australian community, 'I want to change the Australian policy. I do not like the fact that we have Asian immigration.' What did he say this year? He came out and tried to recant this year. His words appeared in an extremely interesting article. correct and I will read what he said: The concerns that I expressed at that time seven years ago were in the context of the emphasis that I always believe we ought to put on the things that unite us as Australians rather than the things that divide us. These were well-considered views that he was expressing for some months. They did not come off the top of his head. He is now trying to recant. What do the community think about that? There is a very interesting article in a magazine called Chamber News, which is put out by the Western Australian Chinese Chamber of Commerce. Its editorial says this: In 1988, he managed to divide Australians with his remark that Asian immigration had to be slowed or else the country would face dire social consequences. Seven years is an extremely long time in politics. One would think that people had forgotten those comments. His re-election as opposition leader changed all that. His infaof the mous comments came back to haunt him to the extent that, for much of his travels around the country at the time the article on page 5 appeared, he had to qualify his remarks many times. The editorial also says: His own silence in the preceding years about what he really meant when he mouthed those words haven't helped to improve his credibility, especially among Australia's Asian population. That is the fact of the matter. What we have seen from this man over the last few months has been an attempt to try to beguile the Australian community and reclothe himself. He is really the big bad wolf who is saying, 'Come into the bedroom and look at me. Aren't I nice and terrific?' But he really is not. We are not fooled. The Leader of the Opposition is a person without substance. He talks about standards when he has none. He talks about honesty when he is dishonest. He talks about having policy when he has none. This motion puts very squarely on the table where the opposition stands. It shows that they are without substance, policy, integrity and leadership. The opposition leader should be condemned for his position.",126
173,Mr CLEARY,PRIME MINISTER,"It is very difficult to decide which way to go on this censure motion. If I understand the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) correctly, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is the closest thing to a baby eater-a megalomaniac who basks in his own glory and tolerates appalling standards amongst his own ministers. He is apparently a bloke not fit for office who should never have been allowed to lead this country. By coincidence, everyone on the Prime Minister's side rejects that view of the Prime Minister. It just happens to line up that way; it is a quirk of fate. The PM, for his part, reckons that the bloke on the other side is nothing but a Queen-loving lickspittle, a little tory from outer Sydney. That is what he says. I cannot say that I necessarily agree with him. How anyone could take this censure motion seriously is beyond me. You would have to be almost brain dead to believe that this is a serious debate. Anyone who believes that the Marks royal commission was set up with honest intentions has to be kidding. It does not matter whether the commissioner is a good bloke or an ex-communist and follows particular procedures to the letter, it still would not prove that the Marks commission was a decent political activity, because it was not. It was a witch hunt. There is absolutely no doubt about that. The commission was set up for political reasons. It was set up as a political payback. The idea that people could come into this House day in and day out and argue that the royal commission was set up to actually search for some kind of information that would be relevant to the Australian public absolutely astounds me. No-one out in punterland actually believes that, except for a few turkeys-they do not even believe it in here, they just claim they believe it. What is really more to the point, and I said this the other day: why did John Halden take that disreputable petition into the House? Why haven't members in this House actually said that that sort of practice is disreputable and should not be used by politicians? When the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) made accusations about former Senator Richardson, the people on the Labor side jumped to their feet to condemn him for it. It was the same when another member made accusations about public servants. There was a concern then about the propriety of parliament, but when it came to the Halden petition no-one would talk about it. My learned friend the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) will tell you it is compulsory, it is an obligation, to lodge petitions. He says it is an obligation to lodge the petition, but the advice from this parliament is that the parliamentary rules in Western Australia are silent on the matter. But that is a matter for another time. The question is: if it is compulsory, why would a person not dissociate himself from a petition of that kind? Something stank in Western Australia; there is no doubt about that. If the coalition were sitting on the other side and one of their ministers was asked to resign after a political witch hunt, they would be defending the minister to the back teeth. They would be defending her every single day and they would pull out every sanctimonious line to do it. Mr Andrew-Give an illustration. Which minister?",128
174,Mr CLEARY,PRIME MINISTER,"I know what you would be doing. You would not be condemning your minister; you would be publicly saying it was a witch hunt. When it comes to the crunch, what separates the Labor Party from the Liberal Party is nothing like what the myth makers would have us believe. The fact is both parties gloat about cutting government expenditure, both are addicted to privatisation, both accept deregulation of the labour market and both accept foreign ownership of Australian industry. So when it comes to the crunch, what does separate the two sides of this House? Some of the social issues separate them. Of course, on the issue of Mabo you find that the coalition is reactionary. On the issue of the republic you find that the coalition cannot embrace it, cannot understand that it will be a fact of and want to run around making out they are monarchists and love queens. So be it. But assurances by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) that he is an economic nationalist and that he would not let Telstra be taken over by foreign interests are laughable. The idea that the minister for communications would actually not let Telstra be privatised and would stop it being taken over by foreign interests is an absolute giggle. Let us look at all the assets this government has sold one after the other. Each time the barrier is lowered, and there is another excuse for selling off another public utility. I just cannot believe the minister and the fact that he can come in here and with a straight face tell us that he is opposed to privatisation. He would not let a foreign company own Telstra? The bloke who runs Telstra at the moment is an American. His name is Rupert Murdoch. He has not had to buy it; he has just been given it. It is no wonder they have not sold it. In Victoria one public utility after another is being acquired by foreign interests, and the Prime Minister does not say boo. We have not heard one single word from the Prime Minister about the selling off of public utilities in Victoria. It is an absolute disgrace. I cannot believe that it goes on and that the Prime Minister comes into the House and talks about being a republican but does absolutely nothing about it. When I put the question to the Prime Minister about Electricite de France and its bidding for United Energy, he said, 'That's a matter for the Victorians.' He was not there to protect us in Victoria. He was not going to use Foreign Investment Review Board powers to put the jackboot into a French nuclear company, if you don't mind, bidding for United Energy in Victoria at the same time as the French were letting off atomic bombs in the Pacific. Unbelievable! I would like to see some of those Labor members actually defend the sale of these public assets. They do defend it. They say, 'That's different. We can't control that.' In relation to the Commonwealth Bank they say, 'It has no role anymore.' If public utilitiesgas, electricity and water-were in the hands life, of the federal government, they would be sold. There is no question about it. A real republican, as I said, would definitely protect Australian industry, but we will not see Australian industry protected. More of our industry is being sold off day by day. If you talk about Australian industry being sold off, they suggest you are some old-fashioned cad, that you have no idea about global economics. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) points to the opposition and says that the use of contract labour as per the CRA dispute is what will become law if the coalition gets into government. He is probably right. The problem is that it is already law under the Labor Party. The battlers have been sold out. The enterprise bargaining policy adopted by the federal Labor Party threatens trade unionism as a concept, a symbol. In practice, as we have seen in CRA, that policy drives workers into small groups where they are in danger of being toppled by employers. How do we know this? Those historians in the Labor Party only need look back to the 1890 strikes to see what happened in those times, to see the use of common law to destroy trade unions. What was the trade union response, apart from the fact that it made a big mistake and said it would organise a Labor Party to protect its interests-which it could never do because from its inception the Labor Party was a revisionist or reformist party? It said, 'We have to go for big, strong unions-one big union.' Out of that developed the IWW and the like. Those blokes-there weren't a lot of women amongst them-understood that in unity was strength but it had to be a broad based organisation in trade unionism. The present Labor Party has driven workers into small organisations where, as we have seen in CRA, they are threatened. Members can tell us that this agreement is a victory for workers. All this agreement says is that workers have the right to collectively bargain. If, on the factory floor where there are 100 members all told, 90 of them are on contracts, it would not matter how often you organised to collectively bargain for those 10 because eventually your members would be gone and driven into private contracts. That is exactly what CRA is doing. CRA is doing the bidding for the modern form of industrial relations, a modern industrial relations that has been orchestrated by the Minister for Industrial Relations-one that is accepted by this side of the House. There is no question about that. It is really a study in neglect when it comes to providing work for the heartlands where people in their masses are unemployed. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) would have us believe that all you need to do is train unemployed workers; if you reskill them you will get them into jobs. The assumption of that proposition is that workers are out of work because they are not skilled. Just because there is a correlawas tion between a lack of skill and unemployment does not prove that you are out of work because you are unskilled. The fact is that people are out of work because there aren't enough jobs for them. Ms Crawford interjecting",128
175,Mr CLEARY,PRIME MINISTER,"The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development can talk about skilling and say that this will provide the way forward and that this will put the unemployed back into work, but the fact is it is not happening. The minister never talks about the number of part-time jobs that are caught up in this job growth. Has anyone ever thought that jobs have to grow? As your population increases, it is inevitable that jobs grow. You need to study the nature of the jobs: where are the jobs coming from; why can't the minister tell us the kinds of jobs that we should be looking for in the future; why can't an industry minister tell us the kinds of industries we should be developing for the future so we could then make training real? Are we talking about a kind of training that is based around some service industry-a point I have taken up before? Are we saying that the future lies in working in hotels up in northern Australia-in Queensland, for example? Are we all going to work in hotels changing beds? That will give us a bit of work. Are they the sorts of jobs we are talking about or are we talking about real jobs? If they are real jobs, let us start identifying them. Better than that, let us start doing something about it in the northern and western suburbs, the heartlands where people are massively unemployed. It is quite interesting. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training crows about the training programs. He did not mention that he took $1.2 billion out of Working Nation. I do not know how much he has tucked back into it. We really need a more interventionist approach to the problem of unemployment. I thought it was amusing in a sense that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) raised the idea of directing super funds into local investment. All the opposition could do laugh about the proposal. I thought, 'That is just bizarre.' What is wrong with encouraging the super funds to put the money back into Australia rather than follow global trends and send the money offshore to make interest for those people who have their money invested in the super funds? What is wrong with encouraging a bit of economic nationalism? What is wrong with asking that money be invested into the future of our children and into sorting out those suburbs and those municipalities out in the north and west of Melbourne and elsewhere where the true believers live but are being jettisoned by the Labor Party? It is really odd that the coalition should laugh about that policy because it is just plain, common, good sense. As far as this censure motion is concerned, there is no way known I could bother to vote. It is just a joke. People ask me about voting in this parliament. My good friend the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) trotted out a leaflet at one time saying, 'Cleary does not vote on every division.' Of course I do not vote on every division because so many of them are just absolutely ridiculous. Today we have wasted hours and hours of the parliament's time. It would be better to have a serious discussion about some of the real issues rather than perpetuate myths about the differences between the two parties. In reality, as most people outside know, the difference between the parties is marginal. What we will see is a growth of third party support out in the community. I am not saying that just because I happen to be an Independent. The facts seem to support that. The party system is definitely fracturing. It is fracturing partly because the Labor Party has moved to the right. The drift of the Labor Party to the right cannot be explained away by any member. The right wing can come in and try to defend it, but they certainly know that the modem Labor Party is a party of the right, that it is a party of privatisation, that is a party of deregulation. What the Prime Minister trots out about his being the great progressive in Australia is just guff. If you want to be a fair dinkum republican, then go and do something about economic and cultural sovereignty. I have to laugh when the Minister for Communications and the Arts talks about culture. That Hollywood mausoleum we are going to build in the show grounds will not be good for Australian culture. We know what it will be. It will be another Murdoch enterprise about pay television, a television system we do not need and which will not develop an art form that actually assesses, refines, develops and illustrates Australian culture.",130
176,Mr ELLIOTT,PRIME MINISTER,"Parramatta-Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts) (6.43 p.m.)-We get this censure motion today the day after we have had 17 quarters of economic growth, the day after the opposition did not ask one question of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) about the current account and did not ask one question about the quarterly accounts, and the day after we have seen the economy continue to grow at very substantial levels. This is the third or fourth occasion on which we have had a censure motion. The opposition has had a deliberate tactic over the last couple of weeks of trying to disrupt the parliament as much as possible, of trying to take action to ensure that question time is truncated on each and every day, to avoid the accountability that they say is so important and is now the subject of this censure. What a lot of nonsense from the opposition, but that has been the tactic followed. Today the opposition had the chance to have question time and deal with all the key issues on the economy, which they say are the subject of this censure, as far as continued economic failure is concerned and the other issues they raise there-standards and false dawns and so on. But what do we get? We get this trumped-up censure motion and then we get the very low, poor performances we have had throughout from the various oppoit sition speakers who have contributed to the debate. This comes at a time when the real question has started to be asked about what the opposition might or might not stand for. We saw a headline in the editorial of yesterday's Financial Review: 'Howard ducks hard issues'. We get results in today's Australian of a Newspoll, a canvassing of people across Australia, that Howard was becoming an invisible man. What we should be getting from the opposition on this last day of proceedings of major consequence in the parliament for the year is a real attempt to enunciate something they might stand for. What do they stand for on industrial relations? We really do know what the opposition stands for on industrial relations because John Howard has said in the past, 'I have been here 25 years. My jobs back program was the right course on industrial relations. I am not going to change from that.' But, as soon as there is a bit of strife because of what has happened in Victoria or because of what has happened in WA, John Howard says, 'I don't really stand for any of those things. That's not really my industrial relations policy. Trust me. We won't really do that. We'll go back to what happened in 1990.' Remember before the 1990 election Andrew Peacock taking the view that it is best to not stand for anything? What did they describe him as then? The puff of smoke. That was Andrew Peacock before the 1990 election. Andrew Peacock's approach did not work. Then they had to have the manifesto, Fightback. That didn't work. The people would not buy that. So now they go back to the invisible man, puff of smoke type approach to these issues. Let us tum to other key areas. There have been 17 quarters of growth. The fact of the matter is that throughout the last three years the opposition has been predicting that there would be another recession. They kept saying that it was a double dip, that there would be a run on the dollar, that the government could not manage the economy, that there would not be a budget surplus-all of those sorts of things. They have been proved wrong every single time. That has been the opposition's track record on its economic approach. Contrast that with the fact that the governI ment made a commitment before the last election to create 500,000 new jobs in this term of office. What was the response from the then industrial relations spokesperson for the opposition, the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard)? He said that it was unachievable, that it could not be done. Of course, what we have achieved is 625,000 jobs in those three years, along with 51 months of strong economic growth. Let us move on to other key areas. Let us take national savings. The opposition constantly berated our approach to savings. Amongst other things, when we introduced the superannuation arrangements in 1991, John Howard said that legislation to increase employer contributions to superannuation would be nothing short of parliamentary confiscation of the assets of employers. We have got a whole litany of quotes of the same type, attacking the government's superannuation arrangements, attacking that strong development of a national savings strategy through superannuation, which already has achieved $200 billion of superannuation assets with that figure to grow massively over the next few years as a result of the measures the government introduced in the budget this year. The opposition has gone month after month, piece of legislation after piece of legislation, attacking that superannuation arrangement as being one that is unfair, unworkable and totally undesirable for Australia. Indeed, as recently as September and October this year we had various speakers from the opposition, including the shadow minister for superannuation matters, talking about this issue. He has now been silenced on these issues publicly. Indeed, he has got the flick altogether for that great person of integrity that is presumably going to seek to take his place in the seat of Bradfield. I speak of Brendan Nelson and all of those strong credentials he has got to represent people because of the whole basis of truth and integrity and all the other things the censure motion talks about. As recently as last month, members of the opposition were saying that our superannuation policy was unfair, unworkable, et cetera. note that one of the people on the speakers list to follow is the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott). He said as recently as 25 September: Compulsory superannuation is one of the biggest con jobs ever foisted ... on the Australian people. That statement was made on 25 September. That member is to speak later. Maybe he got caught up with one of those cables, wires or towers he has talked a bit about before making that statement. Less than two months later, what did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) do when he went and spoke at the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia national conference? He said, 'We are going to adopt Labor's superannuation policy.' That is what he said. He said, 'We will adopt Labor's policy,' the one that was the great con less than six weeks earlier. The opposition will say and do anything to try to make out that they do not believe in all the things they stood for over the last four or five years. That is what they would like us to believe. This censure motion is about trying to cover up the opposition's approach of doing anything to avoid being exposed for the hypocrisy associated with today's censure motion. This censure motion is a load of humbug. Rather than taking steps in the last few days of this session of parliament and saying, 'We really do stand for things. We really do have some substance in our approach to being the next government of Australia' , the opposition comes forward with the cant and hypocrisy pursued in this censure motion today. Looking at the key area of industrial relations, the government's policy has delivered strong productivity and employment growth for Australia. It has delivered both the reform and the fairness and decency that industrial relations should deliver. In our international approach, the government has delivered on the big picture through the massive reform that the APEC process delivered in Osaka last week to the great credit of this government, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). It is easy for the opposition to say, 'We would do this or that in those areas.' Look at the Speakers Notes document that the opposition put round. On the international approach the opposition says, 'APEC may be something, but we'd do things altogether differentmove ly.' The shadow trade minister would map out a major course of action such as APEC, but also have lots of bilateral arrangements that would achieve far more. What nonsense. Compare the opposition's front-bench to that of the government in trade, foreign policy, Treasury, communications, et cetera, and look at their policies in those areas. Absolutely worthless propositions have come forward with absolutely zero substance. As today's Newspoll shows, Australians are waking up to that fact. Twenty years ago, John Howard might have stood for something. What does he stand for now? He is trying to do anything to ensure that the people of Bennelong are somehow conned on Sydney airport by suggesting that 10 years ago he was something different, that he did not really support the third runway. Everybody there knows that his whole approach to those issues has been to say he did support the third runway and he did not express any great concern at all about what impact that might have on the residents of the electorate of Bennelong or the surrounding parts of Sydney. You cannot remake and you cannot reshape. The government's amendment to the censure motion demonstrates to everyone that the opposition have not remade and reshaped themselves. They deserve the strongest possible censure for their inability to deliver alternative policies of any worth or value to the people of Australia. This censure motion that they launched today is a clear manifestation of the fact that they do not have the credentials to govern Australia and the people of Australia should judge them accordingly, as this House will in moving the amendment to the censure moved by the Leader of the Opposition.",131
177,Mr ANDREW,PRIME MINISTER,"Wakefield) (6.53 p.m.)The member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) knows much better than that. The member for Parramatta comes into this House and suggests that the opposition has in some way been unwise because it traded question time for this opportunity to move a censure motion. The opposition traded question time to a censure motion that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) refused to take on two other occasions. We traded question time when, day in and day out, we have come in here, asked questions and got no answers. We traded question time when, day in and day out, ministers have done nothing but used question time to abuse the opposition and evade any opportunity to be accountable. We used the parliamentary forum to call the government to account. The member for Wills (Mr Cleary) preceded the member for Parramatta. The member for Wills said, 'We've all wasted our time this afternoon.' It is easy for the member for Wills, he is an Independent. He has no chance of ever being the government of this country. He is never likely to be called to account. It is easy for him. But those of us in opposition have a responsibility to call the government to account for the things that it has failed to do, commend it on the things it has done that we agree with and, frankly, call the Prime Minister to account for failing to lead Australia as it ought to be led. Preceding the member for Wills we had an astonishing speech by the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon). The member for the Northern Territory had the sheer, unbelievable bare-faced audacity to bring the immigration debate into this chamber to try to discredit the honourable performance of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). Noone else in this House would, surely, sink so low. The member for the Northern Territory stood up as if he alone had a monopoly on all that was decent and trotted out sanctimonious humbug, failing to recognise that all the Leader of the Opposition had ever done in the immigration debate was to welcome Asian immigration and to call for assimilation. But there was no such recognition by the member for the Northern Territory that all of us in some way have been compromised from time to time, none more so than he, as we all know. I stand here on a rather unusual platform, because I share with the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) the rare distinction of having spent longer in opposition without tasting government than any other member of the federal coalition. I entered the parliament in March 1983. I have not been blinkered by a rosy impression of what my lot may do in government. From March 1983 to November 1995, 13 years, I have watched a progressive deterioration in both the standard of living in Australia and the parliamentary standards that Australians expect from this particular chamber. I watched those standards eroded from 1983 to 1991 under Prime Minister Hawke, but that erosion has been unbelievably accelerated under Prime Minister Keating. The member for Parramatta, who knows better than he said, stood up and illustrated the point that I wish to make. Government speaker after speaker, in defence of the Prime Minister, only stood here and said, 'Look at what we've done. Why, look at the World Bank survey which only two months ago said that this happens to be, per capita, the wealthiest country in the world. This happens to be the country where, if you take our land, minerals, plant, equipment, housing, factories, farms and capitalise that against each Australian, then in $US terms each Australian is worth $US835,000 or $A1.9 million.' A few Australians would not mind taking their cash and running in the present climate. But this censure is not about that. It is about the question that every Australian asks: why, if in capital terms I'm that wealthy, has my standard of living fallen? In addressing the censure motion, the Leader of the Opposition made it perfectly clear that, frankly and uncomfortably, we have dropped, in national income per capita, from 10th in the globe to 22nd, while the Prime Minister has been the Treasurer or the Prime Minister. Surely that fact alone, in a nation as wealthy as this, is good reason for a censure. Our standard of living used to be the highest in the world; it has slipped, as everyone knows, to 22nd. This very day we had our current account deficit for this month revealed and it came in at $1.6 billion. Some commentators would tell you that that is reason to rejoice-that we imported more than we exported to the tune of $1,600 million in a one-month period. The only reason why people want to rejoice about that is because it is under $2 billion. We now have ourselves in some sort of mental state whereby a current account deficit that comes in under $2 billion is a good figure. Does the parliament realise and do the people of Australia appreciate the fact that, from 1975 to 1983 in 88 months of recording, Australia never recorded a current account deficit over $1 billion. From 1983 to 1995, under the present stewardship, out of 150 months of recording, on 96 occasions we had a current account deficit of over $1 billionthat is, we slipped back each month by that degree-and on 11 occasions a current account deficit of over $2 billion. Surely those figures alone are justification for a censure motion like this. The opposition, in moving this censure, only reflects what the rest of Australia says: this cannot go on and this man is not fit to lead this country. As the Leader of the Opposition said, in statistics that by now every Australian must be familiar with we have gone from $23 billion of borrowings to $163 billion, and still we slide down. The government will claim-quite legitimately-that Australia's exports have continued to rise. And they are right; they have. But our share of the world export market has declined. If you want a measure of what is wrong with Australia, there it is. Sure, we are exporting more; but other countries are outperforming us hand over fist. In terms 01 our share of the world export market, we have gone from 12th when you came into government to 21 st today. Is that not of itself cient reason for this censure? Mr Latham-It is Asian growth.",133
178,Mr ANDREW,PRIME MINISTER,"Then why aren't we part of it, I ask the member for Werriwa-and why aren't we involved in it? I will come to EPAC in a moment. The reality inescapably remains that we are not the performers in per capita terms in exports into Asia that once we were. Relative to our competitors, we have slipped under your stewardship.",135
179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,The member for Wakefield might like to direct his comments through the chair. The member for Werriwa should cease interjecting also.,135
180,Mr ANDREW,PRIME MINISTER,"I respect your decision, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) came in here and lauded the way the government had exceeded its targets in terms of creating jobs for young people. That is good news. No-one in the opposition has ever pretended otherwise. But, after 13 years, we still have at least 8.6 per cent of the work force out of work. Are we supposed to celebrate that in November 1995? How fluid is that figure, given the multiplicity of training schemes that have appeared? I am not allowed to be critical of training schemes, because people on training schemes become more employable. But people on training schemes are also no longer counted as part of the unemployment figure, so heaven knows what that real figure is. We have over nine per cent of our people out of work and we are supposed to apologise for moving a censure motion against the Prime Minister. Only this week an employer in my electorate rang me-as people may likewise ring the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Ms Crawford), who is at the table-complaining about the fact that he had jobs but no-one prepared to do them. That is an indictment of the way we go about employing young people and of how serious we are about addressing the whole issue of job creation. If we talk about industrial relations, the first thing that happens is that someone on the other side stands up and paints us as though, suffi- with some pre-Lord Shaftesbury concept, we want to send children up chimneys. How absurd can you get! Don't you realise that, in common with every one of you, I too am a parent of children in the work force; a parent of children I do not want exploited, just as you do not want people exploited. I have a vested interest, in company with everyone else, in an industrial. relations system that is fair and that, frankly, offers better pay for better work. Any suggestion by the opposition of criticism of the performance of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is instantly met with the cry that in some strange way the royal commission was loaded against her-ignoring the fact that eight of her colleagues were the very people who gave evidence against her and found her gUilty. While I am on this issue of misrepresentation and deceit, let me address the whole matter of parliamentary standards. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I know that the standard of this chamber and performance in this chamber have slipped under the stewardship of the Prime Minister. We have a Prime Minister who openly defies the Speaker. He thinks he can front himself to the dispatch box and address the parliament whether he has the call or not-no civility; no decorum. Every member of the opposition is treated as dirt. It must be said of the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, that never while he was Prime Minister was I faced with that sort of behaviour. If I met him in the corridor, I was at least treated as an Australian with a role to play, a job to do and a justification for being here. That is not the case with this man. In the eyes of the Prime Minister the opposition has no role at all-and that is inexcusable. In common with everyone opposite, every member of this opposition has been elected to this chamber, charged with a serious responsibility to represent an electorate, from government or opposition, and expected, frankly-I am proud of this as an opposition memberto voice the concerns of all those people who did not vote for the government. That applies no matter which party is in opposition and that means that the voice of the opposition ought to be heard and heeded. I do not expect to win divisions, because the people of Australia did not elect me to the government. But they elected me to the parliament with a job to do, and one of my rights in my job is the right to be heard-not treated as dirt, as happens with the present Prime Minister, against whom we have moved, quite rightly, this censure. I am tired of being treated with scorn and derision. I am tired of being treated as though I had no real role in this parliament when I proudly stand here as a member of the opposition and as the member for Wakefield. I stand here representing rural Australians, who are probably the most accommodating Australians that there are--certainly the most forgiving, because they are accustomed to the vagaries of the seasons, and so they are a little more cynical than others about what politicians pretend they can deliver. Rural Australians are also angry with this Prime Minister because they have borne the brunt of much of his economic mismanagement. They are the people who are generating the opportunity for export renewal and they are the people who feel that this Prime Minister has failed to give them a fair go. The member for Wills said that we had much in common. I am sure the member for Werriwa would disagree with him. The truth remains that the Prime Minister is the man who has snuffed out the light on the hill. (Time expired)",135
181,Mr OCONNOR,PRIME MINISTER,"Let it be forever a matter for the public record that on the last days of the sittings of the 37th parliament the final motion of censure by the opposition against the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was proposed by a Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) who has been rejected once by the Australian people as being unsuitable to lead this great nation and who is the third choice of his peers to lead the Liberal Party of Australia. Let it be a matter for the public record that the member who seconded the motion against the Prime Minister, the member for Higgins, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello), is someone who on two occasions refused to take the poisoned chalice of the Liberal leadership. The member for Higgins must rank as one of the greatest political squibs of the 37th parliament. The future of this great country is too precious to place in the hands of a third rate opposition that would deliver second rate government to this country. The people of Australia at the next election have a clear choice of national leadership, a leadership to represent this great nation in Asia and the great fora of the world. On this side of the House, they will have Paul Keating, Kim Beazley, Gareth Evans and Ralph Willis. On the opposition side they will have John Howard, a reject in his own ranks; Tim Fischer, who is not taken seriously by anybody in this country; Alexander Downer, who was unceremoniously dumped from the Liberal leadership for his incompetence; and Peter Costello, the shadow finance minister who gleefully announced to the Australian public that we were heading for a double-dip recession when the Australian economy motored on to 17 quarters of positive growth. Those are the choices that are before the Australian people at the next election. The Leader of the Opposition is not fit to lead Australia. We on this side of the House know it, you on that side of the House in your heart of hearts know it, and the Australian people know it. I refer to a report in the publication Rear window, edited by Andrew Main and Rowena Stretton. It describes the 17-page presentation of the Leader of the Opposition to a council meeting of the National Farmers Federation. According to the report, the staff of the Leader of the Opposition instructed that there be no questions to him. When the NFF resisted, his staff then offered to write the questions for the farmers. There is only one reason why they would seek to do that, and that is simply that the Leader of the Opposition is incapable of providing a coherent answer to questions about his own policy. Can you imagine the Leader of the Opposition sitting down with the Japanese Prime Minister or the Indonesian President and handing them a list of questions they could ask about Australia's place in the world? There is no-one in this House or the Australian community who really believes that the Leader of the Opposition could have stitched APEC together. There is no-one in this country who really believes that the Leader of the Opposition could have steered the Mabo legislation through this great parliament. There is no-one who believes that the Leader of the Opposition would have had the political courage or the vision to put this simple proposition before the Australian people-that Australia ought to be led by an Australian and that it ought to have an Australian as its head of state. And there is no-one who believes that the great social policy advances that have been made by this Labor government could ever have been constructed by a Tory government led by the Leader of the Opposition. I listened intently to the contributions of Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the censure of the Prime Minister. There was simply no substance to the attack and no fresh policy position with which they could fail the Prime Minister-simply tired rhetoric from a tired opposition who have given up on policy debate in this country. This is the most deceitful and divisive opposition which has ever put itself before the Australian people for judgment. Its ultimate deceit is typified by its deliberate policy of withholding from the Australian people what it intends to do in government. It is a simple strategy of deceit. We in Victoria know quite a deal about that simple strategy because we experienced it in 1992 with the election of the Kennett government. Jeff Kennett told Victorian workers that no-one would be worse off with the election of a Liberal government, and within a matter of months of coming to power he mounted a massive assault on the wages and conditions of workers under state awards. John Howard is simply a Jeff Kennett clone. They come from the same Liberal industrial relations stable. We know exactly what he will do in office. Let the Australian work force be under no illusions about what he will do when-and if-he comes to office. He will strip away the award conditions of workers. He will depress the wages of workers. He will not endorse a no disadvantage test in industrial relations. He will stab the independent umpire, the Industrial Relations Commission, in the stomach. These are not my words but his. While he does that, Jeff Kennett waits in the wings to punish Victorian workers for fleeing to the sanctuary of the federal industrial relations system. He has simply said that with the election of a Howard coalition government workers in Victoria will have nowhere else to go. The greatest political obscenity of them all is John Howard and Peter Costello's pitch to the battlers of this country. Is this the same Howard and Costello who in 1993 put before Australian workers a regressive industrial relations policy designed to strip their wages and award conditions? Is it the same Howard and Costello who in 1993 put before the Australian people a radical plan to dismantle the Medicare? Is it the same pair who put before the Australian people a plan to slash $10 billion from social expenditures in this country? Can it be the same Howard and Costello who gave their hearts and souls to Fightback, that awful Tory manifesto, designed to attack the economic and social conditions and wages of workers? The greatest political obscenity is that, after all of that, Howard and Costello in their hearts and souls now want the battlers in Australia to actually reward them for those policies with the fruits of government. Let me tell you, the battlers are not that stupid. I listened with interest to the contribution by the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), that Tory high priestess from back down the time tunnel. Her speech was one great diatribe against Australia. She constantly runs Australia down, as her leader does, and puts up the United Kingdom and New Zealand as something we ought to emulate. I say to honourable members opposite and to the honourable member for Mackellar: if it is so good there, why not go and live there? Answer me this question: if it is so good in New Zealand, why are a quarter of a million of them here in Australia seeking to build their lives and the futures of their families? The important thing to appreciate about the stance of the honourable member for Mackellar and the Leader of the Opposition is simply this: neither of them can stomach the thought of an Australian being Australia's head of state. Here we are in 1995 and the Leader of the Opposition doffs his cap to a monarch 10,000 miles away and cannot even stomach having an Australian as an Australian head of state. I am proud to stand on the record of this government and on the record of the Prime Minister. I am proud that this was the government that brought into this parliament the greatest piece of social legislation since Federation-Mabo. I am proud to be a member of the Labor government that put on the floor of this parliament Working Nation, a program of economic and social structural change that every country in the Western world now wants to emulate. I am proud of the economic achievements of this country. I do not run them down like the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Mackellar and members opposite. I am proud of the fact that we have had 17 quarters of positive economic growth. I am proud of the low inflation. I am proud of the fact that we have the lowest level of industrial disputation in this country for over 40 years. I am proud of Australia's standing in the world. I will not stand on the floor of this parliament, on any platform outside this parliament or in any international forum and run this country down like the Leader of the Opposition and members opposite do. I am proud to be an Australian, I am proud of the fact that this government engineered APEC, and I am proud of the breadth of our social policy. I listened to a succession of members opposite who railed against the Prime Minister's defence of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). How they can stand up in this parliament and defend one of the most grubby political exercises that Western Australia and this nation have ever seen is quite beyond me. The commission had rigged terms of reference-absolute lies were told to this parliament about that royal commission-a hanging judge and a bodgie outcome. And those opposite parade it before this illustrious house as the truth of the matter! That is a disgrace in itself. I am pleased that the minister for health has drawn the line in the sand on this grubby exercise, has stood at the line and has not bowed to any sort of mealy-mouthed pressure that members have brought to bear on this issue. In closing, let me say this: in the final moments of this parliament, the 37th parliament, we have seen an opposition incapable of carrying a policy debate before this House. We have seen the Leader of the Opposition parade himself in front of this House as an alternative leader-with no policies, with an attitude to run down his own country, a man who is incapable of considering that Australia should have an Australian head of state, and a man who carries baggage from the past that really puts him at the bottom of the harbour in political terms, right where he belongs. Honourable members on this side of the House know the record of this government. It is on that record that we will go to the Australian people and we will stand upon it. At the end of the day, I am confident, as all members on this side of the House are, that when the dust settles on this election in 1996 we will have relegated to the political scrap bin a whole generation of tories and Liberals who have not had the wherewithal, the intellectual capacity, to achieve government in this country. It will be our pleasure.",136
182,Mr ABBOTT,PRIME MINISTER,"I can understand why the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) would be standing on his record, because, quite frankly, it is the best way to try to hide the record of this government. Today we have had a cavalcade of ministers and parliamentary secretaries coming out with platitudes and cliches trying to defend the indefensible. Only one of them has sounded at all convincing, and that is the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley). I suppose he has something to look forward to, and that is being the Leader of the Opposition after the next election. This censure motion deserves to succeed because of the arrogance of this government, the dishonesty of this government and the incompetence of this government. Next year, 1996, is going to be a watershed in Australian politics. It is going to be a watershed like 1949 because Howard's battlers are going to be to the 1990s what Menzies' forgotten people were to the 1940s and 1950s. It is on their shoulders that a new generation of Liberal dominance is going to be created. There are a few parallels between 1949 and now. Ben Chifley had chaos in the coalfields. Paul Keating has chaos on the wharves, in the coalfields and in the mining industry. The difference is that Ben Chifley was against the strikes and Paul Keating is in favour of the strikes. The Australian people are asking who is responsible for the $200 million wiped off our production by this strike. The answer is a Prime Minister who went to Osaka, who swanned off overseas, rather than staying at home and fixing the problem that he created. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is very good at starting fights, but he is very bad at finishing them. He is very good at creating problems, but he is no good at solving them. This is a Prime Minister who turns around and says, 'Oh, the CRA dispute. Marcel Marceau could fix that.' What happened to Placido Domingo? He could not do what he said Marcel Marceau could do. My authority on this is none other than the Prime Minister's erstwhile best friend in politics. to that man who rushed out of the dinner party with Solly Lew, that man who forsook Melbourne's millionaires to raise the standard of the class war, that man who leapt out of his Zegna suit to don the cloth cap, Kelty said, 'I have confidence in the former Prime Minister, but I have no confidence whatsoever in the present Prime Minister.' The present Prime Minister is someone who has been rejected by no lesser figures than the leadership of the ACTU. While we are on the subject of Bob Hawke, it is interesting that the member for Corio claimed that people on this side of the parliament were un-Australian. Let us remember that it was Bob Hawke himself, no lesser figure than the former Prime Minister, who said that the current Prime Minister, Paul Keating, .is the first ever occupant of the Lodge who does not like Australia and does not like Australians and would rather be living somewhere else. After the next election, Paul Keating will be living somewhere else. He certainly will not be living in the Lodge. This week we have seen a strange contrast between the Prime Minister's spoken language and the Prime Minister's body language. His spoken language has had all the usual violence, all the usual vituperation, but his body language has been tense, arms crossed, because now there are enemies all round him. Bill Kelty is an enemy. Kim Beazley is an enemy, after what has happened to Graeme Campbell. Graham Richardson has been an enemy for months, plotting his downfall. You have to say that the Prime Minister's mental stability is no longer something that we can take for granted. This Prime Minister sees enemies everywhere. The Burke mob is the latest in the list of enemies that he is seeing. This is a Prime Minister who has no friends and his attitude to this parliament makes that very clear indeed. He said that he has got the Pope on his side. To be honest, that is about all he has got left. Frankly, you would need to be the Pope to have any sympathy left for someone who can only be described as the 'Jack the Ripper' of Australian politics. The fact is that this government has failed. As It has failed where it counts. It has failed to deliver the goods to the Australian people. Our foreign debt is now worse than Mexico's. Real wages are lower than they were in 1976. A bus driver in Sydney today earns less than a bus driver in Taiwan. Economic recovery is a complete illusion. It has not crawled off the pages of the Financial Review and into the pockets of ordinary Australians. Your mortgage costs more and your house is worth less. That is the reality of life under this government. There are 800,000 unemployed. What does the Prime Minister say to them? He says, 'This is as good as it gets.' His message to the 800,000 unemployed is that this is as good as it gets. Thirteen years ago, Australians believed that we were a rich country getting richer. Today, we think that we are a rich country getting poorer. This is the first generation in Australia's history which fears that it will leave its children a lower standard of living than its parents left it. But it is worse than that. There is the fraud and the hypocrisy. There is the betrayal of a Prime Minister who has abandoned the workers that he has always claimed to represent. Ben Chifley and John Curtin would tum in their graves to see what this government has done. We have a Prime Minister who goes to a Labor area when he wants a safe seat, but as soon as he is looking for a nice house, he goes off to the silvertails in the eastern suburbs. The Prime Minister is nothing but the chief exemplar of a culture of greed which this government has created. We need look no further than at the Australian Industry Development Corporation-a government owned enterprise which this year lifted payouts to directors from $3 million to $18 million at a time when the company made a multimillion dollar loss. What a disgrace. What a shame. What a betrayal of the values that the Labor Party once represented. Heaven help us if the AIDC had actually made a profit. How much would they have paid themselves then? Is it any wonder that this Prime Minister has given up on domestic policy and is now seeking refuge in that ultimate last resort of failed leaders. He now wants to create a Canberra commission to rid the world of nuclear weapons. He cannot solve things like unemployment and the foreign debt, so now he is going to try to tackle ridding the world of nuclear weapons. I suppose he is going to redesign Sydney, completely end any acrimony between black and white Australians and find a cure for AIDS. The fact is that this Prime Minister is a fraud. The Prime Minister said at the beginning of his term that he would deal honestly with the Australian people. He said that he expected ministers to tell the truth. What happens? Along comes Carmen. What happens to the Prime Minister's commitment to the truth? Let us look at what the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) said in parliament? In parliament when asked what had really happened she kept saying, 'My recollection is my recollection.' Did she dare repeat what she had said to the National Press Club? Would she dare repeat what she had told the Western Australian parliament? Of course not, because she knew that she was guilty. What is more, the Prime Minister knew that she was guilty because the leader of the Labor Party in Western Australia had told him. What did the Minister for Human Services and Health do during the royal commission? She took refuge in the Alan Bond defence: 'I can't remember; I can't remember.' To every inconvenient question she is asked she says, 'I can't remember.' Who did that last but Alan Bond, and he was only able to get away with it because he said that he had brain damage. And this is coming from the minister for health! I suppose it is so that she has doctors close at hand if she finally collapses under the strain of all this nonsense. The fact is that the Prime Minister under the pressure of defending the Minister for Human Services and Health has gone slightly troppo. First of all, it was a Liberal conspiracy. The Liberal Party was responsible for putting up Carmen Lawrence's former ministers and staff to say what she had really said. Then, when that looked utterly absurd, it was a Labor Party conspiracy. It was Burke's mob that had done it. The fact is that this Prime Minister is shackled to a political corpse. He knows it, this parliament knows it, the Australian people know it, and the strain is starting to show. The Prime Minister has a problem in that, if Minister Lawrence went, he would also have to go. He is the ultimate master of misrepresentation; he is the ultimate true deceiver. There were the l-a-w law tax cuts that were never delivered. There was the third runway that was supposed to mean more takeoffs and less noise, and the opposite has been the case. There was the consumption tax that in 1985 he said we must have and in 1993 he said we would never have. Ever since he has been giving it to us by stealth. There was the privatisation which was supposed to be selling off the nation's silver and which he said we would never have. Now he is giving it to us in spades. He is selling off the heritage of this nation to whom? To the hated Poms. He is the ultimate true deceiver. Government members talk about a hidden agenda. Their charge has no conviction whatsoever, because they are led by a man who is the ultimate policy chameleon-a man who has demonstrated throughout his career no commitment whatsoever to the concept of truth from the days of his rorted preselection, from the time he failed to get his tax returns in on time, from the time he failed to declare where he lived for the purposes of travel allowance and from the time he failed to come clean on his business relationship with Warren Anderson and various people. This is a man who embodies misrepresentation and deceit. Of course, the ultimate illustration of this is the government's failure today to accept perfectly reasonable suggestions for truth in advertising legislation. Why will they not accept it? It is because they know that, if truth in political advertising legislation is in place for this election, the Prime Minister will be able to play no part in the coming election campaign. He will be the ultimate Marcel Marceau of Australian politics. Those opposite cannot make up their minds whether the opposition are wimps or ogres. The next election will be a contrast between Honest John and Jack the Ripper. That is what is going to happen at the next election. Our policy is very clear. Our policy is to be different from this government. Our policy is to promote workers' rights, not unions' rights. Our policies say that your wages can go up but they cannot go down. If your employer comes along and puts $15,000 on the table for improved work practices, our policy is that you can accept it. You can take the $15,000. You will not be condemned to poverty forever. You will not be condemned to the miserable wages immobility of this government. Our policy is to protect Medicare. Our policy is to make it easier to save money. Our policy is to make it easier for people to buy shares in their own companies. Our policy is to make Australian workers partners with their employers, not antagonists. Our policy is to make it easier to take out private health insurance. Our policy is to raise parliamentary standards. The fact is that the coalition in government will do what this government has completely failed to do: we will bind the wounds of the Australian people. We will restore the social fabric of this great nation. We will enable the Australian people, for the first time in years, to feel good about themselves. That is our policy. That is why we are different and that is why we are going to win the next election. This government deserves very much to be censured, but it deserves more than that. This government deserves to be ejected by the Australian people. The Australian people do not expect miracles; all they want is a bit of honesty from their rulers, and that is what they will get under the next government. It is in the Australian people's hands. I know at the next election that they are going to go for it, and this time they certainly will not be disappointed.",138
183,Mr LATHAM,PRIME MINISTER,"Werriwa) (7.36 p.m.)What a funny old position the coalition parties have got themselves in. This debate shows the ramshackle mess of their political structure and their integrity. We just heard from the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), who presents himself as the future of the Liberal Party. He is a young member recently elected and is the future of the Liberal Party. But who does he take as his political mentor? Bob Santamaria. He has gone all the way back to the 1950s, with Bob Santamaria and John Howard. All the way back to the 1950s and the white picket fence, with John Howard and the mentor of the member for Warringah, Bob Santamaria. That reminds me of an interesting incident that happened last year which reflects perfectlyon the Liberal Party in the 1990s-the launch of the book co-authored and co-edited by the members for Menzies (Mr Andrews), Moore (Mr Filing) and Deakin (Mr Aldred). A funny thing about the members for Menzies, Moore and Deakin is that two of the three have been disendorsed from the Liberal Party. The book they wrote was called The Heart of Liberalism. The Liberal Party ripped out the heart of liberalism when they disendorsed the member for Deakin, who is in the chamber, and the member for Moore. In their book about the heart of liberalism, the last chapter is entitled 'The future of the Liberal Party'. And who is the author of this chapter? Bob Santamaria. They have got Bob Santamaria reciting the future of the Liberal Party in the last chapter of the book. What were the three planks that Santamaria put forward as solutions in the 1990s? The first plank was to send everybody back to the land. The idea was that everyone could go back to the land and live a nice, simple, plain farmer's life with no stress and no family breakdown. The second plank was to send women back to the home-to take all the women out of the work force and put them back in the kitchen. The third plank in Santamaria's chapter on the future of the Liberal Party was to take the technology and put it back in its box. That is a perfect echo of how the member for Warringah thinks: 'Ooh. We're scared of technology and progress. We don't want any of that. We don't want any of these highfalutin, new, modem devices like telecommunications. We want to put it back in the box where Santamaria says it deserves to be, where Santamaria wants it to be and where John Howard wants our society to be-rooted in the 1950s.' Fancy the member for Warringah wanting to lecture the House about parliamentary behaviour. This is the member for Warringah who had the hide and the gall to describe the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as Jack the Ripper. This is the same member for Warringah who, when he was at the monastery, was known not as Jack the Ripper but as Tony the Stripper. If he wants to engage in those sorts of standards-jumping fences in and out of the monastery and bringing that low level of behaviour into parliamentary forums-he is going to get it back with spades. This exposes the humbug and the cant of what the opposition have been saying in this debate. It also exposes the funny old position they have got themselves in. In 1993 at the last election, which was not so long ago, they put forward all the things they believed in. They worked for two or three years, and the member for Warringah was in the research team working on all the ideas that the Liberal Party and the National Party really believed in- What they came up with was called Fightback, but that is locked away now like a mad uncle in the attic. The opposition never talks about Fightback, but Fightback reflects all the things they believe in-the individual employment contracts, the dismantling of Medicare, the 15 per cent GST and the cutting away of all the public sector programs that provide for an equalising and civilising society. They are fundamental political beliefs, and the things that were reflected in the Fightback manifesto are just an echo of Thatcherite philosophythe idea that there is no such thing as society: there is government and there are individuals, but there is no partnership between the two; there is no partnership between government and individuals to form a thing called society. Their sole role in politics is to push away public sector programs and to push more and more responsibility on to individuals. Of course, the wealthy and the privileged in our society can pick up those responsibilities and entrench their position. For the disadvantaged-the people they would call battlers-it is even harder because, without the civilising and equalising role and the great tolerance and liberation of the public sector, those so called battlers have an even harder lot in their lives. What happened after 1993 when they found out that the things that they believed in and the policies they supported in Fightback were basically unelectable and unsupported by the Australian people? In 1996 they are going to go to the electorate with things they do not believe in. What sort of empty shell of a party is this? In 1993 they went to the people with all the things they believed in and found out they were unelectable; now they are trying to put on the fraud and the hypocrisy of going to the election next year with all the things that they do not believe in. This is exposing the two faces of John Howard. The member for Warringah and other speakers have said, 'The Labor Party can't make up its mind. They seem to be campaigning against two John Howards.' There is a perfect reason why we are doing that. There are two John Howards. There is the private John Howard who believes in all the policies of Fightback, and there is the public John Howard who is trying to present himself to the people of Australia as a sensitive New-Age guy-as a reborn political leader; the sort of leader who eats quiche; the sort of leader who helps little old ladies across the road; the reborn, sensitive NewAge John Howard. It is a fraud and the Australian people will not have a bar of it. The Australian people know the two faces of John Howard. They know the face of the private John Howard who supports Fightback to his bootstraps. They also know the public John Howard who is now trying to have a massi ve lend of the Australian people. The Australian people will determine at the next election that they like neither face of John Howard and they will reject both comprehensively at the ballot box. This reflects something interesting about coalition at this part of the political cycle. Those opposite know that they are going to the people with the things that they do not believe in. They are sort of half excited and half geed up by the fact that opinion polls show that they are a bit ahead. They are getting around with a hangdog look and saying, 'We are really not going to the people and getting a mandate for the things that we believe in.' However, they are half excited about the prospect of a coalition government. This is a party with an empty shell. This is a party that is totally poll driven and has no conviction, has no integrity and has no purpose for its existence. Without those things called conviction, ideology, policy and belief in politics and public life there can be no achievement. There can be no achievement without those key ingredients as a meaningful existence in public life. The members of the Liberal Party and the National Party must sit around in the dining room and the party room wondering, 'What has it all been for? What has it all been for in 13 years of opposition?' The opposition has spent most of the 1980s shaking out the ideology and the direction of the Liberal Party. It was Howard versus Peacock. It was Left versus Right. It was wet versus dry. It was a party ripping itself apart to refashion its core beliefs and its core ideology for the 1990s. What does the coalition have going into the next election? What does the opposition have in its leadership? They have Andrew Peacock writ small. They have Andrew Peacock without a suntan. They have Andrew Peacock without Shirley MACLaine. They have Andrew Peacock without the Gucci toothbrush. They have Andrew Peacock without the serious look. All they have left is John Howard and the worried look. They have gone through this massive process of ideological struggle in the 1980s of the wets versus the drys, Howard versus Peacock and Left versus Right to end up with a Peacock style of leadership-all image, no substance-led by John Howard. It is an absolute fraud. All the opposition is left with is the worried look, the constipated look, that the sits permanently on the face of the Leader of the Opposition. It is a sad old state for a party left without a heart, left without conviction and left without core political belief. Those opposite are not going to the people with the things they believe in and the things they showed to the Australian public in the Fightback manifesto. This is the same John Howard who said in his budget reply speech earlier this year: I have dedicated my public life to the pursuit of substantive policy change, and I have led the debate. It is a funny way to lead the debate by trying to hide your policies. It is a funny way to lead the debate and produce substantive policy change by campaigning on the things you do not believe in. The Leader of the Opposition is Australia's answer to Jim Hacker. His motto is, 'I am their leader. I must follow them.' It is the same John Howard who adopted that motto when he was Treasurer between 1977 and 1983-the Treasurer who showed leadership by walking away from the internationalisation of the Australian economy. He is the same Treasurer who showed substantive policy change by walking away from tariff reduction, micro reform, industrial relations reform and integrating Australia into the Asia-Pacific region. This is the same John Howard who has the hide to come into this parliament on this debate and want to talk about economic performance. The Leader of the Opposition produced some figures from the Business Council. I have a better source of figures-the Parliamentary Library. Those on the opposite side of the House wish to compare the performance of this government on economic management. Who would they take as their standard? Who would they take as their benchmark? Is it the Menzies government? Would that be a fair comparison with the performance of the Labor government from 1983 to the present? In this parliament we hear the Menzies era described as the utopian age of economic growth, the utopian age of economic performance in Australia and the golden age of Liberal government. Members opposite would surely accept the proposition that it is a comparison to look at the economic performance of the Menzies government from 1949 to 1966 against the Hawke-Keating government's performance from 1983 to 1995. What do the figures provided by the Parliamentary Library show? On the key performance measure of growth in GDP per capita per annum the performance of the Menzies government was two per cent and for the Hawke-Keating government it was 2.1 per cent. We are greater than Menzies; we are greater than the golden age on the key measure of economic performance-GDP per capita per annum. Another measure is employment. Under Menzies the annual growth was 2.1 per cent and under this government it was 2.1 per cent-just as good. If we take business investment as a proportion of GDP, under Menzies it was 10.7 per cent and under Hawke-Keating it was an average of 10.8 per cent. On inflation, Menzies was 4.6 per cent and under this government it was 5.4 per cent-trying to wind back from the Howard legacy. When it comes to the key measure, the thing that the Liberal Party and the National Party would really pride themselves on in the 1990s is government outlays-growth in the public sector. We had an interesting reminder of this just last Sunday on that infamous Meet the Press program when the Leader of the Opposition said, 'Oh, there is not as much fat in the system as there was 15 years ago.' It is almost as if he has forgotten who was in 15 years ago. Who was the Treasurer responsible for a fat budget 15 years ago? J.W. Howard! How selective and how convenient that he can stand there on a national TV program and say, 'There is not as much fat in the system as there was 15 years ago,' without saying who was responsible for the fat a decade and a half ago. It was him. This is the man with no history. He is the Ronald Biggs of Australian politics. He was not there 15 years ago at the scene of the crime; it was someone else. 1 On this key measure of comparison, let me return to the figures. We are looking at the Menzies period compared with that of Hawke and Keating. For Commonwealth outlays under Menzies we had 2.5 per cent growth valid per annum; under this government it is 1.5 per cent-a lean, effective, efficient Labor government. When it comes to Commonwealth taxation we always hear the opposition say that this is a high taxing government. Have a look at Menzies' performance. We see that annual growth in Commonwealth taxation receipts was two per cent and under this government it is 1.1 per cent. We are better than the golden age. This is a new definition of economic utopia established by this government. This has occurred under this government. I have used a comparison that the Liberal Party and the National Party would say is the only fair comparison of postwar economic performance. So this is a good government. It was once said of Jack Lang that he was greater than Lenin. When one looks at the economic data, is the opposition now going to confess that Paul Keating is greater than Menzies? What the opposition is basically saying in this debate, and what it will be putting forward at the next campaign, is that on the economic data this government is better than the Menzies government from 1949 to 1966. The opposition is saying, 'We have no policies but we want to be in government.' The Labor government has done better than the golden age-the utopian age-of Menzies. Those opposite have no policies but they want to be on this side of the House. That is such a sham; that is such a fraud to be putting to the Australian people. They have no policies but what have they got in personnel? They have got John Howard, the third choice-not of the Australian people in this term of parliament but of his peers. He was not good enough to beat John Hewson in their leadership ballot; not good enough to beat Alexander Downer, the second choice; but was relegated to the third choice-not the third choice of the Labor Party, not the third choice of the Australian people but the third choice of his peers in this session of parliament. He is the most overrated character that Australian politics has seen for a long while. How long do you need to be in this place to know the fundamental tenets of pension policy? How long do you need to be here? He has been here 21 years and he does not know that this government has achieved pensions at the level of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Does he need another 21 years? Is it 42 years before he finds out the basis of policy for the old age pension? Then there is Tim Fischer. One unnamed National Party member-possibly the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran)-said last week, 'With Tim, we don't know if it is a lack of intellectual capacity or intestinal fortitude or both.' We know the answer on this side: it is both. It is lack of intellectual capacity and intestinal fortitude. When it comes to the Leader of the National Party, he is not only dumb and dumber but also weak and weaker. He is the weakest figure in the history of Australian politics. Mr Lieberman- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the member is being offensive in referring to a member in that way and should withdraw those statements.",141

She told the CSIRO it was to give other companies a chance to bid for the contract to erect boardings.' What was said was not correct as my opposition was on environmental grounds only and I was opposed to the erection of billboards by any and all companies on the O'Halloran Hill site.
