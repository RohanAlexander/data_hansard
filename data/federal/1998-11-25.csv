This particular piece of legislation receive better market signals from the It is an industry that has undergone significant it is like many other rural industries at this commercial and market environment and the significant structural changes. The number of seen Australian production in this area decline there is increased competition for the products that has increased by 130,000 To give you an idea of the change in the particular commodity, in 1988 the production to an estimated tonnage of 36,000 tonnes in 1998. there has been a slight increase over the period But when you take the total production of sultanas, decline in packed tonnage from 78,768 tonnes for 1998.
