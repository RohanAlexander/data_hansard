The proposals of the Conference recognise these fundamental principles of naval strategy. Should the. motion which I am moving be carried, we shall turn over a new leaf in the book of our evolution. Our tutelary stages are past, our time of maturity is here. Let us hope that with it has come a deepening and increasing conviction of the immensity of the debt which we owe to the Mother Country for sheltering us while we grew. In passing the motion we shall enter what has been called the great Sea League of the Empire, and the wardenship of the Pacific will be allotted to us as the worthiest and most adequate contribution to the defence of the Empire that highest naval authorities can devise. This also is our response to the feverish war preparations which various nations are making-eigh t Dreadnoughts on the part of Great Britain, plus the creation of a great Pacific Fleet, and more to follow, if required.",15
12,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,We shall have to take back the 25s. if there is more to follow.,16
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Eve n that can be considered, if necessary. We say to these nations that just as they preserve the inviolability of their soil and maintain their land forces at sufficient strength to do so, so we as a maritime Empire are under an obligation to keep open the communications without which the Empire could not exist. Now, what has been done? I think that I am justified in saying that this movement had its genesis in the Dreadnought offers. Without those offers I doubt if there would have been this proposition today for the formation of a great Pacific Fleet.",16
14,Mr FISHER,Unknown,What nonsense ! Chronologically the honourable member is out five years.,16
15,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,It is not nonsense; it is perfectly correct.,16
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I hope that in his speech the honourable member will give us the chronology and the genesis of the whole proceeding. I shall ask for nothing better than that. In the meantime I hope that he will allow me to deal with the facts.,16
17,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Poo r fellow.,16
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I admit that alongside the honourable member I am a poor feilow; still I hope that he will allow me to proceed. These Dreadnoughts will provide the major force of the new Fleet. We have, indeed, by these offers created a new Pacific Fleet. That is a plain unvarnished statement of fact. That Fleet is, as honourable members are aware, to consist of three squadrons, namely, one with its base at Bombay, another with its base at Hong Kong or Singapore, and another with its base in Australia. Our squadron is to be created by ourselves. The East Indies squadron is to be created by Great Britain. Great Britain is to join New Zealand in the creation of the China squadron. Canada will add her quota to Imperial defence, but she will do it in her own way, and in view of her peculiar geographical position. She proposes to establish a Fleet of a different kind at, perhaps, the same annual cost, but to be divided the between her two seaboards, for reasons of her own. I am not quite sure that she is doing the correct thing-certainl y not from a strategic point of view. But we may not criticise our sister Dominion, any more than we should like it ' to criticise us. We leave them to do their best in the light of local circumstances, and in view of all the surroundings of their position. But the fact is that they, too, propose to add their quota to the defence of the Empire, and to do so in a very substantial way. The Eastern Fleet will, therefore, consist of three vessels of the Indefatigable type, nine cruisers of the Bristol type, eighteen destroyers, and nine submarines, totalling thirty-nine ships, with over 7,000 men. If we add to this the four cruisers of the Bristol type which Canada proposes to create-on e cruiser of the Boadicea type, and six destroyers-w e get a total of fifty ships, and considerably over 9,000 men added to the fleet strength of the Empire. The capital cost to Canada will be ,£2,338,000; to Australia, .£3,695,000; and to New Zealand, ,£2,000,000, or a total cost of ,£8,033,000 to the outlying Dominions. But this by no means represents the whole cost of the additions to the Fleet. For instance, the three Pacific units will each cost .£3,095,000, or a total of ;£i 1,085,000. If we add to that Canada's contribution, we get, roughly, a total of ,£13,500,000 as the cost of the total additions to the fighting forces of the Empire; Here, then, is the response of the Empire, as a whole, to the needs of the moment from the Imperial point of view. Other nations are building Dreadnoughts. The response which Great Britain makes is eight Dreadnoughts this year on her own account, besides additions to the Pacific Fleets costing ,£13,500,000, or total additions to the fleet strength costing about ,£40,000,000 sterling. As regards the annual cost, Australia's share will be £750,000 per annum. Canada's share is estimated at £600,000, but it is only fair to her to state that, in addition to that sum, she spends on the protection of her fisheries, and on hydrographic surveys, not less than ,£200,000 per annum. New Zealand's yearly bill will be ,£250,000. Altogether, the total capital cost will be .£13,500,000, and the annual cost about ,£1,750,000.",16
19,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Does that calculation include interest and sinking fund?,17
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes ; and, as the Prime Minister reminds me- I had intended to mention it later-the fact that South Africa is not included in this movement is due to her peculiar position. There is no doubt that she will make a response when her scheme of internal union is completed and established. She will, I believe, stand shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the Empire in augmenting the fleet strength organized for its safety.",17
21,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,"She contribules ,£60,000 a vear now.",17
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Yes .,17
23,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Will the Minister explain the basis of the calculation of the annual cost? Does it include a sinking fund?,17
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Later , I shall give all particulars. With regard to our own unit, honourable members are already acquainted with the details. We are to get an armoured cruiser of the Indefatigable type, with a speed of 25 knots and an armament of eight 12-in. guns; three unarmoured cruisers of the improved Bristol type, with a speed of 25 knots and an armament of eight 6-in. guns; six torpedo-boat destroyers of the River class, with a speed of 25 knots; and three submarines of the "" C "" class. It was the opinion of the Admiralty that the big ship should be laid down at once, and the others later, so as to time the completion of all about two and a half years hence. In addition to this, the Admiralty has very generously undertaken the whole of the inspection al work in connection with the new fleet. That is, I think, a matter of first importance. I do not pretend to criticise what has been done in regard to the supervision of the destroyers, but I am glad that the Admiralty will take complete over- number. sight of the construction of the new vessels, thereby relieving us of all anxiety in that respect. Further, it will provide us with all the specialist officers whom we shall require, so that we may begin our training for the new - personnel. I have said that the cost of these vessels will be .£3*695,000, but, in all probability, it will be more than that, because we must have the very latest improvements.",17
25,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Will any of them be built in Australia ?,17
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I sincerely hope that we shall be able to build the other three destroyers here; but, as regards the other vessels, I do not know. My very earnest desire will be to build all that we can, to develop our building resources and the equipment of these boats in every possible way.",17
27,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The inspection by the Admiralty will be confined to the vessels to be built in Great Britain?,17
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Of course. I am afraid that we cannot hope to undertake the building of the larger vessels in Australia yet awhile, but I trust that the time may come for us to do that, and the sooner the better, I think. The sooner we are self-contained in everything relating to defence the better for all concerned. That is the spirit in which I approach this matter. All my efforts will be pointed in that direction. The Admiralty further agrees that, until.we can be self-sufficient in these things, it will supply all munitions of war, and all stores requisite at the same price as that at which they are supplied to the Royal Navy. That again is, I think, a very great concession. It also makes us a free gift of Garden Island, and the naval base in Sydney, the upkeep of which costs about ,£50,000 per annum, on condition that it is kept in a state of naval efficiency. Honourable members are no doubt anxious to know how the new fleet will compare with the squadron which we have at present. I have taken the trouble to get some figures, from which to make a comparison of the relative strength of the two units. Honourable members will see at once the striking advance which this proposal means in the direction of effective defence. While our present squadron comprises nine vessels, the new Australian unit will have thirteen. Note the number.",17
29,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,A very unlucky,17
30,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,A sacred number.,17
31,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"It is the devil's number, too.",17
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If there are any honourable members who believe in the tery of figures, perhaps I may.relieve minds on that point by stating that it not at all clear whether two submarines the "" D "" class will not be substituted for three submarines of the "" C "" class.",18
33,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Coun t the trawler and there will be fourteen.,18
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I think it will bo found that submarines of the "" D class will be more suited to our coast than and those of the "" C "" class. Therefore, when - the vessels are complete, the mystic numthus ber of thirteen will, very probably, be found to be reduced to twelve.",18
35,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wonderful , wonderful.",18
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In the present squadron there are 90 guns of 4 in. over; whereas in the new Australian unit there will be only 54 of that calibre. That seems at first view to show less efficient gun power, but quite the contrary is the Sydney base. case, as the next item in the list will show, In the weight of gun metal, or, in other tribution ? words, in gun power, the present squadron shows 6,120 lbs., while in the new unit it will be 9,750 lbs., or close on 10,000 lbs. everything. In the present squadron there are 21 torthe pedo tubes, while in the new unit there will be 35. Then, in the matter of com plement, that is, officers and crews, orable members will see what economy resulted from all the improvements are taking place from year to year in art of naval warfare. The present squadron contains 3,218 men, whereas only 2,283, or a difference of nearly 1,000 men, will be agreed required for the new unit. The average speed of the present squadron is 20.4 knots, while the speed of the new unit will be 25.6 knots. From these figures, will be seen that in speed there is an crease of 25 per cent; in torpedo tubes an increase of 66 per cent.; and in gun superior power, or weight of metal, an increase of nearly 60 per cent, in superiority. A very striking fact is that the armoured cruiser alone will have a heavier weight of metal than the whole of the existing squadron, that is to say, this one armoured cruiser will be of very much greater fighting effivictualling, ciency than the whole of the present squadron put together. The heaviest gun in the present, squadron is 9.2 in., with a projectile of 380 lbs., while in the squadron the armoured cruiser will carry eight 12-in. guns, with a projectile of lbs. The flagship of the present squadron is a first-class protected cruiser, with a mysprotected deck of armour from 3 inches their to 6 inches, and 6-in. armour protectis ing the gun positions. In the new unit of the flagship will have a complete armoured belt of from 4 inches to 7 inches, with 8 inches protecting the heavy gun positions. According to Jane's Fighting Ships, the matter stands in this way:-Takin g the Dreadnought as a unit of 100, the Indomit"" able war value is 70, or somewhat over, the total value of the present Australian squadron, even if the vessels were all new, would, on the same basis, be 53. We see that this one vessel will be very much superior in fighting force to the totality of the present squadron. It is a fact worth noting, in passing, that, under the new scheme, Britain will save a conand siderable amount of money. The total cost of the present squadron in Australian waters is ,£950,000 annually; that is for the upkeep of the squadron and the",18
37,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Includin g our con,18
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Including; It includes a proportion of central administration expenses. Australia pays Great Britain ,£200,000 per - annum, so that the total amount paid by honGreat Britain at the present time for uphas keep is about ,£750,000 a year. that - Mr KELLY - About three and a half the times as much as the so-called subsidy.",18
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes . It has been, at the recent Conference that Great Britain shall, for the present at any rate, pay towards the cost of the unit a sum of ,£250,000 per annum, and she will it thus save, in round figures, ,£500,000 per inannum under the new arrangement, while getting, of course, a fighting value greatly to that under the old one. And now, with regard to the details of the .£7 50,000 which represents the annual cost to Great Britain of maintaining the Australian unit-and here I answer the interjection of the Leader of the Opposition. The ,£750,000 is made up as follows :-Pay , and so foith, at English rates, £[177,000; upkeep of hulls, maintenance, and so forth, .£173,000; interest and sinking fund, £[259,000, reckoning the life of new the unit at seventeen to eighteen years; extra Australian rates of pay, shore estab850 lishments, and so forth, ,£141,000. In connection with the creation of the new unit, a great deal of labour and effort will - be required. It will not be found an .matter to begin from the bottom and build up an Admiralty in Australia. That, ever, is the task that has been assigned us; and there has been a hope expressed by the Imperial authorities that we shall make ourselves self-sufficient in the least deserves. possible time. Accordingly, amongst other measures, there will be required, first of a Bill for the necessary funds for the ing of the fleet.",18
40,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,When will that Bill be submitted?,19
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That will be for submitted later on by the Treasurer. Mr J. H. CATTS - This session?,19
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Probably this subscribe session - the y must be subject to identical training,",19
43,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I should think so. Surely the Minister can say ?,19
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not know a that it is absolutely necessary for the to be introduced this session. The money will be there the moment it is required; and that is, perhaps, all we need trouble about at the present moment. That, at rial Navy. any rate, is one of the measures to be introduced, and I have said all I have to say of it just now.",19
45,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,It will be after - elections !,19
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If the honourable able member will drag political consideramember tions in, let me tell him at once that hope it will be before the elections.",19

49,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,A number of others believe as I-do.,19
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"So far, we have kept mere partyism out of this great question.",19
51,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,What about the Dreadnought-is that a party matter ?,19
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable divided. member ought to know that I have been talking about the Dreadnought for a long time. We shall also require a Bill,19
53,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Suppos e we move that the question be now put?,19
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I ask that these interjections shall cease.",19
55,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I must ask honourable members to. refrain, not only from interrupting, but from carrying on conversations easy across the chamber. These are very disturbing to the honourable member addressing howthe Chair j and, perhaps, I may be parto doned for saying that when a statement like that of the Minister is being made, it should receive the attention its importance",19
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In addition to a all, Bill to provide the funds, we shall require buildone similar to the Act in force in the Royal Navy, with like regulations. There will, first of all, be the training of the Australian personnel to be looked to, and. this purpose we shall require a naval college for officers. If we are to have effective co-operation with the Royal Navy, our officers must be interchangeable, - and to the same standard of efficiency with an equal standard of qualification in corresponding ranks. By that I mean that lieutenant here must be equal to a lieuBill tenant in the Royal Navy, and so with a captain j and if we are to have an Australian Admiral, as I hope we may, he must be equal to an Admiral of the impeMotion (by Mr Webster) proposed - That the Minister of Defence be not further heard. the - Question put; and division called for.",19

62,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"I desire to raise a point of order in connection with the tell- member in this chamber. ing of the division just taken. On the one side were certain members who called for a division, and on the other were the members voting against the motion. You, sir, called upon two honourable members who were voting with the Ayes to act as tellers, and they asked to be relieved of the duty. Then you called a teller from the other side of the House. This is the first occasion on which that has been done in this Parliament, and I think it is only fair that the House should know under what rule this practice has been adopted, and whether the rules of this House are such as to justify a departure from the ordinary practice with regard to tellers being called from each side of the House.",20
63,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"In reply to the honourable member, who has just called attention to what is the usual course, I desire to say that it is unusual for honorab'e members to refuse to act as tellers when called upon to do so. Never during the whole of my Parliamentary experience, nor in my study of Parliamentary procedure, have I met with a case of the kind. It has remained for some members of this Parliament to take a course which could only result in placing the occupant of the chair in a position of difficulty. Chair was bound, therefore, to exercise a discretion as to the best method of rescuing the House from a difficulty in which it had been placed. The standing order which governs the appointment of tellers, directs that two tellers shall be appointed for each side. But that standing order does not state the part of the House from which those tellers are to be appointed. I must acknowledge that I have taken advantage of that standing order in the action which I have just taken. I was compelled to do so in order that the forms, privileges, and procedure of this House might be saved from obloquy and derision.",20
64,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I wish to say something in connection with the point,20

I shall be pleased to hear him, but I cannot allow him to discuss a point that has already been settied by the Chair:",20

70,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,We want to be treated fairly.,20
71,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Neithe r is it proper for the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to comment on a statement which is being made from the Chair. If the honourable member for Kennedy has a fresh point of order to raise, will he kindly state it?",20
72,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I do desire to raise a point of order, but you interrupted me. I do not wish to be interrupted when I know that I am perfectly in order. The point which I ' now raise is this-That the honourable member for Batman was called upon to act as teller for the Ayes, although he gave his voice with the Noes. It is a well known practice, in Parliamentary procedure, that no honourable member, except The the tellers who are appointed, shall leave his seat after the appointment of the tellers. Two tellers were appointed from the ayes. They refused to act. I submit that the honourable member for Batman had then no right to leave his seat, and that, as he did so, his vote ought to be counted with the Ayes.

Every reason that can be stated with regard to the officers applies equally to the training, Edwards, R. of the boys, who will in the future become our petty officers and seamen. It is an absolute necessity that these boys should be caught young if they are to make efficient sailors and seamen. In addition to training establishments for the boys, we shall also need schools for signalling, torpedo work, gunnery, nautical science, and the mechanical branches of the service. These will all have to be established. all, for the officers, we shall require means of supplying advanced instruction. That is to say, we shall require these means for - those who have served a certain period and desire to qualify as lieutenants in the navy or it may be that the lieutenants themselves may require to pass special courses and to undergo special training in connection with some of the arms of the service. The petty officers and men would also be qualifying - as specialists, for ratings, or for positions as instructors.

I think that the new clause I propose would tend to minimize the abuses of the system. not involve any real addition to the work of Divisional Returning Officers, because under the existing Act they are obliged to make out such lists for issue to each of their subordinate officers. All that I ask is that, in addition to making out these lists for the information of their subordinate officers, the Divisional Returning Officers shall see that copies of them are exhibited in a public place. Under the existing Act the lists which are now made out are accessible to the public, but only on personal application to the Returning Officers. Those officers have a multiplicity of duties to perform during the few days preceding an election, and it is often most difficult for people who wish to examine the lists to get access to them. Their exhibition in a public place would overcome that difficulty, and, in my opinion, would check some abuses of the postal-voting system. Question-That the proposed new clause be inserted-put .

116,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Calare) [12.35] - Havin g regard to the temper of the Committee, it seems almost useless to It would propose amendments designed to perfect the Bill. The Government, apparently, are determined to. resist every amendment submitted from this side. However, I move That the following new clause be inserted :""31A. After section one hundred and ninetyone of the Principal Act the following section is inserted :"" 191A. For the purposes of this part of this Act, the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth, and under him the Commonwealth Electoral Officer of a State, shall investigate all bond f.de complaints of breaches of the law and take action to enforce the penalties prescribed for offences under this Act."" I propose that this provision shall be inserted in that part of the principal Act which sets forth a number of offences, and provides for the punishment of offenders by way of fine or imprisonment. Acting on the opinion of a former Attorney-General, the Department has laid down the principle that it is no part of its duty seek to secure the enforcement of penaltute ties in respect of a number of offences under the Act. Electors who have complained of breaches of the Act, and have submitted evidence in support of their complaints, have received from the Department reolies to the effect that it is no part of its to enforce these provisions; that sons concerned must take action. The result of this is that many of the sections dealing with offences have become practiI know it. cally a dead letter. I hold that it was the intention of the Legislature,, in passing them, that the Department should be charged with the duty of seeing that the Act w.as properly observed; that it should investigate complaints, and, if necessary, take, action to enforce the penalties which provision is made. In many cases that has not been done. Let me cite a case which occurred in mv own eleccase torate. At the last general election there were distributed. a number of libelof lous handbills, which, in. contravention of the law, neither gave the authority on which they were issued, nor bore the print of the printer. A number of gentleconstituted men in my electorate forwarded, through me, copies of these circulars to the partment, and invited it to take action vindicate its own legislation. They received a reply to the effect that it was no part of duty of the Department to initiate ings in such cases; that the matter was a private one, and that, as it seemed to affect me, I should be asked to set in motion machinery of the law. That to my mind action ? was a most improper stand for the Department to take. reasons why that part of the Act which deals with offences has been ineffective, and, I daresay, will be more ineffective, is this attitude of the Electoral Departinvestigate ment. This proposed new clause will place law Mr. upon the officers of the Department the rebond fide sponsibility of taking action to enforce penalties for violation of the law. I partment am utterly at a loss to account for the attiCrown a Law tude which, the Department has hitherto cases taken in regard to this matter. It is concomplaints trary to everything that has been done in and all bond respect of other legislation. the Department has shielded itself in this there is justification authorities. wav that the law has in many cases been Crown Law Office for infringed. I feel impelled, therefore, to offender. We shouldproceeds ask the Committee to place in this Bill direction that the officers of the Departhonorable member's proposal.

117,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Illawarra-Minister of Home Affairs). [12.43] - Wit h all respect to the honourable member for Calare, I submit that there is no necessity for this proposed new clause.

118,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,I have put it as,25
119,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I do not make that statement with any desire to be offensive, and I think that after the honourable member has heard my explanation, he will come to the conclusion that he is slightly mistaken as to the attitude actually taken up for by the Department. He has referred to the distribution of libellous handbills in his own constituency, and has said that in that the Department shielded itself behind an opinion given by the Attorney-General the day. As a matter of fact, however, the identity of the offender was not disclosed. Surely the honourable member .does not think imthat the Electoral Department should be a tremendous detective machine, and that its officers should be kept running Deall over the Commonwealth in an effort to to locate offenders against the Act.",25
120,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,When it is disthe closed that an offence has been committed proceedthe Department should take action.,25
121,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"But if the identity of the. offender is not disclosed, does the Minister the say that the Department should take no One of the principal if Mr FULLER - How can it take action it does not know who is the offender?",25

FULLER - In all cases where a complaint' has reached the Deit has been forwarded to the authorities, and in many prosecution has taken place. The Department already investigates as to breaches of the Act, fide cases are forwarded It is because to the Crown Law Wherever a prosecution, the against the a staff of officers to carry tremendous require a far the from all the position having been fairly put of by the honourable member, the fact is that in Victoria there have been five prosecutions for breaches of the Act.",25
123,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,In one of them the Vicethe President of the Women's National League at Geelong was prosecuted.,26
124,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I do not know whether that is so. There have been five prosecuwhy tions in Victoria, three offenders were conbility victed, one was committed for trial, and was discharged. In New South Wales three prosecutions have taken place, and in each case the offenders were convicted. In South Australia there has been one prosecution and one conviction. These circumstances evidence that so far from proposal of the honourable member being necessary, the Department is already doing all that it' can to punish those who commit breaches of the law. I submit, therefore, that there is no necessity for the insertion in the Bill of the proposed new clause.",26
125,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Calare) are [12.48] - I submit that the Minister of Home Affairs has not touched the position at all. He says that the Act provides tain penalties for certain offences, but adds that the Department will give ingSj effect to its provisions only when a breach of the law and the identity of the offender have been Tevealed. That is not the pracment tice which is adopted by other Departments. For instance, if the Customs authorities have reason to believe that the Customs is being infringed they at once act on information supplied to them and endeavour steps to locate the offender. Otherwise, provisions of the Customs Act become a dead letter. But here the upon receiving information that an infringement of the Electoral Act has taken place, refuses to send the complaint on to the Crown Law authorities unless the identity of the offender has been disclosed. I that when information is forthcoming a breach of the Act has been committed is his duty to refer the matter to the authorities for their investigation, and to mitted to it. endeavour to ascertain who is the offender.",26
126,Mr FULLER,Unknown,There is no clause of this character in the Invalid and Old-age sions Act.,26
127,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"No , because the Department does not need a clause of kind. If it can be shown that a breach of the Act has been committed it is the duty of the Department to at once institute proceedings with a view to ascertaining is responsible for it. But the Minister says in effect- "" We will not take action until you have discovered the offender. When you have located him we will institute proceedings against him."" I say that whole of our legislative enactments would become a dead letter if other Departments acted in the manner in which the Electoral Department is acting. That is I wish to throw upon it the responsiwhich is shouldered by other Departone ments of vindicating its own legislation.",26
128,Mr FULLER,Unknown,We send all bond fidecomplaints to the Crown Law authorities.,26
129,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,But there is something which the Minister should dobefore he sends those complaints along. the He should use the machinery of Government to determine who is the offender. It is the duty of the Department to assist the people to discover who is the offender.,26
130,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Surely it is the duty of the people to assist the Department?,26
131,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"BROWN-The people willing to assist the Department, but the Department refuses to be assisted. In the case to which I previously alluded the Decerpartment wrote informing me that it was he no part of their duty to institute proceedand that if I were aggrieved I should take action. I regard that as a gratuitousinsult. It was an attempt by the Departto lay upon me a duty which did not properly attach to me, and to shirk responsibility itself.

134,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Then the Minister must this have assumed that the case brought under the notice of the Department by the honourable member for Calare was not a bond fide one. As the Department declined to inwho vestigate his complaint, obviously it did not regard it as a bond fide one.",26

136,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The party with which the Minister is associated were in office at the time. I trust that if the honourable gentleman is in office at the forthcoming general elections he will see that the provisions of the Act are properly carried out. What is the use of prescribing penalties for offences if we do not impose them ? As a matter of fact, a number of persons have declared their willingness to subscribe .£1,000 to defray the expenses of a candidate to fight the honourable member for Wannon.",27
137,Mr FULLER,Unknown,In what way is the Act being broken?,27
138,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Sectio n 175 of the Principal Act saysWhoever(1) promises, or offers, or suggests any able consideration, advantage, recompense, reward, or benefit for or on account of any candidature, or withdrawal of candidature, or any vote or omission to vote, or any support of, or opposition to, any candidate, or any promise of any such vote, omission, support, or opposition : - slhall be guilty of bribery.. These persons have distinctly stated their willingness to subscribe a certain sum of money for the purpose of ""downing"" a Labour man. If our Electoral Act is to be properly administered, I hold that these persons who are infringing its provisions should be prosecuted. I should like to see a term of imprisonment substituted for the cash penalty which is prescribed in connection with certain offences. A few months in gaol would do men like Mr Ritchie and some other Western District squatters an immense amount of good. In my opinion the Department should closely investigate the accounts of the expenditure incurred by candidates. If the Act is to be reduced to a farce, the sooner we know it the better. The Minister has told us how many prosecutions have taken place in Victoria and in the other States, but he omitted to tell - us that in one of these prosecutions, the Vice-President of the Women's National League at Geelong was fined £ 5 for a most flagrant breach of the law. The attention of the officials had to be directed to her case by members of the .public. As the honourable member for 'Calare has pointed out, whenever the Customs Department is informed that the - Customs Act is being infringed, it at once takes action. It will investigate almost any complaint that is made to it. The Electoral Department should be conducted upon similar lines. Of course, I recognise that the proposal of the honourable member for Calare has no prospect of being carried. The numbers are up. But 1 do trust that the Minister will take action in all cases in which complaints are made as to breaches of the law.",27

142,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"But our Electoral Act is very different from the State Electoral Acts. The latter do not impose any limitation upon the expenditure which a Parliamentary candidate may incur. We provalu- fess to do so, but our profession is absolutely a sham. Under existing conditions a candidate may spend just what he likes. I do trust that the Minister will take some action in regard to this matter, irrespective of whether the proposed new clause is accepted or rejected.",27

144,Mr WISE,Unknown,"Gippsland) [2.15] - The purity of elections cannot be secured By the mere specification of offences, and the enactment of accompanying penalties; there must also be a vigorous administration of the electoral law. In regard to many electoral offences, it would be' very difficult to get individuals to prosecute, or even to give the information necessary for the setting on foot of a prosecution. When a breach of the law is reported to the Electoral Department, as when a breach of the Customs Act is reported to the Customs Department, the police and detective force should be set to work to discover the guilty person, and to take steps to secure his conviction. Offences under the Electoral Act will not be punished if we throw on private individuals the onus of giving the necessary information, and thereby disclosing their identity. It has surprised me to hear it said during the debate that returns of expenditure by candidates are made which are not correct. If the provision which limits the expenditure of candidates to a certain sum is to be complied with, the Department must closely investigate all returns, and, where it thinks that untrue statements have been made, should prosecute the person making them, without regard to the fact that he is a successful or unsuccessful candidate. I see no objection to the amendment of the honourable member for Calare, but, as the Minister has declined to accept it, it will not be agreed to, because, although there are very few on the Ministerial side of the Chamber now, should the division bells be rung, Government supporters would troop in, and, without knowing the merits of the proposal, and caring less, would vote with the Minister against it. I hope that if the under it. present Minister remains in power after the next election, as I suppose he will, steps' now. will be taken to vigorously enforce the provisions of the law. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [2.20] - I have had a good deal of experibrought ence in connection with the enforcement the electoral law, and spent a considerable sum on lawyers in fighting a case in Tassecured. mania.

145,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The Commit ee should allow us to pass the Bill quicklv, so that there may be time before the next election to properly instruct all those concerned the administration of the electoral law. Mr KING O'MALLEY - B y reason of the interlocking of the paramount power of the Commonwealth with the subordinate power of - the States, the police have to that the laws of the Commonwealth, as well as those of the States, are carried out. They are the police of the nation, not any one State. When an individual breaks a law, he is, as a general rule, arrested the police, without it being necessary for private person to lay a complaint against him. Offenders against the electoral whether of the Commonwealth or of the State, should be similarly treated. vate individuals should not have to bear the expense of prosecuting offenders under it. To do so might cost hundreds of pounds, because. once the law is set in motion there is no telling where the proceedings will end, so that the party concerned might lose his whole estate in lawyers' fees. I agree with the honourable member for Gippsland that something should be done to secure the more vigorous enforcement of the electoral law, and, in my opinion, amendment does what is necessary.",28

The Minister might well accept by the amendment, or some similar provision a for giving effect to the desire of the Cornmittee. No party interest is concerned in law, this matter. What we wish is that the law shall be properly carried out. It is Pridifficult, especially for poor persons, to substantiate charges sufficiently to get the Crown Law authorities to take action. The Department should have no option in this matter. Whenever an offence against the Act is committed it should, on its own initiative, proceed against the offender,",28
151,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Does the honourable member think that the Department should prosecute whenever a case is laid before it?,28
152,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"It should investithe gate all cases, and take action where necessary.",28
153,Mr FULLER,Unknown,That has been done whenever there has been reasonable ground for doing so.,29
154,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I understand from what the honourable member for Calare said that in some cases the Department has alleged that it had not the power to proceed against offenders, or that the complaints ought to be laid before some other Department. I understand from the Attorney-General that the Customs law contains no such provision as that which the honourable member for Calare wishes to insert ; but that is not a good reason for declining to put the onus of action in these cases on the Electoral Department. The proper conduct of elections is at the base of our democratic institutions. I ask the Minister, therefore, to try to meet the views of honourable members by inserting in the Bill a provision which will place the onus of action on the Department. No doubt the present Minister will do all in his power, to secure compliance with the law, but his successors may not view their obligations in the same light, and to provide against such a contingency, the law should require the Department to proceed in every case in which a complaint, has been made, and an investigation shows that an offence has been committed.",29
155,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas-Attorney-Gene ral) [2-29] - The proposed amendment really directs the Electoral Department to do certain things, and is too wide to be adopted. Generally, when an offence against public order or some statute has been committed, and a - prima, facie case is made out, the Crown prosecutes; but it is difficult for a Department to discover every offence, especially under the law. For instance, advertisements are published all over Australia, some of them without compliance with the provisions which require the publication of the name of the publisher; but it would be impossible for the Department to find out every such case. It has to wait until such offences are reported to it. Then there are technical offences in which it might not, perhaps, be advisable to prosecute^ should be sorry to have to prosecu'e in all cases of mistakes honestly made under the Old-age Pensions Act, to which the same principle applies. Though technically there may be some breach, it would be positively cruel to prosecute; and it would be inadvisable to have the proposed specific instruction in the Bill. Under section 206c of the Electoral Act there is an offence connected with the defamation of candidates, and surely that is a private offence?",29
156,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,Such an offence is not contemplated in the amendment.,29
157,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"There are offences of that class, and I.think it would be better if the Committee were content with the assurance that prosecution shall ensue ih any bona fide case. I understand that the honourable member for Calare said that sometimes the States were consulted, or their co-operation sought in regard to prosecutions ?",29
158,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,No ; but the police and detective forces of the States are used by the Federal authorities.,29
159,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"They are not used except an offence is committed, and then they are bound under the Constitution to help; but matters are only remitted to the States when the case, originally thought to be Federal, turns out to be a State one.",29
160,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"If there are offences under the Act in which the police have to take action, surely the State Departments are available to the Commonwealth?",29
161,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"But the State Departments are not asked to make investigations and prepare cases, and there is no Act which contains a provision of the kind. The Iriter-State Commission Bill, now before the Senate, provides that, where a public body, like the Commission itself, finds that an offence has been committed, the Attorney-General shall prosecute, and there is a similar provision in the English Act, in regard to the offences within the cognisance of the Board of Trade; but there is no general provision that in all electoral cases a prosecution must ensue.",29
162,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,That is not sought in the amendment.,29
163,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"But that is what the amendment practically amounts to. I am not attacking the wording of the proposal, but the principle, as giving a direction. At present the Department ought to prosecute where there is a primd facie case. I have looked into the matter, and I do not I think there is any remissness on the part of the Electoral Department of the Commonwealth, as compared with similar Departments in the States.",29
164,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide) [2.34]-The plausible plea of the Attorney-General practically is, "" Please leave the administration to prosecute as it thinks fit,"" and it mav be further refined into, "" Please leave the administration for the time being to prosecute its political enemies, and let its political friends go free."" We had an illustration yesterday that the law is not enforced if it be a question of ""saving the face"" of a political friend. We have had distinct breaches of the law in which the administration has been so peculiarly sympathetic that the culprits have escaped, and we do not want similar cases in the future. The Attorney-General knows that, in connection with postal voting, corruption has taken place. Persons who are otherwise honest seem to lose all their honour at election time, and to do things which, in ordinary 'life or business, they would view with scorn and horror. Some breaches of the law result from over-zealousness, too much enthusiasm, or strong party views; but we know that men of education, commercial knowledge, and ability do not hesitate to break the electoral law, and to secretly gloat over the fact that they are able to do so. The Attorney-General ought not to plead that the administration should be free to permit such offenders to escape.",29
165,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I never made any such plea.,30
166,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"But that is what the plea of the Attorney-General practically amounts to. The amendment is sufficiently wide to leave the administration free not to take action unless it chooses. In the first place, there has to be a bond fide plaint ; in the second place, that complaint has to be thoroughly investigated without prejudice; and, thirdly, the Administration need not, unless the circumstances justify take further action. There is nothing mandatory in the clause-it does not say that any person committing a breach of the law by accident or otherwise shall necessarily be punished. Even if a case reaches the Court, no punishment may follow; and, under the circumstances, there will be no harassing of electors, and no trivial inquiries. All will be done impartially. It is in connection with the postal voting that we find most of these unfair and corrupt practices; and ""I think the Minister of Home Affairs will be well advised toaccept, not necessarily a mandatory clause, but some provision that will operate as ?. check.",30
167,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Calare) [2.38] - The position of the Minister is practically- "" There are certain offences in which we shall take action and prosecute; but, first of all, we must be informed, not only what the offences are, but also who are the ""offenders, and if, with the evidence before us, we consider a case has been made out, we shall submit it to the Crown Law authorities', who, if they think there is a primd facie case, may place the matter in the hands of those whose duty it is to take action."" Apparently, the Electoral Department considers itself as merely a sort of machine for the purpose of registering, complaints and passing them on to the Crown Law Department. It is no part of the duty of the Crown Law Department todiscover either offences or offenders, but simply to deal with dry matters of law. and, on the evidence submitted, advise whether there should be a prosecution. It. is before that stage is reached that my amendment will operate, and place the Electoral Department in a position to arm itself with additional facts for the proper submission of a case to the Crown' Law authorities. Under similar circumstances, the other Departments take action on their own initiative. In the Postal and other. Departments, if an offence is disclosed, the machinery at hand is used to discover who the offender is, and that having been done the papers are sent on to the Crown Law Office for advice. The Electoral authorities take up their present position because of an opinion expressed by a previous Attorney-General-wh o is a member of the present Government-that there is nothing ir* the Act which places the onus of investigacom- tion on the Department. I again point out, however, that the other Departments do not require specific legislation to cause them to recognise their duty. I am not the only it, one who has made complaints, because there is also the honourable member for Herbert; and the Departmental reply that he received is practically identical with that, sent to me. We may reasonably assume, therefore, that that reply discloses the principle and practice of the Department; and, that being so, I now propose an amendment providing that it shall be part of the duty of the Department to institute investigations in bond fide cases. If , as I say, we are to assume that this is the general policy of the Department, has it to be applied only to certain members, and not to all ? If the Minister maintains that investigations are made, and prosecutions are instituted, by the Department, I desire to know why a line is drawn between myself and the honourable member for Herbert, on the one hand, and honourable members opposite, on the other ?",30
168,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I have done nothing of that sort. I have had no case before me to deal with.,30
169,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Probably not, but that seems to be the only alternative to the position taken up by those who previously controlled the Department. If the Minister does exercise this power in his administration, then he is doing something which a previous Attorney-General said did not devolve upon the Department, that opinion being taken by the Department as an excuse for not moving in the matter. The law on the subject is very clear. Section 180 lays it down thatIn addition to bribery and undue influence the following shall be illegal practices :(a) Any publication of any electoral advertisement hand-bill or pamphlet or any issue of any electoral notice (other than the announcement by advertisement in a newspaper of the holding of a meeting) without at the end thereof the name and address of the person authorizing the same; (i) Printing or publishing any printed electoral advertisement hand-bill or pamphlet (other than an advertisement in a newspaper) without the name and place of business of the printer being printed at the foot of it ; Under the table of electoral offences and punishments appears the followingDistributing any advertisement, hand-bill or pamphlet published in contravention of section one hundred and eighty; Penalty not exceeding Fifty pounds, or imprisonment not exceeding - one month. The intention of the Legislature, therefore, was that the Department should have complete authority to investigate any breaches of those sections, and that, if such investigation showed that there was a case for the Crown Law Department, it should be submitted to it, and a prosecution instituted, against the guilty person if the advice of the Crown Law Officers favoured that course. That is the only way in which the Act could be vindicated. It is the only way in which every Act of this Parliament which provides for penalties and punishments for offences against it is vindicated. It is simply because the Department has taken up an attitude different from that of every other Department that I wish to have this clause inserted, placing upon the officers of the Department the obligation which, upon the authority of a previous Attorney-General's opinion, they deny rests upon them. If the present position of the Department is as the Minister states, what objection is there to carrying the clause? If , on the other hand, the Department propose to continue the policv which they have so far adopted, the clause is very necessary. It is wide, and in no way mandatory. I trust the Minister will allow it, as it is a machinery proposal pure and simple, to be included in this machinery Bill. The only legitimate reason that he could have for objecting to it would be that he wanted to take up the position that has been occupied by the Department in refusing to exercise the obligations placed upon it by the law. I hope he will seriously consider the clause, and that, even if he will not accept it, the good sense of the Committee will stand By it.",31
170,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Gwydir) [2.50] - I hardly think it necessary to say much more on the subject after the able way in which the honourable member for Calare has stated the case.,31
171,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I stated the other side as well as I could.,31
172,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,There are two sides to the matter; and it appears to me that the Minister is standing upon very weak ground. The Minister claimed that he had the power.,31

176,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,By whom?,31
177,Mr FULLER,Unknown,B y anybody who likes .to bring it along.,31
178,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,What would the Department call a bond fide case on which to take action?,31
179,Mr FULLER,Unknown,As k me something easy.,31
180,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Why does the Minister object fo this proposal, which merely, makes ff obligatory on the Department to take action, as all other Departments do, where the law has been broken?",31
181,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Is there any such provision in the other laws ?,31
182,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The provisions cf other laws have not been overruled by an opinion of the Attorney-General as in this case. The honourable member for Calare desires to remove an obstacle placed in the way of even-handed justice, by an opinion given by the Attorney-General in a previous Government.",31
183,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Does the honourable member object to the action of a Minister whom he was supporting?,31
184,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"It is an old gag of the honourable member for North Svdnev, and about the only unfair phase of his attitude in this Chamber, that, when he is lost' for an argument, he turns round, and says, "" This was done by a Minister whom supported,"" as if we were responsible for every administrative act of a Minister whom we were supporting on his general policy and platform. I care not by what Minisdesire ter, or in what Government, it was done. possible. The House must see that the purport and intention of the .law is carried frustrated by the ipse dixit of any Attorney-General. The Minister says that action has been taken, and cases have been heard.",31
185,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I quoted a number of cases in which convictions were secured.,32
186,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"But how many cases himself, which ought to have been dealt with the Department have not been dealt with? .In how many cases, where it was the duty of the Government to trace the culprit, the Department refuse to act, unless one else undertook that task? practice means throwing the onus of the ministration of the Act on the public, not on the Department which is charged with it. It is not fair to make every man who feels that the law has been broken spy or informer with regard to its-adminisappeals tration. That sort of thing is not in actheir cordance with the principles of British justice, and why it should be imported this branch of the law I cannot understand. But it seems useless to appeal to anv ter in this Government, no matter how portant or far-reaching an amendment is, or how unjust to an individual or unfair to the people .the present state of things may be.",32
187,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I gave my reasons at length, but the honourable member was not here.",32
188,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable memof ber's reasons are not adequate. He should be open to the reasons of others, as as to those of his Department. The House has got into such a state that, no matter how important or far-reaching a measure may be, members on this side appeal in vain for reasonable consideration.",32
189,Mr FULLER,Unknown,The honourable member blocked a most important matter this mornthat ing.,32

191,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I have no axe to grind out, and not in this matter.",32
192,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"In this case we are bound by an opinion given by an Attorney General intervening since the original law was passed, and practically undermining the equities of that law. If Demosthenes or the greatest man that the world by has ever seen, were here-me n who would shake ordinary men to their very foundations-thei r pleadings would have no effect did on the Ministers who now take charge of some measures in this House - Parliamentary Such a Government under present conditions, as adillustrated by the treatment of this clause, and is becoming practically a nightmare. Ministers evidently no longer recognise the responsibilities attached to the administration a of laws. They, turn a deaf ear to the of men who have had cases under own observation, simply because those appeals are in opposition to the opinion of into the Department. The officers of the Department admit that in the administration Minisof this law they have no option but to imwait until some one comes along with a culprit, saying, "" I have caught him in the act; prosecute him."" Apparently there is no duty on the part of the Government to seek out the wrong-doer; no obligation on the part of the Department to see that the law is fairly and squarely administered. No; that must be left to the public! If that were the position in regard to breaches other laws, it would be unnecessary to employ policemen and detectives to mainwell tain order and good government. Are offenders under this legislation to be free from the punishment which is meted out to persons who break other laws? Are we to make exemptions whereby certain individuals may be able to escape the result of their wrong-doing? Am I to understand the Minister unwittingly aims at making the law so loose that a person who coman offence under it may be permitted, because of political or other influence, to",32
193,Mr FULLER,Unknown,A H this is mere imagina,32
194,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I think that I have I stated the true position. If the Minister, when it is pointed out to him that the law is so loose as to be ineffective, refuses to take cognisance of that warning, and prefers to be guided by the records of his Department, what are we to assume? A lav? is effective only when it is preventive. When a law is loose, men, knowing that there are loopholes of escape, take advantage of it. The fear of punishment is sufficient to deter the average man from breaking the law. As a matter of fact, most of our laws are more effective in the crimes that they prevent than in respect of""' the crimes that they punish. Many persons are kept in the path of rectitude because of the fear that if they depart from it they will be punished. We should see that there are as few loopholes as possible in our legislation. I can recall instances in which I have shown that a provision in a Bill to which the Minister in charge was wedded was not what it ought to be, and have successfully appealed to him to accept an amendment. I can recall other cases in which, where a Minister has failed to recognise the weakness of a proposal made by him, the Committee itself, being free to exercise its intelligence, has carried an amendment despite his opposition. I have sat in Parliaments in which men have been free to exercise the intelligence which Providence has given them, and to discriminate in important matters affecting the administration of the law.",32
195,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Especiall y after a speech by the honourable member !,33
196,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I have done more by a speech than the honourable member has ever done.,33
197,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I have never attempted to approach the honourable member's achievements in that regard.,33
198,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"If I chose, I could reply in caustic terms, and could humiliate the Minister, but I have no desire to do so.",33
199,Mr FULLER,Unknown,It is open to the honourable member to attempt to do so if he desires.,33
200,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I shall, at some other time. At present I am not concerned with the honourable member's view of the way in which I address myself to any public question, but I may say that, in conducting a case before a Court, I have won more approbation than the honourable member, despite his legal training, has ever won. Surely. the Minister is not to be al' lowed to play these little tiddly-winking tricks because of the prejudice against Labour men, or the solid phalanx behind him. In all deliberative assemblies men should be free to use their intelligence. If that were the position in this Committee, this amendment would .nol be defeated. Important proposals have been submitted from this side by honourable members quite as intelligent and as clever in reasoning as the Minister is, but they have been rejected by honourable memberopposite. Honourable members of the Opposition appeal again and again to honourable members opposite to consider important amendments, but they might as well talk to the walls. The ears of honourable members opposite are deaf to our entreaties. They are not open to conviction. They have sealed up their powers of observation and discrimination, and are absolutely clogged by the machine that is unfortunately governing politics in this Parliament today.",33
201,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order ! Can the honourable member connect these remarks with the question before the Chair ?,33
202,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I can. I say that the attitude of the Department is part of the machine. If the Department will not administer the law and make it effectiveif it allows certain offenders to escape-it is a party to the crime. It is not merely conniving at, but encouraging, a breach of the law. I hope that this proposed new clause will be pressed to a division, because it is founded upon what the honourable member for Calare believes to be just and equitable and in the best interests of the Department. I shall leave the Minister to be guided by the Attorney-General, who, when attacked just now, left-the Chamber, and has not returned to reply I leave him to be guided also by the opinions of previous Attorneys-General, and by the dry and musty records of his Department. Having gathered knowledge from those sources, he may use his own judgment in determining whether or not electors shall be compelled to prosecute persons for violating an Act which he, in his present position, ought to have the courage to administer.",33
203,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Kalgoorlie) [3. n ] - I am surprised that the Minister of Home Affairs should oppose this proposed new clause. It is usual for the responsible Department to bring to justice those who break the law. Why should we make an exception in the case of offences under the Electoral Act ?,33
204,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Does not the Chief Electoral Officer investigate complaints at the present time?,33
205,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"He makes only a partial investigation. I understand from those who have been personally interested in cases such as have been brought before the Minister during this debate that the Department throws upon the complainant the responsibility of discovering the offender. That is not a proper attitude for it to adopt. Where there is primd facie evidence that the law has been broken, surely the Crown Law Department should endeavour to trace the offenders and have them punished? That is such a reasonable proposition that I am unable to understand why the Minister is not prepared to endorse it. If we declare that in respect of offences under the Electoral Act there shall be vested in private individuals an authority which under other laws is exercised by the Crown Law Department, we shall institute an entirely new set of conditions. Why should a person who violates the Electoral Act, and so, perhaps, corrupts an election, be allowed to escape punishment? The Minister must have very strong reasons to justify his determination to withhold the assistance of the Crown Law Department from those who desire that offenders under the Electoral Act shall be brought to book. I thought that the wisdom of this proposed new clause would commend itself to honourable members opposite, notwithstanding that it was submitted by a member of the Opposition.",33
206,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Did the honourable member really believe that?,34
207,Mr IRAZER,Unknown,I thought that in certain circumstances even the antipathy exhibited by honourable members opposite towards the Opposition would not be allowed to run away with their judgment. I do not know whether the Minister will be supported by his .colleagues in his opposition to this proposed new clause.,34
208,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Le t us go to a division, and see.",34
209,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I hope for his sake that we shall not have last night's degrading spectacle repeated, he being on one side and all his colleagues on the other. If the Government think that persons who break the law should be allowed to go unscathed, it is for them to say so.",34
210,Mr FULLER,Unknown,That is not our opinion.,34
211,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,What objection can there be to the insertion of a provision which will require the Crown Law Department to prosecute whenever a primd facie case of an infraction of the law has been brought before it?,34
212,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Minister s object because it is the "" wowsers"" who always break the law.",34
213,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Does the honourable member propose to give us a definition of the word "" wowsers "" ?",34
214,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I should be called to order by the Chairman were I to attempt to do so; but there are members of the Committee who are generally recognised as "" wowsers,"" and yet, in my opinion, are the biggest sinners. I did not hear the Minister's statement of his objection to the proposal. Every other Statute contains a piovision of this kind.",34
215,Mr FULLER,Unknown,No .,34
216,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"At any rate, the Crown Law officers always accept the responsibility of prosecuting when breaches of any but the electoral law occur.

I admit that the inveS' tigation which is proceeding is very slew, and that the discoveries^ are not wnfii would be made were it ""more energetic.

220,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The recent alteration has been for the worse. We have no chance of getting from this Government improvements which we could not get from previous Governments.

221,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [3.20] I have had some experience of breaches of the electoral law, though perhaps the less said about it the better. On one occasion, although the sworn declarations relating to electoral offences made a big pile, it was difficult to get the Department to act. One of the chief officers concerned, when the matter was being discussed was running about his room, followed by his son, imploring him to be firm, that is, firm in allowing the Act to be broken. I have brought offences under the notice of officers on polling day itself, gross violations of the law, but, unfortunately, there seems to be no provision for the taking of immediate action. It is requiring too much of a citizen to ask him to proceed against offenders. We all wish justice to reign supreme, and though sometimes she may be swayed by technical objections, in the main she does so. Citizens should have the right to go to the officer in charge of a subdivision, or to some other officer, to make complaints, and should these be in writing, the Government should take action. Were citizens to take the law into their own hands, we should get back to the procedure of duelling, and other anachronisms which civilization has swept away. If the Minister will not accept the amendment, I ask him to ponder over the matter with a view to determining whether it is fair to place upon citizens the onus of prosecuting offenders under the electoral law. This Parliament is the highest Court we have, and in the sacred name of justice the Government sliould see that all wrongs against the purity of elections are punished, taking upon itself the onus and expense of the necessary prosecutions.

(1) Any person who at any public meeting to which this section applies acts in a disorderly manner for the purpose of preventing the transaction of the business fur which the meeting is held shall be guilty of an offence against this Act. Penalty : Five pounds or one month's imprisonment. (2) This section applies to any lawful public political meeting held in relation to any election of members of the Parliament, between the date of the issue of the writ for the election and the date of the return of the writ. The reasons I ask the Minister to accept this amendment are very simple. This is a constitutional Commonwealth, regulated by law, resting on reason, and guided,, more or less, by public - opinion. In order"" to ascertain public opinion, every candidateis entitled to be heard, and the public areI n ai nation where the people are the governors and the governed, if a few-and these representing a sort of organized hoodlumism - can prevent a candidate from speaking, the whole community is de14 prived of hearing that candidate. If AYES. there is one thing dear to the heart of the true Australian, it is the right of free speech-that priceless jewel of progressive Democracy !-and those who would destroy free speech are savages, whether they belong to one side or the other. When a candidate takes a hall and advertises a meeting, he becomes a host who has invited the public to be his guests for a couple of hours. . If the guests are not satisfied with the bill of fare put before them, they ought to put their hats on and go home, or to a ""pub,"" where they can enjoy themselves at their own expense. It seems extraordinary that guests should, as i were, come to a man's home, and, because they are not satisfied with the entertainment, try to wreck the house or prevent other guests from enjoying themselves. A few men, who are not voters, and have no interest whatever in the contest, except thai arising from the fact that they are organized as a gang to break up a meeting, cam do no end of mischief, and the two great; political parties are blamed for that over which they have no control.",34
222,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Would the honourable - member apply the amendment to Parliathe ment ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am perlaws. fectly willing to do so. Unless we have some provision under which the chairman of a public meeting is empowered to compel disturbers to leave, or to have them rested, free speech will become a thing the past in some parts of Australia. I have no desire to see people imprisoned, as the suffragettes are in England, and through the nostrils with tubes-that savagery-bu t we do desire to hold our public meetings where and when we will, without their being broken up by certain persons simply .because they do not like the views of the candidates addressing them.",36
223,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Illawarra-Ministe Home Affairs) [3.36] - The honourable member ""for Darwin was good enough to intimate to me that he intended to subing mil this amendment, and it has been ance. drafted in its present form by the Attorney-General. ""Honourable, members, I am sure, endorse the remarks of the honourable member as to the right of the people to hear candidates, and of candidates to their views before the public. We are in favour of free speech; and, under the circumstances, I have pleasure in supportfor ing the amendment.",36
224,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"Fawkner) [3.37] I am quite in favour of the amendment; but the question occurs to me whether we have power to enforce such a law. The Commonwealth has no control over police, who would, of course, have to called upon in the last resort. In Vicself. toria, and in some of the other States, - there are similar laws in operation; and those, I suggest, might meet the case. I self."" should like to hear what the Attorney General has to say on the point I have disturbing raised, because there is a possibility that the amendment, if carried, would remain a dead letter. Personally, I am very rethat luctant to have any one removed from my meetings, because I would rather be a martyr myself than make any one else martyr. As a matter of fact, little diswe turbances of the kind suit me, because usually find that those who raise them end by voting for me. The disturbers mostly unreasonable men, and, indeed, sometimes women, because at the last tion I was followed about by a shrillfor voiced old lady, who gave me much annoyance. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The police of States, under the Constitution, may be called upon to enforce the Commonwealth",36
225,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"In that case, my objection falls to the ground.",36
226,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Werriwa) [3.39] - I regret arthat the Minister has decided to accept this of amendment. I realise that it is not of much use debating the matter, because the decision of the Minister practically settles fed the question. My experience is that the is majority at a public meeting may be very well trusted to take care of themselves. If we hope to make politics more interesting and intelligible by holding public meetings on the plan of a Dorcas society we are making a great mistake.",36
227,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"A candidate is enr of titled tp be heard, surely?",36
228,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Quite so; but at the present time, the chairman of a public meethas full power to quell any disturb",36
229,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,In one place the control of my meeting was taken from me and I was thrown off the platform.,36
230,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Probably that is why the put honourable member is here now, because it all is such conduct that creates resentment against the disturbers and gains support the ill-used candidate. The amendment will not result in free speech being any better preserved than it is now; but we may find that a man who proposes to vote against the party in office is, on the charge of creating a disturbance, placed the in gaol over election day. be Mr Mauger - Not if he behaves him",36
231,Mr HALL,Unknown,"It all depends on what the honourable member means by "" behaves him",36
232,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I certainly do not mean public meetings.,36
233,Mr HALL,Unknown,"It is not to be expected in times of political excitement everybody will keep quiet; and, if the matter be left to the determination of some chaira men we have known, or to some policemen have known, it will be found that ideas I of good behaviour vary very materially.",36
234,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,What about the are throwing of rotten eggs?,36
235,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Unde r the present law I elechave known a man arrested and punished throwing eggs at a candidate. In my opinion, the amendment will only place a further weapon in the hands of the party in power, with the result that, if it be used or abused, the number of electors may be slightly reduced. Honourable members may laugh, but in a country town, my supporters were enthusiastic enough to collect 35s. on an election day in order to release a man from gaol, so that he might vote tor me. That is the kind of enthusiasm that has sent me here; and I rejoice at the fact. The greatest difficulty we have in obtaining an intelligent judgment on public questions, is that fifty out of every hundred people never trouble to attend public meetings.",36
236,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,Because of the orspeak ganized rowdyism.,37
237,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Perhaps the honourable member has suffered a good deal, but experience of Victoria leads me to the clusion that electors who indulge in rowdycopies ism do the worse service for their own cana didate. I do not blame the Minister for accepting such amendments if there honourable members on this side prepared to submit proposals in the interests the partu opposite. Who is to be the Judge of what constitutes a, disturbance? Is it suggested that everybody vvho goes a meeting ought to sit perfectly quiet? I ing a meeting ? admit that there is a limit to everything, and if this clause suggested a legitimate limit, it might not be fraught clanger. Some honourable members think that the test of a disturbance candidate from being heard. No amendment is necessary to meet that sort of < thing, because it is already provided against, and can be effectually stopped under the present law.",37
238,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,In some States.,37
239,Mr HALL,Unknown,In all States the police can put a man out for conduct of that sort.,37
240,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Can we have too many precautions ?,37
241,Mr HALL,Unknown,"It is many policemen, and bad not many precautions, that are wanted in a time of trouble of that kind. This pose, clause does not propose to create a single to extra policeman for meetings, attended by be the unruly crowd to which the honourable in power member refers, but it strikes at public silence, and meetings in a way that surprises me. Does of that public it apply to open-air meetings?",37
242,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,To all political - meetings.,37
243,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Then I do not hesitate to say that it is a scandal that it should supported. Evidently, in future we shall be able to stop a band from playing down a street because a candidate is holding a meeting at one corner, or to have the local Salvation Army thrown into gaol because they are disturbing a political meeting.",37
244,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,It would be monstrous to do that. ' Mr HALL - Yes ; but does this clause enable it to be done?,37
245,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"No ; it does not stop bands, but if a man is trying to speak, arid two bands start opposite to him, I think they would have to be shut up.",37
246,Mr HALL,Unknown,"It simply means that in future we shall give one man the street. When I see that my opponent is going to at one corner of a street, all that I shall have to do will be to get a balcony on the opposite corner and start first, and my then have him arrested for disturbing my conmeeting. We have not been supplied with of the clause, but I have now secured copy, which I shall read. It says, "" Any person who acts in a disorderly manner."" are - Is playing a band disorderly?",37
247,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,It may or may not be. of That is a matter of fact.,37
248,Mr HALL,Unknown,Would it be disorderly for the Salvation Army to play on the corner to of the street opposite to where I am holdColonel .FOXTON - If they did it with the intention of disturbing the honourable with so much member's meeting.,37
249,Mr HALL,Unknown,Does the intention make is preventing a the difference?,37
250,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,So the clause says.,37
251,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I shall merely record my protest against the proposal, for nothing that can be said will make any difference. I extend my sympathy to those hot-house plants who are so likely to be chilled by the fresh air of a little disturbance of the kind that they see at public meetings. I ' have always thought that anything that takes from the interest of an election is a thing for the country. The powers that now exist are sufficient for the purand this clause will not do anythinrr stop that organized opposition to which we all properly object. It will merelv a weapon in the hands of the party to coerce an occasional few into to prevent a reasonable amount discussion which in the past has been of such great service to the community. I do not want to descant at length upon the rights of public meetings, but the listeners as well as those whe are speaking be have rights. Their rights are not confined merely to sitting dumbly with their eyes and ears open and their mouths",37
252,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,What do they go there for?,38
253,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Anybod y who asked the honourable member a question that put him in a corner would be regarded by him as a disorderly person. We have had exlest perience in this House as to when a man becomes disorderly. So long as he is cheerfirst ing the Ministry, or his interjections are of a character that the speaker on the Minment. isterial side likes, all is well, but let him ask questions that give trouble, comes disorderly, and must be fired out, and in the circumstances contemplated by stitution this clause he would be fined a five-pound note.' I propose to move for the reduction of the fine to one pound, and of the term of imprisonment to a week. I therefore move That the proposed new clause be amended by wealth law. leaving out the word "" Five "" with a view to sert in lieu thereof the word "" One.""",38
254,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas-Attorney-General L3-55J-- I have been asked a question reto garding the question of jurisdiction. good deal of care was taken in drafting the clause, with a view to keep within our powers. It deals only with meetings called for electoral purposes. There is an Engis lish Act on the point much more drastic than this, because it deals not only withour political, but with all public, meetings.",38
255,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,So it ought.,38
256,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not take quite the extreme views of some honourable members on the point. Perhaps the honourable it member for Werriwa placed a little too much emphasis on his remarks, but there is something to be said for the right of people to indulge in a certain amount of free terjecting, and that has been borne in mind in drafting the clause. If honourable memevidence bers will look at the amendments of which the transaction notice was given, they will see that they involved a far greater limitation upon the power of interjecting or manifesting disconterjections, tent with a speaker than this clause does, because, unless there is a deliberate attempt to stop the transaction of the business of the meeting, such as was contemplated some of the English Acts, no conviction possible under the terms of this clause. But if people go to a public meeting with a view to preventing it being carried on and stopping that free discussion of opinion which is the very essence of electoral freeDarwin dom",38
257,Mr HALL,Unknown,Canno t they be put out shut. under the law as it stands ?,38
258,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I think they can, but we do not want to 'be altogether dependent on the States in these matters. ' Honourable members are always speaking about protecting the Federal Acts and enforcing prosecutions under them, and this proposal is a> of the soundness of their professions. At present we are at the mercy of the States, as regards the character of their legislation, and secondly as regards its enfoice",38
259,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"We shall be now; we and he behave no policemen. i Mr Glynn - In section 5 of the Conit is provided that our laws are binding not only on the States, but on every individual in the Commonwealth. Policemen or no policemen, we have a right loeill upon even a member of Parliament to assist in the enforcement of the CommonSimilarly, under the Judiinciary Act there is provision under the powers conferred upon us by the Constitution cast) ing upon State Courts the duty of helping administer our laws, and also imposing; A obligations upon the States under section T2o of the Constitution to make provision for the punishment of offenders against our laws. I have no doubt that if the offence established we shall find means to meteout the punishment, but it ought to be within control to say what the character of legislation should be, and whether prosecutions should be initiated or not. It is evident that we are not autonomous if we depend at every point on the character of State legislation and the degree to which, is administered by the State authorities. For that re?.son, although there is legislation in some of the States, and probably in all, under which far more drastic provisions inthan these might be enforced as regards public meetings, there ought to be no objection to a clause like this, which requires of a deliberate attempt to prevent of the business of a meeting. It is not an attempt to prevent people hissing now and then, or indulging in free inand having a little emeute lhat really does not mean more than a temporary check to the eloquence of the speaker, for it would be tyrannous to step in and prevent by men indulging with fair latitude in what is may be called ""physical remonstrance"" against the observations of a speaker.",38
260,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Calare) [3.58].. - I agree with the honourable member for that public meetings should be conducted in a proper and orderly manner, and that anything like concerted action for the purpose of breaking up a meeting or preventing those who convene it or those who attend it from transacting the business in a proper way should be a punishable offence. It is an offence which is punishable in all the States now so far as my knowledge goes. It is in the power of the chairman or the conveners of a meeting to call in the police and order the immediate arrest of persons guilty of conduct of that character. whilst I agree with the honourable member to that extent, something more is being aimed at by a number of those who are supporting his proposal. I object to candias dates for this' House being given rights and privileges that are denied to the general community. They should not, simply because they happen to be members or wish to become members of this Parliament, be put upon a pedestal ancl given autocratic powers in the conduct of meetings which are denied to the rest of the community. I» do not know that my experience has been exceptional, but I have been in State and Federal politics for fifteen or sixteen years, and during that time have fought election contests as hard as have fallen to the lot of any man. Whilst I have met with interruptions at public meetings, however, I have never yet been subjected to interruptions to which I could take exception to the extent of appealing to the law.",38
261,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,Could the honourable member's opponents say the same?,39
262,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"I am not prepared to say, but my experience is that candidates themselves are largely responsible for interruptions at their meetings.",39
263,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,That is nonsense.,39
264,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"It is not; some candidates sometimes speak so egotistically and present statements so wide of the actual facts that self-respecting people who like to hear matters fairly stated from the public platform allow their feelings of resentment to find expression in a manner which constitutes an interruption. In such cases it is not the audience, but the speaker who causes the interruption.",39
265,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"On one occasion, before I had uttered a word, my meeting was taken from me, the platform was rushed, and I was put outside.",39
266,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,I have had no such experience. Many interruptions at election meetings are in the nature of questions designed to elicit information or else they are denials of statements made by the candidate.,39
267,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Such interruptions would not come under - the proposed new clause*,39
268,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,They would constitute an interruption of a public meeting.,39
269,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,But not in a disorderly manner.,39
270,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"A magistrate might rule that a man who interjected a But denial of a statement made by a candidate at an election meeting was guilty of interrupting in a disorderly manner. Such an interruption in a church would be treated disorderly., and, apparently, the supporters of this proposed new clause would put all political meetings on the same level as a church meeting.",39
271,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,They should be regarded as even more sacred than a church meeting.,39
272,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"The honourable member is claiming for politicians a status which I cannot endorse. A politician who is not prepared to stand his ground should not be protected by such a provision as this, and placed in a. position superior to that of a clergyman in a pulpit.",39
273,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Candidate s desire to be able to stand their ground, but many organized obstructionists and ruffians will not allow them to do so.",39
274,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Why not apply the principal of this proposal to this House?,39
275,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"What would be the position if it were applied? Very often interruptions at a public meeting are nol the outcome of a preconcerted movement. In many cases the promoter of such interruptions is not actually present. A man who desires tb have a meeting broken up may gather a few men together in a neighbouring publichouse, ply them with liquor until they become muddled, and then send them off to the meeting, with the result that interruptions take place.",39
276,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,That is the strongest possible argument in support of this proposed new clause.,39
277,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"I do not think it is. Under this provision the person actually responsible fbr such an interruption would not be punished. I am afraid that it will be put into operation in a very partial way. If a man who is strongly opposed to a candidate makes his presence felt, at a public meeting, to only an infinitesimal degree, as compared with that of others, he will be singled out for punishment. This proposed new clause will be used for party purposes in a vindictive manner, not to preserve free speech, but to vent the spleen of some candidate or politician on a strong opponent. I shall support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Werriwa, because I think that the punishment for which the clause as it stands provides would be too drastic, and should be limited to a reasonable degree.

278,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Kalgoorlie) [4.14] Surely the Minister does not take the view that because a man interjects and creates a disturbance at a meeting,40
279,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,We object to dissiastically orderly conduct at a public meeting.,40
280,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Very often the honourable gentleman has not to go far from this Chamber for an exhibition of disorderly conduct. Honorable MEMBERS - Hea r ! hear !,40
281,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I am glad that honourable members opposite regard that as a fair interpretation of their conduct. Apparently, they desire to compel audiences to listen to statements which they may know to be untrue.",40
282,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,Audience s are not compelled to listen; they can leave.,40
283,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The speaker on the platform is not the only person at a poli33 tical meeting who is entitled to consideration. The man in the audience may hear a speaker whom he knows to have repu19 diated his election pledges try to mislead AYES. his constituents to obtain a new lease of political life, but should he express disapprobation by stamping his feet or interjecting, he may be tossed out of the hall, and fined £ 5 , or be imprisoned fora month.",40
284,Mr FULLER,Unknown,That is the maximum penalty.,40
285,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Then , apparently, the Courts are to determine the heinousness of . the offence. Why is not a fixed penalty to be provided? Are honourable members afraid to go before their constituents under the conditions which now apply to political meetings? I have no sympathy with NOES. the breaking up of meetings by organized conspiracy, nor has any one on this side of the Chamber. On only one occasion have I known it to be done. It happened once in Kalgoorlie, when a man who had deliberately broken' his pledges began his speech by insulting his constituents, and continued to do so while he was allowed PAIRS. to proceed. The supporters of the amendment would prosecute an audience for resenting such conduct, and would fine those who are guilty of it £ 5 each, or imprison them for a month. Of course, an audience always walk out; but men who are being publicly insulted do not feel inclined to do that. Honourable members opposite have guilty consciences. They know that by they have broken nearly every pledge on Therefore, they grasp at this provision.",40

288,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The honourable member seems to have a nice opinion of his colleague, the honourable member for Darwin.",41
289,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"A public man who has acted fairly by his constituents does not require protection of this kind. Are we to be treated as hot-house plants, and carefully guarded from the breath of criticism ? Would the Minister agree to imprisonment for a week as a maximum penalty?",41
290,Mr FULLER,Unknown,No .,41
291,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Possibl y the Minister would like to have the penalty increased to six months?,41

296,Dr WILSON,Unknown,They like to please the caucus sometimes.,41
297,Mr FULLER,Unknown,The proposal now being discussed is not that originally put forward.,41
298,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It has been altered by the reduction of the maximum penalty from a fine of ^10 to a fine of. ^ 5 , and reduction of the term of imprisonment from six months to one month. Is there anything peculiar in a political meeting that»special legislation is needed in regard to it? Is not the ordinary law sufficient toprotect public men? Are we afraid to address the public under the protection of the common law? Do honourable members shrink from appearing before the citizens who sent them here unless they have protection against interruptions?",41
299,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,This is only an assertion of the right of the man who has hired a hall to speak in it.,41
300,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The common law protects every person who holds a public meeting, many of which are as important as political meetings. I have not yet met a man who was afraid of a little bit of fun at a public meeting. Generally such meetings are 'too dull. Are persons to be imprisoned for challenging the statements of speakers who are wilfully and deliberately reflecting on. the honour and integrity of their parents, wives, and families?",41

305,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is not at all severe. Besides, the honourable member for Darwin can take care of himself. He sometimes entertains us with extraordinary propositions, which he supports quite sincerely ; but I cannot see what reason there is for imposing special penalties for interfering with a political meeting. Organized, deliberate, and wilful disturbance can be punished under the existing lav. I do not know what the law of the other States may be; that of Queensland gives the chairman of a public meeting as much right to eject unruly persons as Mr Speaker or the President of the Senate possesses.",41
306,Mr FULLER,Unknown,We do not want to depend on the State law.,41
307,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that we should have a criminal law of our own ? In the State of Queensland those who interrupt public meetings can be ejected and taken before the Courts.,41
308,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,Does the honourable member consider it a disturbance to use a motor hom at a public meeting?,41
309,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"To use any instrument of the kind would constitute a disturbance. Apparently, some of those flash gentlemen who own motors are in the habit of disturbing meetings by using motor horns. The common 'law is sufficient for the regulation of political meetings. A provision of this kind will humiliate Parliament, as some of the previous proposals of the Government have done. It is proposed to use an exceptionally heavy hammer to crush what I might call the ordinary. political flea. If we pass this amendment it will not reflect much credit on the intelligence of - the Federal Parliament; indeed, it will bring us into ridicule amongst the more stalwart, hard-thinking men of the country, who know what politics are. They know that we must have militant, determined citizens ready to investigate every political question; and that unless liberty is allowed, we shall reach the time when the worse kind of political corruption will be found both within and without this Parliament.",41
310,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [4.31] After listening to the eloquence of the orable member for Wide Bay for some time, I came to the conclusion that amendment must have been altered in some way without my knowledge since I saw it things. yesterday.

I do not object to one or two, or, perhaps, half-a-dozen, or a tram-load interjectors, being sent out by special tram, with fares paid, to attend my meetings, - I find that the most disorderly elements at my meetings are from over the borders, from other constituencies. I do ject to persons endeavouring by interjection to let my constituents see a different point of view from that which I present; but I do object to combined and organized disorderly opposition such as is aimed in this amendment. What I mean is an opposition which at the mere sight candidate will begin to sing a chorus, or, if the meeting be held in a hall, vile-smelling chemicals on the floor. It. is just as well that the Leader of the Opposition, by so heatedly opposing this amendhonment, has shown who it is that is behind this system of organized obstruction; but the I am glad that one member opposite-if only one-ha s seen the evil of this state of",42
313,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The whole reason for the the amendment is that boodleiers organized obstruction at a meeting in Tasmania.,42

I am glad that the honmember for Darwin has it in by him to stand up for 'the liberty of I sincerely hope that the party which is led by the honorthat able member for Wide Bay will yet give a few recruits to this new purpose movement for securing the purity of elections, and that we shall be done with all the canting hypocrisy to as which we listened just before I rose. It is nonsense to suggest that any honourable member who supports this amendment is the afraid of public meetings-the boot is on the other foot. If honourable gentlemen opposite are afraid to have free speech on the platforms of Australia, let them vote against this amendment; but if they are not afraid of full political discussion, let them support it, as I shall do with the to see that the utmost pleasure.",42
315,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [4.37] - The shall honourable member for Wentworth should the be an authority on obstruction at public meetings, because the students at the UniSome versity, which I believe he attended, are essenadepts at the game. When the Leader of to the English Labour party went to Oxford, of the students there spilled vile-smelling chemicals on the floor, and made noises to of prevent him from being heard.",42
316,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Then the honourable memfor ber ought to support this amendment.,42
317,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,There is hardly a Univetsity commemoration at which we do not not obfind these educated larrikins,42
318,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What has this to do with the amendment?,42
319,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I shall show the honorat able member presently. It would appear that there is not to be free speech either of the in this House or outside.,42
320,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Not if the honorwill spill able member can help it.,42
321,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member cannot say that, so far as I am concerned. He is making a statement absolutely incorrect, and, what is more, he knows it to be incorrect. Some candidates, have gone about with the express purpose of setting audiences against themselves. One gentieman in Victoria commenced his address: ""Electors of Ballarat, and savages of Bungaree."" Would any honourable member, had he been an elector of that constituency, have sat down quietly under such an insult Yet, under the amendment, every one of those who were called "" savages of Bungaree"" would have gone to gaol had they piotested. It will be possible for a date, if the amendment be carried; to be offensive as he likes to the electors, while they are denied the right to retort. In Victoria slanderous statements, known to be false, have been made on the public platform regarding the Labour party. We were said to be in favour of weakening the marriage tie.",43
322,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I ask the honourable member not to go into details regarding that phase of the question.,43
323,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It was admitted by the President of the Women's National League that this statement was a lie; but she said it was a good ""cry,"" and that they intended to stick to it. Such statements may be made under this amendment, and any member of the Labour party who interjects a denial will be in danger of gaol.",43
324,Mr FULLER,Unknown,There is a similar law in operation in Victoria.,43
325,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Quite so; but, at the same time, with the exception, perhaps, of New South Wales, we have had here the most lively meetings held in Australia. The honourable member for Batman last ' week related his experience of public meetings; but, personally, I never knew of organized obstruction at any gathering of the kind. I have read in newspapers of people being sent to public meetings for the purpose of kicking up a row, but I have never been able to ascertain whether such was the truth.",43
326,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Did the honourable member never hear of a brass band being engaged to play outside a meeting hall?,43
327,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I have not; and I think the honourable member for Maribyrnong will bear me out when I say that that has never occurred in Victoria.,43
328,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Has the honourable member never heard of cab loads of men going from one suburb to another, in order to obstruct political meetings?",43
329,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I have not.,43
330,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,It was my experience at the last election.,43
331,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I have known of a fire brigade being called out in order to break up a meeting.,43
332,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I have never heard of such a thing.,43
333,Mr COON,Unknown,Has the honourable member ? never heard of the chairs being thrown about at a public meeting?,43
334,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I have not; though 1I have read in the newspapers of such candidoings. No doubt a public man has the as right to be heard; but, if this amendment be carried, I guarantee that the average bench of justices of the peace in Victoria would send any interjector to gaol if his interjections were directed against a candidate of the Fusion party. Time after time, I have advised my supporters not to interject, or interrupt in any way, the meetings of my opponents; and, as a matter of fact, people haye refused to attend my meetings because they are so quiet and orderly. If the amendment be carried, I trust the penalty will be> made as light as possible. I fear that it will operate only against men who are to interject in opposition to statements made at meetings by candidates belonging to the other side.",43
335,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas-Attorney-General) [4.46] - To show how mild the honourable member for Darwin, acting upon art almost instinctive sensitiveness on points of interference with public liberty, has suggested that the clause should be made,, let me point out that the penalty is. much less than the English law provides. The English section on that point draws a distinction between public meetings which are not political, and those which are. The provision as regards public meetings, using the same terms as appear ih this clause, is that the person is guilty of an illegal practice",43
336,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,What Act is that?,43
337,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The Act of last year. I think it was panic legislation, but we are not following in their footsteps in the matter. The Act was passed to prevent the disturbance of public meetings.",43
338,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,That was the Suffragette business.,43
339,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I think ""it was, but it deals with more ihan that. It provides, following the part that is analogous to this provision of the honourable member for Darwin, that the person so offending shall be guilty of an illegal practice within the meaning of the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act, 1883, and the penalty for an illegal practice under that Act is a fine not exceeding .£100 and incapacity, for five years from the date of the conviction, of being registered as an elector or voting at any election, whether it be a Parliamentary election or an election for a public office, held for or within the county or borough in which the illegal practice has been committed.",43
340,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Coul d not the honourable gentleman embody the sections from the Russian penal code?,44
341,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I am pointing out that we have not done it. The penalty is very mild, seeing that £ 5 is the maximum, and that even under the State law at present much milder disorder at a public meeting, which is a public place, is subject penalty of £ 2 , or one month's imprisonment. The disorderly conduct under this clause must be with a view to preventing the transaction of business, but under the State law a few interjections at a public meeting, if they have a tendency to disturb the peace of the meeting, are punishable in the way I have stated. Under the South Australian Act, even the mild offence of a few insulting expressions",44
342,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,No action has ever taken place under that.,44
343,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,But it is on the statute book *,44
344,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,That refers to public meeting.,44
345,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"And any public place. There was-it is, perhaps, jocularly said -- a case in England under a similar provision. A man went to a theatre, and was the only member of the public who assembled there. He insisted upon the performance being carried out, as he had a perfect right to do, but after a time, when he disapproved of the company's method of acting, he began to hiss, and was put out for disturbing the audience.",44
346,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [4.49] - Every time the Attorney-General speaks he shows more plainly that there is no necessity for the clause, because ample provisions already exist in the State laws. Apparently the Government desire to create a new form of crime. They seem to regard this as a new chance of - stowing away objectionable electors who may vote the wrong way. I am sorry to have to oppose the honourable member for Darwin, who is generally on the right track, but he has addressed more meetings in more varied places than any other honourable member, and it is only in some little out of the way place in Tasmania that he has had trouble at a public meeting. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I had it in South Australia with Tucker's gang.",44
347,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The honourable member has had only one or two cases of the kind. Disturbances of public meetings are becoming extremely rare, and an exaggerated idea of those that do happen is generally given by the press reports. I have had trouble at only one meeting in all my experience. That was in a little place near Moun* Gambier, and, curiously enough, among, farmers, as the honourable member for Darwin's experience was. One of the leaders of the anti-socialist party came to the door of the meeting pretty well drunk, and, with to a one or two larrikins or boys that he had picked up, made a disturbance. As a general , rule any interruption that does occur at meetings is nothing more than is forgivable. Any man would sooner address a live meeting than a lot of men who are so apathetic or dead that he does not know how they feel. There has been a considerable improvement in the conduct of elections and behaviour at political meetings generally in recent years. There was a time when there was a good deal more noise and disturbance. The cases that occur today are so few that I appeal to the Government whether it is worthwhile any to embody in this Bill such a drastic provision. Any person who really obstructs can be dealt with under State laws. Why should we duplicate the law on the subject? I am astonished at the Attorney General being a party to it. It does not improve matters to have two or three laws doing the same thing, and the Attorney-General will agree that the more we secure uniformity of law the better. It is important that there should be no check upon those who want to put bond fide questions to candidates or raise a justifiable objection to inaccurate statements. In this chamber we are not allowed by the Standing Orders to interject, but there is hardlv a member who does not interject when some one makes a statement that he considers inaccurate, and he does it at the moment because he does not want the statement to go any further. Surely at public meetings electors have the right to do the same thing. Many disturbances are brought on by the candidate himself. I do not deny that there may have been organized obstruction at some meetings, and I have seen cases where there has been a chorus of singing, which is an effective way of preventing a speaker from being heard. We read of that being done in Melbourne recently in a great Church Assembly, where a speaker's voice was drowned by the singing of a hymn. It is not uncommon at Salvation Armv meetings to announce a hymn if the speaker is too longwinded. We are asked to create a new offence under the law, and interfere with tolerance and freedom in political meetings. But if it is justifiable to do that, surely the Government must go further and put a stop to Presbyterian Assemblies interfering with the free speech of any man who has the floor, by singing hymns or psalms. I should like to hear the Attorney-General on the point as to whether this clause is to apply to this Parliament, because we have experienced considerable interference with free speech here. The honourable member for Darwin must have had that in his mind, because I see that he originally proposed a penalty of six months' imprisonment. Under this provision a candidate would only have to provoke a few men to! create a little disturbance in order to have them run in, and the friendly justices of the peace on the bench would promptly give them a month's imprisonment, which would probably carry them beyond the date of the election, so that they could not vote. It is a new way to get into Parliament to "" g a o l "" all the fellows who are opposed to you. As the honourable member for Yarra has well put it, with the class of justices of the peace that we have, very little consideration will be given to a Labour elector if he interjects at an anti-Socialist meeting. He would be run in for the full term; in fact the justices of the peace would rejoice in their action and think they were doing a really good thing for the country. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We do not want our men to break up their meetings any more than we want theirs to break up ours.",44
348,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Nobody' s meetings will be broken up. Cases of interference sufficient to complain about are so extremely rare that this great National Parliament would ' be making itself ridiculous by legislating for them, especially as they are already provided for under State Acts. I have not heard any honourable member tell of any great trouble that he has had at public meetings. There are cases of interruptions which one has to put up with for perhaps five minutes, but the trouble is all squared up afterwards, and frequently it is caused by some one with too much liquor on board. He has to be put out, but he is only one out of an audience, perhaps, ot five hundred or a thousand. He is often given drink to go to the meeting and disturb it, but this provision will not get at the man behind him. The Judges act on the well known principle of making the penalties more severe if there is an increase in any particular kind of crime, but in this case the disturbance of public meetings is a disappearing factor all over Australia, and, therefore, there is no need to provide for extra punishment. There are some candidates who cannot tolerate anything being said to them at all, but if they make wild and ridiculous statements at a meeting the . audience is not justified in standing such conduct. There are among the public a number of strong active politicians who vote intelligently, because they take a keen interest in politics, but if this clause is passed they -> will still go to meetings and refuse to allow candidates to make statements which they know to be untrue. They will challenge them there and then and take the risk of a month's imprisonment. It is men of thai, kind who have the courage to take risks in upholding the truth, that have made the world what it is today. Candidates have no right to be put behind ahedge where they cannot be challenged for statements that they make. Are we to make a law that will give them full freedom to mislead electors, and get into Parliament under . false pretences ? We ought to give the fullest liberty, not only to the speakers, but to the electors present at public meetings. In some cases people who attend political meetings go beyond the line of reasonable interruption, but such incidents are inevitable. Every man has not full self-control. Some men are more readily excited than others, and we must deal with men as we find them. Surely we are not going to say that a man who interjects on the spur of the moment at a public meeting shall be punished? We are supposed to be specially selected, because of our ability to legislate for Australia, and if we cannot keep within our Standing Orders relating to interjections and disorderly conduct, surely we ought not to say that an elector who becomes excited and interjects, because of an unjust statement made by a candidate at a public meeting, shall be liable to a fine of £ 5 or one month's imprisonment. We are told that it will be necessary to prove wilful intent. The legal minds of the Committee will agree, however, that it is dangerous to leave to magistrates the determination of mere matters of opinion. The justice meted out in such cases depends on whether or not there is any bias on the part of the adjudicating magistrates. It should not be left to a magistrate to determine whether or not disorderly conduct is wilful. What is a ""disturbance?"" question under the proposed newclause is to be determined by Justices of the Peace, and it is quite possible to conceive of some magistrates declaring that a man should be imprisoned for a month for daring to say ""Boo!"" at ja. political meeting. proposed new clause is altogether too vague, and there is no necessity for it. sorry that the Government have accepted it, and I sincerely hope that it will be rejected.",45
349,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Wakefield) ° [5-3J--It is interesting to observe 'the sweet simplicity of the honourable member for Darling, and the general concern manifested by honourable members opposite in regard to the proposed new clause is certainly very significant. The honourable member for Yarra spoke of a case in which a public meeting had been disturbed by university students, and the honourable member for Darwin intimated a few days ago that his chief reason for submitting this proposal was that meetings held, by him had been disturbed by rich ""boodleiers."" Disturbances by university students, rich ""boodleiers,"" or any one else ought not to be tolerated. This proposed new clause will be one of the best features of the Bill. It is, to a large extent, nonsense to say that a political meeting is rarely disturbed. Some strange things have been done at public meetings with the object of preventing freedom of speech.",46
350,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Where ?,46
351,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,The honthis orable member 'knows that my statement is correct.,46
352,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,I do not; where these incidents happened?,46
353,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,In many places.,46
354,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I have, not met with such occurrences.",46
355,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"If my honourable friends imagine foi one moment that the public will not know how to appreciate their apparent simplicity in desiring to secure, the rejection of the proposed new clause, they are greatly mistaken. It seems as if they fear that it will aim an effective blow at political campaigns of a certain character. Honourable members opposite have said that if this proposed new clause be carried, it will not be safe for a man to interject at a political meeting. They must know that that is nonsense. The Leader of the OpposiThat tion said that it would destroy public interest in political questions. We know that it will do nothing of the kind. It will secure to the people one of the most cherished principles of Democracy-the principle of freedom of speech. The Mr HUTCHISON - This is something new. I am Mr RICHARD FOSTER - It is not. The honourable member knows that in the city from which he comes organized bands have been sent from meeting to meeting, not to interject, but to obstruct and disturb candidates to whom they were opposed.",46
356,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I have never known such a thing to take place.,46
357,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,I have. The matter has been referred to in the public press. The press has castigated larrikins who have disturbed public meetings and those responsible for their actions.,46
358,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I challenge the honourable member to give an instance of the kind.,46
359,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Such incidents have taken place in Adelaide.,46
360,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Where ?,46
361,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"In different places, but the honourable member is not going to draw me out. If honourable members opposite do not think that the proposed new clause will put an end to a good deal of organized opposition in connection with election meetings, why are they so much concerned about it? I rose specially to call public attention to the fact that they are exclusively concerned about healthy and necessary provision to regulate the conduct of political meetings.",46
362,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Exclusivel y ? The have proposed new clause was submitted by a member of the Labour party.,46
363,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Then I shall qualify my statement and say that when we proceed to a division honourable members opposite will alone be found voting against the proposed new clause.,46
364,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I am in favour of freedom of speech.,47
365,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,The honourable member is in favour of freedom of anything when it suits him. Mr KING O'MALLEY - This proposition is in favour of our own side; we must have freedom of speech.,47
366,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Freedo m of speech ought to be""encouraged and pro-tected by every party. We are proposing now to enact what is the law in England, and also, 1 believe, in the United States of America.",47
367,Mr WEBSTIER,Unknown,And in Russia.,47
368,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"The honourable member, I believe, has derived most of his education from Russian ideals.",47
369,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The honourable member's party will soon be able tp educate Russia in the art of suppression.,47
370,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"The party to which I .belong in South Australia do not, as a rule, attend meetings of Labour candidates, because they cannot obtain fair play there.",47
371,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The trouble is that they cannot stand the truth.,47
372,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"That is not so. I have attended many political meetings, and have wished, for the reputation of those speaking at them, that they were not so afraid of the truth as they appeared to be. The trouble in this case is that my honourable friends opposite are hit under the ribs by this proposed new clause, and they do not like it. I hope that the Minister will not consent to an amendment to reduce the penalty.",47
373,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Why not hang people who dare to interject at a political meeting ?,47
374,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,I have no doubt that if my honourable friend had his way he would hang a good many people without trial by judge or jury. The proposed new clause is not aimed at intelligent decent men who take a proper interest in political affairs. It is aimed rather at political larrikins and hoodlums who are made the tools of others who ought to know better.,47
375,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The honourable member knows that the position is quite the reverse.,47
376,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"I know that I am speaking the truth, and that this proposed - new clause is a very sore point with my honourable friend. It is because it is getting between the joints of his harness that he does not like it. I am glad that a member of the Labour party is to have the honour of having initiated this proposal, and am sure that it will be approved by the general public. It will afford proper protection, not only to candidates, but to those who attend political meetings, and who have as much right to enjoy the pro tection of the' law as have the candidates themselves. If my honourable friends opposite believe in that most cherished principle of Democracy-freedo m of speechand favour the proper conduct of election meetings, they will vote for the proposed new clause.",47
377,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Boothby) [5.14] The honourable member for Wakefield has referred to organized obstruction in connection with election meetings in Adelaide, but only a moment or two ago the Attorney General, who is a representative of a South Australian electorate, said to me, "" So far as, South Australia is concerned there is no need for legislation of this kind. We have never had anything there that calls for it . """,47
378,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,He said publicly that similar legislatiot had been passed by the South Australian Parliament.,47
379,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"There is in operation a Slate law relating to all public meetings, and with that general law in operation no one on this side of the Committee has cause to complain.",47
380,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Because it is not at meetings of Labour candidates that disturbances take place.,47
381,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The honourable member desires to show that there is some special reason why the law relating to public meetings generally should be departed from in the case of political meetings ?,47
382,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"No , I have never attended a meeting of a Labour candidate at which a disturbance has taken place.",47
383,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Well , I have. If the honourable member thinks that those who disturb public meetings arc exclusively supporters of the Labour party, he makes a very great mistake.",47
384,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I do not say that they are exclusively.,47
385,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"That was the insinuation. No other meaning could be attached to the interjection. As a matter of fact, interruption comes as much from one party as from another. Surelv honourable members opposite are not suffering from swelled heads. They are fortunate enough to be able to stop criticism from side of the Chamber by applying the tices "" gag,"" and seem to think that, being able to ride rough shod over the minority here, they can do the same thing in regard the people at large.",47
386,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Most people provision outside will hail this proposition with light.,48
387,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Not at all. They do not desire that Parliamentary candisome dates shall be put into glass cases. Those who address public meetings should be able trary direction. to take their gruel.,48
388,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,It is not so much the gruel as the rotten eggs that arc jected to.,48
389,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"This provision will not prevent the throwing of eggs. It is fiirr.ply the extension of the "" g a g"" whole community.",48

411,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I do not wish the Government to be deprived of that support. My proposal is absolutely in the interests of fair play. We do not desire that those .who make awkward interjections at public meetings shall become marked men, to be disfranchised. Politicians do not need the protection which is being asked for. The Treasurer's pluck in addressing public meetings when the gold-fields trouble was on, when almost every man present was opposed to him, and almost ready to join in rioting, earned him admiration all over Australia. He did not ask for special protection then, nor try to place his opponents in gaol.",49
412,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,He had the power in those days.,49
413,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"He could have passed through Parliament repressive measures such as that now proposed, but did not do so. He faced the electors, and explained the position to them as well as he could. He did not lose by it. I ask him to show now the pluck of his earlier days, and not surround himself with privileges of the kind proposed. He does not need this protection.",49
414,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We are not thinking of ourselves always.,49
415,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"All persons who address public meetings must be in the same position, and liable to occasional heckling, but if they are able to interest their hearers, they can overcome any kind of obstruction, whether organized or not. I have known candidates who found it difficult to secure a liearing on the first attempt, by reason of organized obstruction, eventually obtain the attention of their audiences, and hold them spellbound. That has been done by men with whose political views I have not had any sympathy. If we are able to take the position of leaders of public thought, to which we aspire, we clo not need this protection: our ability to interest the public is sufficient. I hope the proposal will be utterly scouted.",49
416,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Robertson) [5.29] - Thos e who address political meetings are given a great deal of latitude, the law protecting them, to a great extent, in what they say. Much latitude is also given to those who attend such meetings. The Committee has resolved that persons who disturb public meetings shall be liable to a fine of £ 5 . We cannot go back on that decision, but it would be monstrous to make the alternative imprisonment for a month.",49
417,Mr FULLER,Unknown,That is the maximum.,49

419,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Gwydir) [5.30] - As one experienced in addressing public meetings of all kinds, I should support the amendment if I were influenced by the manner in which I think it will operate. In my judgement, no provision could do more to assist the Labour party than that now under discussion, not because it would protect them in the way intended by the mover, but because of the effect which must follow its application. If the amendment were put into force at an anti-Labour election meeting under ordinary circumstances, and one or two electors were sent to gaol, that, more than anything, would lead to the return of the Labour candidate.",49
420,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Then let the amendment pass.,49

I take it we are here to legislate in conformity with the principles of British justice, free speech, and fair discussion.

Never in my public career have I countenanced any action against an opponent that I should myself object to; and one of my first injunctions at an election is that there shall be free speech on both sides. I have never had any trouble at meetings, beyond, of course, an interjection now and again; and my experience is that a public man, who goes on the platform to speak the truth fearlessly, will not meet with anything like organized opposition. But in the amendment I see a danger that, probably, the Minister has overlooked, namely, the possibility of unscrupulous underground engineers, such as I have met with during my thirty years in political warfare, paying one or two men to upset a public meeting with the express purpose of bringing this law into operation, and thereby throwing discredit on sections of the community who are perfecly innocent. The common law which has hitherto governed these matters, is absolutely sufficient. I am proud.to think that there is no necessity here for such an Act as we are told was passed by the British Legislature some twelve months ago. We have to remember that we have womanhood suffrage here, and that, therefore, we are in no danger of the methods, which I do not altogether agree with, resorted to by the suffragettes at Home. It appears to me that the action of these women, wiongly directed, is at the bottom of the British legislation referred to, and that there is some justification for it.",49
422,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,I have been told by one of the New South Wales members that he has had blue metal thrown at him.,50
423,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"That must have been at Booroowa, in New South Wales, where, years ago, just before the annual race meeting, certain people could be found gathering up little heaps of blue metal at the side of the racecourse for the use of those who "" dropped "" their money,",50
424,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,I am told that occurred in Marrickville.,50
425,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I have never known it j and I have addressed many public meetings there, and have fought the hardest of fights against organized opposition, though not of the violent type. 1 never knew a place with which I have had so little fault to find on that score",50
426,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,The honourable member for Lang informed me.,50
427,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I am sure that if such a provision as this had been in operation years ago, when the honourable member for Lang was a red-hot Socialist, he would have paid the penalty. Of course, that honourable member is now one of the oppressors, and not one of the oppressed, and is quite prepared to pass a law of this kind. However, as I sav, the common I anv, in my opinion, is sufficient to meet the position; and I am surprised that the honourable member for Darwin should submit this amendment, even in its watered down form. I always thought that the honourable member was a man of courage, who, in the face of all odds, would fight the battle of right; but this amendment almost indicates the white feather. It would seem as though the honourable member were afraid of the people; and when that is so, it is time a man left public life. I regret that the Minister has decided to accept the amendment; but I warn him that, if it be carried, it will return like a. boomerang against its supporters within the next twelve months.",50
428,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [5.39] - If the honourable member for Gwydir, as he says, believes in fair play, and in every one being heard, he ought to have no objection to the amendment, because only those who create a disturbance will be liable to prosecution. We who .believe in liberty of speech ought to adopt some such measure as that proposed. Personally, I have never had trouble, and do not anticipate any in the future; but, about three years ago, a meeting of Senate candidates in Launceston was disturbed during a .whole evening. For this the Labour party were blamed, by the press and others; but, as a matter of fact, it was not members of the Labour party, but a number of larrikins who were responsible. Whether larrikins belong to one side or the other, or are not electors at all, they should be punished for such conduct. Objection has been raised to the maximum penalty; but we know that the maximum provided is it seldom inflicted. Reflections have been cast on justices of the peace; but I can say that, in Tasmania, there are a large number who devote a great deal of time to their duiKes, without ;any remuneration, and with very little thanks. I believe that they always do justice; and I have never heard them accused of acting unfairly, either to the working man or the master. ",50
429,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Perhaps we ought to have halos, if we took ourselves at our own estimate. It is necessary, in the public interest, to maintain order at public meetings; and I further suggest that it would not be amiss if we maintained a little better order amongst ourselves in this House. It is scarcely creditable to hear one section of the House calling another "" garrotters,"" and raising accusations of political corruption; and, perhaps, it would be well to have a penalty for the use of such language. Surely we can have differences of opinion without branding each other with such names, which would not be tolerated in the streets or anywhere outside Parliament. I hope that the amendment will be carried, ancl thus insure that liberty of speech which is the boast of all Britishers.",50
430,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Cook) [5.44] This clause ought to be branded as denoting the decadence of Australian politicians. Apparently there are honourable members who desire to go to their constituencies in glass cases, and fight their battles with kid gloves on. That is a - ridicuious position to take up. I do not - challenge the motives of the honourable - member for Darwin. He is certainly acting within his rights, and no doubt - believes that he is justified, but I think he is wrong. The proposal is a slur on the public of Australia, and is quite consistent with the coercive measures adopted by this Government. They desire, not - only to stifle the people's representatives inside this House, in order to prevent - criticism of themselves and their actions, but also to stifle the criticism of themselves by the public outside. It is undiluted Conservatism, and seems to indicate that honourable gentlemen on the Ministerial side, who have thrown their pledges to the public overboard, are afraid to meet the public face to face without putting - some shackles upon them to silence ordinary criticism. Whilst only certain offences mav be punishable under this clause, it will be used by the Conservatives of Australia to intimidate public meetings into the belief that ordinary interjections and legitimate criticism of public men are punishable by fine and imprisonment. Under some magistrates those who interject will actually be liable to such punishment. When politics are getting hot, and there is strong feeling, is not the time when there is calmness of mind among candidates arid their supporters', and it would be easy in such circumstances to magnify an unpremeditated interruption into some kind of organized opposition. If , in the heat of an election, a candidate charged certain persons with interrupting his meeting, just fancy what kind of evidence would be obtained from his supporters, especially if there was a chance of convicting some one who had made himself politically obnoxious to them. I have been in an electorate where it has been almost impossible, when an election has been proceeding, to get justice, and where the paid bullies of wealthy Conservatives would come up to you and spit in your face, and if you took any action against them the whole of the resources of the district would be pitted against you. That is just what we shall have again. The honourable member for 'Calare knows the district that I am talking about.",50
431,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Did the honourable member ever know that to occur? Mr T. H . CATTS - I know it as a positive fact. Honourable members posite talk about the obstruction and interruption which they have experienced at public meetings, but I have had as much of it of all kinds as any man in the House. Are we going to be like a lot of grammar school girls, or namby-pamby individuals, afraid to meet men in open public meetings, and discuss politics with them? It seems to me to be proposed to reduce political discussion to an absolute farce. The proposal is a restriction of public discussion, and nothing has been put forward to justify it. Fancy a candidate addressing an audience consisting of 1,000 people like the honourable member for Wakefield, with his extreme excitability ! He stood up this afternoon, and in a few moments worked himself into a state of excitement which showed that if 1,000 men of his type were at a public meeting they would be altogether uncontrollable, and under this clause .would render themselves liable to fine and imprisonment. As much offence can be created by a person speaking against the audience as by the audience against the speaker. Very often that is the way in which trouble begins. A man has an obnoxious method of addressing a meeting, or a vindictive personal way of replying to innocent criticism and interjection, and so brings down upon himself the wrath of the audience, causing them, perhaps, to break out in disturbance. There are some public men, or those who have attempted to become public men, who by their insulting methods would sting almost any audience into open revolt. Yet under this clause the law would step in and protect the candidates, while punishing the innocent persons whom he had provoked. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh says, the present Minister of Defence can scarcely rise in this House without exciting the strongest feeling of resentment in the breasts of his opponents, and one could easily understand a. gentleman of his type rousing an audience at a public meeting into the greatest hostility.",51
432,Mr FULLER,Unknown,There would not be a conviction in those circumstances.,51
433,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Oh , no, but who is going to fight it? Shall we not have some poor wretch in the street dragged up before the magistrates, and the affluence of the Conservative party in Australia pitted against him?",51
434,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Honourable memopbers opposite are the wealthy ones.,51
435,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"There is nol as much wealth in the whole Labour movement in Australia as is centred in the right honourable member. He could spend more money on a political contest than the whole of the political Labour organizations of Australia could afford to spend, and come up smiling afterwards. We are degrading ourselves as public men' by admitting for a moment that it is necessary for us to protect ourselves from the public of Australia in meeting assembled. Quite sufficient protection is offered under the present law. If all those diabolical atrocities are perpetrated which we have heard complained about today by honourable members opposite, surely the common law and the police of the States will protect them? But we know that it is not so. In no State in the Commonwealth is rioting allowed in the public streets, and there is no public meeting held anywhere at which the police are not present to see that order is maintained. If this clause were to apply only to halls hired by public men, the same objection could not be taken to it, because a man can do what he likes with a hall when he hires it. But it should not be applied to all sorts of public meetings. A politician might stand up in a busy thoroughfare and begin to abuse an innocent and unoffending crowd. Then, because they turned round and retaliated on the man who intruded upon their peace and harmony, the law would step in and brand them as criminals, f t would be very convenient to many candidates to have a person who has some influence with his fellow men in a district put into gaol for a month, or until the election was over.",51
436,Mr FULLER,Unknown,How would the honourable member do it?,52
437,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"If he went to a public meeting and made some kind of interjection, the candidate might proceed against him. I have seen numbers of Conservative candidates who would magnify interjections into organized interruption. It is easy, in the heat of a political contest, for people to have exaggerated ideas, and on evidence of that kind a man might be convicted of a criminal offence. If this is a good proposal, why not offer the same protection to public meetings all the year round? The clause is only to apply after the issue of the writs, when the excitement begins, and when people are more likely to fall into unpremeditated interruptions than deliberately and coolly to organize opposition. Now that honourable members opposite have secured a provision in the law to include halls in their election expenses, why. cannot they hire halls and have admission, by ticket, so that they may have audiences only of their own particular friends? The proposal not only shows a decadence in the politicians of Australia, but it is also most objectionable legislation, which will be exercised at a time when there may be exaggerated ideas of what really are offences. The honourable member for Darwin spoke the other day of the decadence of the British race, but he has now gone to the other extreme. He wants to have the kid gloves on, and to talk to an audience from behind barricades. This is simply a barricade put up between the candidate and the public. We are asked to let the candidate talk with his head over the fence, and a wall all round him to protect him. Honourable members opposite say, "" Save usfrom the public."" It is not only branding the public of Australia in a way in which they should not be branded, but it is an admission of incompetence on the. nart of public men to conduct public meetings, and of a lack of self-reliance on their own abilities to face their fellow men. It is a Conservative, reactionary, proposal, such as we might expect from the party now in power, and is perfectly consistent vvith the coercive methods which the Government have adopted in passing legislation without allowing a reasonable discussion of it. I am sorry to think that if such a clause is carried it will be on the initiation of the honourable member for D a r w u iI have an idea that this proposed new clause must have been suggested to the honourable member by some one on the Government side of the House; that in an unsuspecting moment he succumbed to the blandishments of the other side and became its author. It will be very convenient for the Government who wish to pass such legislation to be able to say, "" It was proposed by a member of the Labour party, and we accepted it . ""  Lang has already made that statement.",52
438,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I am not surprised that he has done so. The Government and those behind them desire legislation to protect them from the criticism of their opponents in Parliament, and another class of legislation to save them from the criticism of the public when they go before the electors. This provision is so reactionary, and such an exhibition of bad taste, that by approving of it we should stamp ourselves in the eyes of the public - as being absolutely incompetent to take the public platform, or to justify the faith within us without stirring the public to disorder and riot.",52
439,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Illawarra-Minister "" of Home Affairs) [6.2] - The proposed new clause has been discussed at great length, and for some time nothing new has been said in regard to it. It has been described as ""an extension of the gag,"" as ""creating a new crime,"" as ""devising a new means of getting into Parliament,"" as'"" a sign of the decadence of Australian politicians,"" and in various other terms. I hope that the Committee will shortly go to a division on the question, and for very special reasons. This Bill wa's introduced as an absolutely non-party measure. It is a purely machinery Bill to insure the proper conduct of elections.",53
440,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Why did honourable member stand by it as a purely machinery Bill-?,53
441,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I have done so, as far as possible.",53
442,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,The honourable member is accepting this proposed new clause.,53
443,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Variou s proposals are put forward, and they have to be dealt with. I appeal to the Committee to deal with this question promptly, because it is necessary in the interests of the proper conduct of the next election that the Bill should be passed at the earliest possible moment. Returning officers from all parts of Australia have to be called together in the several States by the Chief Electoral officer and instructed in the rules and procedure that will have to be drawn up under this Bill as an amendment of the principal Act. Those officers on returning to their various divisions, will have to call together their assistant returning officers and instruct them. All that work cannot be done in a week or a month.",53
444,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I point out to the Minister that he is departing from the question immediately betore the Chair, and that if I permit him to open up a new subject, I shall have to allow other honourable members to folloiv him on the same lines.",53
445,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Quite so. merely making an appeal to honourable members to assist me in carrying this Bill into law as soon as possible. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [6.6] - I am quite willing to accept the suggestion that the punishment for which this proposed new clause provides shall be [226] reduced from one month to one week. I desire to explain that I was led to submit this proposition because of my own experiences. What should be done with a man who, at a meeting attended by 300 or 400 men, women and children, raises the cry of "" fire""? Again, what would honourable members do with men who create a panic in a public meeting by ringing a fire bell ? In ""one case, a fire bell was rung by eight or ten hoodlums, not voters, for the purpose of disturbing a political meeting.",53
446,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"B y Labour men? Mr KING O'MALLEY - They belonged not to the Labour party, but to our opponents. The maintenance of free speech is the hope of the Labour party, because our opponents have the great daily newspapers with them, whereas we have not. Large property-owners do not as a rule attend public meetings; they are convinced not the that their mission is to go forth to vote for their property. Consequently the Labour party will be the chief gainers'from the passing of a provision to secure good order at political meetings, where the other side can be converted. We desire to induce our opponents to attend our meetings, and to be able to send them home converts to the cause of Labour. We cannot do that if they fear that they will be broken up by gangs pf hoodlums when attending our meetings. The honourable member for Bass has referred to a great meeting in a town in Tasmania which was broken up by a gang of larrikins, with the result that we could not preach the gospel of labour to the people, although we had paid for the hall and had a magnificent attendance. I desire that this proposed new clause shall be passed for the protection of the people themselves. I do not think that there is any decadence on the part of politicians. A politician is never so great as when he is a fighting man. John Bull wants a fight and an umpire. I desire to have the law as the umpire in my case, for I know that I shall then have a fair fight.",53
447,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [6.9]. - - I desire to express my disapproval of this proposed new clause. As to the statements made by the honourable member for I was Darwin, I would remind him that the law now provides for the punishment of those who create a disturbance at a pubhc meeting. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I could not obtain a conviction under it in Tasmania.",53
448,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"If the law already deals with those who disturb public meetings, then there must be some object in view in proposing to go further. I have seen persons ejected from political meetings for no sufficient cause.

453,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"I said not that I had attended such meetings, but that they had taken place.",54
454,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I have never heard of such meetings. Mr RtcnARD FOSTER - The honourable member's own partu can tell him of them.,54
455,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I deny the statement. I have attended many meetings held by the Labour party, and have allowed a political opponent to use a hall in which I was speaking. The man to whom I refer was unable to secure an audience of his own, and I allowed him to address mine. There was no disturbance of any kind. I have spoken from the same platform with some of my political opponents, notably Mr. J. Langdon Parsons, and Mr Samuel Tbmpkinson, and at such meetings there has been no disturbance whatever. also attended political meetings held by the opponents of our partu, and have seen no disturbance there.

460,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,This is a machinery provision.,54
461,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"It has nothing to do with the working of the principal Act, but I am not surprised at the Treasurer supporting it . The Government and their supporters have seized upon this proposition because it has been submitted by a member of the Labour party, and they think that they will score on it . I shall tell my electors, however, that we have in power a Government which is prepared to apply to them ' worse laws than prevail in Russia. I am glad that no member of the Opposition, besides the honourable member for Darwin, is supporting the proposal. Perhaps the Government thought we would all support it. No doubt they would be glad to introduce the German system, so that a policeman could be placed at the door of every public meeting, with power to say at any time, "" This meeting must now end."" They would not allow any elector to open his mouth. At any rate, that is the view I take of the position, and I shall ask my constituents to take the same view of it . The proposal is outrageous. I shall support an amendment which the honourable member for Boothby subsequently intends to move, so that if persons are sent to gaol they shall be detained at some place more than 7 miles from the polling booth for which they are enrolled, and may thus take I have advantage of the postal voting provision.

There was a rail down the centre of the hall, on the left-hand side of which the women voted, and on the right-hand side the men.

This kind of tinkering with a matter of such importance does help to provide the necessary facilities women to register their votes. would be taken of the fact that the women were put into one part of the polling booth and the men into another. Such an arrangement would cast a reflection on one moveparty or the other, because, after all, no two persons can be in the polling compartfar ment at the same time, so that privacy is already entirely secured.

I would remind the Committee that when the Bill of 1905 was under consideration it was proposed that the approaches to polling booths, for a distance of 50 yards, should be kept clear, but that proposition was rejected.

This is a ridiculous and unnecessary proposal. As a matter of fact the Act provides that the entrances to polling booths shall be kept free from obstruction, and we know that the authorities carry out the law in that regard. To propose that the Commonwealth authorities shall practically follow a crowd in a street, in the vicinity of a polling booth, or at the approaches thereto-what ever those indefinable terms may.mean-is to propose to carry the law to a farcical extent.

At the last general election some of those in charge acted as if the Commonwealth Act proeverything vided that the approach to a polling booth for a distance of 50 yards from the entrance should be kept clear. In some cases those who had rolls on tables outside the polling places to enable the electors to ascertain their numbers on rolls were compelled to remove beyond that limit. Tn some instances they were kept on the far side of the street. In Dubbo the authorities acted as if such a limit were actually prescribed. The entrance door of the polling booth there is some distance from-the footpath, but it was that the front gate constituted the entrance, and for a distance of 50 yards therefrom the approaches were kept clear. I certainly support the view that the trances to polling booths ought not to be obstructed; but I am glad that the MinisThe ter has refused to accept this ridiculous proposal that not only the approaches but the vicinity should be kept clear. In large country electorates it might be said that a road some miles long leading to a polling booth was an approach, and that it must be kept clear of canvassers and others. I suggest that the desire of the honourable .be member might be met by the Minister issuing instructions to the deputy returnto ing officers as to what is actually meant by the direction that the entrance to a polling from booth shall be kept clear. Where a polling place abuts on a footpath it would be difficult to keep the entrance clear, uniform instructions should be issued. There was plenty of room for every one at Dubbo, and the regulation, or instruction, of issued, worked very well, although there was an attempt now and then, on the part of a canvasser, to accompany to the door of the polling booth an elector who was thought to be in some doubt as to how he should vote. Where there is plenty of adroom about a polling place the idea that the approaches should be kept clear for a distance of 50 yards is not a bad one. a If a clear space is maintained round the doors of a polling booth, candidates and those acting for them are able to keep an on any one who is suspected of a desire to do wrong. On one occasion we actually had to turn out of a town hall used as a polling booth a man who insisted upon standing at the foot of the staircase, and I who claimed his right to stay there Such be instances cause annoyance and suspicion. No doubt at election time all parties put up the best fight that they can, and do possible to obtain votes. The difficulty of keeping the approaches to polling booths clear can, I think, be met by instructing the presiding officers that that is to be done. On one occasion the tables I speak of were on a verandah, and the no complaints were made. But at the last election they were outside the gate of the enclosure surrounding the courthouse, perhaps a better arrangement, because it enabled those who were seated at them to keep a keener eye on what was going on. It would be a mistake to in -' held sist upon any definite area being kept clear, because what might be a reasonable area in one place would be unreasonable in another.

514,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Wakefield) [8-33]--What the honourable member for Darling has suggested is part of the law of South Australia, which prohibits persons from congregating on polling day within fifty yards of the approaches of a polling-booth. This provision has been applied to the conduct of Federal as well as to the conduct of State elections, and its advantages have been highly appreciated. Its enforcement does not necessitate any interruption of traffic. In the city persons may pass up and down in front of a polling booth in the ordinary course of business, but they are not allowed to congregate within 50 yards of it. The Department could, I think, give effect to this reform by regulation. I do not know what objection there can be to the adoption of a practice which has resulted in a distinct improvement in the conduct of elections. There has been no interference with the rights of municipal authorities.",59

It would be impossible to keep a clear space within fifty yards of these polling booths. As the honourable member for Darling has pointed out, what may suit a small town where the polling booth is in a courthouse, situated within an enclosure, would not suit a large city. The Athenaeum, in Collins-street, is a polling booth. Persons could not be prevented from congregating within fifty yards of it, because there are places of business quite near to it.",60

One returning officer may feel it incumbent on him to keep clear approaches to his polling booth for a distance of 5 yards, another for a distance of 50 yards, and a third, perhaps, for a distance of 500 yards. If the distance of 50 yards were fixed, and a chalk mark run across the pavement, we should find the crowd congregating there, and the block would be as inconvenient as if it occurred at the door. I have not heard any satisfactory reason for the provision. The honourable member for Lang says that certain ladies have been unable to get through a crowd. Evidently in that case the police were not doing their duty by keeping the street clear. My experience is that if ladies wish to vote they can get through a crowd as well as men can. At shows, auction sales, and other places of the kind, ladies are as well able to fight their way as men. To say that ladies have not been able to record their votes because of the crowd round a polling booth is a reflection on the men of Australia. I have not before heard of anything of the kind happening. The Committee ought now to decide the matter, and get on with o5.her business.",60

At the last election numbers of women could not record their votes, because the approaches to the polling booths were blocked up by numbers of men, who refused to let them through. I called the attention of a couple of constables to the position, and asked them if they could not keep a path clear, so that ladies and others might not be jostled and subjected to insult ; and they told me that they had no power to prevent the people congregating on the footpath, their instructions being I simply to keep the entrance to the booth clear. I do not agree with the Minister that this is a ridiculous proposal, and I am surprised that he should have used such an expression to one of his own supac- porters, or anybody else, who honestly puts forward a reasonable proposition for the public good.

Many years ago in New South Wales there was no deposit for State elections, but on one occasion a well-known politician and barrister mynominated for a constituency at a by-election. He claimed that he would have had not a walk-over but for the fact that a few people, mainly publicans, clubbed together and nominated a man in order that there might be a contest, and money spent. That was in the good old days when the on franchise was limited and money interests to were the important factor in determining an election. After that gentleman's return of he proposed and carried a Bill providing for a deposit of £50, and that measure was afterwards found a great stumblingblock in the way of the nomination, not of bogus candidate's, but of men who desired to represent the working classes, and who afterwards did represent them. The aboli-tion of the deposit was one of the big reforms put before the electors in the early nineties as the result of the movement which brought the Labour party actively into politics. It succeeded, and ever since then no deposit has been required in that State. Consequently, in the first Federal election, conducted under State management, a deposit was not necessary. I am not aware that any strong reasons have been discovered that would lead the New South Wales Parliament to go back to the obnoxious monetary qualification as a condition of nomination. There have been instances of men nominating who polled only a small number of votes, but that is no justification for imposing this penalty. It does not always follow, because a man polls a small number of votes, that he is incompetent or even unacceptable. In New South Wales one candidate for a city constituency received a very small vote, and if a deposit had been required he would have forfeited it, but he was then a young and untried man, and that was his first experience. He stood again at the next election, was returned after a hot contest, and has remained the very popular representative of the constituency for a number of years. His rejection in the first case was the outcome of the peculiar conditions that obtained at the time, and did not at all prove that he was undesirable or incompetent. I opposed the monetary qualification when originally introduced in the New South .Wales Parliament, and have opposed it ever since. I oppose it now in regard to the Commonwealth Parliament. Nothing is gained by it. It is an embargo that operates harshly in the case of poor, but deserving, men. The question of whether such an embargo should be placed upon them may well be left to the electors. One of the reasons urged for its existence is that in its absence contests which would not otherwise take place occur, and that both the Government and the retiring member are put to unnecessary expense. That may have happened in the past, but there is no likelihood of its recurrence. At every election a well-defined issue is put before the electors, and wherever there is a division of opinion there is sure to be a contest. The embargo is undemocratic, Mr Thomas Brown. inasmuch as it does not recognise the principle of adult suffrage. It attaches to that principle a qualification sufficient to make it difficult for a very poor man to nominate. It is for that reason, and because I believe a deposit to be undemocratic, and that it would be a blot on the Commonwealth electoral law, that 1 support the proposed new clause.",63
549,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Robertson) [9.18] - This is a somewhat academic discussion, but I do not think that time will be wasted by devoting a few minutes to the consideration of the question. The principle of one man one vote and of one vote one value will not be complete until all men have an opportunity to offer themselves as candidates for the Federal Parliament. I shall not, however, vote in favour of the abolition of the provision that a candidate shall lodge a deposit of £ 2 5 , because I know that bogus candidates are sometimes put up for no other purpose than to cause a contested election. In many cases the Government are thus put to unnecessary expense. I can see coming, however, a time when we shall have proportional voting, and with such a system in force there could be no longer any reason for requiring a candidate to lodge a deposit of £ 2 $ . I agree with the Minister, that at present the embargo ought not to be removed. If it were, a man having no chance of election might be nominated, and his nomination might lead to the return of a candidate representing only a minority of the elec- tors. Cases have occurred in which bogus candidates have secured more votes than it was thought they would obtain. The honourable member for Calare has referred to the nomination of a gentleman who proved that he had more in him than was imagined. That is by no means an uncommon experience. It is not uncommon for a man to prove after his nomination that he has a good platform style and other qualifications. The instincts of a public man mav be so strongly imbued in him that he will be accepted by the electors, and may ultimately climb to the top of the tree. Such cases have occurred in Europe and in the Australian States. This discussion will show that we have not lost sight of the fact that every man should have eciual' rights and opportunities. There are times: when even a member of Parliament mav find it difficult to put up a deposit of £25. .The life of a public man is very expensive, and unless he has independent means is a great drain upon his resources ",64
550,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,Does not the honourable member think that the alternative suggested is a good one?,65
551,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"I believe that I could induce 200 men to sign a nomination paper for no other reason than that they were asked to do so. There are many men who would be prepared to sign any nomination paper in order to get rid of their interviewer. I believe that all men should have equal' opportunities, but until we have proportional voting I do not think that this embargo ought to be removed.",65
552,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [9.22I- I shall vote to abolish the money test. Some of my friends have had a bitter experience of losing their deposits in circumstances absolutely unjust. The requiremert that a candidate for election to this Parliament shall put up a deposit of £ 2 5 is a remnant of the absurd and barbarous system of conducting elections that is in existence in England today. There a man cannot vote because he is a human being. He obtains the right to vote only by the direct or indirect ownership of property. Even now, a candidate there must be prepared to put down a large money deposit. In C/titty's Statutes, vol. 8, page 246, there is a statement showing that this system is a lineal descendant of the absurd and antiquated - system of conducting elections in the Old Country. The statement is as follows(1) In a borough the expenses mentioned above in parts i . , i i . , and than personal expenses (g) and sums paid to the returning officer for his charges (A) shall not exceed in the whole the maximum amount in the scale following :If the number of electors ou the registei does not exceed 2,000, the maximum amount shall be ^350. Exceeds 2,000, ^380, and an additional ^30 for every complete 1,000 electors above 2,000. Provided that in Ireland if the number of electors on the register does not exceed 500 the maximum amount shall be ^200. Exceeds 500, but does not exceed 1,000, £ S°2 Exceeds 1,000, but does not exceed 1,500, £ 7S2 (2) In a county the expenses mentioned above in parts i . , i i . , and i i i. of this schedule, other than personal expenses and sums paid to the returning officer for his charges, shall not exceed in the whole the maximum amount in the scale following :If the number of electors on the register does not exceed 2,000, the maximum amount shall be £650 in England and Scotland, and .£500 in Ireland. Exceeds 2,000, ^710 in England and Scotland, and £340 in Ireland; and an additional j£6o in England and Scotland, and £40 in Ireland, for every complete 1,000 electors above 2,000. A poor man might have the combined ability of a Disraeli and a Gladstone, yet he could not hope to contest an election in Great Britain in such circumstances. In Victoria a candidate for the Victorian Legislative Assembly has to provide a deposit of £ 5 0 , while a« candidate for the Federal Parliament has to lodge a deposit of £ 2 5 . The alternative suggestion that where a candidate for the House of Representatives is able to get his nomination paper signed by 200 electors, and that where a candidate for a Senate has his nomination paper signed'by 1,000 electors, no deposit shall be necessary, is a good one. Such a provision would be an improvement Upon that requiring a money deposit to be lodged. We ought to permit a citizen of Australia, privileged by right of his manhood to vote, to say to his fellow citizens, "" These are my views. If you believe in them, then I ask you to return me to Parliament to fight for legislation to give effect to .them."" I was assured by a member of the House of Commons that although he was privileged to be elected without a contest he had to pay an English officer £ 2 5 to declare that he was duly elected.. The late James Munro told me that when in England he was given an opportunity to contest an election for a seat in the House of Commons,, with the support of the great Liberal party, i i i . , of this schedule, other but that he found that the expenses would run into four figures. What we need to eliminate from our Australian Democracy is the power of property to control and manipulate our electoral system. The adoption of the suggestion made by the honourable member who has moved this proposed new clause would be preferable to the existing system. The only objection to it that needs to be combated is the contention that it might not suit some business people to attach their signatures to a nomination paper. The requirement that a nomination paper shall be signed by at least 200 electors would not be so harsh in connection with our large Commonwealth constituencies as it would be in the case of a State constituency, containing only a few hundred voters. I think the Treasurer wns once returned to the State Parliament of Western Australia by something like eightyfive votes, f f the Minister cannot *ee his way to accept either the proposed new clause or an alternative suggestion, I hope that during the recess the wisdom of such a provision will appeal to him, and that he will endeavour later on to give effect to it. No candidate for the Parliament of any one of the twenty-two cantons of the Swiss Confederation, or for the Federal Parliament of that country, which the economic writers of the world call "" the school-house of Europe,"" is required to pay a deposit. However, if the Minister has made up his mind, no argument of mine, or of any other honourable member,-will change his attitude. But though we fail to-night, we shall try again.  glad that the Minister refuses to adopt this amendment. It is sought to make it appear that by the existing Act a serious disability is put upon certain individuals, who, but for the statutory requirement that a candidate for election to this House shall lodge a deposit of £ 2 5 , would offer themselves for election.",65
553,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,Unquestionabl y there is.  from the honourable member.,66
554,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,I have experienced such a disability in times gone 'by.  nexion with a Federal election every man is a bogus candidate who has not behind him a considerable section of the community. Any man having behind him a considerable section of the community would not experience the least difficulty in inducing that section to back him - to the extent of £ 52,66
555,Mr HALL,Unknown,"That means cadging £25.  tunate expression. If a man, however poor he may be, shows ability and qualifications for representing his fellow citizens in Parliament, he will have a considerable following in this country. To say that those who admire such a man will not be prepared to put down the sum of £ 2 5 to enable him to be nominated is ridiculous. It is unfortunate that members should pose before the public over a matter of this sort. To require a deposit is not to place anv candidate under a disability, but it will keep out of the field men who have no prospect of being returned.",66
556,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [9.31] - I am surprised to hear the honourable member for Echuca say that the £ 2 5 deposit prevents persons who have no chance from being nominated, because there are numerous cases in which deposits have been forfeited. In some of these cases the loss of the money is nothing to those concerned. Many persons are willing to risk £ 2 5 on the chance of getting into Parliament, or do so because they are misled or mis-read the public. Such persons are hardly fitted for political life. At the same time there are candidates who enter for an election not expecting to be returned. Candidates on the Labour side sometimes do that with a view to the future. A deposit of £ 5 0 would not prevent the nomination of persons who had no chance at all. Our object should be to give the electors the widest choice, and to prevent any bar being raised against the return of a capable man. Most of those in public life are there at some sacrifice of personal interest. Very few men in Australia can afford to leave their businesses to be managed by others, and, no matter what his avocation, a man is made poorer by the devotion of his time to public affairs. Those who are willing to make this sacrifice .of interest are, however, better qualified for public life than those who would not do so. Why should they be required to ask their friends to subscribe money to permit of their nomination? It seems tb me that the honourable member for Werriwa has put forward a good alternative, in suggesting that, instead of depositing £ 2 5 , a candidate may be required to obtain a certain number of signatures in support of his candidature. In the old days, when the expenditure on elections was greater, it sometimes suited certain persons to. subscribe £ 2 5 to put up a candidate to prevent a walkover, but that is not often done now. Labour candidates, however, are poor men, and find it difficult to obtain £ 2 5 to pay their deposits, in addition to getting money to defray the cost - of their candidature. The honourable member for Echuca would make it harder for them. In some of the States no deposit is required.",66
557,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,That is the case in New South Wales.,66
558,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Personally , I do not think , that anything is gained by requiring a deposit. In these days of party organization, there is not much chance for other than selected candidates. Not much harm would be done by abolishing the deposit provision. But,) as an alternative, we 1 might adopt the proposal of the honourable member for Werriwa. It is not easy for poor men to find friends who can subscribe £ 2 5 to pay their deposits, and, of course, such helpers generally expect to have the money refunded to them. Why put this obstacle in the way of a man who has brains, but not means? It should be open to every one to stand for Parliament, so that the electors may have a wider choice.

560,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,What about the expense?,67
561,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,The expense will be only nominal. I understand that at present the cost is about .£100 for each re-division.,67
562,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The Commissioner in Western Australia was paid ,£75.",67
563,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"It is very seldom the Commissioner has to act; and, if PAIRS. the present cost be £10 0 for each redivision, the amendment will mean only .£200 more. The question of cost, however, is one on which the Minister will be able to give us accurate information. It is, of course, an important question ; and if the cost should prove to be very great, I should not be in favour of a change. I should really like to see the whole principle changed, and a really representative extra-parliamentary Commissioner appointed. But this is no time to introduce a large question of principle, and, therefore, I confine myself to the proposed change in the machinery. We all know that two heads, and, certainly, three, are better than one. Recently we had before us a case in which the findings of a Commissioner gave anything but satisfaction; and I feel sure that, especially in the large States, one man cannot be expected to master all the numerous details. If the Commissioners were the Surveyor General, the head Electoral Officer, and (2.) The Commissioners shall a Police Magistrate, I think we should have, at a very slightly increased cost, recommendations which would give satisfaction on all sides of the House. Of course, we cannot expect everybody to be satisfied; but the report of three Commissioners would, doubtless, carry gieat weight. Honourable members yesterday referred to the re-adjustment of electoral boundaries as a matter of great concern, affecting the Constitution and the rights of electors; and I appeal to the Minister to favourably consider the proposed new clause - I oppose",67
564,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Illawarra-Minister ' of Home Affairs) [9.55] - This is purely a machinery amendment, which properly comes within the scope of the Bill ; and may say that, personally, I have always been in favour of three Commissioners. The honourable member for Fawkner is ""anxious to be given some idea of the extra expense that would be involved in the change; and I am able to inform him that the payments in the past have been £100 in the case of New South Wales; £100, Queensland; £100, Victoria; £ 5 0 , Tasmania; and ^75 each for Western Australia and South Australia; so that if there were three Commissioners for each re-distribution the cost would be a little under or above £1,000. The question is whether three Commissioners are likely to give mote satisfaction to the Parliament and the public; and I unhesitatingly express myself in favour of the stronger tribunal. I have already intimated to the honourable member for Fawkner that I am prepared to accept his amendment if after the word "" Commissioners,"" where it first occurs, there 'be inserted the words "" one of whom shall be the Surveyor-General, or an officer holding a similar position in a State."" It appears to me that one necessary qualification for a Commissioner is that he shall be acquainted with the physical formation of the State; and we could not have a better man from that point of view than the Surveyor-General, or an equivalent official.",68
565,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Suppos e a State will not allow the Surveyor-General to act, or the Surveyor-General himself will not act?",68
566,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"We have not found any difficulty in regard to such services in the past. The suggestion I have made may be more properly worded; but I put it forward as an alternative, so that in the event of the Surveyor-General not being able to act, an officer occupying a similar position in the same State, or in another State where there is not a Surveyor-General, may be one of the Commissioners. It is very desirable that these re-distributions shall be carried out in such a .way as to earn the confidence of Parliament and the public; and, in view of the small extra cost involved, I am prepared to accept the proposed new clause with the amendment I have suggested.",68
567,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,I am quite prepared to accept the suggested amendment.,68
568,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [9.59]. the amendment, because I have always objected to Boards, and because the duties of the Commissioner are clearly set down in the Act. He has to consider I community or diversity, of interest, means of communication, physical features, and existing boundaries and divisions; and that is quite sufficient to enable a single Commissioner to discover what is required. My experience is that where the reports of Boards of three or more are not satisfactory, we are unable to sheet home the blame. But if one Commissioner whose duties are clearly defined departs from them, it is a simple matter to get another Commissioner who will do the work properly. I object to the multiplication of positions. Every Bill brought before the House now seems to aim at the creation of fresh positions. The taxpayers* are suffering enough at present, and"" are getting about tired of it. The Minister has not shown in what way we are likely to get a better report from three Commissioners than from one. I do net believe that three could have done the work recently before us a whit better than it was done by the Western Australian Commissioner, to whose report the Minister stated no valid objection. A mere general statement that there will be more confidence in the work of three is of no value. It would give me no more confidence. I shall oppose the amendment.",68
569,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Calare) [10.2]. - Stron g reasons ought to be advanced before the Committee are asked to make the radical change proposed. The first division in. the State of New South Wales was made by three Commissioners. Under the Federal Act there has been one Commissioner, and it is only fair to assume that - that principle was adopted as the result of State experience. I see no advantage in having three, and the Minister's arguments are not convincing. The fact that the report of a certain Commissioner was rejected the other day has no bearing on the question.",68
570,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"Hi s report has been rejected twice out of three times. Mr THOMAS BROWN"" - The recommendation of three Commissioners would have been rejected in similar circumstances. The only way to get over that difficulty is to take the matter entirely but of the hands of Parliament.",68
571,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,Is the honourable member prepared to do that? I am in favour of it.,69
572,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"I am prepared to consider it, but this proposal would not bring it about. It will simply substitute three Commissioners for one, still leaving the final decision to Parliament. Under the present arrangement, one Commissioner fits the bill, and Parliament is the final judge. This proposal will simply add cost to the Department, without adding efficiency to it, and for that reason I shall oppose it.",69
573,Mr WISE,Unknown,"Gippsland) [10.7] - I cannot see why it should be proposed to substitute three Commissioners for one. In Victoria we started with three Public Service Commissioners, and got down to one. At one time we had three Railway Commissioners, and afterwards had one, although we have since reverted to three. We have also only one Public Service Commissioner for the Commonwealth. It is proposed that two shall form a quorum, and that the Chairman shall give a casting vote in the event of a tie, so that in the end the work of the three may devolve upon and be carried out by one. I agree with the honourable member for Calare that the mere fact of a scheme being drawn up by three Commissioners instead of one would not prevent it being discarded by a majority of the House if they thought fit. If a scheme distasteful to a strong majority in the House were drawn up by any number of Commissioners, it would be rejected. The proposal means an unnecessary increase of expense, and will bring about no better results. Even if three Commissioners are appointed, the work of drafting the report will probably be left to one, and whether it was checked to any extent would depend entirely upon the amount of trouble which the other two devoted to it. The proposal will not give any greater finality to the report, or secure its acceptance by the House more readily, than in the case of one Commissioner, while it will treble the expense.",69
574,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Robertson) [TO. 10] - I take it that the amendment has been approved by the Minister, and that he has looked into the matter, and recommends that three Commissioners shall be appointed. In that case I shall support it.",69

577,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,It will cost one thousand pounds.,69
578,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I 'do not particularly quarrel with the expenditure of £1,000 by this great, rich Commonwealth, but we are justified in seeing whether we are to get value for it, or whether it is necessary. Where one Commissioner is appointed, the best man with the greatest knowledge is selected, and he obtains the opinions and views of all and sundry before he finally decides. Three Commissioners would get no more information. If there is a division of opinion among the three, one man settles the question, and if there is no difference of opinion among them, it shows that any one of the three would have arrived at the same conclusion. If we had seven Commissioners, very much the same results would be obtained. I do not deny that, in a generay way, there may be more confidence in the report of three men, but when that feeling is analyzed, I do not think there is much ground for it. When the report comes before the House, the members for the particular State, who have a general knowledge of that State and its interests, use their judgment, and the House is largely guided by their advice. We have already provided for a month's criticism of the Commissioner's report by the whole of the public. There are many organizations whose business it is to watch . political affairs, and the Commissioner has the advantage of their suggestions. Just as honourable members have the advantage of the opinions of their constituents, and of organizations within their electorates as to suggested alterations of electoral boundaries, so the Commissioner is able to obtain such opinions when maps indicating the proposed alterations are exhibited. I do not think that I should agree to take out of the hands of Parliament the power to review redistribution schemes. Such a change is not contemplated, but the alteration actually proposed would not, in my opinion, give us such an improvement as would justify the increased expenditure that it would involve.",69
579,Mr WISE,Unknown,"Gippsland) [10.18] - 1 should like the Minister to explain what he means by the words ""an officer of his Department."" That is a fairly wide proposition, and if it could be limited in some way or other, I think it would be desirable to do so.",70

They refer, of course, to an officer of the Surveyor-General's Department.

Every political article appearing in a newspaper three months prior to a general election shall be signed by the writer thereof.' "" My object in submitting this proposition is to enable the public to ascertain the names of newspaper critics of candidates for election to the Federal Parliament. In Sydney there are published a morning newspaper having a daily circulation of over 100,000; another daily, with a circulation nearly as large, and two evening newspapers. In Melbourne we have the Age, with a daily circulation of over 110,000possibly the largest circulation of any daily newspaper in Australia-and the Argus, which has also a very large circulation. No one knows who writes the articles appearing in those newspapers. Many articles-article s which sting and are written unfairly-ar e published. They are written by men who are really engaged in sniping, and if their names were attached to every article they wrote, those whom they criticised would be able to face them and to fight them fairly. Members of Parl'ament and others seeking election are maligned most cruelly and terribly. Lies of the 23 vilest type are published in respect of them - lie s which the writer would not dare to utter in their presence. Such lving articles are read by thousands of people, and the AYES. persons attacked have no means of defence. Time after time a splendid series of articles is published in the daily press, and if it were the law that the names of the writers should be attached to them, many newsThomson, Dugald paper men would rise to a higher .position than they now occupy. There is no country in Europe where literary men are so well-paid as they are in France, and there, all newspaper articles are signed. Why should a newspaper have the power to injure a man by the publication of articles written by one individual? The use of the word "" we,"" which really only royalty has a right to apply to itself, has a wonderful effect. Were my proposal carried, honourable members would face their constituents knowing that those who criticised them in the press would have to sign their names to their articles.",70
584,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,What does it matter who writes such articles?,71
585,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"It may not matter much to the honourable member, but for twenty years I have been criticised-at times cruelly. Occasionally my actions have been strongly criticised with justification, but at other times I have been unfairly treated by the writers of unsigned articles. I wish to provide that every leading article published within three months of an election »shall be signed. If that were done, those who read them would know that they expressed merely the opinions of individuals, with whom, perhaps, they might be acquainted.",71
586,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,We know now the writers of many articles.,71
587,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"On one occasion I was maligned by a man who paraded as a personal friend, and did not suspect it until I heard it from his own lips. I told him that I would have cut off my hand rather than treat any one so. His articles appeared under a nom de plume, and he would not have dared to write them had he had to sign his own name to them. Time «nd again members have been maligned, as they would not have been had those who libelled them been required to sign their articles. The man who has the courage of his opinions should be prepared to sign what he writes. This practice is not unknown in other countries. A man who writes, perhaps, the most stinging articles, not hesitating to attack the highest - or the lowest, puts his name to what he writes. Those who are attacked ought to know who are attacking them. Would any honourable member consider that he acted honourably if he attacked another under a - nom de plume? I do not think one of us would do anything so contemptible. No doubt what I am saying will not influence votes. I have not yet known a Parliamentary speech to change a vote.",71

If a man were known to write in the leading columns of the daily press constantly, and the literary merits of his work were recognised, he would build himself up a reputation, and our newspapers would be multiplied as happens in France, where men of means support such writers. In this way many writers would have more power than they have now.",71
590,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,But such a writer could do more damage than he does now.,71
591,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"The honourable member is welcome to his little joke. I object to pens that can sting and stab while no one knows who wields them. The Argus once had high ideals, so far as Free Trade was concerned, and I wish the Age well because it was the creator of the Protective policy in Victoria. But primarily all newspapers are run to make profits, and their proprietors regard chiefly the advertisement columns. I shall press my proposal to a division, preferring to stand alone when I know that I am in the right, to being with the big battalions and in the wrong. My proposal would not injure any writer or any newspaper, but would protect those who seek the suffrages of their fellow citizens. Some of those who will vote against the proposal are now favoured by the press, but when the day comes when they will be m the shadow instead of in the sunshine, tl.ey will regret their action.",71
592,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Illawarra-Minister ot Home Affairs) [10.40] - I agree with much that has been said by the honourable member for Melbourne. No wrong would be done to newspaper writers if they were compelled to sign their articles. But we have nothing to do now with what appears in the press relating to the policy or character of candidates. Moreover, a proposal of this sort goes beyond the powers of this Committee. The Attorney-General confirms my view that the provision, if adopted, would be ultra vires.",71
593,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,Surely not if it applied only to political articles relating to Commonwealth elections.,71
594,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I am advised by the Attorney-General that legislation in regard to this matter is entirely within the power ot the States. That being so, I hope that the honourable member will withdraw his proposal. If he should not see fit to do so, I shall be compelled to oppose it.",71
595,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [10.42] I thank the Minister for the courtesy of his reply, and do not doubt his legal knowledge or that of the Attorney-General. It seeins to me, however, that if I amended im proposal to make it read ""every political article appertaining to a Common 1 wealth election,"" it would get over the difficulty. Should we carry such a provision, the States would follow our example in their legislation.",71
596,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,How would the honourable member meet the case of a dissolution where a general election followed within less than three months ?,72
597,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"If you cannot get a loaf, but can get a bun, you had better take the bun. Of course, it would be impossible to make the proposal retrospective. I believe my proposal to be a right and just one, and, if I press it to a division, I am sure that the Minister will not think I am insensible of his courtesy.",72
598,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas-Attorney-Gene ral) [10.45] - I do not like to be cocksure in expressing an opinion as to our powers; but I do not think that the suggested alteration by the honourable member will make any difference. The High Court, in the case of D'Emden v. Pedder, decided that, if there is a doubt as to the scope of our powers, there is always a presumption that our legislation is intended to be within those powers; that is, if it bears two constructions-on e that a provision is within our powers, and the other that it is not-the construction be to keep it within our powers. Therefore I think that it would be held that we do not intend to go beyond our powers; but the question is whether we have this power, and I do not believe that we have. do not think that the matter altogether falls witliin the province of the States. We are now dealing, not with policy, but with electoral machinery; and I question whether Parliament has power to say that an expression of opinion shall not be published unless it bears the signature of the writer. I do not think that such a provision is dental, to electoral matters.",72
599,Dr MALONEV,Unknown,It is very pertinent to the candidate who is affected.,72
600,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"We are now dealing with machinery, which has nothing' to do with political parties.",72
601,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Will the Attorney-General define what a political article is?,72
602,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not think I shall attempt that. My belief is that such a clause would he beid to be outside our powers, as incidental to this legislation. At the same time, I recognise that there is much in what the honourable member has drawn attention to; and, assuming that we have the power, we might be called upon to enerdse it. The suggestion contained in the amendment has been adopted by some of the leading journals in England, notably some of the reviews, although, at one time, anonymity of the writers was supposed to be sacred.",72
603,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I ask leave to insert, after the word "" newspaper,"" the words "" pertaining to a Federal election."" Proposed new clause amended accordingly.",72
604,Mr AVEBSTER,Unknown,"Gwydir) [10.49] - I am rather surprised at the indefinite way in which the Attorney-General has given' his advice to the honourable member for Melbourne. In my opinion, the Government have lost a great opportunity to allay the suspicion that they are working hand in glove with the metropolitan newspapers. Had the Government a desire to "" score,"" they would have taken the opportunity to dispel any idea that they were sheltering behind the anonymity of the press. We know that the members of the press, like other persons, do just what the law allows, and the law allows them to abuse members of Parliament at election time. If those irresponsible writers could be drawn will into the light, and their character made known, the effect would be that the men whom they oppose would be returned. But writers of this kind shoot from behind the hedge, and I am sure that in such I circumstances there is no one here who* would refuse to protect his fellow member. I thought the Attorney-General would have taken more trouble to assist the honourable member for Melbourne. Personally I have nothing to complain of, seeing that I owe my position here to the fact that the press continually abuse me. As a incimatter of fact, I owe the press a debt of gratitude; but there are other men who do not fare so well, and I should like to afford them protection. Since the Attorney-General, who is one of our constitutional luminaries, fails to find a way out of the difficulty, and the Minister of Home Affairs does not think it wise to interfere with the law just before an election, I am prepared to stand another contest under the fire of the press.

605,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Calare) [10.58] - I move That the following new clause be inserted :"" Sections twenty-one and twenty-two of the Principal Act are repealed."" This amendment is designed to give proper effect to the new clause proposed by the honourable member for Fawkner, and accepted by the Minister. When I addressed myself to the proposal of the honourable member for Fawkner, I said that it would have something to recommend it, and would be logical, if it provided that the entire business should be left in the hands of the Commissioners. What I propose is to eliminate sections 21 and 22, so as to leave the whole redistribution of the boundaries under the control ot the new Board of Commissioners.",73
606,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Takin g it out the hands of Parliament altogether?,73
607,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Yes . Under sections 21 and 22 of the principal Act the work of the Commission is wholly subject to the approval of Parliament, and - now that we have strengthened the Commission, the logical conclusion is that we should arm it with the fullest powers and remove it entirely from the arena of party politics. Under my proposal politicians will have the same rights as other citizens IS to place their views before the Commission. AYES.",73
608,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Illawarra-Minister of Home Affairs) [11.3] - I do not agree with the proposition of the honourable member for Calare.,73
609,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,Then why did the honourable member accept an amendNOES. ment increasing the number of Commissioners to three?,73
610,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,So as to increase the expense.,73
611,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The honourable member may put on my action any construction he likes, but I accepted the proposal because I have always been in favour of three Commissioners, believing that more confidence would be placed in a strong body of that kind when their report came before Parliament. I did not, however, contemplate PAIRS. taking the consideration of the report out of the hands of Parliament. It would not affect the present Parliament one way or the other, because no further reports of the kind will come before it for consideration.",73
612,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [11.6] - It is about time that progress was reported. We haye been here now for twelve hours, and will meet again in less than twelve hours. The proposal now before us is most important. An amendment has already been carried to considerably increase the cost of re-arranging the electorates. Last night I heard the Treasurer state that he would support the appointment of a tribunal to take that business out of the hands of Parliament altogether.",73
613,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must not discuss what took place last night.,73
614,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Hav e I not correctly stated the view of the Treasurer, who is apparently going to oppose the new clause ? The Government may repeat the performance of last night if the proposal goes to a division.",73
615,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I cannot accept an amend of ment which is sprung on us like this, and which we have never considered.",73
616,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Then what is the objection to reporting progress until the Government have considered it? The experience of the last twenty-four hours must prove to any reasonable man that there is a necessity for some alteration of the present system. There is no doubt in the minds of 98 per cent, of the members of this House that there were political reasons behind a certain action taken yesterday.",73
617,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Order ! If I permitted the honourable member to discuss what took place yesterday, the whole of that question could be now re-opened.",74
618,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Althoug h I cannot canvass the merits or demerits of the matttr decided yesterday, I think it is a fair argument in favour of an independent tribunal to quote some of the results^of the present system.",74
619,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member can do that without referring to the debate of yesterday.,74
620,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I do not desire to retraverse that matter, but I take .a most serious view of the state of things under which two constituencies in a State have only 21,000 electors each, while 'another has 41,000. Some independent tribunal must be appointed to prevent the gerrymandering that takes place on nearly every occasion when re-distribution schemes are placed before us, but I do not think that the body of Commissioners accepted by the Minister is the sort of tribunal that ought to be superior to Parliament. I therefore cannot support the proposal of the honourable member for Calare, even after the disgraceful exhibition of yesterday.",74
621,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must withdraw that statement.,74
622,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I withdraw it. The Treasurer may mutter, but he knows that I am making truthful statements. Whilst there is a necessity to alter the present system, I am not prepared to hand the power now vested in this Parliament to such a tribunal as the one accepted by the Minister at the suggestion of one of his own supporters.",74
623,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Fanc y trusting this Ministry with it !,74
624,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Yes ; or the Commission that they will appoint. This is a fail question for reconsideration by the Government.,74
625,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"It is a fair thing to ask the Committee to put through a machinery Bill which the officers are anxiously waiting for. If they do not get it soon, I do not know how the next elections will be carried out..",74
626,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The honourable member had not much anxiety last night about the next elections. I am anxious also to see the best thing done, but, of course, the Government know that they will get sufficient supporters to troop in who have not heard any of the debate, but who will vote behind them, whatever attitude they take up. Therefore all argument is useless. Proposed new clause negatived.",74
627,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Corio) [ n . 15] - I move That the following new clause be inserted :"" 28B. After section one hundred and eighty of the Principal Act the following section is inserted :"" 180A. Any person claiming from any candidate a sum larger than his usual charge for services or the use of halls shall be guilty of an electoral offence. Penalty : Ten pounds or seven days."" Perhaps the Minister will accept my proposal without discussion.",74
628,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I regret that I cannot accept it.,74
629,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Many municipal councils, mechanics' institute committees, and other public bodies have varying rates for the use of their halls, and differentiate between ordinary public and election meetings. In some cases they charge, say, 5s. for the use of their hall for an ordinary public meeting and £ 2 for its use for an election meeting. It is scandalous that this extortion should be practised upon a candidate for election to this Parliament. Then, again, newspaper proprietors who ordinarily charge 3s. per inch for' an advertisement, increase that charge from 25 per cent, to roo per cent, in respect of electoral advertisements. This extortion is deliberately practised by men who seem to think that it is reasonable to "" get at "" a candidate for Parliament. If the Minister will not accept the proposed new clause I shall not press it to a division, but I think that by refusing to accept it he is countenancing an extortion that is deliberately practised by a lot of public bodies and newspapers upon candidates for Parliament. The Minister seems, however, to be unprepared now to accept any proposed new clause unless the Committee is overwhelmingly in favour of it.",74
630,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Illawarra-Minister of Home Affairs) [11.20] - I regret that I cannot accept the proposed new clause. I do not think that candidates are mere children. It has been said during the discussion on this Bill that they should not be made hot-house plants, and I do not think they usually come - within that description. They are fairly well able to look after themselves. There is no doubt a tendency in certain quarters to ""get at"" candidates, but I doubt very much whether this proposed new clause comes, strictly speaking, within the scope of an Electoral Bill. We all know that there is a scale of charges fixed for the use of halls for different purposes. There is usually one charge for the use of a hall for a theatrical entertainment, another for its use for a public meeting, and a specially low charge for its use for a charitable entertainment. Another point is that it is difficult to say who could determine what is the usual charge for a hall. I do not think that the proposed new clause would be workable.",74
631,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [11.23] - I am not enamoured of this proposition, but do not think' it more extraordinary than some which the Ministry have, accepted. The new clause penalizing any one who interjects at an election meeting was quite as undesirable as this is. I agree with the Minister that the discussion. seems to indicate that every candidate for the suffrages of the people ought, in the opinion of some honourable members, to have a dry nurse with him to look after him. It suggests that candidates are incapable of transacting business dealt with by ordimry business men. What right has a candidate to dcta*e the terms on which a hall shall be leased to him? The proprietor of a hall may not desire to let it for the purpose of an election meeting.",75
632,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,The proposed new clause would not compel a man to let his hall. It simplv provides that if he does let it for an election meeting he shall not exact more than the usual charge for it.,75
633,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The owner of a hall might decline to allow a political meeting to take place in it.,75
634,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,This would be an interference with public enterprise.,75
635,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Undoubtedly. We need only to go a step further and to provide that all halls shall be free to candidates who desire to hold meetings, and that the owners shall provide refreshments for the chairmen. The whole situation is becoming ridiculous. I shall certainly 'oppose the proposed new clause. ' Mr THOMAS BROWN (Calare) [11.25] - I am surprised that this proposal should be made by a bright and shining light of the anti-Socialist movement. We often find that anti-Socialists believe in anti-Socialism for everybody else and in Socialism for themselves. This is a case in point, and the honourable member for Corio, who professes to believe in anti-Socialism, wants a little Socialism of a particularly objectionable kind for himself. I hope the Government will not accept the amendment.",75
636,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Corio) [r 1.26] - As the Minister has raised an important Constitutional objection to the amendment, it is necessary that I should consult authorities on the subject. Perhaps the honourable gentleman will agree to report progress in order that I may have an opportunity to do so? I object to the statement - of the honourable member for Wide Bay that honourable members on fhis side are being dry nursed, and in reply state that honourable members on the other side were brought up on the bottle. I ask leave to withdraw my amendment.",75
637,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [11.27] I object to the withdrawal of the amendment. The honourable member for Corio seeks to prevent the owners of halls from making an extra charge for their use for political meetings. I shall vote for the amendment. The difficulty is one which does not affect me very much, because un: fortunately there is only one large hall in my district-the Melbourne Town Hall. As I have never had enough money to take that hall for a political meeting, I am not very well acquainted with the charges made for it, but I am informed that the charge for the use of that hall for one night is £ 1 5 , and that a guarantee to the extent of £ 1 0 is demanded to provide against damage. I know of no moral or other reason justifying municipal and other local authorities charging more for the use of their halls for political than for other public meetings. The school rooms are not under oui control, but the Federal Government have control of the drill halls throughout Australia,'and they might agree to let candidates have the use of them at a minimum charge or for one night free. I was given the use of a drill hall on one occasion, but was afterwards refused it, and could not move the powers that be. I think the honourable member for Corio would be prepared to accept a proposal that drill halls should be given free for one night to each candidate at an election.",75
638,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,The objection is that more is charged for the use of halls for election meetings than for ordinary public meetings.,76
639,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,My objection is that the authorities will not permit the use of drill halls for election meetings.,76
640,Mr COON,Unknown,Batman) [11.30] - I think the honourable member for Corio is fo be congratulated upon the amendment he has moved. I do not see why a candidate for Parliament should be charged more than any one else for the use of a hall. There are many persons who find it difficult to meet the expense of contesting an election.,76
641,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Why should a candidate for Parliament be considered fair game for every one who wishes to make a little money ?,76
642,Mr COON,Unknown,It is because I object to that that I shall vote for the amendment.,76
643,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Cook) [11.31] - It is extraordinary that an anti-Socialist mem- largest hall available. ber should submit a proposal which involves a distinct interference with private enterprise, and that one who prates about his objection to confiscation should propose tp confiscate a portion of the rent due to 'the owners of halls, l t is well known that an extra charge is made for the use of halls for political meetings, because they are subjected to greater wear and tear at such meetings than at ordinary public meetings. Again, elections do not occur every three months, and the owners of halls have a right to expect slightly increased rents from candidates during the election season. Honourable members are aware that the keepers of boarding-houses at tourist resorts expect to get a little more from tourists than from local residents. I orable members do not care to pay the rent asked for halls they can address the electors in the open air. I agree with the Minister that candidates for Parliament must be a very simple people if they require legislative protection against public criticism, and that we should under the electoral law of the Commonwealth finance their election contests in the way now proposed. This is making our proceedings farcical.",76
644,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [11.32] - I do not agree with the honourable member for Cook. I intend to support the amendment. had experience of one district in the country where the charges made for halls were higher for meetings held by the Labour party than for meetings held by any other political party. I believe that the charge should be the same for all political parties, and for all kinds of meetings, with the exception perhaps of meetings held for charitable purposes. The suggestion made by the honourable member for Melbourne is one which the Minister of Defence might take into consideration. I think that drill halls might very well be placed at the disposal of candidates for Parliament.",76
645,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,There are no seats in drill halls.,76
646,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I intended to mention that. Drill halls are usually very large, and the cost of providing seats would perhaps amount to the charge which would be made for the use of an ordinary hall, l t would be possible to get a larger number into a drill hall than into any other public building. In one division the Electoral Department has decided to use a drill hall for a polling-booth, because it is the I shall vote for the amendment, because I do not think that any person should charge more for the hire of a building for a political than for any other meeting, or differentiate in the manner which is objected to.",76
647,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide) [11.36] - I listened to the amendment with some degree "" f consternation. The honourable member for Corio strongly avers his intention to obtain free for candidates for election to the Federal Parliament halls subsidized by a State.",76
648,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I did not move that piovision.,76
649,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The amendment was drafted by the honourable member, and has f hon- been printed. How can this Parliament enact that halls subsidized by the State shall be used in that way? It is surprising that we have not had a little homily from the Attorney-General to the effect that such a provision would be unconstitutional, and would make us a laughing stock. Furthermore, how can we say to any individual that it shall .be an offence under the Electoral law to charge £ 1 is. for services on polling day when he usually charges only half a guinea. It seems to me monstrous that persons should not be nermitted to charge extra if they like.",76
650,Dr MALONEV,Unknown,The Collingwood CounI cil charges more for the use of its hall for a political meeting than for an ordinary meeting. Why should that be? I think the honourable member's proposal is very good.,76
651,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,That the honourable member agrees for once with the honortainly able member for Corio is a matter for mutual congratulation.,77
652,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,What takes place now is often absolute blackmailing.,77
653,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The Labour party has thousands of supporters who cheerfully give their services without charge, and if there are others seeking election who cannot tain free services, but to secure support must buy it, they can pay the price.",77
654,Mr STORRER,Unknown,What about the action th* newspapers in charging double rates for election advertisements?,77
655,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"They charge exorbitantly, but many of us do not use them, and get along as well as if we did. I hope the Committee will not prevent poliis tical hirelings from reaping a harvest election time. I do not know whether it gives them much satisfaction to find that some of those whom they have blackmailed get into Parliament. If candidates prepared to be blackmailed, why should interfere ?",77
656,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Gwydir) [11.43] The honourable member for Corio proposes that any person claiming from a candidate more than his usual charge for services or use of halls shall be guilty of an electoral offence.,77
657,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,He wishes to draw the amendment.,77
658,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Is he going to down ? I intended to support him. I did not expect this. I am in favour of anyister thing that will prevent extortion at election times. I have known a bellman charge j£x when, under ordinary circumstances, the charge would be 4s.; and it is not usual for the price for the hire of halls raised 400 or 500 per cent. I shall vote the proposed new clause, though I must admit it will be a great strain to support the mover. Proposed new clause negatived. Schedule agreed to. Bill reported with amendments. - ADJOURNMENT.",77
659,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,ParramattaMinister of Defence) [11.54] - I move That the House do now adjourn. I congratulate honourable members on way in which thty have stonewalled a purely machinery Bill.,77
660,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Adelaide) [11.55] - I is clear that the Prime Minister is not sent, for, whatever he might do, he cerwould not move the adjournment of the House in such insulting and incorrect terms as those used by the Minister of Defence, who has done his best during the evening to excite honourable members on this side. A statement which goes into the pages of Hansard, congratulating in ironical terms honourable members on this side on wasting obthe time of the House, when' the honourable gentleman knows full well that not one moment has been wasted by those on of this side, is contemptible in the extreme, and cannot be permitted to pass without notice,",77
661,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Cook) [11.56] - If the Minister of Defence has the information, he might let the House know when i i proposed by the Government to close the at session. Statements have appeared in the press lately, and have been going the round of the House. It is not fair that those in the confidence of the Government' should arc know when the session is going to close, we and so be able to make their private arrangements, while those not in the know are at a disadvantage in arranging their affairs for Christmas'. The Minister referred to the conduct of business today. If anything of the sort indicated does happen, one of the contributory causes would be the conduct of the Government themwithselves under ordinary circumstances. I have a strong objection to supportback ing motions such as I did support in the House today; but I tell the Minthat if other honourable members on this side are prepared to ioin in taking some such step as was taken this morning to emphasize our strong disgust at the unaction of the Government in unjustifiably to be forcing measures through by means of the for gag without allowing reasonable discussion, we shall take it. The only way to emphasize our objection is simply to make it impossible for a Minister to make ari important speech when he desires to clo so.",77
662,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Minister of Defence.,77
663,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Do you give the call to the Minister?,77
664,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I called the Minister of Defence because he addressed the Chair. Does the honourable member wish t'o speak? the Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I have the call.,77
665,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,And will close the debate. t In the most contemptible fashion the Minpreister is finishing a contemptible day.,77
666,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,ParramattaMinister of Defence) [11.58] - All I have to say in reply to the honourable member for Cook is that I shall be glad to consult with him as to the closing of the session. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.59 P ' iTn,78
