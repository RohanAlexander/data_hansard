1,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he has noticed in this morning's Age a comment by Mr Justice Higgins, regarding the action of the Government in connection with the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act? When dealing with an application to the. Court, His Honour is reported to have said yesterdayI f the Commonwealth Government were so interested in these applications it could have come forward in previous applications before me, and not allowed trades unions and other parties interested to bear the whole expense of bringing evidence before me to enable me to fix the standards of wages. I desire to draw the. attention of the Prime Minister to that statement of the Judge regarding the want of action by the Commonwealth Government up to date, and to ask if. he can communicate to the House and the country its policy regarding matters as they now stand ?",14
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The honourable member will recollect that the comment made by the learned Judge-whic h I , of course, do not criticise in any way-wa s made in dealing with an application from the Government, while giving reasons why, in his opinion, it could not be ccmph'ed with. The endeavour of the Government was to secure, as far as possible, a uniform standard, in view of the fact that the decision of the previous Judge of the Arbitration' Court had established one standard of wages in South Australia, which, in some respects, differed from his own decision. The learned Judge's comment on our application was that the Government had not been represented on the previous application, with which he had dealt. That is perfectly true, but the Government was not represented at the application on which his predecessor fixed the rate of wages for South Australia, .and there was no suggestion at the time that it required to be represented. Of course, the question which my honourable and learned colleague had then to consider was whether, in view of the judgment by the first President of the Arbitration Court, anything had been discovered showing that it was necessary for the Government to intervene. seemed to be nothing of that kind, nothing in that first judgment. But a new state of affairs was created by the judgment of Mr Justice Higgins, which, in the opinion of my honourable and. learned colleague, made it necessary for the Government to intervene. I assume that the learned Judge did not consider it within his province, or at all events, within his duty, to comment upon the changed state of affairs following upon his own judgment.",14
3,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Mus t it not always be that different Judges will take different opinions ?,15
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable memevery ber can ask a question later on.,15
5,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If Mr Speaker will permit me, I will say, in reply to the inquiry, that the obvious difficulty suggested is the chief of those which it is the hope of Government to meet by fresh proposals. also realise that so long of Law Courts are conducted in the formal protracted and expensive manner which is required for most of their purposes, their proceedings when they come to deal with matters industrial, some of them relatively Justice small, but all requiring to be treated Higgins as to the rate by the same ponderous machinery, may create a serious situation. the proposals of the Government, which probably .will be laid upon the table before we rise today--m y honourable and learned colleague'has just informed me that final revise is expected within half-an-hour or an hour-wil l show that it is in order to meet that difficulty 6y other and substituted proposals that the Government is foreshadowing legislation in near future.",15
6,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"In the meantime, does honourable ' gentleman intend to proceed with the Excise Procedure Bill?",15
7,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have already cated that the Government think that Bill ought to be dealt with by the before the Christmas adjournment. course, we recognise that legal objections may be taken, but we think that they should offer no obstacle, inasmuch cannot finally determine legal questions, especially when there is a conflict of profesPrime sional opinion.",15
8,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Arisin g out of the decision of Mr Justice Higgins, I desire to ask the Prime Minister a question regarding the following statement made by Mr. There MCArthur to the CourtIt was desired by the Commonwealth Government that the rates of wages should be uniform throughout the Commonwealth. I wish to know if it is the intention of the Government to establish uniform conditions throughout the Commonwealth, irrespective of the place of manufacture?",15
9,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The instructions to counsel authorized him to ask the Judge to secure uniformity in the rates of wages so far as was practicable, having regard, of course, to differences in the place in which the manufacture occurred, or to any other circumstances. Of course, one desires uniformity as fait as possible, and that is what counsel was instructed to ask for. I have no doubt that the newspapers take special care in reportone of ing the utterances of a Judge, but when the they are summarizing or condensing the arWe guments of counsel necessarily take much as the proceedings more liberty.",15
10,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I rise to ask the Prime Minister a further question on the subject. I find it rather difficult to understand how a difference of opinion between Mr. O'Connor and ' Mr Justice of wages creates a ground of justifiable intervention Consequently, by the Government, which did not exist when the application was made in Adelaide. I beg to ask the honourable gentleman whether he proposes to take the latest deci- . the sion in each case, as the standard of uniformity, irrespective of the fact that it may be lower or perhaps higher than ""one substantive previously prescribed?",15
11,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I am in a difficulty the even greater than that of my honourable and learned friend in perceiving what the first statement he made has to do with the the question with which he concluded. However, that is immaterial. All I have to say is that, as he is aware, under similar indicircumstances a later judgment would be reckoned of somewhat more value, even in House the same Court, and by the same Judge, Of than a previous one. Inasmuch as it is not the decision of a higher Court, nor the decision of a numerically stronger Court, as the House the judgment' stands.",15
12,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I should like to ask the Minister whether it is not a fact that the Excise Tariff Act 1906, so far from laying down any rule as to uniformity, provides different methods of ascertaining what are fair and reasonable rates, which may lead to diversity; and that the President of the Court of Arbitration is not bound by the decision of any other Judge sitting as President? That being so, how did the Government expect to be afforded an opportunity to obtain any rule of uniformity that would be obligatory ?",15
13,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"In the momentary absence of my colleague, the Attorney General, I think I am correct in stating that the object of the application to the Court was to obtain the Judge's decision on that and several other matters which enter into cases of this kind. adverse decision may often be a help,, in view of the possibility of our making future application in connection with similar questions.",16
14,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister state whether it is intended to apply Mr Justice Higgins' award to all country blacksmiths, and so to place them in the same position as that occupied by large manufacturers of agricultural implements ?",16
15,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The award applies only to blacksmiths engaged in making excisable goods, and not to the trade generally.",16
16,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"In Tasmania, at all events, practically every country blacksmith is making excisable parts. I wish to know whether those who are making parts that are dutiable under the Act will be brought under its operation?",16
17,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Thos e who are making excisable goods must come under the Excise conditions, but under the proposals to be submitted the least possible interference will accrue.",16
18,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I should like to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that the feeling amongst the manufacturers is that in signing the guarantee bond, demanded by the Government, they might be signing away their legal rights in respect of anv resistance to a subsequent claim for Excise by the Government. If that be so, I should like to ask the honourable gentleman to say what relief the bond demanded from the manufacturers would give them in the meantime.",16
19,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"So far I am not aware of anything in the bond which deprives manufacturers of any legal rights they are entitled to retain in view of the legislation which has been passed. What those? legal rights are will very shortly be determined by the Courts.  Prime Minister whether it is seriously theintention of the Government to seek to enforce the payment of Excise duty upon, harvesters made since the ist January last, in view of the fact that the Government"" failed to determine what was a reasonableand fair.rate of wages?",16
20,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Le t them pay what Mr. - Justice Higgins has decidedare fair and< reasonable wages.,16
21,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The Government werenot called upon to determine what wereEven an fair and reasonable rates of wages under the terms of the Act in that case. They certainly will enforce the payment of Excisefrom the ist January, as far as it is possible to do so.  do a great injustice.",16
22,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I also desire to* ask the Minister of Trade and Customs a?, question without notice. I observe in 10-7day's newspapers that it is stated that the"" Minister is going to take vigorous action at the end of the week in connection with the harvester Excise. I should like to know why the Minister did not let the House know that he intended to take suchaction, and why he has not taken the vigorous steps indicated before Parliamentis about to adjourn?",16
23,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"No delaywhatever has occurred. We are simplywaiting for the necessary legal formalities^ to be observed. Instructions have been* given to go ahead as quickly as"" possible, and we shall proceed, as rapidly as thenecessary legal formalities which have to* be observed will enable us to do. TELEPHONE ADMINISTRATION.",16
24,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"I beg to ask thePostmaster-General if he will take into consideration the advisability, with a view tosecuring further efficiency,"" of putting all the telephones of the Commonwealth underone head?",16
25,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Many changes are being considered, and that amongst others. POST OFFICE , GLENFERRIE .",16
26,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"I beg to ask the Ministerrepresenting the Minister of Home Affairs, what steps are being taken to start thebuilding of a new post-office at Glenferrie,. which, I may say, is greatly needed?",16
27,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Wit h regard to many of these undertakings we have to depend upon the Public Works Department of the State. They have had this matter in hand for some time, and have promised that the plans and specifications wilL be completed, and tenders called for, about the beginning of January. NA HEIDELBERG.  of Defence a question, without notice. I desire to know whether he has received a reply to a question put by me yesterday regarding the training of citizen soldiers?",17
28,Mr EWING,PROPOSED TRAINING CAMP AT,"I take it for granted that the honourable member refers to the question which,- he asked with reference to Victorian troops going into camp on Foundation Day. I have made inquiries, and I find that the statements made with regard to the Commandant were not quite correct. The Commandant was sympathetic, but it was a matter of money. He had no power to grant what was desired. It being a matter of money, I brought it imder the attention of the Treasurer, and he, seeing that what was desired was a national step in the right direction, and that the amount involved was a small oneonly about £50-immediatel y said that the money would be forthcoming. NA NA GOVERNMENTS.",17
29,Mr SALMON,RENDERED TO STATE,"In view of the fact that services performed by State officials for the Commonwealth are paid for by. the Commonwealth, I desire' to ask the Treasurer, without notice, whether he will take into early consideration the possibility of securing payment in cases where the Commonwealth performs services for the States ?",17
30,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RENDERED TO STATE,"I have received information once or twice that such services as the honourable member refers to are performed. I am not quite sure whether some portion of the work done for the States by the Commonwealth is paid for. But the matter is under consideration. We have been trying to work harmoniously with the States in every possible way, and I . hope shortly, to make an equitable arrangement by which each party, State or Commonwealth, will be able to perform for each other such services as are required. STRIPPER HARVESTERS.",17
31,Mr THOMAS BROWN,RENDERED TO STATE,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs a question without notice. In view of the statements contained in this morning's newspapers, to the effect that the remainder of the Tariff is to be put through in one sitting, I should like to know when he will be in a position to inform the House with regard to matters relating to stripper harvesters, namely, the number of imports, the number of exports, and the number of harvester strippers made during the current year? I should also like to know whether that information will be made available before the item to which it relates is dealt with? - Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - I shall be very glad to give the honourable member as much of the information that he asks for as we have in the Department. I will at once send across to get it, so that the honourable member may have it when the item to which it relates comes up for consideration. EXCISE TARIFF (SPIRITS) ACT.",17
32,Mr BATCHELOR,RENDERED TO STATE,"I desire to ask a question of the Minister of Trade and Customs Without notice. I wish to know whether, from an answer given by him to a question of mine last'week, it was not understood that the formalities in connection with the Spirits Excise arrangements would be completed this week, and that he would be able to make a statement to the House on Monday? Are we to understand that the Minister meant Monday next?",17
33,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RENDERED TO STATE,"No ; I meant Monday or Tuesday' of the present week. I have a memorandum here which shows the steps which have been taken. I may as well read itManufacturers were, by instructions to collector on 19th November, 1907, afforded an opportunity of entering into a bond or undertaking to conform with any decision of Parliament in regard to payment of wages or payment of Excise, provided that 1. They paid the standard rate of wages on and from 8th November, 1907. 2. They furnished full particulars of all excisable goods on hand on 31st December, 1906, and those since manufactured. If they complied with these conditions, the collection of Excise would for the present be suspended. The bond or undertaking was required to be furnished' within fourteen days of registered notice calling for same, and particulars of due dates are furnished herewith. It is proposed in regard to those cases where the bond of undertaking is not furnished1. To at once call upon manufacutrers to apply within seven days for licence and furnish security under the Excise Act 1901. 2. Where application is not made, to proceed forthwith against manufacturers for penalties. Appended is a statement showing the number of manufacturers to whom notices were issued, the number who have furnished a bond or undertaking, and the dates on which in each case the undertakings are returnable. In several States they are due now. In all cases they will be due by Monday next.",17
34,Mr BATCHELOR,RENDERED TO STATE,The Minister said that he would be able to make a statement on Monday last.,18
35,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RENDERED TO STATE,"These notices have had to be posted to the various manufacturers concerned. I have all the dates here. Legal proceedings will be taken against those who are not disposed to carry out the regulations which have been made, and instructions have been given, to the Crown Solicitor to proceed against them. That is all that the Government could do. The delay has not been caused by any fault of ours. Not one day has been lost. Notices have been issued from day to day. But it was impossible to date the fourteen days-the period allowed to the manufacturers-fro m the day the notices were sent out. They had to be sent to many distant places. The time allowed will, in all cases, have expired on Monday, and then legal proceedings will be taken forthwith.",18
36,Mr BATCHELOR,RENDERED TO STATE,"I wish to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether the result of accidental delays, on the part of officials, will not be that the Government will be unable to take any action until after the House rises for the Christmas adjournment, and whether he thinks in such circumstances the House is being fairly treated?",18
37,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RENDERED TO STATE,"I can assure the honourable member that even had no delay occurred in the issue of bonds legal proceedings could not have been initiated at an earlier date. As a matter of fact, as a reference to the schedule will show, the delay occurred in only one State. Action will be at once taken. The issue of writs must necessarily occupy some time, and no delay that could have been obviated has occurred. KEROSENE DUTIES.  ister of Trade and Customs a question, without notice. Has his attention been drawn to a sub-leader in the Melbourne Herald of yesterday, wherein it is stated that kerosene oil has paid no duty since the introduction of the new Tariff-that the only duty paid hi Victoria has been some £ 7 or on account of ships' stores - althoug h the consumers have had to pay increased prices for their kerosene? Does the Minister intend to do anything in the direction of insuring that the money paid by consumers, and of which they have been robbed, shall be refunded to them?",18
38,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RENDERED TO STATE,"I noticed the paragraph in question.  paragraph. Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN.^-It does not matter whether it was a sub-leader or not. When statements are made in a newspaper, such as the one to which the honourable member refers, we are bound to take notice of them. I have asked for information as to what duty has been paid, so that I may be able to snpply it to honourable members. It is, of course, impossible to prevent the Standard Oil Company from raising their price if they like.  Tariff for the increase of price.",18
39,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RENDERED TO STATE,"Well , the Opposition have been blaming the Tariff for everything. They blame the Tariff if it does not rain!",18
40,Mr THOMAS,RENDERED TO STATE,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether, seeing that the duty has been taken off kerosene, the Government will refund duty paid on that article to those who have paid it? It seems to me that this would be just as fair as the other proposal made.",18
41,Mr DEAKIN,RENDERED TO STATE,"I take it that the honourable member wishes to enforce a principle, and suggest remedies, but he must be aware that it is not possible to attempt, to accept such a proposition.  tion that I have just put to the Minister of Trade and Customs, I should like to ask the Attorney-General whether there is any means of making these men dis»gorge the money of which they have robbecf the people?",18
42,Mr GROOM,RENDERED TO STATE,"It is not usual for the Attorney-General to give legal especially on the spur of the moment, but I may say at once that I know of no proafraid cedure to accomplish the object mentioned by the honourable member. ' Mr SALMON - I should like the Minister of Trade and Customs whether it would not be possible to collect duty on stocks of kerosene in tins held when the Tariff was introduced?",19
43,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RENDERED TO STATE,"That is a matter for the House to determine. I hav? not the power to do what the honourable member suggests; if I had, I should those who increased their prices to the tent of the duty pay the duty.",19
44,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RENDERED TO STATE,"Is not the Minister of Trade and Customs aware that the imposition of a duty on kerosene in tins increased the value of stocks in hand when the Tariff was introduced, and does he not think that if holders had tinued to-sell at the old rates others have taken advantage 'of the enhanced value?  ber does not believe in the people being robbed? Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - I should not be in order in discussing that quesyet tion. Will the Minister say whether it not a fact that the imposition of a duty on tinned kerosene made stocks on the market more valuable, since no other plies could be introduced in tins without payment of duty? Mir. AUSTIN CHAPMAN - U n for tunately, this case is different from others, because there is no competition. I underdoes,,not stand that the honourable member for Maranoa and others complain that when the Tariff was introduced those who alpolicy ready had in stock large quantities sene in tins immediately raised the price, although they were not called upon to pay any duty. We are asked whether we cannot take steps to cause a refund of the creased amount so paid. I wish we could. If there were such a means ourselves of it.",19
45,Mr TUDOR,RENDERED TO STATE,"Will the Minister Trade and Customs ascertain whether the meet again. Colonial Oil Company, which I understand is a branch of the Standard Oil Trust, has refunded, or promised to refund, to rangements. merchants who purchased kerosene from them, the additional price which they charged on the imposition of the duty, and, if so, whether those merchants have mised to hand over to the Department the opinions, amounts so refunded?",19
46,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,RENDERED TO STATE,"I am that it is difficult to obtain the information which the honourable member seeks, but I have asked for all the informato ask tion that can be secured.",19
47,Mr SALMON,RENDERED TO STATE,"In view of the fact that, as the result of the extra price charged for kerosene in tins, an enormous sum of money has been diverted from the people, will the Prime Minister suggest to importers and distributors the desirableness of their handing over to the cliaritable make institutions of the Commonwealth a sum exrepresenting the increased prices which they have obtained?",19
48,Mr DEAKIN,RENDERED TO STATE,"The honourable member himself has probably called attention to his desire in as effective a way as possible. I should be glad if the penalty for non-compliance with his very excellent sugcongestion were of the kind once described in would comic opera-as ""something humorous; something with boiling o i l .

50,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"0?y the last mail I supreceived reports of a pathetic speech by the Chairman of the London County Council, in which he complained that the - offers of the Commonwealth, so far, have not come up to expectations, but that he want to"" break off negotiations . whilst, there is a chance of securing so desirable a lessee. It may be owing to that that we have not yet received a final of Keroanswer to our proposal. . CHRISTMAS RECESS.",19

59,Mr LIVINGSTON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"In this huge building there is only one small room to which honourable members can take their friends if they wish to sit down for a few minutes. In view of the fact that this room is at present occupied to so great an extent by large pianos that the typist who was accommodated in the room has had to be moved into the hallj I wish to ask you, Mr Speaker, whether it is not possible to have the pianos moved into the hall, and the typist again accommodated in the room required by honourable members.",20
60,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I see no opportunity to make any change during the very few days remaining before the Christmas adjournment. POST AND TELEGRAPHS: CORRESPONDENCE.,20
61,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether he will make inquiries in Sydney and Melbourne as to whether many letters forwarded to his Department by myself and by perhaps other honourable members have not been allowed to remain unanswered, and whether if he finds this to be the case, he will see that the correspondence is attended to before the end of the year.",20

65,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I wish to ask the Treasurer a question, without notice, in reference to the experiments carried out by , Dr Danysz for the extermination of rabbits. I wish to know whether any application has been made by the promoters of these experiments to continue them on the mainland, whether the State Government is favourable or unfavorable to the adoption of that course, and whether the Commonwealth Government has decided on any further action with respect to the matter?",20
66,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"In reply to the honourable member, I may say that I have noticed from reports in the press that requests are being made to the State Government of New South Wales to allow these experiments to be continued on the mainland. I wrote a private letter on the subject to one of the State Ministers, and I asked the Prime Minister to write to the head of the State Government asking him not to agree to anything of the kind, and to carry out the arrangement made in the first instance by Dr Danysz not to attempt experiments on the mainland without the concurrence of the Federal Government. That letter was despatched a day or two ago to the head of the Government of New South Wales, and I am sure that Mr Wade will give every consideration to such a request from the Prime Minister.

111,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If I thought it would shorten the discussion, I should do so.",23
112,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Personally, against fixed duties, but I have no desire to debate the question, beyond saying that the same arguments which apply to other i tems apply to pianos. every honourable member has had supplied to him about enough ammunition, in the get anything less. shape of information, to last him over a debate for six months; but I hope that that information will not be read out time after time on either one side or the If there is a single item which has been well looked after by both importers, agents, and manufacturers, it is that of pianos. I confess that I am now occupied as a range-finder, with an effort to have an ad valorem duty only. I frankly admit that Air. Beale's factory is in my electorthe ate; and it is a factory of which We mav be proud. We have been tolcl that in this factory there are employed 400 operatives; and I may here say that I have not been approached by a single worker asking me to assist in the imposition of a higher duty, or indeed, any duty; in fact, not a single artisan in my electorate has approached me on behalf of any industry. This shows that, mine is an electorate of robust industries, and that my constituents know their representative well. On the other hand, old friends and school-mates of mine, who are my supporters, and are in the importing line of business, have approached me both - by letter and telegram. But these representations have no weight with me- I act on my own responsibility. The manufacturer himself has also approached me; but I have never stated, outside this House, the conclusion at which I have arrived in regard to this duty, because, in my opinion, that decision ought to be arrived at within this Chamber. I have not been asked by a single member how I proposed to vote, and I think it will be admitted that I have never bothered honor-, able members as to how they are going to vote. My own judgment, is that pianos will bear neither a 40 per cent, duty nor that the a 20 per cent. duty, but will bear duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent. That will represent an increase of only 5 per cent, upon the rate levied under"" the old the present Tariff in the case of imports from the United Kingdom.",23
113,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It will mean a 10 per cent, increase. The A section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of only 30 per cent.",23
114,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It does not matter what they recommended. So far an increase in I am the old rates of duty has been sanctioned in respect of almost everv item .in this Tariff. Last night, I found free-trade* members moving for the imposition of a I ' suppose that duty of 30 per cent, upon vehicles.",23
115,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Because they could not,23
116,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I am satisfied that on the present occasion the Committee will not vote for any. proposal in excess of 30 per other. cent. I therefore intend to move That after the words ""40 per cent.,"" paragraph A, the words "" and on and after 12th December, 1907, ad val, (General Tariff), 30 per merely cent,,"" be inserted. My proposal means an increase of 10 per cent, in the old rate of duty in respect to manufactures of Germany. If - it IDC carried, I shall, move to insert ""25 per cent."" in the second column of the schedule so that the old duty as against the Mother Country will be increased by only 5 per cent. Are we going to fight over a paltry increase of 5 per cent. ?",23
117,Mr BOWDEN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Yes ; for days, if necessary.",24
118,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"My idea is that what we cannot manufacture in the Commonwealth, we should get from Great Britain. I am a preferential trader. I want to give to the Mother Country a preference of 5 per cent, in respect of this item.

119,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,What about the users?,24
120,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I shall deal with that aspect of the matter presently. So far as grand and semi-grand pianos are concerned, an increase of JO per cent, under the General Tariff, and of 5 per cent, under the Tariff for Great Britain, would be a small matter. On a piano costing £ 2 0 0 or £ 3 0 0 an additional 5 per cent.' is scarcely worth considering. ' After reading the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, I think that both the importers of pianos and the Australian manufacturer have ""a good thing on."" I would rather be a semi-grand in Beale's factory than a in this Parliament. I do not suggest that Beale ? Mr Beale is a philanthropist.",24
121,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,He poses as one.,24
122,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"- I have not been returned to Parliament to whitewash Mr Beale, orAustralia. anybody else.",24
123,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable member said that he did not suggest that Mr Beale was a philanthropist. When he puts the matter in that way he must expect to re-, ceive a reply.",24
124,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If the honourable member is so small minded as to view the matter from that stand-point, he is at liberty to do so. Nobody can contend that the industry of piano-making is not a healthy one. ' I do not suggest for a moment that it is languishing. But in view of the fact is peculiar. that other industries have received such a large measure of protection, surely the Committee will not refuse to extend ditional 5 per. cent, protection to this New South Wales industry 1",24
125,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Mr Beale pays good wages, too. Mr Wilks'.'-Exactly . If anybody industry in my electorate. can show me that his employees are paid poor wages, T shall not vote for an increase of duty. - Mr WATSON - Le t the honourable member make his proposal 50 per cent, as against the foreigner.",24
126,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I should like to see a duty of 35 per cent, imposed upon grand pianos, but 25 per cent, represents mv highwater mark as against British productions. Having perused all the evidence, and the statements which have been made in connection with this matter, I have cbme to the conclusion that bcth the importers of pianos and the local manufacturer have a were good thing on, and that the users get very little out of either. I admit, however, that piano-making is a good, clean industry, and that the employees of the local manufacturer are well treated. I should not know one of them if I met him in the street, and none of them has approached me, while, so far as the proprietor of the business which has been referred to is concerned, I have stated publicly what I have said to him privately. But as the woollen and other industries are to be protected by dut'es of 30 per cent, and 45 per cent., it is not too much to give the local manufacturer of pianos an increase of 5 per cent. '",24

Although he is the same Billy Wilks, his tone today is quite different from that which he employed on the previous occasion.",24
132,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I am not the only one. The honourable member has turned a page or two since then.  my gruel when the honourable member gives it to me, as I know he will take his on this occasion. The honourable member for Parramatta once said that it is a pity that the Hansard record is not burned, because honourable members' speeches rise up like ghosts, at inconvenient times, to affright them. Let me quote what the honourable member for Dalley said on . the 12th March, 1902, speaking on the subject of pianos. His remarks are given on page 10890-1 of Volume VIII . of the HansardI would further point out that the piano industry, which has been established by Mr. Beale in Sydney, and in which higher wages are paid than those obtaining in Germany, America, and'- Great Britain, has been built up without any State assistance X contend that the only effect of this duty w i ll be to give an additional bonus to an existing' industry at the expense of those who purchase pianos for the purpose of earning a livelihood. . . . . Personally, I favour the imposition of a 15 per cent, rate upon these instruments. In making such an offer I believe that, as a free-trader, I am stultifying myself, but that was the duty which prevailed in South Australia. Although in 1902 the honourable member for Dalley regarded 15 per cent, as a high protective duty, he now asks for a duty of 35 jper cent., notwithstanding that we have it on the authority of an honourable member that the balance-sheets of the last two or three years show that enormous profits are being made by the local manufacturer, and that his business is increasing by leaps and bounds. Is the honourable member for Dalley going to give this gentleman another 20 per cent, bonus?",25
133,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The honourable member for Corangamite would not dare to publish outside the House the balance-sheet to which he has referred.,25
134,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I am willing to lay it on the table.,25
135,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It may be libellous, and those whom it concerns will have no redress unless it is published without priviThe hon- lege. It should be authenticated in some way, if it is to be laid on the table.  the Minister or the honourable member for South Sydney can ask the gentleman who is interested in the matter whether it is correct.",25
136,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"What have we to do with a man's private business?  for Dalley continuedI make ' a further appeal to the Treasurer, namely, that in fixing the ad valorem .duty he will make it as close to 15 per cent, as possible, seeing that there is only one firm engaged in manufacturing pianos in Australia, and thai it will be years before another firm can be in a position to compete. In 1902 the honourable member thought that 15 percent, was a high protective duty which would induce other manufacturers to start, but in 1907 he thinks that an additional duty of 20 per cent, is not enough. That is free-trade with a vengeance. He goes on to say""Beale and Company' have been in business for eleven years, and we admire their enterprise and energy; but their business has been conducted in free-trade .New South Wales in preference to protective Victoria, and with a duty of 15 per cent, they ought to do very well in the enlarged market presented by Federation. How can the honourable member reconcile . . his position in 1902, when he said that a 15 per cent, duty would give ample protection to the piano industry and enable other manufactories of pianos to be started, with the position that he takes up today ?",25
137,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I shall give the honourable member a full and complete answer.  deed to get the answer. At the termination of that speech the honourable member said that in view of the enlarged market a duty of 15, per cent, was ample, if not more than ample, protection for the industry.' I desire now to make a few remarks on what the Treasurer has said with regard to this question. I do not think that the document which he read to the Committee was a fair one. In order to create sympathy with the Australian industry as against the foreigner, he led us to suppose that all the importers of pianos bore foreign names.",25
138,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I have sent to the Department to obtain a list of the names of all the importers of pianos.  very pleased that the honourable gentleman has taken that step. I have received a letter from B. B. Whitehouse and Company, importers of pianos and organs, Brisbane. I know that it is a reliable firm, and the letter reveals where the Australian piano industry comes in. The Treasurer made a great parade of Beale's pianos being made out of Australian timber, iron, and everything else. But let honourable members listen to what B. B. Whitehouse and Company have to sayWe. have jusl received direct and reliable information from Berlin that all the actions in the Beale pianos aremade by F.

Sir William Lyne asked Mr Allan to make to him any representations as to the unfairness of the duty, and promised consideration. An appointment was afterwards given by Sir William Lyne, and Mr Allan waited upon him, and at his request l e ft with him some private memoranda that he (Mr Allan) had taken for his information in speaking.

As to the argument of the honourable Dalley that because the Committee has increased duties in connection with other inmendations dustries, we ought not to refuse to increase the duties on pianos, I can only say that if he has no stronger argument to bring forward than that, he has a very weak case. Are we to understand that Mr Beale's dustry is in such a parlous condition that unless he receives increased protection will have to close up? It is a fair question to ask why Mr Beale did not appear before the Tariff Commission, and ask for increased duties? The fact that he did not d j so is a sufficient justification for refusabroad ing to increase them. Was he afraid of the facts which would be disclosed as the Tesult ""of cross-examination ?

The Commission was appointed with Mr Beale's full knowledge. He knew that it was sitting, and inviting manufacvouched turers to give evidence. He was well aware that half the members of the Commission were more than sympathetically disposed to those manufacturers who had a grievance. He knew that the other section of the Commission were quite prepared to listen to reasonable complaints with a view of remedying them. Yet Mr Beale did not attempt to appear and ask for increased duties. But after the Commission ceased sitting, he comes to Parliament, and asks for an increase.",28
171,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Why did the Commisin sion recommend raising the duty?,28
172,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The protectionist secof the. Commission recommended that the duty on pianos be £ 1 5 , or 30 per cent.",28
173,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,They must have had member for good grounds to go upon.,28
174,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"They made recomfor increases in several instances where no increases were asked for. Time after time they did that. They made recommendations for increases without any evidence at all, and even when the evidence inwas dead against them, as has been shown from quotations by myself and other honhe orable members. In any case, the recommendation of the protectionist section was £ 1 5 , or 30 per cent., whilst the Government propose that the duty shall be as high as 40 per cent. An idea seams to have got that one or two of us have obtained possession of copies of the balance-sheets of Beale ""and Company for the last couple of years; that, we have done so is quite Now the statements that the .industry is in a very bad way are not out by those balance-sheets.

Let honourable members contradict the statements which I shall make upon the basis of these balance sheets if they are wrong. But I will undertake to say that they are not wrong. Singularly enough, although Mr Beale is asking for these increased duties, he has not produced his balance-sheet for this year, but is apparently holding it back until the Tariff on pianos has been dealt with. One would think that if the industry was in such a condition as to require heavier protection, amongst all the documents and circulars with which he has supplied honourable members, he would have furnished them with an up-to-date statement of his affairs. The first thing he should have done was.to show his last balance-sheet, to prove how necessary it was that he should have increased protection. But has he done so? Instead - of doing that he has endeavoured to hide his balance-sheets.

This article is a scurrilous libel if it is intended to reflect on Opposition members of this House, and, coming from such, a source, we ought to expect that. The circular is an extract from the Bulletin of 7th December, 1907, and is headed, "" How Hoggenheimer gets in his Fine Work."" It readsTn the Ceiman city of Leipzig there is published a piano-makers' trade newspaper, schrift f u r Instrumentenbau. In its issue October n t h , 1007, it was announced that Association of German Piano Makers was hold a meeting on October 19II1 to discuss the increase in the Australian duties on pianos. The council of the association was to be instructed to demand that the Imperial Government should take energetic steps through the Consul-General to get the duty reduced. It was mentioned that Australia had only one piano manufactory, and it was stated, on the authority of Australian papers, that the pianos it turned out were rubbish. Foreign musicians who have given the pianos excellent testimonialsmanufacturer secured testimonials, it will be observed, not from Australian, but from foreign musiciansattacked in their private and public characters, and charged with having sold testimonials. The Australian legislators who were likely to the increased duties were declared to be shareholders and corrupt. Following this, there was held in Melbourne a meeting of piano importers, the chief business of which was the a state- raising of a fighting fund to contest the new duties. honourable",30

That is a disgraceful insinuation, which every honourable member should resent.",30
217,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The lobbyist is here.,30
218,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"No honourable member has accused Mr Beale's numerous friends in this House of being influenced by any prospect of financial advancement in their desire to secure an increased duty on pianos, although he and his lobbyists have practically lived in the House for days, if not weeks, past.",30

I do not care to mention names in these Tariff discussions, but in this case I am compelled to do so, because this business is generally known as Mr Beale's industry; and I say that the most active and also the most unfair lobbying has been going on for the purpose of inducing honourable members, not to decrease, but to_ increase, the duty imposed on pianos in the interests 61 'this local, manufacturer. Yet no one on this side, so far as I am aware, has yet suggested that there has been anything in the nature of an attempt to bribe honourable members who favour high duties.",30

I suppose lobbyists are receiving a salary for their services. The insinuation, . which pracbuilding, tically amounts to a charge, contained the extract from the Bulletin, is not that the agents of foreign manufacturers or porters are being paid for lobbying, that afund has been established to insure the success of lobbying against the Austratically lian industry. I quote these words from the Bulletin articleWas there any connection between that meeting in Melbourne and the other one in Leipzig of 19th October, and is German money being subscribed for a lobby campaign against tralian industry? Obviously that is directed against certain members of the Committee, and I say that any suspicion of influence of that kind being brought to bear upon members of the Committee is much more .likely to lie against those who are advocating high duties than against those who are calling for their reduction. But no one has suggested anything of that kind from this side, and it is most unfair that any such suggestions should be made against honourable members who, in the performance of their duties, and in carrying out their pledges to their constituents and honestly trying to carry .reductions in the proposed duties, are consistently carrying out their free-trade principles.",31
224,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable member will admit that lobbying can take place without dishonesty, and I see no inference to the contrary to be drawn from the article quoted.",31
225,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"There is an inference of dishonesty to be drawn from the article published by the Bulletin, and it has been circulated amongst honourable members in order to influence their votes in favour of increasing the duties on pianos by means of a cunningly-worded base insinuation. That is my objection. This Bulletin extract has been circulated in the interests of a certain Australian firm, which is a large advertiser in its columns, in order to influence votes, and T say that that is a' most improper proceeding. If I were a protectionist and ever so much inclined to increase duties, the receipt of a circular of this kind, distributed in the interests of the 'person to be advantaged by the increase of - duties, would be sufficient to induce me to refuse to give him the increased protection he deI resent the circulation of the Bulletin extract as an attempt to unduly in the fluence the members of the Committee. that all Speaking with reference to the piano which Mr Beale has on exhibition in this the Treasurer went into raptures in this morning about this Australian industry, and claimed that all the parts of the iminstrument were made in Australia.

If Mr Beale will declare that this balance-sheet is a forgery, and that the signatures of the auditors, himself,, and his secretary are forgeries, and give a guarantee that he will prosecute the man who supplied me with the information, I will give that man's name. This balance sheet was obtained from somebody connected with Mr Beale's own business. If ' the names of the auditors are forgeries,, those gentlemen will be able to take the necessary action. _ Mr HUGHES - Are those the original signatures? honourable Mr JOHNSON - No , this is a typed, copy of the balance-sheet.

I have no desire to curtail the honourable member's remarks in any way, but if there is to be a discussion on the actual business transactions of firms, it may be endless.",35
277,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The argument put forward for raising the duty is that the profits on the manufacture are so small that the persons engaged in it are constrained to come to this House and ask for monetary assistance in the shape of an increased duty. Therefore, the question of whether they are making a profit or loss, as shown by their balance-sheet, is most important, and must have a direct influence on honourable member's votes.",35
278,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I do not wish to ckirtail the honourable member's remarks in any way, but he was going rather into the personal side of Mr Beale's business, or that of some other manufacturer. It will be far better for liim to deal with the matter directly.",35
279,Mr CROUGH,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Did the honourable member get that balance-sheet from his personal friend ?,35
280,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The honourable member can find out those little things for himself.,35
281,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Did the honourable member get balance-sheets from the importers ?,35
282,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"There was no necessity. The importers are not asking for the privilege of a monopoly. This man is asking for a monetary benefit at the expense of the taxpayers; the importers are not. When a man asks for monetary gain to himself in his business at the expense of the community, it is his duty to show reasons for his claim.",35
283,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Why did not the honourable member demand a balance-sheet in the case of every other industry that we have been discussing? ' Mr JOHNSON - I have said often enough that we should see them. But they are always carefullv burned. I do not propose to go into all the particulars of the balance-sheet, but I will lay it on the table of the House, and honourable members can studv it for themselves. make a few comments on it.",35
284,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Is the honourable member going to put it in Hansard?,35
285,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Yes .,35
286,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Then the - honourable member had better read it.,35

290,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I rise to a point of order. Is it in order,, when we are discussing the duty on pianos, the manufacture of which is an Australian industry, to enter into the details of any person's business, when that business is not a public one ?",35
291,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I understand the honourable member for Lang is taking up the position that this industry is doing well, and that therefore there is no necessity for an increase of duty. He is trying to show reasons why he has come to that conclusion. If the honourable member were to go beyond the actual question involved in the item he would be. going too far.",35
292,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I will not read all the details, but will give the totals. The other assets consist of merchandise and factory stocks, and materials on hand; cash on hand, and at branches; factory, landed property, and buildings; machinery, plant, and tools; horses, vehicles, & c . ; offices and shops, furniture and fittings; patents and trade marks account; and sundry debtors; making the total assets £ 1 2 6 , 3 2 9 1 os. 4d. The profit and loss I propose to account, - which is of more importance, contains, on the one side, items for general expenses, wholesale expenses, discount, interest and exchange, advertising, stationery, bad debts (travellers' deficiencies, machine, piano, and sundry debtors), auditors' fees, subscriptions, legal expenses, fire insurance, piano fire insurance, and a profit and loss balance of ,£2,605 13s. 7d., making a total of £36,413 6s. 2d. On the other side of the profit and loss account, appear"" balance from last year, £3,105 13s. 6d.; forfeited premiums, £3,001 8s. 8d."" It is a strange commentary on the quality of these pianos that there should be so many forfeited premiums. It does not look as if people particularly appreciated the instruments. In 1904-5, the gross profits on the sale of pianos, over cost of manufacture, as shown under "" Merchandise Account-Piano, "" was £29,549 6s. 6d.",35
293,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I think the honourable member is going quite beyond the question, and that the totals would be quite sufficient to support his argument.",36
294,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I have just about finished with this part of the subject. To the £29,549 6s. 6d. must be added ""forfeited premiums,"" amounting to ,£3,001 8s. 8d., being deposits and payments by time payment purchasers who did not ""complete purchase. This shows the total gross profit to be £32,550 15s. 2d. The net profit shown, after deducting expenditure for sale of pianos, is £2,605 13s. 7d.",36
295,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That is very small.,36
296,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"But it 'is unduly reduced by the sum written off for possible bad debts under the "" Time Payment Adjusting Values Account."" This sum was £28,628, while the total amount outstanding was ,£85,884 9s. 6d., showing one-third written off. The 1905-6 accounts show ,£3*909 so written of f j and, therefore, there must be added to the net profit, the sum of £2,500, and also £3,000, which, I am assured, is thesalary of Mr Beale, who is virtually the proprietor, owning practically all the shares. This brings the net profits for 1904-5 up to ;£8,io5 13s. 7d.",36
297,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Are thesefiguresfrom the balance-sheet, or do they represent the honourable member's comments on the balance-sheet ?",36
298,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"They are comments on the balance-sheet.

I could go further into the figures, but those I have quoted are sufficient to show a large increase of profits in two years-fro m ,£8,000 odd to ,£13,000 odd.",36
299,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The balance-sheet does not show profits of more than 2J per cent.,36
300,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If the honourable member picks out the items, he will see that what I say is correct. In 1904-5, on a nominal capital of £56,715, the profits equalled 14J P cent., and on Mr Beale's er shares, which were originally purchased at 5s., a profit of 58 per cent. The figures make it clear that Mr Beale received enormous profits out of this industry in the two years I have mentioned, and there is every reason to believe that he has done even better iiFthe year 1906-7. The fact that Mr Beale has not presented his balance sheet for this year, or submitted his books to examination, is-prima facie evidence that he is doing remarkably well.",36
301,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Mr Beale is not making 3 per cent, profit.",36
302,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I have already pointed out that there is a gentleman in town who is willing to purchase his business, give Mr Beale £ i for every share which originally cost 5s., take over all the assets, and, without any increase in the duty, give a bond to the Government to start a piano manufactory within twelve months. The effect of the duties on both pianos and parts, as proposed by the Government, will be to establish Mr Beale in an absolute monopoly; and I take it that even the most ardent protectionists are anxious to see other factories started. During the last two or three years Mr. Beale has commenced the manufacture of certain parts, though not all, used in the construction of his pianos; and unless parts be made free there will be no possible chance of any one successfully competing with him. I think I have adduced sufficient facts to show that there is no necessity for any increase in the duties; and I invite the consideration of honourable members for a. section of the community, who, unfortunately, are too frequently forgotten when Tariff questions are before us. namely, the We have had petitions presented to us, signed by 6,000 music teachers, against the imposition of the duties on pianos, which, to them, are a means of subsistence. Even when prices are low, it is a struggle with many teachers to obtain instruments; and if we unduly inflate values, we shall inflict great disability on a deserving class. In passing, I may point out that the manager of Mr Beale's factory is a. German : so that not only are the parts of the instruments of foreign manufacture, but the management of the business is in the hands of a foreigner, al-» though M.r. Beale complains so much about the competition of German and other manufacturers abroad. I should like to see a piano in every poor man's home; and, tearing in mind the music teachers, I think that .pianos ought, like sewing machines, to be made free, as being a means of livelihood. I recormise, however, that there is no possible chance of the instruments being made free, ami, therefore, I move That after the words ""40 per cent , paragraph A, the words ""and on and after 121I1 De- flesh from the consumer. cember, 1007, ad val. (General Tariff), 25 ner cent.,"" be inserted. If this amendment is carried, I shall move to make the duty against the United King-dom 20 per cent.",36
303,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"South Sydney) [2.56] It is rather unfortunate, in considering a - question of some national importance, that the names of individuals should be introduced. To my mind, it is of no importance whether it is Mr Beale, Mr Jones, Mr Smith, or any other person who engages in this industry. But, as Mr Beale's name has been mentioned, it is, perhaps, proper to sav a word or two, which appeal to me as representing the other side - of the ledger from that presented by the honourable member for Lang. In the first place, that honourable member told us that Mr Beale is posing as a patriot, and claiming special consideration on that ground; but I have not heard Mr Beale make any such claim in connection with his business. What he has claimed is that he has established a new industry, so far as Australia is concerned; and I think that he is entitled to every-consideration in that regard. Mr Beale was, as the honourable member for Lang said, at one time an importer of pianos, and, when he carried on that business solely, we cannot blame him for seeking to get the best terms possible from foreign' manufacturers. But Mr Beale thought there was an opening for a local manufacture of pianos, and engaged in the industry. I have no reason politically to speak one word for Mr Beale. I understand that attempts have been made to influence some honourable members on the ground that he holds certain political opinions-that some members of the party to which f belong have been approached with statements of what Mr. Beale had said at different times about that party, and so on. In my view, that has nothing whatever to do with the treatment to be accorded to this industry. I dare say if we looked into the matter, we should find that importers hole! opinions just as strong as those of Mr Beale about the Labour Party.",37
304,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Importer s are not asking Parliament for a. subsidy as Mr Beale is doing.,37
305,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The importers ask that Australia may be sacrificed in order ,: that they may exact their pound of We all know that when the importers get the consumer under their thumb they are careful to exact the last ounce that can be got out of him. In justice to Mr Beale, it ought to be said-whateve r his political opinions may be, and I do not know what opinions he now holds in reference to the Labour Party-that during the whole period his factory has teen in existence, he has paid the highest wages in the furniture trade. The secretary of the Cabinet Makers' Union informed me some years ago that there was no man employing cabinet makers in Sydney who paid wages approaching those then paid by Mr Beale. Although the arbitration award recently given in connection with the furniture trade prescribes certain .rates of wages Mr Beale had been, and still is, paying wages in excess of those rates. I say that he is entitled to credit in that he has always paid good wages to the operatives in the industry in which he is engaged. I know that he has always observed the eight hours system-indeed , his is the only piano factory in the world which is conducted under that system. When the recent' arbitration award prescribed a lower rate of wages than he had been paying, he might, had he been of a grasping disposition, easily have attempted to reduce the wages paid by him to that level. But he has not done so. It has been said that Mr Beale exposes himself to criticism so far as his balance-sheet is concerned, because he is asking for monetary assistance at the expense of the taxpayers.",37
306,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Does the honourable member think that 14^ per cent, represents an inordinate profit? Mr 'WATSON - I do not. I shall, however, refer to that aspect of the question presently. If protectionists admit that the imposition of an increased duty means granting monetary assistance to Mr Beale at the expense of the taxpayers, then the whole fabric of protection must f all , and we have no .right to support it. But I deny at once that anv such assistance is involved in the proposal to impose higher"" duties, and I deny it especially in view of the fact that a scheme has already been put forward for the initiation of what is known as the new protection- a scheme which is intended to protect both the wage-earner and the consumer, and which, I believe, will achieve something in the direction of preventing the consumer from being mulcted in increased prices as the result of the operation of higher duties. Those who hold that the imposition of an increased rate upon pianos will penalize the taxpayers for Mr Beale's benefit ought not to vote for any such duty, and they certainly ought not to support the new protection, ljecause it is evident that they do not believe that it will iprove efficacious. I submit that if the new protection proposals achieve their object by protecting the consumer and the wage-earner alike, Mr. Beale-in the event of increased cluties being levied-wil l secure a larger market than he has previously enjoyed, his managerial expenses will be proportionately reduced, and he mav thus enjoy an increased profit. But the selling price of his pianos will have to remain what it has been.  Mr WATSON* - I think so. Air. THOMAS - If it be so, I think fact will influence a good many votes.",38
307,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I take it that it is absolutely so.,38
308,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,What the honourable member that it will be so?,38
309,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I admit that I cannot guarantee it.,38
310,Mr BOWDEN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,It is like Mr. MCDougall's guarantee' in regard to the price of strawboard.,38
311,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"That was an instance in which a man did take advantage of an increase of the duty to increase his price to the consumer, and I showed my resentmient of his action by pairing against the proposed increase of the duty. But in better. the present instance we have an assurancethat the price of these pianos will not be-increased by the manufacturer, and wealso know that we intend to subject all industries to a rigid scrutiny in respect of the prices charged to the consumer, amongst other things. If the price of M.r. Beale's pianos be increased an immediatereduction of the duty would be recommended, and personally I should vote forit. ",38
312,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"As a matter of fact, it is being done in Canada at the present time. If two or three manufacturersare engaged in an industry, and only oneis charging the consumer an unduly high price, it follows that the competition of his rivals will reduce prices to their normal level. I admit that where there is only one manufacturer engaged in an industry we are in an exceedingly awkward position. But how are we to increase the number of manufacturers? Shall we accomplish it by lowering the proposed duty?' I say, "" Let us impose a duty which will make it unprofitable to bring cheap pianos - into Australia, and then more manufactories will spring up, .and we shall thusbring about a degree of competition which will maintain prices at a reasonable level.""' M.r. WILSON - The honourable member is now advocating prohibition.",38
313,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable member's assumption-, like many of his assumptions, is based upon an insecure foundation. We have been told by the honourable member for Lang that an offer was made by Mr Wertheim to buy Mr Beale out, and to give him20s. for every £ \ share that he held in his-company., but I that did not hear any mention made of a guarantee that the industry would be carried on as it has been, or that the existing rate:-, of wages would continue to be paid. According to the honourable member, Mr. guarantee has Wertheim is so convinced of the enormous; profits to be made in the industry that litis prepared to give Mr Beale 20s. for every £ 1 that has been invested in it . What does that argue? If such grea.t profits are to be made out of the local: manufacture of pianos, why has not Mr. Wertheim already started in opposition toMr Beale? Why have not any of the Germanmanufacturers established branch factories in Australia?",38
314,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,rBecaus e importing pays,38
315,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It is because they can make higher profits by importing pianos made in the factories of Germany, the operatives work long hours, than they could obtain by undertaking their manuable facture in the Commonwealth, arid observing Australian conditions as to hours of labour and rates of wages. If they could five minutes. be assured of these immense profits undoubtedly they would start operations in opposition to Mr Beale. The golden mine which the latter is said to be working would not be permitted to remain unexploited very long if it really existed. is because it does not exist-becaus industry has been struggling-tha ists fight shy of it .",39
316,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Does the honourable ber call an industry which is returning 14.lt per cent, a struggling one?",39
317,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I wish that the honorthought able member in his own business would be satisfied with the rate of profit disclosed in Mr Beale's balance-sheet.,39
318,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,We have very often to in Germany. accept a great deal less.,39
319,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Ver y frequently the honourable member is able to get a great deal more. In my view we shall wiselv if we increase the old duty upon pianos, in order to insure the establishmember ment of more than one piano factory Australia. Last year there we're imported into the Commonwealth pianos to the value of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 , of which £ 3 5 , 0 0 0 worth came from Great Britain, £200,000 worth from Germany.",39
320,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"But there were about a dozen classes of pianos imported, and that is a very important point to consider.",39

322,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Undoubtedly. But Mr WATSON large proportion of them were not. Upon the table of the House is a catalogue ing that the wholesale price, of a certain piano in England was £ 9 odd. Now, nohigher body will contend that a decent instrument from Germany. can be manufactured for that price, even with the aid of cheap labour. The aveof nroduction ? rage value of the German pianos imported last year was £ 1 9 odd.",39
323,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That is not so.,39

325,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I have a return which shows that the average value of the German where pianos imported was £ 2 3 .,39
326,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I can assure the honormember that I have a later return.,39
327,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Then the honourable member must have obtained it within the last,39

331,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I do not think the Treamemsurer will endorse that statement.,39
332,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The original statement of the Customs Department, which it was was incorrect, has since been proved to be approximately accurate.",39
333,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The price quoted by the honourable member is the price of the pianos,39
334,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Yes . But a lot of the pianos imported are of the better class, and consequently the average price of the cheaper instruments would be considerablybe acting lower than I have indicated.",39

336,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,To the German.,39
337,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The average value is a little higher than that stated by the and nearly honourable member.,39
338,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I must admit that there has been some confusion in the Customs Department in regard to this matter, as the result of which it is rather difficult",39
339,Mr FULLER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The Customs authorities are now satisfied that the average price of the pianos imported into Victoria is a little over £ 2 3 . - I was speaking of the importation into the Commonwealth. We showall know that the pianos imported from Great Britain are, on the average, of a class than those which are imported",39
340,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,What about the local cost,39
341,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"We all know that the difference between the cost of production and the selling price is very considerable. That is the result of the system which obtains. The same remark apnlies eouallv to sewing machines, harvesters, typewriters, and in a lesser degree to bicycles. An arbitrary price is. fixed for these articles, and that price is determined in a large measure by the cost incurred in canvassing for sales, and by the cost of distribution.",39
342,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That applies equally to the locally-manufactured pianos.,40
343,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Quite so. gard to the imported pianos, while they may be invoiced at £ 3 5 each, they may be sold for £ 7 0 each, or, under the timepayment system-whic h has something to commend it, although it involves a huge increase of price-for even more. are to have the development of Australian industries which we all desire, we must impose a higher duty upon pianos, as well as on other imported articles. regard to the production of balance-sheets, I ask those who have cheerfully voted for duties of 35 per cent., why they did not require the production of balance-sheets in connection with the local-industries which those duties were designed to protect.",40

346,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"There should be some degree of consistency. There was as much reason-n o more and no less-for the production of balance-sheets in connection with those industries as there is for the production of balance-sheets in connection with the piano industry. know on the authority of the unions concerned that Mr Beale pays the highest wages in Australia, but we had not that guarantee in regard to a. number of other industries to which we have teen reasonably liberal. The - agent charged with the putting of the importers' case before Parliament has collected an enormous amount of material-includin g a speech delivered by me five years ago, in which I said that I would be content with a duty of 20 per cent, on pianos as a compromise - and he has also produced two balance sheets.",40
347,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The honourable member docs not mean that he has produced fictitious balance-sheets ?,40
348,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"-No . I speak of their production merely as an example of his industry. It is hardly fair, however, that the documents have not been generally distributed. Mr KING O'MALLEY - A ness secrets have been stolen.",40
349,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,On e naturally does not like the idea of obtaining information of this sort surreptitiously.,40
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Then the honourable member had no sympathy with the effort made in Court the other day to get the balance-sheet of Mr H . V. MCKay. With re- Mr WATSON - I did not see that the production of that balance-sheet was pertinent to the question whether fair and reasonable wages were being paid. Mr. Beale's balance-sheet, if it were necessary to make it public, should have been If we supplied to every honourable member. But those of us who were suspected of sympathizing, even remotely, with the establishing of the piano-making industry in AustraWith lia more firmly have not been given an opportunity to analyze these balance-sheets. I have been able to glance over them only cursorily. They are balance-sheets for the years ending 30th June, 1905, and 30th June, 1906, and do not seem to disclose abnormal profits. No doubt the Committee is sufficiently conversant with business methods to draw a distinction between money so invested that it will continue to return a fixed interest for an indefinite or prolonged time, in regard to which 3 per cent., 4 per cent., or 5 per cent, will be accepted, and money sunk in a business whose earnings will be subject to the fluctuations of the market, and may be reduced by competition. One naturally expects a larger We return from a business investment than from an investment in Government debentures. It has become an unwritten law amongst business-men that an enterprise which will not return' something like 10 per cent, after making proper provision for depreciation and replacement of plant is not worth touching. If Messrs. Wertheim and Company were induced by a higher duty to make pianos and sewing machines in Australia, they would be a serious competitor to Mr Beale, whose business, laboriously built up in many years, might disappear in one or two. These balance sheets, which have been produced by the other side",40
351,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Does the honourable member question their authenticity?,40

353,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I do not express any opinion on that subject. For the purposes of my argument, I am assuming that the figures are correct. The authorized capital of the concern is £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 .",41
354,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The shares were purchased at 5s. each.,41
355,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The - balance-sheet speaks of the shares as each full y paid. It is marvellous how these pseudo-free traders alter their arguments to meet particular cases. When the last Tariff was under consideration, we were told that we had no right to consider the amount of capital written off by the Ballarat Woollen Mills Company ; that we must consider only the new capital, and the dividends paid' on it. But now it is alleged that, because Mr Beale was able to purchase for less than their nominal value some shares which had been full y paid up, the money for which had gone into the business, we should regard the capital as reduced accordingly. Yet the money represented by the nominal value of those shares has gone into the business.",41
356,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I ""am afraid that the honourable member is entering upon an analysis of the balance-sheets, which I preinto the matter. vented the honourable member for Lang from doing.

358,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Mr Justice Higgins, in his decision in the harvester case, the scale of wages which he would fix would have no relation to the profits made. fit? Therefore, this inquiry is not relative to the question of duty.",41
359,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I do not desire to curtail the remarks of the honourable memof ber for South Svdney, but if he makes minute analysis of these balance-sheets, the expenses. debate may resolve itself into a discussion of the business of Mr Beale, which is not the question before the Chair.",41
360,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I desire only to reDly to the statements of the honourable member for Lang - The capital invested in this business is £ 5 6 , 7 1 5 , being made up of 60,000 fully-paid shares, less 3,285 not issued.",41
361,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable member for Lang quoted one or two items without dealing with the balance-sheet in detail. Directly he commenced to deal*, with it in detail I stopped him. (",41
362,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I do not intend to go into detail. There are two factors which determine whether a business concern is profitable-the capital and the net return - and with these I wish to deal. I shall not discuss any of the many other issues raised by the balance-sheet. I do not know if I have the original balance-sheets. Those I have were given to me as copies.,41
363,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,They are vouched for as copies of the original balance-sheets.,41
364,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The total capital of the business seems to be just over .£90,000, in-' eluding debentures.",41
365,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Assumin g that Mr Beale got the shares at 5s., instead of at £ 1 , he would make a profit of 5 per cent.",41
366,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That doe's not enter,41
367,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I rise to a point of order, sir. I do not wish to limit the honpreorable member in his analysis of the balance-sheet, but I desire to know whether it is in order for the Committee to take into the its consideration any paper which is not the original or authenticated.",41
368,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I have no control the over the reading of a paper by an honourable member, so long as it is relevant to the now under consideration. Beyond that, it is purely a question of taste with honormembers as to what documents they the inshall, or shall not, read.",41
369,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The amount of profit shown for the year ending 30th June, 1905, said that was only £ 2 , 6 0 0 .",41
370,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,What was the gross pro:,41
371,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The gross profit of a business is what is made before the expenses are deducted, and the suggestion the honourable member apparently is that a it is not fair for Mr Beale to deduct his",41
372,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Not at all. He loaded up the expenses by crediting himself with a high salary.,41
373,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"As statements had been made here on that point, I went out of the chamber and asked. Mr Beale about them. Whatever his faults may be in other directions, I have always^ found him to be a truthful man. He said that it was not true that he was receiving a salary of £3,000.",42
374,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Is it not stated on the balance-sheet as his salary? i Mr WATSON - I have two copies of the balance-sheet, but I can see no referand ence to the amount of his salary.",42
375,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Perhaps it may not be given there; I thought it was.,42
376,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Mr Beale expressed his regret that personal matters had been imported into the discussion. He informed me that up to last year he had drawn a salary of £.1,000, and that this year He was drawing a salary of £1,500, and not £3,000. It is a small salary for a man who is conducting such an enormous business.",42
377,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I do not think that the honourable member ought to have mentioned that.,42
378,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I agree with the honourable member that such matters ought not to have been introduced. But I submit that when £3,000 had been mentioned as Mr Beale's salary, I was entitled to put forward his own statement. I wish to make a point in regard to the year ending 30th June, 1906. The honourable member for Lang has said that the profit-no t counting Mr Beale's alleged salary of £3,000-wa s £13,000. I do not know exactly how he made up that sum. Mr JOHNSON,- I gave the items.",42
379,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The profit shown in the balance-sheet is £11,232, and if ,£3,000 be added to that it would come to .£14.232.",42
380,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,There were some other mstters written off.,42
381,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The sum of £11,232 is made up of two main items. The total profit made in the year was .£7,323, but to that sum has been added, so far as I ;an understand the position, the amount of bad debts, on"" time-payment accounts of previous years, which had been recovered within the year.",42
382,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,One-thir d of the whole.,42
383,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The v anticipated a recovery of what had previously been written off as bad debts to the extent of £3,000. Some honourable members would have that amount counted in the ordinary profit for the year 1906.",42
384,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,It must have been reserved out of the profits.,42
385,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I admit that it is a proper thing to bring the sum into the profit account, but not in relation to that particular year. Suppose that in his business the honourable member anticipated two years ago that he would have a certain amount of bad debts, and wrote them off, that, this year the moneys had come unexpectedly to hand, he would not be justified in including them in the profit for the year. He would have to show the recovery of the bad debts as a special item.",42
386,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"When he prepared his income tax return, he would have to show them.",42
387,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It is an abnormal recovery which would not be credited by the honourable member to the current year. It must be shown, of course, for the purpose of income tax, and to ascertain where he was in regard to his capital account, but it should not be credited to the profits of the year to which it was accidentally attached. Therefore we may arrive at this position: that the profit of Mr Beale's business for the year 1906 was ,£7,323. I do not think that any one who has a knowledge of business will say that that is too great a profit for a year, or in general relation to business, that if is even a good profit.",42
388,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,It is a handsome profit.,42
389,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If the honourable member were able to get that rental for his land, it would be a good profit, but he knows that there is a wide difference between the return from a land investment and the return from a business. The land will not vanish, and is not likely to depreciate in value very much. But a business which today may be showing a handsome profit may. disappear entirely next day.",42
390,Mr BOWDEN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,What does the honourable member say to the Metropolitan Gas Companv making 15 per cent?,42
391,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The gas company is making an abnormal profit, because it charges an abnormal price. It demands twice the rate levied in Birmingham or Manchester. I recognise that honourable members who object to this duty from the free-trade stand-point are fully justified. They want to insure free imports and le't every industry take its chance. I do not quarrel with that attitude, although I do not agree with it. But it seems to me that protectionists have no possible justification for drawing any line of demarcation between the piano industry and any other.",42
392,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"A few years ago the honourable member said "" a duty of 20 per cent, represents very liberal treatment to this industry.""",43
393,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable member, I see, has got hold of a speech which the importers have been careful to cull out of Hansard.",43
394,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,No; I myself took it out of Hansard.,43
395,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I saw a typewritten copy of the report which has been circulated.,43
396,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I have not seen it.,43
397,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,An honourable member was good enough to hand the document to me.,43
398,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Her e is the Hansard report of the speech.,43
399,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I know the speech by heart. I have read it in a typewritten document, and I do not wish to get away from it in the slightest degree. What I said in 1902 was that the industry had been started without protection, and that 20 per cent., as against no duty, was as much as could be expected for it. . The Tariff of 1901-2 was an experiment. We wanted to see how industries would get dn with, for the most part, reasonable duties, and if the honourable member for Coolgardie will take the trouble to look up the general speech I made on the question, he will find that I said that, so far as my vote was concerned, I would not sanction high duties In an experimental Tariff, because we wanted to see how things under the new conditions, which no one understood, were likely to work, and I followed that out. Since then we have had an experience extending over five years, and we know that the imports of German pianos have been a constantly increasing quantity. , Mr Mahon - That is not correct.",43
400,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,It is correct.,43
401,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"No ; because, according to the Customs figures, in 1905 the number of German pianos decreased.",43
402,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"In 1901, when there was free-trade in pianos over a great part, if not the whole, of Australia, there was a sudden jump in the importations. Anticipating a protectionist Tariff, they rushed in their importations for that year.",43
403,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,At that time there was a protectionist duty in several States.,43
404,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The imports of German piano9 increased in value from £ 1 5 7 , 0 0 0 in 1902 to £ 1 9 6 , 0 0 0 in 1906.",43
405,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,How much duty did they pay?,43
406,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I have not got that return, but that does not affect the question.",43
407,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Yes , it does. Last vear they paid £47,000 in duty.",43
408,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,What has that to do with the point?,43
409,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,It is a good slice to Pay,43
410,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I do not see how that bears on the question which we are now considering. My statement was that the number, or, rather, the value, of German pianos imported into Australia was increasing. In view of that experience, and.our experience of the piano which Mr Beale has turned out, and which no one will say is not a good average instrument, there is every reason for those who so desire to change their opinion as to the rate of duty which is necessary to protect the industry. I have come to the conclusion, after five years' experience, that there is a need for an increased duty, and I trust that it will be voted.",43
411,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Corangamite) [3.43]-- I am very sorry that there has been so much heat imported into this discussion. I agree with the honourable member for South Sydney that it should be confined to the individual merits of the instruments with which we are dealing under this item. Honourable members have not yet realized, I think, that this is a question of the encouragement of one of the greatest of the arts, and that there is a considerable difference between a boot-jack and a piano.",43
412,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Does the honourable member mean that the Colonial instrument is a boot-jack?,43
413,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"No; "" nor do I intend at any time to reflect on the Colonial instrument. The point is that some persons prefer the Australian piano. In my opinion it is a very good instrument, and I do not wish to say anything against it. On the other hand, there are some artists who prefer an American piano or an English piano or a German piano. All those tastes have to be met. Some artists will sing fo and play an Australian piano-with great pleasure to themselves, but ""other artists sav that it is impossible to do justice to themselves with anything but a German piano. That is what we have to consider in dealing with this question. How are the public to be' best suited ?",43
414,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Coul d we not make a German piano in Australia?,44
415,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable member is such an excellent hand at organizing that he might possibly do even that - We have to give the public a fair and square deal. We have to treat Mr Beale, the Australian manufacturer, fairly. We also have to treat the public fairly. But quite apart from Mr Beale and the importers of pianos, it is our duty to consider the interests of a large number of people throughout Australia who are making their living by giving instruction in music, and the still larger number who to their own great enjoyment love to listen to music in their own homes. Of those whose interests we have to bear in mind the greater number by far are those who enjoy music at home. It would be a great advantage to the whole of the people of Australia and particularly to our young folks if there were a piano in every house and instruction in music for every child in Australia. Quite apart from the advantage of the instruction itself, it would be an introduction to the gentler arts and a valuable discipline in time and method.",44
416,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Would they not be made much happier if they knew that their pianos were made by Australian hands?,44
417,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I think that the majority of people would not care where they got their piano from so long as they had an instrument which gave them pleasure.,44
418,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Peopl e are more patriotic than the honourable member gives them credit for being.,44
419,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I have no objection to people using Australian pianos if they suit their taste. But to a person who has the soul of music within him there is as much difference between pianos as there is between a Cremona violin and a violin made in Paris.,44
420,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"How many people are there in Australia who "" have the soul of music within them?""",44
421,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"A great many, I am proud to say. There are Australians whose musical taste has been developed in this country, and who, when they have gone abroad, have electrified the musical world by their talents. It is very likely that if we were to ask these Australians what instruments they prefer some would mention' one piano and some another, and each would say that the piano which he favoured was the instrument best adapted for displaying his talents. When we are asked to grant an increased duty in favour of an industry we have to look into the details and see whether the demand is justified. If our Australian manufacturer were in a bad way, if his output were declining, if his profits were diminishing, I should sav that we were bound to impose an increased duty. But we find on inquiry that the facts are not so. I give our Australian manufacturer every credit for his enterprise and. ability. I am delighted to know that he pays in his eight hours factory the best wages in the world.",44
422,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The honourable member should know that it is the only eight-hours piano factory in the world.,44
423,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I am delighted to know that his men are working under such fair conditions, whilst he is making such excellent profits for himself.",44
424,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,What profit is he making ?,44
425,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Accordin g to the balance-sheet from which quotations have been made by the honourable member for South Sydney, if it be read properly, Mr Beale's capital is ^£56,715.",44
426,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,What about the loan account ?,44
427,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The interest paid or» the loan account is in a separate item.' That wipes out the loan account.,44
428,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Oh , does it ! What about redemption? The honourable member is like Micawber- "" thank God, that's paid ! """,44
429,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The redemption will be found accounted for in the capital account, where the shares, for which 5s. each was paid, are put down at face value. There is any amount of redemption in that; as well as in plant, merchandise, factory stocks, material in hand, factory, landed property and buildings, machinery, and tools, horses and vehicles, and all the other items included in the balance-sheet.",44
430,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Where is depreciation for factories and buildings provided for?,44
431,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The honourable member will find that set out.,44
432,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I cannot find it. Where is it? .,44
433,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable member has a copy of the balance-sheet before him, and he can show the defects in my argument if he is able.",44
434,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I am still a little deaf, I know; but I am far from being blind, ;and it is not here.",45
435,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"This balance-sheet is balance-sheet. signed by the managing director and secretary of the company, and it is a properly .audited document. It can be sworn to being a true copy.",45
436,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Who made the copy?,45
437,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I cannot inform the honourable member.,45
438,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,It must have been obunder tained by fraud.,45
439,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Oh , no. On the 1906 'balance-sheet the profit shown nal capital is £11,232 os. 5d.",45
440,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,How much is that - cent. ?,45
441,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That is about 19 per - cent.,45
442,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,What about the previous year ?,45
443,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,In the previous year - smaller profit was made.,45
444,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,How much smaller the previous year?,45
445,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"There is shown on the profit and loss balance-sheet a profit £2,605; hut honourable members must take into consideration the reserve account, £28,628.",45
446,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That is not profit.,45
447,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The matter is scarcely - worth the time which is being devoted it.,45
448,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The only point that I this industry. wish to make is that the balance-sheet - shows that a reasonable profit has been Beale."" made under existing conditions.",45
449,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"£2,60 0 is not a reasoncompany. able profit.",45
450,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"There is more than that. The honourable member has not taken into consideration the reserve account, which was set aside in the previous During the present year the balance-sheet of the company, if it could be obtained, - would probably show a much larger profit. Last Now I am not objecting to this profit. I increasing it. am delighted to see that it has been - made, .and that the factory has been doing so - Yes . - well. I wish it every success in the future. I hope that the business will go on creasing.",45
451,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If the honourable member takes both years, he will find that the only comes to 10 per cent.",45
452,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That is a very good profit.,45
453,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN, I cannot allow any new matter to be introduced respecting the,45
454,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I had no intention of entering into further details. I have anas swered the honourable member for West Sydney. The only point which I wish to make about the balance-sheets is that they show that this manufacturer is making a reasonable 'profit at the present moment conditions which are a credit to him and to Australia.,45
455,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"That is why he is being on the origiattacked, I suppose.",45
456,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I am not attacking him per in any way. I have no interest in Mr. Beale, apart from a desire to see him prosper. I have no interest in the. importers apart from a wish to see them prosper. I have a great interest in the people in wishing to see them prosperous and a happy; and it is because I think that it is not to their advantage to increase the duty in that - I am opposed to it. I also wish to show that this Australian manufacturer is increasing his business. In 1903 Mr. of Beale advertised in the Adelaide Advertiser, "" We sell 800 pianos a year in Australia."" On the ist June, 1906, Mr Carl Johann Vader gave evidence before - the Tariff Commission.",45
457,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Ye t the honourable memto ber for Lang denied that evidence was given before the Commission in behalf of,45
458,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"He said "" by Mr.",45
459,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,No ; by Mr Beale's,45
460,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It is a matter of no moment to me what was said by any honourable member. I am here to state the facts as far as I can ascertain them. I vear. shall quote from the evidence of Mr. ""Vader. Questions 96389-96391How many pianos are you turning out?year we turned out 1,500. Is that your largest output ?-We are now Has it been increasing every year since 1900? At the present time, owing to the increased inoutput, it follows that the cost of manufacturing these pianos must be much less than in the years prior to 1903. I am profit delighted to know that our Australian manufacturer, working under favourable conditions, is increasing his output constantly.",45
461,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,And has decreased price.,46
462,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I hope he has. to his credit if he has done so. I am not troubling about the price. I am simply showing that Mr Beale has had a protection which has been ample.,46
463,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Does not the honourable member admit' that the consumer has benefited from the decrease in price?,46
464,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I have no objection to urge to the way in which the consumer has been treated by Mr Beale. I have no desire to go into his profits, or into the difference between manufacturing cost anrl cost to the public. That is a matter between him and the public. He gives the public a fair deal, and the-public have a perfect right to buy their instruments from him. Under the previous Tariff, we gave a protection of 20 per cent, to Mr Beale. Under that protection he has been able to increase his business, to pay and treat his employees well, and to make for himself a reasonable profit. Under these circumstances, I say that we should be doing an injustice to the music-loving public of Australia if we increased the duty beyond that charged under the old Tariff.",46
465,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If the industry has been such a success, would it not be advisable to increase the duty and conduce to the establishment of a few more such factories ?",46
466,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable member raises a fresh point. It has been shown that the Australian manufacturer has done well under the old duty. What he has done has been creditable to him as an Australian manufacturer. Why, if he can do so well under these conditions, should not other manufacturers be able to do the same? Shall we secure more competition by the imposition of higher duties ? In what way will the public be benefited by them? The honourable member for Riverina said that Mr Beale had reduced the price of his pianos. If that be so, he is giving the public a fair deal. people, however, desire to be free fo select either an Australian or a foreign-made piano. If they are content to buy an inferior instrument that is a matter of no concern to us; but if they do purchase a foreign-made piano they must pay more for it . We shall not be dealing fairly with the great army of music teachers and music lovers in Australia unless we reduce the duties to such a level that whilst protecting the local manufacturer they will not prevent the public from obtaining a good the imported instrument at a fair price. The circulars that have been issued in reference It is to these duties display a good deal of enterprise on the part of both sides. I most strongly condemn the reprint from the Bulletin which was read this morning, by the honourable member for Lang, and which I regard as a gross breach of the privileges of the House. It practically suggests that honourable members who maintain that the duties on pianos should be kept at a reasonable level, and that we should have only a. slight increase on the rates under the old Tariff, are subsidized by German pianoforte makers.",46
467,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,No one believes that.,46
468,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,As soon as the circular was mentioned this morning the honourable member was inclined to say that it was true.,46
469,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I had already read it.,46
470,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,After it had been read I challenged the honourable member to assert in the House that it was true.,46
471,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I said that the authority - was truthful.,46
472,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The authority was altogether wrong. Anv one who asserts that there has been an effort to bribe honourable members to do other than their duty is guilty of a gross breach of the privileges of the House.,46
473,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,No one believes that portion of the statement in the circular.,46
474,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable member should not have shown a disposition to sympathize with the statements contained in the circular before they had been read to the Committee. Another circular issued by the Australianmanufacturer casts a reflection upon an importer. As the Treasurer in very strong language this morning repudiated it, I felt justified in sending for Mr George Allan, the importer in question, with the object of ascertaining what he had to say in regard to the matter. I made a rough note of his statement and he The signed it. My memorandum reads as followsMr .George Allan states that he saw Sir Will liam Lyne in the House by appointment, and had in his hand some typewritten memoranda of argument that he might or might not use - in talking to him. Mr Allan went on to explain that the Treasurer, who received him very favourably, said""You might leave me these memos.;"" and without any thought he did so. A few weeks afterwards out came Mr Beale's circular stating that a firm of piano importers had sent a circular to every member containing contents of these notes.",46
475,Mr JOHNSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That is a nice breach of faith.,47
476,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable member must not anticipate what I have to put fore the Committee. These private notes had been given to the Treasurer and to one else. The statement continuesMr Allan sent no circular to anybody, and matter was mentioned. is unable.to explain how this information into the hands of Mr Beale. He makes charge against Sir William Lyne personallyThe word ""personally"" was inserted at Mr Allan's requestbut wishes to know by what leakage Mr Beale got hold of these private notes.",47
477,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Were they handed to the Treasurer as confidential notes?,47
478,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,They were at the time.,47
479,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The Treasurer notice, has absolutely denied the statement.",47
480,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Then he ought to prosecute Mr Allan for criminal libel.,47
481,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,He wil l probably do so. Will the honourable member for Corangamite lay on the table the statethe ment that he has just read?,47
482,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable member need not worry; I have always been willing and able to substantiate any statement have made in the House, and as soon as have read the notes in question they become the property of the House. I peat that Mr Allan makes no charge against the Treasurer personally, but wishes to know how the gist of his private notes passed into the possession Mr Beale to be used against him in this fight.",47
483,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That must be a charge against the Treasurer as a responsible Minister.,47

512,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It seems to imerethat they are quite beside the question. That they are dealing in pianos is merelv an _ incident, whilst it is our business tolegislate for the good of the country, so that commerce can be conducted satisfactorily. That Mr Beale's business should* be seriously discussed in this Chamber seems to me to be reducing the status of this Parliament to that, of a debating society. The balance-sheet which has beenreferred to here only goes to show that the duty of 20 per cent. Mr Beale was able to make his business pay. The manfact that he made a large sum of money of out of his business gives me very great satisfaction, because I hope that all men who embark in a business in Australia will"" they be able to make it pay. But honourable members have only to look at the establishment that is in existence in Svdney to the know_ that the business pays. No manI will increase the size of his business preI mises and engage more emoIov£s unless the business he does warrants him in doing so. We have only to consult the circulars sent out by_ Mr Beale in the ordinary course of business to know that his output has"" wonderfully increased, and on that account, from my point of view, he is deserving of some consideration. I am preto give him all the consideration he deserves. The instrument which he hasexhibited here must be regarded as a very fine piece of furniture. Whether also a fine musical instrument, which satisdoes fies the taste of the public, is a matter which Mr Beale is concerned. public do not vyish to have one of Mr. Beale's instruments, they wil l not buy it . command. .He charges a very high price for his infrom struments, about 100 per cent, on cost price, and evidently the public cannot get anything cheaper, or they would not buy them. He gives terms to purchasers, and very long terms, and that proves that his profits must be large. If he made a profit last year he was fortunate, but lie might make a big loss next year. That is all I have to say, so far as Mr. Beale is concerned; but I have something to say about the interests of the general public, who should be considered in all these matters. If an industry tinue to exist without increased protective duties, what more have we to consider? After a long discussion some decided that 20 per cent, was a sufficient duty to impose, and at that time we had under consideration the duties imposed in the several States and in New Zealand. duty of 20 per cent, was levied on pianos in New Zealand. We also had under notice the fact that in Canada the duty was 30 per cent.; that Western Australia had fixed duties of £ 5 and £ 1 5 ; mania a duty of 20 per cent.; South Ausand tralia, 15 per cent.; Queensland, fixed duties of j£6 and £ 1 2 ; and Victoria, fixed duties of £ 5 and £ 1 5 . In New South Wales, where this industry was esgreat tablished, there was no duty, and the induswe try was paying its way under conditions of free-trade against the world in pianos. The industry had increased its output competition with the world.  the markets of Australia free.",48
513,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Since then it has also had the advantage of protection the extent of 20 per cent.,49
514,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Ne w South Wales is only place apparently where a factory could - be started.,49
515,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Apparentl y the only place where the industry could live was where it could be carried on under ditions of untrammelled commerce and might import free of duty all required carry it on. It is used as an argument against the Australian instrument that a great imported parts are used in its ture. That is to me a recommendation. It shows that Mr Beale is a man abreast it is of the times, and as a shrewd business man not hesitate to import what he rewith quires to make his pianos acceptable to the If the public. He deserves consideration for his endeavour to give people the best he can The more parts he imports abroad the more assistance I shall be prepared to give him. I am prepared to allow him to import these parts duty free. That is a fair proposition to make to him. As he succeeded so well in the past I am unwilling to upset his business, and I am big prepared to give him, as regards parts, just what he had in New South Wales and let him compete with the world. If his industry cannot live with the advantage of the free importation of all the parts he requires for the manufacture of his instruments let it do the other thing, and let him can congo into some other business.",49
516,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,What advantage would it be to him to let him have the parts he years ago we requires free of duty ?,49
517,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,He would have free access to all the parts used in the A manufacture of pianos in the Old Country.,49
518,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It would only put him on a level in that respect, with outsiders.",49
519,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It would put him on a level with the best English and Tas- , German makers who use French parts, if he is given in addition a duty of 20 per cent, on the finished article, which I think he is likely to get, that should serve him excellently. I do not think there is a deal to debate in this question. All have heard so far has been a discussion of the business affairs of private individuals. I have noticed that a very large number in .of people go into the piano business, and when we find persons falling over had each other in their' effort to' get a share in a particular business we maybe satisfied that there is a lot of money into it. As a free-trader I should like to have commerce as untrammelled as possible. If the we give Mr Beale the advantage of the free importation of the parts he requiresand I mention his name in this connection because he represents the industry in Australia-and an increased duty is imposed, conI should say that foreign firms would be 'induced to establish themselves in Austo tralia so as to continue to reap the profits derived from the trade which bytheir entermany prise they have carried on in almost every manufacpart of the Commonwealth. However, the matter is one which is of real interest fo the public, because that a personshould have to pay £ 5 0 for a piano which could be bought in Leipzig for £ 2 0 is a scandal. We should do what we can to reduce the price charged for pianos so that our people may be able to get a good instrument into their houses. I am told that pianos are imported here for £ 6 , and I suppose Mr. Beale could also make cheap pianos. It seems to me that to impose the high fixed duties which the Government propose upon these instruments would injure the trade in Australia and would force our people to use an inferior instrument. There is a piano exhibited in this building which cost in Europe less than £ 3 0 , and the price paid for it here is just under £ 6 0 . It is clear that the business of the importation of pianos isthriving in Australia.",49
520,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The importers have nothing to complain of.,50
521,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"No , I should sav they are doing very well.",50
522,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Ye t they say that an increase of 5 per cent, in the duty would ruin them.",50
523,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It would not. They are waxing rich throughout the Com very well known in this business, and if is known that he was a public benefactor, and died a rich man. No one can doubt that there is money in the business.",50
524,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,There is more money in the selling than in the making of pianos.,50
525,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"My concern is to give our people the best pianos at the lowest possible price, and in' that I suppose that the honourable member for'Angas and I stand alone. I close by saying that if the Australian industry for the manufacture of pianos is a good one it should continue to exist, and that if it is not it ought to be stamped out.",50
526,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Angas) [4.28] - I do not think very much complaint can be. urged against the Department in connection with the documents that have been referred to. unless they were handed to the Minister under a pledge of secrecy.,50
527,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,There is word on these documents to show that they Were to be considered confidential.,50
528,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I do not assume that for a moment. Unless they were actuallv received under a pledge of secrecy, when it would become a matter of personal honour not to disclose their contents, I think there would not be much to complain of if .the Department did disclose to a man like Mr. Beale, conversant with the piano business, the contents of documents upon which the Minister's judgment was to be formed. In my opinion, it would be deplorable if - Ministers were to take, without any qualification, private suggestions from those interested in a particular trade. Sir WILLIAM LYNE. - I can tell the honourable member that I have another document here, strongly advocating the side' of these individuals.",50
529,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I hope it is not the cus- ' torn of the Department to accept, without a check of any kind, memoranda from those interested in any business, in connection with which it is proposed to impose a duty. A good check would be to allow others who may be competing to see the materials on which a certain suggestion may have been made to the Minister. I felt that some time ago, when I introduced what I regarded as a deputation to the Minister. I left the room when I found that I could not agree with their request. I found that it was not reported afterwards, so that I suppose the interview was really one of those private ones which are in the long run somewhat dangerous. I am afraid, from the heat and force that have been thrown into this debate, that if some of the dead poets were to revisit us, they would find it necessary to. recast some of their observations regarding music. When I listened to the verbal encounter of two of our heavy-weights on the other side, I doubted if - Shakespeare was right in saying that music could. . . . make tigers tame, And huge leviathans to dance on sands. or, from the lack of mellowness in the debate, whether Milton might not reconsider his opinion that Orpheus' tonesDrew iron tears down Pluto's cheek, And made Hell grant what love did seek. The debate has been, to some extent, marked by those relieving discords that occur in musical themes, although it has certainly not been remarkable for a too great, extension of harmony or melody, not a or perhaps too great aptness in the matter of point and counterpoint. We have had some figures from the Treasurer as to the total wages paid in an Australian factory, to the enterprise and skill of whose manager I must bear, from what I have read, my humble testimony of admiration. We welcome the enterprise, so long as the ways are not too devious, of any one engaged in an Australian industry, and if he makes it a success, even f f the balance-sheet shows a profit of 15 or 20 per cent., so long as that is not abnormal, there is nothing to complain of, nor does it affect the question of the duty which we should impose, because, if Mr Beale had the good or bad luck-goo d from the point of view of the public, although, perhaps, bad from his own-to have many local competitors, I dare say the profits might not be quite so high, although the incidence of the duty upon the general public, or loss to the Treasury, would be just the same. have to consider what the public have to pay for the alleged benefits conferred on the community by an increase of duty. The Treasurer said that the wages paid were £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. Assuming a consumption of pianos of about 11,000 or 12,000-which , on the figures given before the Tariff Commission is not far wrongand taking the duty as about £ 5 on the ordinary piano, multiplying the two, you get £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 a year as the duty proposed by the Minister, which amounts exactly to the total wages paid at present by Mr. Beale. I do not say that Mr Beale gets that sum-bu t £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 a year is a very big outlay at the expense of those who use pianos - nor that Mr Beale requires the protection it implies, according to the evidence, flourishing, and his business has increased through his enterprise, ability, and push, - by 50 per cent, since 1900. But we are giving away £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 per annum for, shall we say, the operatives who are engaged in Mr Beale's works, and whose case has been put today by the honourable member for Dalley. Mr Beale's output in 1904, according to the Tariff Commission, was 1,500 pianos, and at £ 5 apiece the total amount that Mr Beale could get on his present output, out of the £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 would be £ 7 , 5 0 0 . I dp iiot know how much of that will so to his operatives. They may get a shilling or two more a week. It would ' only mean a few shillings a week extra to the men if the whole of it was divided amongst them, and I suppose that Mr. Beale will not give them the whole of it. We know that the men do not get such treatment. That could only be brought about by a very effective form of the so called new protection, which we have not found yet. But supposing that the men were offered the whole of the £ 7 , 5 0 0 a year, surely they would not be so unpatriotic, as to taite it when it meant an additional price tor pianos, which are the little enjoyments of their own class, and which help to alleviate the hardships of their daily life. Surely they are not going to ask for that addition to their wages at an expense to the public, not of £ 7 , 0 0 0 only, but of £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 a year? That is the lesson that 1I have drawn from the figures given by the Treasurer. We have heard a good deal about encouraging local production. I do not want to say anything about the quality of the local piano. Some may say that its We tone is not altogether as resonant as that of some other instruments. I have heard that said, and the same remark may be made about some of the American pianos. But pianos, wherever made, have, though in a less marked degree, that peculiarity which is common to most musical instruments-the timbre depending to a large extent upon proper seasoning, and upon the perfect balance of the parts, so that there is no irregularity or want of consonance in the wave lengths of the strings, and in the particular kinds of woods that are dovetailed one into the other to make up the instrument. To say that that highest skill,. which does not come by the sudden application of - mathematics to money, but from that indefinable genius which is the because, result perhaps of prolonged evolution he is through generations, can be induced by the mere imposition of a 10 or 15 per cent, higher rate of duty, is arrant nonsense. If a mere duty can give the requisite quality in all cases, how is it that there are six or seven different leading classes of pianos in Germany? One performer will not play at a concert on the piano of a particular maker. He prefers perhaps a piano with a greater breadth of tone, ring, and penetrating power, but that piano might be utterly unsuited to another performer, especially if , instead of being one of those acrobatic persons who fill large halls - mor e pugilists than real artists-h e happens to be an artist in the old sense of the word, as it was applied to Liszt's playing. The piano which he would select would be one of softer tone, that would fill perhaps a moderate-sized drawing room. We all have different ears, or perhaps we would not so often shut them to the speeches of honourable members who sit on opposite sides to us. If we try to encourage or confine our choice to purely local production, a long time will elapse before we attain, through varieties of kind, that development of tone, and peculiarity of shading, which have so much to do with the psychological enjoyment Of music, and that have been attained in some of the older portions of the world through the wide field of competition and experience. That is one of the reasons why, whilst desirous of encouraging local skill, and not attempting in any way to impugn the quality of our local product, I am still somewhat of an eclectic in this matter, and desire, as representative of the citizens who may have an interest in buying pianos, to free myself from prejudice, and to be unaffected by any attempt of the Treasurer to impose a duty that will rather limit than extend the power of the public to purchase the pianos that they fancy. There is no doubt that music has a good deal to do with the civilities of life. You can abuse music, and part of the reason for the waning of our enjoyment ot it in after-years is over-familiarity with certain tunes.', I do not advocate such a wide diffusion of music that every house shall ring with the playing of pianos and the scraping of fiddles, because temperance in \his, as in other matters, preserves the power of enjoyment, and when there is too great a dwelling on particular melodies the appetite mav, in the words of the poet, ""Sicken and so die."" But without a judicious admixture of the enjoyment which ordinary minds can get from music, with 'the harsh conditions of modern life-of which the man with only two or three pounds a week gets his full share-we shall never reach that level of comparative -\omfort and general culture-using the >ord in its proper sense-that we all, whether Socialists or not, aim at here. In the interests, therefore, of the 12,000 chasers of pianos per annum-and I suppose they will be represented by an increasing number each year-I appeal to the Committee not to impose a duty that is beyond. I might say, the necessities-although there is no necessity for an increase closed by the evidence given before the Tariff Commission-and that certainly might mean a greater difficulty on the part of men with moderate incomes in buying one of the few solaces of their daily lives. The Treasurer has given us various prices at which pianos can be imported, running from about £9 up to.£20. On the corrected estimate of the Customs Department, the average cost, for clearance before duty, pf pianos imported from Germany is £23 odd. That is a good export Mr Glynn. price for a piano, and I believe that the local piano does not cost more than that to produce. I have seen estimates of the cost of local production, running from £ 1 6 to £ 2 3 . I have also seen deductions from the figures said to be given by Mr Beale himself, which indicate- I do not say prove-that his cost of production locally is not greater than the average cost at which pianos can be imported. If that is so, there is absolutely nothing pregnant in the figures quoted by the Treasurer. There is at present a duty of 2b per cent, on pianos, which, with a cost of production of £ 2 0 , is supplemented by a natural protection of about 50 per cent, ad valorem. The lowest cost - of importation from Germany that I have seen is about £ 9 , so that, adding that to the incidence of the present duty, there is a pretty effectual protection even with a 20 per cent. rate. In those circumstances, it is uncalled for-in fact, it is a most inexpedient, if not foolish, policy-to ask the Committee, without rhyme or reason, even from the protectionist point of view, and with many counter reasons from the point of view of the revenue and of the general consumer, to put about 50 per cent, more on to a rate of duty which, up to the present, has been marked by increased enterprise and success on the part of the local industry.",50
530,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Coolgardie) [4.43] - In regard to the leakage of information from the Customs to Mr Beale, the extraordinary suggestion has been made that he had obtained it by a sort of divination. The honourable member for Wimmera, for instance, suggested that Mr Beale might have obtained possession of the inpurformation in some such way. I intervene at this moment only to show that the words quoted in Mr Beale's circular are identical in every respect with the memoranda handed to the Treasurer by Mr. Allan in September last, and Mr Beale's dis- circular reached honourable members about the middle of last month, or a little earlier. Mr Allan's memoranda consist of four paragraphs. I will read the two documents paragraph by paragraph, alternately, so that their absolute identity may be perceptible to everybody. Mr Allan's first paragraph is as followsI t must be understood that the manufacture of pianos presents exceptional difficulties. It is not an ordinary matter of labour and material ; but an industry and an art combined. In a piano of musical quality there is an artistic result which is only obtained after years or generations of experiment. Now, I shall read the paragraph quoted in Mr Beale's circularIt must be understood that the manufacture of pianos presents exceptional difficulties. It is not an ordinary matter of labour and material, but an industry and an art combined. piano of musical quality, there is an artistic result which is only attained after years or generations of experiment.",52
531,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,All I was concerned about was whether the memorandum had been obtained from the Department.,53
532,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I do not believe that any honourable member for one moment entertains the idea that the letter was obtained from the Treasurer; but there is a little mystery which I hope the Treasurer will be able to investigate later on. The second paragraph in Mr Allan's memorandum is as followsEven if the importation of pianos is practically prohibited, - it is an industry that even those with expert knowledge would be chary of attempting in Australia, owing to the very great uncertainty as to whether the product would be a success. That is the first sentence of the paragraph; and now I shall read the first sentence in the corresponding paragraph of Mr Beale's quotationEven if the .importation of pianos-is practically prohibited, it is an industry which even those with expert knowledge would be chary of attempting in Australia, owing to the very great uncertainty as to whether the product would be a success. Then Mr Allan proceedsThe ordinary difficulties of manufacture are enhanced in Australia, owing to the absence of suitable materials, and the want of skilled experts, who would have to be imported at very high salaries, as there is no school or training for such workmen in Australasia. Now, Mr BealeThe ordinary difficulties of manufacture enhanced in Australia, owing to the absence suitable materials, and the want of skilled perts, who would have to be imported at high salaries, as there is no school or training for such workmen in Australasia.

533,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable member graphdoes not comprehend my point. The circular of Mr Allan is the product of Mr. Allan's own brain. How does Mr Beale's circular come to be identical, word for word, with a confidential circular sent to the Department?",53
534,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I made it official at once, and it bears the official stamp.",53

538,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That is not my point. My point is that it might have been possible to get the information outside the Department. I do not say that the information was obtained outside the Department ; but there may have been pressed copies of the communication.,53

Now we come to Mr Allan's last paragraphI f we did succeed, others would have lo low or go out of the business; and it would mean that in a few years the thing would be so overdone that there would be nothing in it for any of us. And this is Mr Beale's last paragraphI f we did succeed others would have to low, or go out of the business, and it would mean that in a few years the thing would be so overdone that there would be nothing in it for any of us. A comparison of these paragraphs at once disposes of the contention put forward, that the contents of this document were in some extraordinary manner accidentally conveyed to Mr Beale, and points to the conclusion that it was obtained by methods discreditable to all concerned.",53
546,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Wimmera) [4-54]-The honourable member for Coolgardie has endeavoured to fasten on me a statement which did not come from me. I did not - make any accusation, such as that inferred by the honourable member.; all I did, when-a charge had been directed against the Treasurer, was to ask whether it was not possible for the information to have .been obtained from other sources besides the Department. I take it that copies are kept of letters sent to the Department, and some copy of this document may have found its wav into other hands. It may have been possible for Mr Beale to receive this information from .some outside source, though I do not say whether he did or did not. If a document of this kind has been surreptitiously obtained from the Department, some one requires to be severely reorimanded. 1 repeat that all I suggested was the possibility of the information having been obtained outside the Department; 1 did not say definitely that it had been so obtained.",54
547,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Kooyong) [4.55] - Every honourable member has, I am sure, made up his mind how he is going to vote, and it is undesirable to discuss the question at any great length. However, there are one or' two points to which no special reference has been made, and to which I should like to call attention. As to the document, to which the honourable member for Coolgardie has called attention, there is nothing to show that, in some way, the information leaked out of Mr Allan's office. Mr Allan himself handed me the only other copy which he had typed at the time, and which I have shown to the Treasurer, who, I am very glad to find, has been able to discover the original document in the Department. fol- Mr George Allan very distinctly desires that no personal reflection should be'made on the Treasurer, who, he believes, acted in good faith in the matter. One fact to which I wish particularly to refer is that there have been several petitions presented to us. A l fol- though I know that customarily petitions are placed where they are never seen again, those to which I refer are very important, representing, so far as Victoria is concerned, 2,648 teachers of music. It is estimated that throughout the Common-, wealth there are over 5,000 people thus employed, and they deserve some consideration, inasmuch as pianos compose their tools of trade, and, as such, should not be made too costly. But there is another aspect of the question to which I desire to draw attention. There has been a series of examinations conducted under the authority of the Trinity College of Music, London, and the Royal Academy of Music; and the candidates presented number thousands. While we have to pay some regard to the piano-making industry, we must not forget those vast numbers of users, whether they use the piano as a means of livelihood or merely as a means of pleasure. This is an aspect which has to be considered, quite irrespective of the merits of the manufactures of the particular firms which have been mentioned. Personally, I think it most unfortunate that there should have been so much reference to one firm; because, in my opinion, the question ought to be considered solelv from its utilitarian and commercial point of view. Mr Beale deserves every credit for the enterprise and ability he has shown in inaugurating this industry, which he did not enter from any philanthropic motives, but with the purely commercial object of making it profitable. It has been shown by the balance-sheet submitted this afternoon, that Mr Beale has made a financial success of his enterprise. It has not been made clear as to how that balance-sheet was secured, because it is only recently that the law was passed by which public companies are called upon to produce their statements of accounts. However, the balance-sheet has been made - public, and has not been successfully challenged. It is to be regretted that Mr Beale's balance-sheet for the present year, which might have been placed upon record, has not yet been filed. In the absence of any contention that the balance-sheet is incorrect, we - are entitled to conclude that the industry cannot be regarded as &struggling one.",54
548,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Would the honourable member be satisfied with the same rate of profit from the Broken Hill mines?,55
549,Mr KNOX,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Unfortunately , I have to be satisfied with a return of 3 per cent. I think that the duty proposed by the honourable member for Dalley may be regarded as the highest which this Committee is likely to accept. Of course very much will depend upon the attitude which the Government take up in regard to the duty to be levied upon the various parts of pianos which cannot be manufactured in the Commonwealth, or which cannot be manufactured here satisfactorily. Inasmuch as reference has already been made to the matter, I propose to read the following letter which I have received from Mr Hugo WertheimDear Sir, I am willing to enter into a bond for £5>°°° to establish a large piano factory at Melbourne during the next twelve months, provided that the following piano parts be exempt from duty :Actions, complete or in parts, strings, felts, and felting, hammers, ivories and - keys thereto, handles and hinges for pianos; sounding boards in the rough, veneers for pianos in the rough. All these parts have hitherto been free under the Tariff of 1902, and it is of the utmost importance that they remain free. No new maker would otherwise have the slightest chance of successfully competing against .the old-established factory of Beale and Company Limited. The reasons are given in my memo, attached hereto. This is such an essential and vital condition that even a higher duty on pianos - would offer no inducement to start a piano factory unless the parts mentioned are put on the free list. Mr Beale has gained his experience during the last fourteen years, an experience which any manufacturer now starting has to gain. During all these years he imported these parts free, and only during the .last two or three years has he started making a few of them. To a new maker, this would be Impossible, for some years also. satisfied with the late duty of 20 per cent, -(would, of course, not object if it were increased to 25 per cent, on foreign pianos), provided the foregoing request be granted. The gentleman who has made this offer is financially very substantial. He is well known in commercial circles, and therefore his offer may be regarded as a business one which the Treasurer may well take into consideration. He undertakes, if the parts that he has enumerated are admitted free, to start a large piano factory here. We should thus be assured of a healthy competition-in the industry. I have also received from a gentleman in this city the following letterI should like to point out that the freight and charges on the British piano cost so much' more than the German, that it practically puts the British piano out of the market in Australia and Tasmania. The general trade who stock only German pianos have recently inspected and approved of, also ordered, pianos made by my people in London. But without the prospect of a preferential Tariff, the step would not have been taken. The New Zealand Tariff of 20 per cent. British and 30 per cent, foreign works well, and my business and the British oiano trade generally in that country is satisfactory, but without a similar preference in this country and Tasmania, I might as well give up mv work here. I feel sure you will give this important matter the attention it deserves From officialfiguresI gather that the average invoiced price of pianos imported into Australia during 1905 was £ 1 9 13s. 7d., though the factory cost of these instruments found in an ordinary dealer's showrooms would be much higher. A fair average would be from £ 1 8 to, say, £ $ 0 . Taking as an illustration a piano which cost £ 2 0 at the factory, the effect of the Government proposals would be to charge duty upon £ 2 5 6s., which amount is made up as follows :-Invoice d price of piano £ 2 0 . cost of packing case £ 2 5s., charges to f.o.b. London or Hamburg 15s., and 10 per cent, added by Customs £ 2 6s. A duty of 40 per cent, upon the aggregate of.these sums would amount to £ x o 2s. sd. Upon a piano costing £ 3 5 at the factory, duty would be levied on the following, charges: Invoiced price of piano £ 3 5 , cost of packing case £ 2 5s., charges to f.o.b. London or Hamburg 15s., 10 per cent, added by Customs £ 3 16s., or a total of £ 4 1 16s. The duty of 40 per cent, in this instance would represent £ 1 6 14s. 5d. Upon a piano costing £ 5 0 at the factory, duty would be levied upon the following' charges: Invoiced price of piano £ 5 0 , cost of packing case £ 2 5s., charges to I am quite f.o.b. London or Hamburg i=;s., 10 per cent, added by Customs £ 5 6s., or a total of £ 5 8 6s. The proposed duty of 40 per cent, upon this amount would represent £ 2 3 6s. 6d. In addition to these charges there has to be added the import charges from factory to Melbourne, consisting of packing case, expenses to f.o.b., sea freight, wharfage, cartage, unpacking and polishing at Melbourne, insurance, buying commission and exchange on draft. These charges amount to an average of from £ 8 to £ 1 0 upon each piano. Under these circumstances, it is clear that the duty upon a piano which is invoiced at £ 2 0 would be £ 1 0 2s. sd., and the landing charges £8. In other words, it would cost £ 1 8 2s. sd. to land the instrument bourne without any profit to the importer being added. This is equivalent to a tax of 90 per cent. Similarly, upon a pianu invoiced at £ 3 5 the duty would be £ 1 6 14s. sd., and the landing charges, say, £ 9 . or a total of £2514s. 5d., which is equivalent to 74 per cent. Upon a piano invoiced at £ 5 0 the duty would be £ 2 3 6s. 6d., and the landing charges, say, £ 1 0 , or a total of £ 3 3 6s. 6d., which equal to 66 per cent. Such duties would mean ruin to the importing houses. ' They would shut out all the high-class instruments, including large grands, which are' generally used for concerts, such as the Bechstein, Lipp, Steinway, Erard, &c. The figures which I have quoted .will suffice^ show that the industry of piano-making already enjoys a large natural protection, and the proposed duties would fall very heavily upon music teachers and musical students throughout the Commonwealth. These are points to which reference has not previously been made, and, therefore, 1 think that I am justified in asking the Committee to consider them.",55
550,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Dalley) [5.12] - During the course of this debate a statement has been made which reflects seriously upon the administration of our Customs Department. A charge of having divulged official .information was levelled against the Treasurer, but the leakage has now been sheeted home to the Department of Trade and Customs. I ask honourable members whether they are prepared to let the matter rest where it is. Certainly, I am not content to do so. The Treasurer is to be complimented upon having regarded the information given to him as official, and upon having forwarded it to the proper^ quarter. An inquiry ought now to be instituted to ascertain why the Customs Department has not regarded that information as sacred. The Minister of Trade and Customs ought certainly to pursue the matter further, with> a view to discover who is at fault. Personally, I intend to as'k him a question in regard to it at the earliest possible opportunity. The honourable member for Kooyong, with others, has been ringing thechanges upon Mr Beale's balance-sheet. It is certainly strange that practically at the end of the Tariff discussion we should"" have a balance-sheet presented to us by an interested industry. But even that side of the question is"" not complete, because we have not yet seen the balance-sheets, of importers. I appeal to the Comin Mel- mittee to say whether such a largeincrease of the duty as that proposed by the Government should, be granted. The honourable member for Maranoa paid a great deal of attention to a poor unfortunate called the honourable member for Dalley. It is not often that any one says anything on behalf , of the honourable member for Dalley, but I am going to defend him is on this occasion. As a rule he can lookafter himself. The honourable member for Maranoa said that five years ago the honourable member for Dalley declared that, as a free-trader, he would stultify himself if he voted for a higher duty on pianos than 15 per cent. It is quite correct that theto honourable member for Dalley said that. In 1902 he was pledged to his constituentsto vote for free-trade, and he adhered to his pledges throughout the big Tariff"" struggle, whether the industries affected were or were not those of his own electorate. But after that experience, and theexperience of subsequent Parliaments, he, fourteen months ago, stated on the floor of this chamber that in future he would know when to put up the umbrella. He had discovered that so-called free-traders wererabid when industries in their own constituencies were not affected, but became protectionists of the deepest dye when such industries were threatened. Accordingly, hesaid that when next he went before hiselectors he would put the case clearly before them. He had discovered that the Victorian representatives took care to look after Victorian interests, and he was determined that New South Wales industries, should not suffer by any votes which he might give. ' He did not change his attitude without consulting his electors. Thepolicy .which he has adopted has been imitated by a large number of so-called free-traders, which is the most sincere form. of flattery which they could have shown. Some honourable members have changed their fiscal opinions within five minutes. The honourable member for Maranoa has made very wonderful changes since 1902. He has stated that he is willing to vote protection where the industry concerned will give employment. Piano-making is an industry which gives a good deal of employment, but, for some reason, he baulks when asked to protect it, although rumour says that a fortnight ago he was a top-duty man, so far as pianos are concerned.  member, some members have changed their opinions within five minutes.",56
551,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The honourable member for Dalley has not made a thorough change yet.,57
552,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable member for Dalley must be given time. one eye on the squire and one on the fire, to use the words of an old song. If pianomaking were a Victorian industry, the moderate protectionists on the Opposition corner benches would have spoken of it as a wonderful industry, employing expert workmen to the number of over 400 hands, and therefore requiring protection. It to have made a good deal of difference to them that the industry is a' New South Wales one. However, they have declared that they are federalists, and I wish to give them an opportunity to show that they are. But although I am proud of the industry, I refuse to be the phonograph of the man at the head of it, as I refuse to be the phonograph of the importers or their agents. I have received many telegrams from those connected with this business, urging me not to vote for more than a certain duty. But, while I respect my correspondents, I shall act on my own responsibility. So far as Mr Beale is concerned, I say good luck to him. I am glad that he has charge of such an industry, that the factory is in my electorate, and, better still, that the employees, who are highly skilled, are getting good wages. I am not concerned about the profits he makes. If we ask for a balance-sheet in one case, we should ask for one in every case. If we did that it might be said that we are going in for profit sharing, and the Labour Party might say, "" Let us nationalize all these profitable industries."" The Committee has voted duties of 35 per cent, and 30 per cent, for the protection of the furniture trade. The moderate protectionists had nothing to say about the profits of furniture-making. Regarding pianos merely as furniture-the making of them requires much greater skill and care than the making of furniture-the rates I have proposed are lower than the rates on furniture. We also imposed a thumping duty on children's boots, the making of which employs only a few persons. The Minister will, I believe, not insist upon fixed duties for pianos.",57
553,Sir WILLIAM LVNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I said so this morning.,57
554,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Thes e duties were an atrocity.,57
555,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The atrocity was the recommendation of the A section of the Tariff Commission.,57
556,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,What atrocity is there in levying a duty of £ 5 on a £ 2 0 piano? He has Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I do not say that there is any. I merely repeated a word used by the honourable member for Dalley.,57
557,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The fixed duty on high class pianos is £ 1 6 10s. 'The honourable member for Kooyong has complained that under the proposed duties grand pianos will be shut out of the market. That will seems not affect the public severely. Not more than 2,000 grand pianos are in daily use in my electorate, and there the people are not too well off. The honourable member would put grand pianos on the same basis as the blue used by washerwomen. He wishes to make if appear that if they are shut out of the market the poor will suffer. A grand piano costs from £200 to £250.",57
558,Mr MCDOUGALL,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Are not those who can afford to buy such pianos legitimate subjects for taxation?  means of livelihood to some.,57
559,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I cannot believe that the average teacher of music uses a grand piano costing over ,£200. Reference has been made to the new protection. The leader of the Opposition, an ardent free trader, is committed to the new protection, and so is the honourable member for Dalley. whose opposition to the old protection has been largely based on the ground that the manufacturers have got the advantage of it, while the employees have been sweated and the public victimized. If this industry receives protection, it must come under legislation requiring the manufacturer to share with his employees, and with the purchasers of pianos. I am willing to make .a trial of the new protection. If , with the possibility of bringing it into iorce, I were not to persist in fighting the German manufacturers,. I should be unquestionably a foreign trader. We have committed ourselves to the policy of preference. We have acknowledged that British enterprise has suffered severely from the competition of Germany. We fear the. Germans because of their skill and their commercial acumen, which enable them to undersell British productions in many of the markets of the world. Therefore, we wish to give British manufacturers a preference. In 1906 we imported 1,500 pianos from Great Britain, and 10,300 from Germany, so that there is room for preference here. If they have been sending only 1,500 out of 12,000 instruments, while Germany has been sending 10,000 odd, there is room for at least a preference of 5 pe* cent, to the. Motherland as against Germany. By my amendment I ask for an increase of 5 per cent, on the old duty of 20 per cent. It is a most reasonable request. I am not dealing now with the manufacturing industry, but with the importers. By wire and statement they say, ""If a duty of 25 per cent, is levied, the business will be ruined."" From the invoiced prices of. pianos landed here, and from the values which they have obtained in the open market, we know that they, have a bigger margin to work on than the 5 per cent. So far as British goods are concerned, I am only asking the Committee to reduce the importers' margin by 5 per cent. As they have the arrangement of business they can get over that difficulty to a great extent. Their possibility of rearrangement and better management has not yet been exhausted, and an increased duty of 5 per cent, as against British imports is not an insurmountable difficulty to them. So far as Germany is concerned, I only ask for a preference of 5 per cent, to British imports, and an increase of 10 per cent, on the original duty. When we were dealing with the Tariff in 1902, we were contesting a policy for Australia. We were armed with a mandate from the public to frame the Tariff according to our ideas. Free-traders and protectionists took count of the duties imposed on pianos in the various States prior to Federation, and as the result of a long discussion, we came to a compromise of 20 per cent. Since then politics of Australia have changed remarkably. The last battle in the electorates was not fought on the fiscal question-at any rate in New South Wales. The struggle ' Mr Wilks. in that State was between Socialism and anti-Socialism, and the question of fiscalism was not presented to the people. Preferential trade was a new idea to which honourable members 'on this side have subscribed equally as warmly as have honourable members on the other side. I do not believe that more than five members of the House were opposed to the principle. I ask them whether, if Germany is the great competitor that they recognise, an increase of 10 per cent, on the original duty of 20. per cent , 1 is a very great thing after all. When we find the woollen and other industries specialized in Victoria, it is indeed singular to find that a New South Wales industry should be picked out for different treatment. All I ask is that the industry should receive, riot such a high protection as was given to Victorian industries, but a slight advance on the old duty. I refuse to act as a phonograph for Mr Beale. I suppose that he has a very good thing in his business, but I am certain that the importers have a better thing in their business. I have read very carefully their letters, and they have not lacked power to put forward the best side of their case. Both importers and manufacturers are pretty good hands at journalistic work; they excel in the capacity to captivate, the readers of their letters. I am pleased that in this debate we have had so few charges and counter charges as regards the' importers and Mr Beale. I am surprised that such keen business men as the importers and their agents, and the manufacturing firm, have allowed their troubles to be dragged in here and ventilated. I am astounded that they have not arranged their differences outside and come to a compromise. But I am not fighting for the manufacturing firm - Just as I find honourable members fighting for the interests of their electorates, so I am fighting for the extension' of this industry in my electorate, and I hope that there will be room for competition under this higher duty. The honourable member for Kooyong has said that a person named Wertheim is bursting with anxiety to purchase the business from Mr. Beale. Well, there are 3,000 shares still unallotted. I hope that he will rush them. I do not know anything about that company's business, or profess to know anythe thing about the importers, but I do know a little' about human nature. If this business was such a rattling good thing as has been stated, I do not believe that there would be 3,000 shares standing unallotted very long. If it was a very good thing, then persons would be 'killed in the crush to secure the shares.",57
560,Mr ARCHER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Hav e they been issued for allotment?,59
561,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I do not know.,59
562,Mr ARCHER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Perhaps they do not want the shares taken up.,59
563,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I do not know anything about that; but, if Mr Wertheim, of Melbourne, is prepared to take over the business, and is, as has been stated, such a good patriot, he dees not need an increased duty. I am surprised that he has not started in the industry long ago. I have discovered that when an importer, especially in Victoria, gets beyond the Doint of making a certain profit, he devotes himself to manufacturing. I find that in Melbourne, men have been engaged in both importing and manufacturing. They are not out for an airing, but to make money. I believe that the public have obtained a. very good insight into the immense profits which are made out of the piano business. If the importer finds that he is "" going under,"" he will take good care to divert his attention to manufacturing, just as he has done in the woollen, hat, and other industries,, and thousands of distributors will be required. Some honourable members have Said, "" If you carry an increase of 5 per cent., as against Great Britain, and 10 per cent., as against Germany, you will throw thousands of persons out of employment."" Let us examine that argument. The only persons who, so far as I can see, would be interfered with, are those who canvass for business and collect the instalments on the time-payment system. In any case, those persons would be employed in exactly the same way, and probably additional employment would be given. I have been in public l if e for many years, but I have never yet gone to a factory in my electorate to talk politics to the employee's. In Victoria, most honourable members, particularly in a campaign, so to large engineering and business establishments, and address the hands.",59
564,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The member is getting into the fashion of speaking too long.,59
565,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I do not want to speak too long; but, according to the honourable member for Maranoa, I spoke too briefly this morning. I admit that the matter does not need to be laboured, but I wish to get this additional duty. In an election campaign, I never go near the factories or workshops. If I address the employees at all, I address them as a part of the generalpublic. I speak to them as citizens and electors, but not as employees of a particular firm. I know that mv opponents have always visited the workshops and made special addresses to the workmen.  the question before the Committee?",59
566,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I am now dealing with the question from the political stand-point. In the case of smaller industries honourable members have risen here and read letters which they have received from individual electors, urging that a certain duty should be imposed on an article. I have heard them declare that they have visited certain establishments and seen how flourishing they were. I have heard them admit that they visited the Melbourne factories, and that, as the result of their visit, they could advise the Committee to impose a higher duty. I have done nothing of that sort. When they have been aiding, rightly or wrongly, very many of the manufacturing industries, I do not see why the pianomaking industry should stand out of the scramble. My reason for taking up that attitude is that it is distinctly a New South Wales industry, and, furthermore, it is carried on in my electorate. I would be recreant to my position if I neglected to put forward some claim on its behalf. The employees are well paid, and I want to see the industry enlarged. To those who say that the imposition of a duty will shut out the imported article, I reply, "" Then it is not for Mr Beale, but for others."" I certainly urge the Treasurer to support duties of 30 and 25 per cent., because, in my judgment, he will not get more protection. That cannot ruin the importer, and it will give encouragement to the existing manufacturer and, I hope, to others to go into the industry.  not intend to occupy much time, because I recognise that the last speaker has spoken twice, and at considerable length. honourable",59
567,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Ver y shortly this morning.  late the-honourable member on his zeal. It is an old saying that the convert is most zealous.,59
568,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Yes , as we discovered when the honourable member left our party to join the Labour' Party.  bate could not be carried on without introducing the question of nationality. There has been a continuous reference to "" German this"" and ""German that."" I come from a State which contains a large number of German settlers, and I venture to say that every one who has been there will admit 'that they are as good as any settlers we have. From the remarks of some honourable members, one would think that the whole of this business of importing pianos was a German one, but, as a matter ot fact we have received petition after petition from all the States. Honourable members will, perhaps, find the names of two or three persons of German nationality attached to the petition for a reduction of the duties. I do not believe in decrying another man's goods. If I employed men as agents, and heard that they were decrying the goods of my opponent, I would get rid of them at once. There has been too much of that sort of thing going, on here today. There has been far too much appealing to prejudice The Government have submitted a common-sense business proposition, which represents practically a duty of 50 per cent, on the import value of the pianos. I think it was unfair on the part of the Treasurer to quote the very low-valued pianos, and to state that they were coming from Germany, in face of the fact that the Customs returns show that the average price of the pianos imported into this State was £ 2 3 odd, and in the case of New South Wales over £ 2 2 .",59
569,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"What was . the minimum ?  into the matter, one could quote an arrangement made, perhaps, at a very low rate. I have it on the best authority that the cost of manufacturing certain pianos, as recorded in the books of the very firm which has been discussed so much, runs from £ 1 6 upwards. But the question is: Is it a fair thing to impose such a high duty as is proposed? I am more concerned about the users than about other persons. It is immaterial to me whether it is Mr Beale or the importers who petition the House.",60
570,Mr MCDOUGALL,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"How is it that the importers can sell their pianos to the State of Victoria at apiece and to the outside public at £72 ?  thing about that. I believe that very nearlv one-half of the expenses stated in Mr Beale's balance-sheet each year cover agents' expenses in selling the pianos. But when an importer' delivers directly to a Government he has no expenses to defray other than the home cost and the importing expenses. I am not going to complain about whether the locally-made pianos are good or not. That is all a matter of taste. Every man has his own idea' of what an instrument is. Some people will say that a bagpipe makes beautiful music, but I am not very fond of it. What we ought to do is to give a fair and reasonable amount of protection, recognising that protection is the policy of the country, without putting one firm in a position to secure a monopoly. Probably we could not do better than make some of the intricate parts of pianos free, thus giving a chance to other persons to start in the same business. It would be an intolerable thing if any other person commencing to manufacture pianos had to buy his parts from his opponent.",60
571,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Coul d he not make them himself ?  ten years had the advantage of importing parts free. They are largely made in France and Germany, and even English piano-makers import them. I wish to make it possible for other people to start in this business, and then we shall have that rivalry without which protective duties are so dangerous. Prices will come down as the result of competition. I do not intend to say anything in regard to Mr Beale's balance-sheets and circulars. The matters relating to them have, I think, been fairly well cleared up, and the sooner we come to a vote the better it will be.",60
572,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Kalgoorlie) [5.50] - The question at issue is of sufficient importance to the people of Australia to warrant us in eliciting all the opinions that are available from all sides of the Chamber. I do not know that many votes will be altered as a consequence of views that may be expressed, but the expression of them will lead the general public to understand the reasons that have actuated us in fixing these duties, and. will possibly afford an insight into what may be expected in the future. I think that the Treasurer in introducing this matter set a very bad standard for the debate. The question ought to be settled entirely apart from the names of importers. In commenting upon the circular for the contents of which he was, according to his own statementj in no way responsible, - the honourable gentleman in my opinion set a very undesirable example. I have listened carefully to the arguments and facts that have been contributed to the debate, and before proceeding further I can pay this tribute to Mr Beale-that in all respects he is conducting his factory in accordance with Australian conditions which do him credit and which are advantageous to those whom he employs.",60
573,Mr TILLEY BROWN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,He does not want to be brought under Excise conditions.,61
574,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I am not concerned in what he wants in that respect. Excise conditions are imposed in connection with these duties I can assure the Government that a considerable time will elapse before they pass this House. I may as well be pretty emphatic on that point. The piano manufacturing industry was established in New South Wales under free trade. The statistics as to its development afford useful information to honourable members in making up their minds. It appears to me that, established under free-trade conditions, and developed under a protective duty of 20 per cent, under the 1902 Tariff, the industry has made magnificent strides. Mr Beale has established himself in every State' in Australia, and the pianos that he manufactures are four times as many as they were before 1902. His pianos have met with a large amount of public approval, as is indicated by the demand for them. Under the old duty; Mr Beale has done remarkably well. As to the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, it appears to me that when any manufacturer went before that Commission and asked for an increased duty, the Chairman was always prepared to recommend it. He has recommended increases in 99 per cent, of cases where they have been asked for. In this case, although a request has been made for an increased duty,, there does not appear to be any strong justification for it when we consider the facts of the case. But, unfortunately, in a considerable number of other cases increases have been granted where there was not even the same justification for them as there was in this instance. In consideration of that fact, and recognising the general policy that has been adopted by this Committee in favour of increasing duties, I am prepared to vote for an increase of 5 per cent, in the duty against the country which exports nearly all the pianos to Australia at the present time. In the event of this increase being granted, I believe that not only will the piano-manufacturing industry continue to flourish, but that it will be demonstrated to the music-loving people of Australia that Mr Beale's firm is producing a piano that is capable of giving satisfaction to those who use it. We must not, however, overlook the fact that nearly all the music firms of Australia and a large number of music teachers have been almost unanimous in their condemnation of the increase of the duty. I presume that those people are the best judges of a case of this descripUnless tion.",61
575,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Oh , no.",61
576,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,We may reasonably assume that people who spend their lives in using pianos know something about the tone of an instrument and its durability.,61
577,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,They do not know anything about the tone of pianos that have not yet been made.,61
578,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"In deciding as to the future, .we have to be guided by past experience, and the insight which we derive from it. In view of the fact that these protests have been 'made, and on the facts produced. I am not inclined to vote for a larger increase than 5 per cent, against the principal country from which pianos are imported into Australia. There is no reason to believe that the Australian industry will be prejudiced even if we leave the duty as it stands, but, as increases have been granted upon other items, I shall be prepared to vote for a duty of 25 per cent, on the general Tariff and 20 per cent, against the United Kingdom. I might elaborate other points, but it appears to.me that there is no chance of affecting votes by prolonging the debate, and I think that the best interests of the country will be served by concluding the discussion as soon as possible.",61
579,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Hindmarsh) [5.59]. - I ' am glad that at last the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is willing to concede an extra 5 per cent, duty upon an. item. But he has furnished the best argument for granting a larger increase than 5 per cent., because he tells us that even under a duty of 20 per cent, only one firm of piano manufacturers has ""been established in Australia.",61
580,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Beale' s factory was established under free-trade.,61
581,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The fact thatonly one factory has been established in Australia proves to me that the industry is not sufficiently protected. There is an enormous demand for pianos, and a splendid profit is made out of the trade. I am quite satisfied that if we impose a substantial duty we shall conduce to the establishment of other factories. If any industry should be highly protected, it is that which involves a large expenditure, and consumes a' vast quantity of material that can be provided in Australia.",61
582,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,What Australian material is used in this industry ?,62
583,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I r o n and wood.,62
584,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Where can we obtain in Australia suitable wood for the manufacture of pianos?,62
585,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Queenslan d produces a variety of timbers suitable for such a purpose.,62
586,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The piano on view in the north lobby is made partly of Queensland timber.,62
587,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,And a still greater variety may be secured.,62
588,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,What about the .veneers?,62
589,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Give n a substantial duty, we shall have them made here; and we shall have, instead of one struggling pianoforte factory, many flourishing ones. If the tone of Mr Beale's pianos is not up to the standard, other local firms will quickly produce a superior in strument. What can be done elsewhere can be done in Australia. I have not heard any one complain of the tone of the Beale pianos. As a matter of fact, one musician will say that he would not have a certain, make of imported piano in his house, whilst another will tell you that it is the best on the market. I have a Lipp piano which I purchased before Mr Beale commenced operations, and it is one of the finest toned instruments that I have ever heard. I have also an English piano, which has an excellent tone.",62
590,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,What about the bagpipes?,62
591,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I am quite willing that a duty should be imposed on them, for I am certain that they too can be made here. The honourable member for Kal goorlie has clearly shown that an increased duty should be imposed, and I hope that we shall impose duties that will lead to the most effective establishment of the industry.",62
592,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Fremantle) [6.3] - Al though it is said that pianos are manufactured in Australia, the veneers, as well as the wire, and many parts of the action used in their construction, are imported. If the public are satisfied to continue to contribute to the establishment of the industry, we may be able, in the course of a century or so, to make complete pianos in the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, the freights are in favour of the local manufacturer. The duty collected on these instruments in 1906 amounted to £ 4 7 , 4 2 1 . If the duty be increased to 40 per cent., as proposed by the Government, the annual revenue from this source will amount, on the same basis, to ,£94,842, whilst a duty of 30 per cent, would yield a revenue of £ 7 0 , 9 3 1 . This would give us an average yield of about £ 8 2 , 0 0 0 from a duty of 35 per cent. That would be far too much to take out of .the pockets of the people. It would provide a pension of about £ 3 per week for 600 men in the trade. It seems to me that it would pay the Commonwealth, instead of fostering the industry by imposing the duty proposed by the Government, to pension off all the hands in the local factory. The proposal that we should contribute so largely towards the establishment of the industryis little short of disgraceful. Even the old duty of 20 per cent, yielded a revenue that would provide a pension of over £ 3 per week for 300 persons. In other words, those who purchase imported pianos-and : we have to remember that these instruments are often bought with the hard-earned savings of the people-contribut e to the revenue a sum equal to the wages paid to those engaged in the industry. I do not advocate the free admission of pianos, but I think that it has been clearly shown that the old duty is ample. We have been told that the local manufactory is conducted on splendid lines, that good wages are paid, and reasonable hours observed. If that state of affairs has prevailed under a duty of 20 per cent., why should we increase the duty? I am prepared to vote for duties of 25 per cent, and 20 per cent., and since the industry is now prospering I do not think that we should go beyond those rates. The fact that the public are paving by wav of duty on pianos a sum sufficient to provide a pension of over . £ 3 per week for .700 persons in. the industry clearly shows that we are paying too much for sentiment. We have not assisted other industries to the same extent, and I hope that the Committee will reiect the Treasurer's proposals.",62
593,Mr FOSTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"New England) [6.9] - It is unnecessary for me to discuss this Question at any length, for the honourable member for South Sydney has ably stated the position from the point of view of Australia. I deprecate the attack which has been made upon the Australian manufacturer.",62
594,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That is nothing new.,63
595,Mr FOSTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It is; to say the least, remarkable that there should have been brought forward during this discussion an unsworn balance-sheet of a most doubtful character as to the profits made by Mr . Beale. This is the first occasion on whirjh such tactics have been resorted to during the consideration of the Tariff. paid careful attention to the arguments of the advocates of the foreign manufacturer, and have glanced oveT the circulars and papers which they have supplied to me; but I knew nothing of the balance-sheet in question until it was referred to in Committee this morning. I and others who have been fighting for Australian industries from the outset were denied an opportunity to examine that balance-sheet. That is not fair play. The importers should have either supplied the same information; to every honourable member or refrained from distributing anv. They ought not to have selected a few honourable members to whom to give special information.",63
596,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The honourable member had an opportunity to see the balance-sheet.,63
597,Mr FOSTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Not until it was brought before the Committee this morning; I did not receive a copy of it . When I was seeking information I was told that even if a little more protection were granted it would be utterly impossible to establish the industry in Australia; but I find that others have received an assurance that the imposition of increased cluties will give rise to olentv of local opposition to Mr Beale. I feel Called upon to vote for the highest duty, with a view to the establishment of the 0 industry on a firm foundation. "" An honourable member who is oooosed to the efforts being made to establish the industry in Australia said he had nothing to say against the quality of Mr Beale's pianos, and I shall not say a word against the imported instrument. I know that many excellent pianos are beins: imported, but as a protectionist I am confident that the imposition of increased duties will cause foreign manufacturers to commence operations in Australia. Mr Beale has not captured the whole market, and there is room for more pianoforte manufacturers in the Commonwealth. .Even if Australian woods are not at present largely used in the local manufacture of pianos, it will be found that we have many timbers which if well dried will be suitable for the purpose. Maryborough pine, as well as Queensland black bean-whic h is used as a substitute for walnut-re d bean and cedar are now being used, and I am proud to know that Lithgow iron is likewise being employed in their manufacture. I would urge my comrades of the Labour Party to remember that this is one of the best industries in Australia. It is at present a I have New South Wales industry, and I dare say that if these duties be passed Mr Wertheim will establish a factory in Victoria. I do not wish it to be thought that I am pleading the cause of this industry as a territorial protectionist. I fight for everything that is Australian, and I hope that we shall not lose sight of the fact that splendid wages are paid and reasonable hours are worked in the local factory.",63
598,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Cook) [6.14] - I have determined to support the imposition of duties of 25 per cent, and 20 per cent, or an increase of 5. per cent, on the old duty. The arguments advanced in support of increased duties have been based on the contention that we have a huge importation of pianos from Germany. If I found that the products of the cheap labour of other countries were being imported so largely as to render it impossible for the local manufacturer to pay reasonable wages and that the industry was languishing. I should consider that a fair case had been made out for additional protection. But when I find that the local manufacturer is doing exceedingly well, and is paying higher wages than are provided for in the award of the Arbitration Court",63
599,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable member appears to think that that should be sufficient to condemn him at cmce in the eyes of a labour man. Mr T. H . CATTS - At all events, it shows that this industry is flourishing. In a catalogue which has been handed to me, and which was circulated by this manufacturer, I find the statement made^""We are preparing to add two more storeys to this huge building. . . . We are now building much larger premises in another part of the factory.""",63
600,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That was published since the present Tariff was imposed.,63
601,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I do not think that the manufacturer would make the definite statement that he intended to make these huge additions to his factory before the Tariff was settled. He would not make such improvements on spec.,63
602,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,He might depend upon a conscientious vote from honourable members returned as protectionists.,64
603,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If the honourable gentleman refers to me, I am here to do what I believe to be right. When I go before my constituents, it will be I , and not the honourable member for South Sydney, who will have to answer for mv actions. I hope that every vote that I have recorded on the Tariff will give my constituents as much satisfaction as the one which I intend to record on pianos. I do not take the same view of the manufacture of pianos and other musical instruments as I - do of the manufacture of boots - There is an artist's art put into the production of the tone of a piano. Honourable members would not contend that our people should not have the advantage of the musical compositions of great composers like Mendelssohn and Haydn. Mr To DOR - Coul d they not be played on an Australian piano?",64
604,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Our rising musical artists are sent to Germany and other countries abroad, to complete their musical studies, because it is admitted that in the older countries of the world the musical art has been brought to a higher state of perfection than in Australia. It is because I believe that there is an artist's art in the Atkinson, L . production of pianos that I say that if our people desire to have a piano with a tone which comes from Germany, we should not prohibit them from, having it.",64
605,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The honourable member should vote for pianos being admitted free.,64
606,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"That does not follow. I am prepared to give sufficient protection to enable the local manufacturer to pay decent wages to his employees, and derive a fair profit from the industry, but when I have done that, I say that, seeing that the production of the tone of a piano is the work of an artist, I ' have no right, by my vote, to prevent the people of Australia from being able to avail themselves of the best that artists can produce in the musical instrument line. The question has been debated at sufficient length,, and I suppose all the evidence that could be submitted on behalf of the importers, as well as of the - local manufacturer! has been placed before the Committee. I have read all - that has been published in connection with these duties, and have listened to every argument that has been submitted. I ""think I have given more attention to this item than to any other in the Tariff. I have looked in every corner for information, because I desired to give a conscientious vote upon this item. I believe that an increase of 5 per cent, in the duty under the General Tariff will make up to the local manufacturer for some slight increases in the duties imposed in connection with other items affecting his industry, will also be to some extent a bar against the importation of German pianos; will make the duty sufficiently high to enable the local manufacturer to continue his operations profitably, and at the same time give his employees the benefit of fair labour conditions.

611,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The Committee must understand that it is not for me to decide what duties can be collected under the paragraph as amended. That is a question for the Department. I have acput the amendments in the form in which' they have been submitted.,65

613,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Trea surer) [8.0] - I should like to know how paragraph A now stands as regards the fixed duties, and if there is any chance of their being operative for purposes of collection?",65
614,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It is not for me to AVES. interpret them. I might give an opinion, but that would not make it right or wrong. The item, so far as we have dealt with it, readsPianos, viz. :(A) Grand and Semi-grand (General Tariff), each £\f> 10s.. or ad val. 40 per cent., whichever rate returns the higher duty; and, on and after 12th Decem- ber, 1007, ad val., 30 per cent. ; (United Kingdom), each £ 1 5, or ad val. 30 per cent., whichever^ rate returns the higher duty; and, on and after 12th December, '1907, ad val. 25 per cent.",65
615,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Angas) [8.1] - There is no doubt that the paragraph as amended is a little ambiguous. That occurred to me at the time when the question was put; but if the suggestion I made last night had been followed, grammatically, there could have been no mistake. That was to put in after the word "" duty "" the words ""up to today,"" and then add "" and on and after,"" & c , the rates agreed upon. No doubt the paragraph is ambiguous as it stands, as it is not clear whether the new ad valorem duties refer only to the previously proposed 40 per cent, and 30 per cent., or to both the fixed duties and those ad valorem rates. We can clear the matter up in the Tariff Bill, which will be introduced in a few days. That Bill will have to be passed by this House before the Tariff can be sent to the Senate, because we cannot send resolutions up, but must send a Bill. The ambiguity could be easily explained now by a footnote, and, of course, in the meantime the Treasurer would act on the sense of the Committee, which is to collect only the ad valorem duties ",66
616,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"On former occasions, where a composite duty was proposed, and the Committee made an amendment, the course adopted was to add to the item words which in this case would read as follows:- "" and on and after izth December, 1907, A, grand and semi-grand, ad valorem (General Tariff), 30 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 25 per cent.""",66

618,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,There is no doubt about that. I promised to strike them out.,66
619,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The only question now is, whether the language used in the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Dailey achieves that object'. Before we leave the paragraph, the Minister should make it clear that the specific duties only operate up till today, and that after to-dav the ad. valorem rates agreed upon by the Committee prevail. The matter should not be left in uncertainty, to be cleared up later on in a Bill.",66
620,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Trea sureri [8.6] - I directed attention to the wording of the item as amended, because I had some doubt as to its effect. I was going to move to strike out the fixed duties, but the Committee carried the amendment in the form submitted by the honourable member for Dalley. In order to make the matter absolutely clear, ' the Chairman might indicate in some .way, by a footnote or asterisk, what the Committee meant, or allow the Committee to go back in order to strike out the fixed rates. Whichever course the Chairman thinks advisable, I shall be glad to adopt.",66
621,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I understand that the Committee was desirous of amending the paragraph in the form previously adopted in similar cases; but, that, owing to the amendment having been put in the way in which it now stands, there is some doubt as to its effect.

623,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Angas) [8.9] - I am sorry that the Treasurer could not see his way to propose a lower/ scale of duties for this class of piano. It is not the expensive class that we have just dealt with. That is evidenced by the fact that the Government originally proposed the much lower specific duty of £ 5 10s., as against a specific duty of )£i6 10s. on grands and semi-grands.",66
624,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The same ad valorem rates were proposed.,66
625,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"But the specific duties would have been the operative ones, because the Customs Act obliges the Minister as far as possible to levy the higher duty.",66
626,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Why have another debate about it?,66
627,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I rose merely to suggest that, inasmuch as these are the pianos that will be bought by people of moderate incomes, and as we were only beaten .by one vote in our effort to obtain duties of 25 per cent, and 20 per cent, on the last paragraph, it would be more gracious and agreeable to the hallowed time upon which we are just entering if the Treasurer would agree to those rates in this paragraph.",66
628,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Hume-Trea surer) [8.10] - I am terminating the specific duties in this paragraph, and the ad valorem rates will have the same effect upon the one class of piano as upon the other, because the duties will be levied according to value. I hope, therefore, that the honourable ' member w ' l l not press his request, because it would be very invidious to make a distinction, and there is no doubt that if I were to reduce the ad valorem rates upon these very.cheap pianos it would make them still more liable to be imported. I am proposing the same proportion as was agreed to in the last paragraph. I take it that the decision of the Committee on paragraph A was meant to apply to the whole of this item, and therefore I am moving the duties down to that level.",67
629,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Coolgardie) [8.11] - Be fore the Treasurer goes further, he ought to inform the Committee what he proposes to do regarding the outside cases of pianos.",67
630,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I could not with that matter now.,67
631,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The Treasurer could give some indication now of what he intends to propose, because according to my information the duty upon the outside cases means an addition of practically 5 per cent, to the duties upon pianos.",67
632,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,It is the same in this case as in that of every other article.,67
633,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Not to the same extent, but whether it is worse or better I shall ask the Minister to express his intention now. I shall not be bullied or put off by anybody here. A good deal of claptrap is being talked about people who vote against these duties wishing to strike at Australian industries. I have as much regard for Australian industries as have those who talk in that way-perhap s a little more. There is a good deal of lip service in this chamber, as in other places. think that it is the people who parade their loyalty at all times that are the most loyal. In the same way, those who talk loudest about safeguarding and standing up for Australian industries are perhaps not the people who on all occasions do the most for those industries. going to stand here until the Treasurer is prepared to announce what he intends to do about the duty on the outside cases. If he thinks he is going to get this item through without our having some understanding about that matter, he is making a mistake. If the cases are to be taxed, it will mean that instead of agreeing to a duty of 30 per cent, we shall really be sanctioning a duty of 35 per cent. I wish to be courteous to the Treasurer, as I ""have been throughout the Tariff, but I think that I am making a fair and reasonable request. He ought to tell us his intention now, because if the duty on the cases is not re1 moved, it will mean a considerable addition to the cost price of importations. In order that the Treasurer may have an opportunity of making an announcement, I will resume my seat.",67
634,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Bendigo) [8.14] The question of outside packages is dealt with in item 444, by which outside packages on' fixed duty goods are free, whilst those on ad valorem goods are dutiable. The general rule in the case of ad valorem goods is that the basis of valuation shall be the whole of the consignment, that is, the contents as well as the package. But I suggest to the honourable member that the most convenient course would be to deal deal with this matter when we are on the item of packages generally, and when their treatment may be made uniform.",67
635,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The Committee might be influenced in regard to this item by the way in which packages are' dealt with.,67
636,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I apprehend that the Minister will stand by the arrangement that outside packages in the case of ad valorem - goods shall remain dutiable.,67
637,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Grampians) [8.16] - I think the Treasurer might answer the question which has been put to him by the honourable member for Coolgardie. We had a discussion on the question of outside packages when bottles and other glassware were being considered, and a statement from the Treasurer now would expedite business. I do not Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer [8.17] - It is scarcely fair to ask me to answer a question of this kind before we reach item 444. Hitherto the practice has been to admit free the outside packages of goods subject, to fixed duties, but to charge on packages containing ad valorem goods; I am and there seems to be a good deal of reason for adopting that method. If I were asked the question at the presentmoment, I should be inclined to stand by the proposal as it is ; and, in any case, the ad valorem' duty on the outside package of a piano will not be a heavy charge.",67
638,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,It means an additional 5 per cent.,68
639,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"My feeling is to deal with this matter as proposed in item 444. A specific duty is sufficient to cover the whole, but that is not so in the case of an ad valorem duty.",68
640,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It will mean a 35 per cent, duty instead of a 30 per cent, duty on pianos.",68
641,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I do not think so, but I shall make inquiries before we reach item 444; and, if sufficient reason be shown, I may be induced to make an alteration.",68
642,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Parramatta) [8.19] - I think that the honourable member for .Coolgardie very opportunely raises the question before this item is disposed of. As already pointed out, if the outside packages are taxed, it will mean an increase 'in the duty by 5 per cent.; and, moreover, to tax packages in the case of pianos will be a new departure.",68
643,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The taxation has applied all through this Tariff.,68
644,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I am speaking of the old Tariff wherein packages in which goods are ordinarily imported were, when containing such goods, free. There was a special exemption inserted for the purpose, and there ought to be a similar exemption in the present Tariff, because it seems the height of absurdity to impose a duty on packages.",68
645,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Why differentiate tween pianos and other goods?,68
646,Mr TOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Because there was a differentiation in the old Tariff.,68
647,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I do not think that that exemption applied to pianos only.,68
648,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I do not object to the exemption being applied to other goods; on the other hand, I think it ought to be applied. I understood that, when we obliterated this duty .in reference to the cubic contents of packages containing glassware and so forth, it was intended to free all outside packages.",68

657,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Flinders) [8.22]. - I should like to point out the difficulty there is in the. amendment which has been moved. It seems to me that the only logical and consistent way to deal with this question is under item 444. One of the difficulties of dealing with it now is that, if the proposed amendment be carried, it will necessarily mean that in the case of paragraph A, which we have already passed, the outside packages must be taxed. That will not only have the effect of singling out paragraph B for special treatment, but will practically mean that two different rates must be charged right throughout the Tariff. We shall expedite business by allowing the whole discussion to take place on item 444; and the fact that the Committee has strongly indicated be the opinion that packages should be free, whether the goods be subject to ad valorem or fixed duties, will be a strong argument against the imposition of such duties.",68
658,Mr TOSEFH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Parramatta) [8.24] - I am quite aware of the anomaly that may be created; but my idea is, if the amendment be carried, to regard it as a test vote, instructing the Government to make a similar amendment in regard to other items.",68

661,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The Minister has made a statement.,68
662,Mr TOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The Minister has said that he does not know what he is going to do.,68

664,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Honourable - members will be prepared, I take it , to - vote on these pianos the same duties that they voted on the other kind of pianos, if it is understood that packages are f r e e; - otherwise some of us will make an endeavour to reduce the duty by so much.",69
665,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Then , as the honourable member for Flinders has pointed OUL, the duty on the two classes of pianos will be unequal.",69
666,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That inequality may easily be corrected afterwards.,69

668,Mr TOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If outside packages are to be made dutiable, it will that the duties on pianos will not be per cent, and 25 per cent., but 35 per cent, and 30 per cent.",69
669,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I do not think that the duties will be anything like that.,69
670,Mr TOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Can the Treathe basis of calculation. surer tell me what is the cost of an side package for a piano?,69

679,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I do not think I am called upon to do so now. I have told the honourable member that I shall make furof ther inquiries, and be prepared to say what the Government will do when we reach item 444.",69

681,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"But if a duty be placed on the packages, it will increase the duties which have already been voted on pianos.",69
682,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,And so it w i ll be with everything else.,69
683,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"But I take it that when we vote a duty of 30 per cent, we do not desire to see a duty of 35 per cent. collected. I have just been informed that the cost of packages for pianos varies from 27s. to 50s., plus 10 per cent.; and I think we ought to know definitely what cluties we are voting.",69
684,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"South Sydney) [8.28] mean When there is an ad valorem duty, I do 30 not see how honourable members can object to including the cost of the package. . The theory underlying ad valorem duties, I understand, is that the value of the goods landed on the wharf in Australia must be The value of outgoods in Timbuctoo or elsewhere, before they are cased and got ready for export, is not the value when they arrive in Australia. Although the principle is that the think it is value of the goods landed in Australia is the value for the purposes of the duty, the Department, for convenience sake, accepts foreign invoices, and imposes an all round charge for freight and so forth. cost That plan in some cases works harshly, though in other cases the importers are let When people talk of a duty of 35 per cent, or 20 per cent, they invariably have in their mind the value beof the goods when they come into Auscould tralia; and, as the goods cannot be brought here without packages, it stands to reason that the value of the packages must be included for the purposes of the Tariff. was Only the other day I was talking to a merchant in Sydney in regard to the system ; of admitting packages containing goods He said that while he was disinwhat clined to pay a duty upon packages, the system of levying duty upon them was distinctly in favour of honest trade. He said that there was a disposition on the part small manufacturers in other portions of the ""world to inflate the charge for cases, and to reduce the cost of the goods which they contained. I do not say that a large proportion of outside manufacturers do that, but this merchant assured me that some of them do it . He expressed the opinion that from the stand-point of fair trade, it was better to charge a duty upon the packages. But I do not see why we should differentiate between the packages in which pianos are encased and other packages. We have already decided that a specific duty shall be levied upon bottles which are imported full of spirit. The reason why an ad' valorem duty was not applied to packages under the old Tariff was that their contents bore a specific duty. In regard to bottles, a difficulty was experienced, because nearly all of them are imported full of spirit. But, in respect of any item which bears an ad valorem rate, no difficulty need be experienced. The interjection . of the honourable member for Bass, - wh o as an importer has a good knowledge of business-to the effect that if we allow any packages to be admitted free, we shall open the door to the possibility of the Customs authorities being deceived, and of the fair trader being subjected to unfair competition, has considerable weight with me.",69
685,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I should like know how that result could be brought about?,70
686,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I thought that I had already explained. It is merely tion of the manufacturer placing a fictitious value on the cases because they would exempt from duty, and of undervaluing sons the goods in them, which would be subject venue. to duty.",70
687,Mr TILLEY BROWN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Who could that ?,70
688,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It is the easiest thing done so. in the world. Let us suppose that a manufacturer in another part of the world charged .£100 for a certain line and that the cost of encasing them amounted t 0 £,SBy representing the cost of the casing at £ 2 0 , the importer quired to pay duty upon only £ 8 0 worth of goods.",70

693,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I prefer to accept the statement of men of experience in the importing line, who say that to their knowledge it has been done, to that of the honourable member. The difficulty in regard to piano cases is that persons in other parts of the world place a certain value upon them, and we have no means of checking it. We practically have to accept their statement in the invoice. If honourable members care to run that risk, and to subject the honest trader to a disadvantage, they are entitled to do so. But, in my opinion, it is wise to charge duty upon the cases as well as upon the pianos, even if . by so doing, we have to accept a lower duty upon the instruments themselves than we should otherwise have to accept. Personally, I should prefer to accept a lower duty upon goods by about 2 per cent.,1 than to exempt packages in respect, of any form of merchandise.

The validity of the collection of the duty may be challenged by certain merchants, not because it is being levied under resolution, but because section 154 of the Customs Act provides for the levying of duties upon goods, which are defined as separate from packages. There is nothing in the Tariff which says"" that packages shall be subject to duty; there is only the declaration that outside packages in which goods other than those dutiable ad valorem are ordinarily imported shall be admitted free. That declaration does not impose a duty on other packages, it being an incontrovertible rule of law that the ject is not to be taxed except by express words. If it is doubtful under which of two headings an article shall be taxed, it is, according to the Customs Act, dutiable at the higher rate.

745,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Discus s the question on item 444. It is not fair to bring it up now.,73
746,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It may be too late to bring it up on item 444. A duty of [259]- 2 16s. 6d. on a piano case cannot be advocated in the interests of local makers. Pianos must be imported in cases, and it will not be argued that cases can be made here and sent to Germany. Therefore, the duty must be regarded merely as an attempt to increase the protection granted to the local manufacturer of pianos - It might as well have been said that the proposal to take the duty off casks was an attack on coopers. In my electorate there are very large cooperages, but I did not advocate then that a duty should be placed on casks in order to help the coopers. Now that the duty on pianos has been settled, there will be a rush to take them out of bond, and the cases, which, under normal conditions, can be bought for a few shillings, will be thrown at the Treasurer in about a week. I see no reason to vote for a duty of 30 per cent, on £ 2 ios., the cost of the case, subjust as if it were a piano. From a protectionist stand-point, I see no justification for the tax. It is only a roundabout way of increasing the duty on the piano. My high-water mark of protection for pianos was 30 and 25 per cent., according to the country of origin, and I am not going to be seduced into voting for higher protection to piano manufacturers by means of a duty on cases.",73

749,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"In my opinion, the proper course is to deal with this question on item 444. I do not think it is a correct charge to make on the cases. I know that it has been abused, and, although persons who have made that statement have been accused of being thieves, I may tell the Committee that when I commenced business as a young man offers of that description were made to me, but they saw that I was not a man of that kind. I 'knew it was wrong, and, therefore, I did not do what they wished. Yet, because I know that it is done, an honourable member has said that a man who makes a statement of that kind has been a thief, or he would not know that it is done.",73
750,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I was referring to the informant of the honourable member for South Svdney.,73
751,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable member was not aware that I had told that honourable gentleman; he did not know the name of the informant, but if he thinks that I am a thief, I shall not take any notice of .it.",73
752,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Coolgardie) [9-3]-understood the honourable member for South Sydney to say that it was a Sydney merchant who gave him that information. I certainly never understood that it came from the honourable member for Bass, and I think that even now he must be making a mistake. But if he thinks that I have said anything that is calculated, even by inference, to give offence to him, I unreservedly withdraw it, and apologize to him.",74
753,Mr STPRRER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I take no notice of it .,74
754,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Corangamite) [9.4] The honourable member for Bass has said that no'attempt has been made to deal with this question on other items. I may tell him that on an early item I raised the question, and proposed that where the contents of the case should exceed the value of the case, it should be free, and that applies particularly to piano pases. The Treasurer should give an indication to the Committee that he is prepared to consider this proposal favourably when we get to item 444. I have no particular desire to deal with it now.",74
755,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Le t us wait until we get to that item.,74
756,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If we adopt that suggestion, we may find ourselves in a peculiar position. I believe that there is a majority of honourable members against the imposition of a duty on cases. Sir WILLIAM * LVNE - If there is I wil l be quite prepared to submit to the decision of the Committee. I am not quite sure what course I will take with regard to item 444.",74
757,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If the honourable member for Parramatta persists with his amendment, and we take a vote, some honourable members, thinking that it ought to be dealt with in connection with item 444, may vote against it now, and when we came to that item piano cases would still be made dutiable. That would be an unfortunate position in which to find ourselves.",74
758,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,It would be a very proper thing after this waste of time.,74
759,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I think that the honourable gentleman is not right in making that remark.,74
760,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I think that this is an unpardonable waste of time.,74
761,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I entirely disagree with the Prime Minister. This is a matter of very considerable moment, and if he were engaged in the piano trade he would hold a. different view 1",74
762,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,He is here very little.,74
763,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Le t him hold his tongue.,74
764,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I protest against this unpardonable waste of time.,74
765,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The time has come for the Prime Minister to behave himself with decency in the Chamber ,74
766,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I must ask honourable members to cease this continuous crossfiring.,74
767,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Wit h all respect, I think that the Prime Minister is talking nonsense, because this is a matter of very great importance to those who are connected with the piano trade.",74
768,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,But there is an item on which it can be dealt with.,74
769,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,We have an indication from the Treasurer that at the present moment his feeling is that he will tax .these cases.,74
770,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The Committee will , decide when item 444 is reached.",74
771,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Does not'the honourable member see that this charge affects the duty on a piano to the extent of from 5 to 7^ per cent. ?,74
772,Mr WISE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Le t us settle the matter by a vote.,74
773,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I want to have a fair thing done for the piano importers and also the purchasers. It affects them all. When we are proposing to put duties of 30 and 25 per cent, on upright pianos, why should the Treasurer try by a side-wind to increase the duties to the extent of from 5 to 7 per cent.? The L honourable member for Coolgardie was justified in drawing his attention to this important matter. And the honourable member for* Parramatta was justified in moving his amendment. The Treasurer would have facilitated business if he had given the Committee a fairly clear indication as to what he intended to do I think that the whole question should be dealt with on item 444. At the same time, we want the Treasurer to indicate how the cases are to be dealt with before we record our votes on this item of pianos. He must see that if he would only give an answer to our inquiries the business would be proceeded with, and a vote taken as ouicklv as Dossible. I have no wish to delay business for a moment.",74
774,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I ask leave to'with draw my amendment.,74
775,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Coolgardie) [9.10] - I desire to say a few words before the amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta is withdrawn. I am not going to sit here silently under the taunt that we have been wasting time in discussing this matter. The honourable gentleman who made that interjection is in this chamber so little that he is not in a position to say when the Committee is or is not wasting time. mind the Committee that a whole dav was practically wasted over the item of printing ink, when, if the Government had understood what they ought to have comprehended,, a small amendment would have solved the whole difficulty. Instead of occupying an hour on the item, as we have over this matter, nearly a whole sitting was wasted. I reiterate that we have no right to impose this high duty by a side-wind - If it is tended to charge 35 per cent., let us have a .proposition to that effect; but if the duty is to be 30 per cent., let it be that rate and no more. The Treasurer knows quite well that, under the ad valorem system, the unfortunate importer pays duty as if the case were part of the piano. He knows further that piano cases are sold in this market at 4s. or 5s. each, although they cost the importer on an average £ 2 5s. In these circumstances, I think that the proposed charge j s hardly fair, and that the Treasurer might have given the Committee a more reassuring declaration as to his intention in regard to this item. Mr. JOSEPH .COOK (Parramatta) {9.12] - The Prime Minister has declared this to be a wicked waste of time. amendment would not have been moved but for the interruption of the honourable member for Riverina, who, when this matter was' being referred to, took a point of order to try to prevent even a mention of it . It was then that I said, "" I will put myself in order, sir, by moving an amendment, which I hand to you.""",75
776,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I think that the matter ought to be decided now.,75
777,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,No : I intend to standing ask leave to withdraw the amendment.,75
778,Mr WISE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The honourable member is afraid to take a vote now.,75
779,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Her e is an honindeed orable member going on in this way, and the sir. Prime Minister declaring it to be a wicked waste of time. What does he want ?",75
780,Mr WISE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,To take a vote.,75
781,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The honourable member recognises clearly enough that the vote would be against him.,75
782,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If the honourable member wastes more .time we shall get all the blame. Some honourable members on this side have urged that this question I reshould be dealt with on item 444. I remind them that that is the last item in the Tariff, and that honourable members are already going away.",75
783,Mr TILLEYBROWN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It wil l be rushed then, and that is why it is suggested.",75
784,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If it is not rushed, the extreme probability is that there will be a number of honourable members in- away without pairs when the vote is taken. However, fo save time, I ask leave to withdraw . the amendment . Amendment of the amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Mr TILLEY 'BROWN (Indi) [9-13] This question ought to be tested now, because, in my opinion, it is a deliberate attempt to increase the duty on pianos which has been passed.",75
785,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Order ! Do I understand that the honourable member intends to submit' an amendment?,75
786,Mr TILLEYBROWN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I do, sir. This proposal was apparently concocted during the dinner adjournment. We sat for five minutes longer than we ought to have done, and sat illegally, I am told. If the stateMy ment made by the deputy leader of the Opposition is correct, we must automatically suspend the sitting at half-past 6 o'clock.",75
787,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Order ! The honourable member is casting a reflection on the Chair, which he has ne right to do. There is no time definitely fixed for the suspension of the sitting to take place. If I so desired I could remain in the chair until 7 o'clock. It is merely a mutual underthat we suspend the sitting at 6.30 o'clock. Whatever was done after that hour was quite in order.",75
788,Mr TILLEYBROWN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I am very glad to have that explanation from you, An attempt is being made by a sidewind to increase the duties imposed on pianos by levying duty on the cases, and I think the matter should be tested now. Therefore I move That the amendment be amended by inserting alter the word "" U p r i i r h t "" the words ""except Cook, Joseph outside packages in which pianos are ordinarily imported when containing such goods."" ",75
789,Mr ARCHER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Capricornia) [9.15] This is undoubtedly an important matter, and I wish to remind honourable members that, in the past, the Government, and especially the Treasurer, have repeatedly expressed a willingness to give way when it has been clear that they could not secure what they wanted, but afterwards, at a late hour, when there has been a very sparse attendance of honourable members, and there has been a chance of forcing a thing through, they have changed their tactics. I had some experience of that treatment in connection with the item relating to ink. I have no hesitation in saying, from my knowledge of the Treasurer,' that if this matter is left over, at some later sitting, the Opposition will be squeezed out, and the honourable gentleman will. get his own way. We shall find that we cannot get pairs; we were - refused pairs today, I understand.",76
790,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,What is that?,76
791,Mr ARCHER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I understand that some honourable members on this side were refused.,76
792,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The member should speak about what he knows.,76
793,Mr ARCHER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I may be wrong.,76
794,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable member is wrong in this case. Mr .ARCHER - Then I withdraw that remark entirely. But we have had over and over again the experience which - I have described. I can quite understand why the Treasurer is refusing to give any indication of his intended action. No doubt, he hopes to get his own way at a late sitting. We have had experience of treatment of that kind, as I know to my cost in relation to the ink business. I sincerely hope that the opinion of the Committee will be registered when there is a full attendance.

When interrupted, I was expressing regret that I had been induced to make a certain promise.

816,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Yes .,77
817,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Dalley) [9.36] - This is avery wise provision to insert, and is similar to that which we have inserted in regard to the importation of vehicles.

818,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Robertson) [9-371-- I do not think that the insertion of the words "" under departmental by-laws "" will accomplish the object which the Treasurer has in view. A person might import separate parts in several different shipments, and in that way, bring in , at the lower duty, a complete piano. To avoid that being done, it will be necessary to keep a record of the importations of different firms.",77

The Geelong Harbor Trust had a very unhappy experience in the case of two second hand dredges which they bought at Natal. Unfortunately for those on board, those vessels never reached here. I hope the Treasurer will be able to include dredges in this item, so as to give work for some of our workmen. I hope the honourable member for Dalley will object, on behalf of the ship-builders in his electorate, to the dumping hand boats here.",80
845,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Dalley) [10.8] - The Treasurer, as a protectionist, should be very careful not to give protection to the outside world instead of to his own country. The principal launches imported are motor launches, the building of which is a great speciality in New South Wales. They are made by a firm whose main business is in my electorate, but this work is done by them in the electorates of the honourable members for Parramatta and North Sydney. Although the Treasurer has accepted the suggestion of the honourable member for North Svdney for a preferential rate, I would rather see the duty remain at 20 per cent, all round.",80
846,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The Tariff Commission recommended 20 per cent., and I think we shall have to stick to that.",80
847,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Twent y per cent, means an increase of only 5 per cent, on the duty in the old Tariff. Engine-fittings, which have to be imported for these vessels, are dutiable now at a certain rate, and why should we allow the finished article in the shape of the vessel itself to come in at a lower duty? Even a duty of 20 per cent, is low.",80
848,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Robertson) [1.0.9] - No case has been made out in favour of this duty. Launches take up a great deal of room on shipboard, the charge for freight is by measurement, and that makes imported launches very expensive. It is to the advantage of Australian builder's of launches to have samples occasionally of the best work of the kind from America, where the industry is very advanced. I hope the duty will not be [REPRESENTATIVES.] (Boats dsc). made prohibitive. As the freight is so high, we are not likely to be inundated with imported launches.",80
849,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"North Sydney) [10.10] - Unde r the old 15 per cent, duty, only £1,446 worth of launches were imported last year. During that period, I know that hundreds have been constructed in Australia, a very large number in my electorate. The figures show that there is no danger to the local builders of undue competition from abroad, and in those circumstances the Treasurer could safely take the course to which he assented just now.",80
850,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I did assent for the moment, but,, on consideration, I think I of second- will withdraw that assent.",80
851,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"What I ask for will be, at any rate, some preference to Great Britain on an item where a preference should be offered. If the Treasurer sees reason to depart from what he said, I am not desirous of holding him to his impetuous statement, but there is no fear of the concession injuring the Australian industry. This is a special line, which Great Britain can produce, and it looks curious that we should, not give her a preference.",80
852,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"We can give her a preference by agreeing to rates of 30 and 25 per cent, respectively.",80
853,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I do not care about that sort of preference. If the Treasurer objects to it, I will not press my amendment to a division.",80
854,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Melbourne Ports) [10.13] - Will the Treasurer make any proposal on this item to stop the importation of dredges by public bodies? If any one ought to support local industries, the members of public bodies should do so. In Victoria, where the settled policy of the people is protection, a number of men who take public positions on bodies like the Harbor Trust and the Metropolitan Board of Works import all they can when* they get the opportunity, especially dredges, which could well come under this item. Sir WILLIAM. LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [10.14] - I should like very much to deal with dredges, but I am afraid the debate which would result would be too long. Another important reason why we should hesitate before taking a step of that kind is that the duty would affect public bodies, and raise the question of taxing their importations. I do not think the imposition of a duty of that kind would be very popular with the States. We should not allow that consideration, of course, to be paramount, but I should hesitate before making - at this stage a proposal which would give rise to a long debate, even if we could get it through at all.",80
855,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"In order to save debate, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Item agreed to. Item 390 (Oars and skulls); item 391 {Carpet sweepers, &c.); item 392 (Brushes); and item 393 (Coke), agreed to. Item 304. Manures, free.",81
856,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Riverina) [10.17] understand .that the Treasurer intends to propose to impose <a duty on manures.,81
857,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Manures are not an Ausbut tralian production. . Mr CHANTER - I can assure the well ask honourable member that the production of mittee manures is an Australian industry, in which ^1,000,000 has been invested in plant New South Wales alone, and in which, in the same State, ^100,000 a year is paid in wages. Those who have invested their capital are penalized to the extent that have to pay duty on the bags they use, whereas Japanese manures, bags included, iire admitted free.",81

Sulphur is the basis of this artificial manure, and has to be imported from Japan.",81
860,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,A good deal imported from Sicily.,81
861,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The information given to me in reference to this industry I have verified, as far as possible, by my own observation. Those interested in the enterprise have to compete with manufacturers abroad, who employ low-paid coloured labour, and send the product here in foreign ships manned by coloured men.",81
862,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Any duty will fall upon the Australian farmers.,81
863,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"In reply, I may point out that the Australian farmers, whose interests I have the greatest, regard, were at one time called upon to pay £ 6 and upwards a ton for their artificial manures, but now, in consequence of the competition caused by local production, they are supplied at £ 4 5s. and £ 4 ios. per ton.",81
864,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The price has been reduced all over the world.,81
865,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable member must not tell me that, because I have been engaged in farming, and speak with some knowledge. In consequence of the internal competition, Australian fanners are now getting an article equal, if not superior, in quality to imported manures, at a reduced price.",81
866,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Muc h of the imported - I manure has been proved defective.,81
867,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I know from the farmers to which firm they give preference, I am now merely treating the question in a general way. The Treasurer might the Committee, and the Commight well agree, to impose duties of, say, 15 per cent, and 10 per cent., in order to give the Australian manufacturers m some little advantage over their Japanese competitor. It is true that very little of this manure is from Great Britain, but still a preference might be given in the Tariff. they ' The Australian manufacturer has to pay Australian rates of wages and observe Australian conditions, and it would only be an act of justice to afford the protection I",81
868,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Dalley) [10.24] - Thes e were free under the old Tariff, both sections of the Tariff Commission recommended that they should be free, and they appear as free in the Tariff now under The phosphates, which are the find main component, come from Ocean Island, off the north-east coast of Australia, where there is estimated to be something like 12,000,000 tons in natural formation. is These phosphates are brought to Australia, and here treated with sulphuric acid, which , is produced from imported sulphur.",81
869,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Some sulphur is obtained from Tasmania.,81
870,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Quite so. Many of theworkmen, to whom the honourable member for Riverina refers, are employed in turning seathese phosphates into superphosphates; and it would be protection run mad to impose a duty on an article every ton. of which means additional wealth to the whole of the continent. Surelv the Treasurer will not for abandon the proposal he has made in this Tariff. Any one can see the farce of suggesting' a preference to the United Kingdom, which imports manures from other parts of"" the world; and if a man were inclined to be a protectionist, such an extreme proposal as that suggested by the honourable member for Riverina would cause him to t tllcC £ll ELI m",81
871,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Hindmarsh) [10.25]. - I join with the honourable member for Riverina in asking the Treasurer to put a duty on manures. If I thought that the farmers would be penalized in any way I should not advocate a duty, but the experience in South Australia is quite to the opposite effect. In that State some years ago the whole of the manures used were imported, and the importers, having the field to themselves, charged £ l per ton. This price was so excessive that the Labour Party urged the State Government to do as had previously been done in the case of wire netting-which, - by the way, was being imported at ,£5 or £ 6 below the price charged to the farmers-and import a shipment of manures. The importers at once came to the Government and said, "" If you will not import manures, we will agree to reduce our prices to £ $ 7s "" ; and from this it will be seen that they had not only been leaving themselves a large margin of profit, but had actually been robbing the farmers. The imported manures were so badly adulterated that, again, Parliament had to step in ; and I assisted to pass a Bill in the State Parliament in order to secure the puritv of the article. Then it was discovered that there are plenty of phosphates in Australia. Tn addition to the plant mentioned by the honourable member for Riverina, there is one at Port Adelaide; but I am assured that the New South Wales plant, alone is capable, with the local phosphates, of supplying all the manures required in Australia. The price has been reduced to £ 4 Ss. per ton, and that reduction is due entirely to the operation of the local mills. I feel certain that if we destroy the competition caused by the Australian industry we shall revert to' the old conditions. I have no doubt that in some of the States, - where there is no preventive legislation, the farmers are suffering from adulteration just as the South Australian farmers suffered. The Treasurer, I think, will admit that it would be only fair to impose a small duty for the encouragement of an industry ""capable of supplying the requirements of Australia - at a fair price. Honourable members who oppose such a duty do so. simply because they have not gone into the matter, and do not know the facts of the case.",82
872,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Melbourne Ports) [10.28] - No one can contend .that these manures cannot be locally produced in sufficient quantities, seeing that there are manufacturers sufficiently numerous to turn out more manures than are required in Australia. In 1902 the price was £4. 15s., and now it is £ \ 5s.; and this is due to the fact that the industry has been started in Australia. The honourable member for Indi, and the honourable member for Grampians, both being Victorian members, know how,- some few years ago, the imported manures were proved to have dropped below the previous standard. Seeing that we can produce a good article, and that our manufacturers have to pay a duty upon their bags",82
873,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The error of levying a duty upon their bags was pointed out when the item was under consideration.,82
874,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"But I may tell the honourable member that I believe in extending protection to the bag-makers as well as to the manufacturers of manure. I trust that the Treasurer will agree to the imposition of a duty of 15 per cent, or 10 per cent, upon this commodity.",82
875,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Robertson) [10.32] - I am very much surprised to find some representatives of the poorer States of the Commonwealth advocating a proposal to make manures more expensive. In South Australia the use of concentrating manures has revolutionized the farming industry. I speak of that State specially because it is a lean State notwithstanding that it.covers such a vast area. If millions of tons of manures were accessible to the farmers of South Australia at a cheap rate, it would become one of our greatest States. I have been told that since the farmers there have - been using concentrated manures they have been enabled to make land remunerative which previously would not payfor ploughing. The effect of imposing a duty upon this item must inevitably be to make manures more expensive. In my opinion they are already expensive enough, seeing that the best kinds range in value up to £ 6 and £-} a ton. We know that in the past the sale of manures was characterized by a great deal of fraud. But there is fraud in every department of trade.  dors of manures were the biggest sinners.",82
876,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"In the more enlightened States, however, legislation has been enacted under which the purchaser of any manure may have a sample of it analyzed, and if ' it is not up to standard the vendor may be punished. To a large extent this legislation has checked the evil which was previously rampant. scarcely point out that within thirty miles of Sydney there is to be found land which is not worth 5s. per acre, but which by the use of manures can be made worth ^ 1 0 per acre. I shall vote against the proposal to levy a duty upon this commodity, because I know that it would have to'be paid by the farmer.  astonished that a proposition has been submitted to increase the price of manures.",83

It is quite true-as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Robertson-^that in South Australia we had to enact legislation to prevent the adulteration of manures. But who were the worse offenders in that connection? Undoubtedly they were some-of the local vendors, who were actually digging up soil upon the adiacent islands and selling it as manure. The use of manures has brought under cultivation hundreds of thousands' of acres which were previously regarded as worthless.",83
878,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"In some cases it has increased the value of land threefold.  under this Tariff the farmer is already called upon to pay more than his fair share of taxation. I am astonished that the honourable member for Riverina, who is a farmers' representative, should endeavour to penalize that class more than it has already teen penalized. What benefit will the farmer derive from this Tariff? He has to compete in the markets of the world, and he cannot work eight hour's a day.",83

There are many large phosphate deposits in South Australia, and, in fact, in my district, and where ever there is an indication of the presence of superphosphate there are persons ready to enter into agreements with-the farmers for the right of mining for it. If I were to study my interests as a member, I might favour a duty on superphosphates, because a good many persons in my district are making these into manure, and the price paid for the raw material depends, not only on its quality, but also upon the price obtained f b r the manure made from it . Some persons have asked me to support a duty, but I do not feel disposed to do so, especially in view of the splendid results which have followed the use of superphosphates in South Australia.

I think there is some misapprehension as to the method of manufacture. phuric acid is made from pyrites and sulphur, which can be easily obtained in Japan, and is being sent down to Australia in considerable quantities as well as the superphosphates. The original proposal of the Government was - that these manures should be free; but representations have been made to the Treasurer that a labour question is involved, and he has very properly endeavoured to ascertain the feeling of the Committee. He has left himself in the hands of honourable members as to what course should be taken.  derstand that the position surer has been asked to agree to the imposition of a duty on chemical manures. has not definitely agreed. He is very properly waiting to ascertain what the num-. bers are. It is not often that I into the realm of prophecy, but I do venture to say that this question is great importance to the material welfare of the Commonwealth that any Government, which proposed to impose a duty which am might lead to a considerable increase price of what is an absolute necessity to producers would have a very short life. This is one of the matters which exemplify the great difficulty of arriving at anything like a scientific system of protection. Unthe farmer. doubtedly the men who are engaged in ducing chemical manures would, under strictly scientific protectionist Tariff, be enfor a longer period than I have. titled to their modicum of protection. is no getting away from that argument. But we cannot shut our eyes to the obvious, and it is utterly unreasonable to propose that we should tax a material well-being of the country in the interests of a comparatively few. It would be absoof lute suicide to do so.",87

The question has been raised several times as to that the whether the imposition of a duty decreases the price of an article. Because the prices of some commodities have been reduced it is argued that that is the result of protecThe com- tion, whereas the reduction of the prices of many articles has been simply due' to the improvement of mechanical contrivances. guar- Mr CHANTER (Riverina) [11.17] - I should like to reply to a few of the statements made by the honourable member for Grey and the honourable member for Barker.

The honourable member for Grey, I am sure,, will admit that he seems always to throw out a lenge to other representatives of the mers. I rose only for the purpose of what I conceived to be my duty. The orable member for Grey seems to think that if a duty be imposed upon any ticle the farmer has to pay for it. I take an entirely different view. I have always held that, if by the imposition on any articles used by the farmer its local manufacture is stimulated and competition created the farmer is benefited. I have proved that the manufacture of superphosopposite phates in Australia has resulted within last five years in the farmer securing at 35s. per ton less than he had to pay dustries. before. I feel, however, that if we allow things to remain as they are, the 800 men friend. now engaged in the industry in Australia will be driven out of it. Over £1,000,000 has been invested in the industry in three of the States, and last year £100,000 paid in wages. By penalizing the men employed in the industry we shall take money out of their pockets and put it the pockets of the importers. The object - free-trade is to place every one on even terms. It was proposed, not merely that-the tralian manufacturer should compete openly with the foreign manufacturer, but that he should be under penalties in having to pay the higher rates of wages, and work under disabilities which did not affect his foreign the competitor. Honourable members opposite further, and say that the article which I he requires as a package for the product he manufactures must pay a duty, whilst rethey are prepared to allow the manure and the package in which it is contained to be an unimported free from Japan.

996,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,And as the farmers',89
997,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"And as the farmers' friend. I have represented farmers for the last twentv-three years in the Parliament of was New South Wales and the Commonwealth Parliament. In spite of the efforts of honourable members opposite, with thousands of in pounds behind them to prevent my return, of the farmers have remained true to me. This is not merely a matter of theory with Ausme - I was' farming years ago before the establishment of the manufacturing industries, brought into being by the protective Tariff of Victoria,'and for the implements I used I had to pay 100 per cent, more than the price for which they can now be obtained in the Commonwealth. I admit the value of manures and superphosphates, and wherever I go I recommend their use to the farmers. I need not mention names, but I am aware that time after time, by analysis, farmers have discovered'that they have been imposed upon with rubbish in the shape of imported manures, and might just as well have put sand into the soil. Where the manufacture is carried out under local legislation and supervision, the farmer knows that he can get a pure article, which will increase his crop. He wishes that the Australian manufacturer of manure shall continue in existence, and if he were a member of this Committee he would be found assisting the Australian manufacturer to continue his competition against the foreign manufacturers of manures. If honourable members have made up their minds to protect the foreigner, the responsibility is theirs, and not mine.

998,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"North Sydney). [11.39] - If n e debate, I ask the Treasurer to state what his attitude is upon this item. I have no wish to detain the Committee, but I could show that some statements which have been made are not in accordance with the facts. The honourable member for Riverina has stated that there is £1,000,000 fixed investment in this industry in Australia. From personal knowledge, and also from sworn evidence given. before the Tariff Commission, I am in a position to say that that statement is an exaggeration.",90
999,Mr CHANTER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If the honourable member will not accept my statement, will he not accept the statement of the honourable member for Kooyong, who has asserted that there is more than £1,000,000 in this industry ? ",90
1000,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I will accept the statement of the honourable member for Kooyong that £90,000 is invested in his own works. We have the evidence, given before the Tariff Commission, of Mr. Elliott, of Elliott Brothers, of Sydney, one of the manufacturers of this article. He said the output was, roughly, as follows"" Cuming, Smith and Company, Melbourne, 30,000 tons ; Wischer, of Melbourne, 10,000 tons; Wallaroo Copper Smelting Company, of Wallaroo, South Australia, 10,000 tons; Explosives Company, of Braidwood, 4,000 tons; Adelaide Chemical Company-Cuming , Smith and Company-of Adelaide, 10,000 tons; and Elliott Brothers, of Sydney, 10,000 tons; 0 or a total of 74,000 tons."""" Mr Cuming, of Messrs. Cuming, Smith and Company, ' the largest manufacturers in Australia at the time of the giving of evidence before the Commission, was askedWhat capital is invested by these four firms in plant? And replied:- . I cannot speak for the others, but we have about ^100,000 invested in this way. Then, in reply to the questionCan you give us some idea of the extent of - the industry in Australia?He said I suppose that the works and plants in Victoria would have a capacity to produce 60,000 tons per annum. His firm produced, according to Mr. Elliott, half of that amount at that date. Their plant represents £100,000, and is one of the finest in Australia. Assuming that all the other plants cost another £100,000, that gives £200,000 for plant for - Victoria. The production wishes to curtail the outside Victoria, according to the evidence of Mr Elliott, was then about 15,000 tons.",90
1001,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The output in South Australia alone was 20,000 tons.",90
1002,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I see there is some discrepancy between Messrs Cuming, Smith's figures'and Mr Elliott's figures ",90

1004,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Then that 10,000 tons has to come off. But, taking 30,000 tons - as the production of l 'he £100,000 - plant, and allowing, say,, twice as much as the value of the plant for the whole of the rest of the .production, that would give £300,000, and, adding £90,000 for the works of the Mount Lyelt Company, as stated by the honourable member for Kooyong, we get a totalof £390,000, or, say, £400,000. That is giving an outside estimate. Therefore the statement that £1,000,000 is invested in plant and buildings in this country is much beyond the mark.",90

1028,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I am sorry to hear that interjection from an honourable member who professes to be a protectionist. Like the honourable member for Grey, I am speaking for those I represent, and in my electorate, there are two very large manure factories, together with two or three smaller ones. In spite of the fact that the local industry has brought down prices, we have honourable members who are wedded to free-trade refusing to give a chance of employment, and doing what they can to - stop the development of manufactures in Australia. If the farmers' representatives could see as far as the ends of their noses-, they would realise that if the local industry be crushed, the importers will at once raise prices. Here we have an industry that has not been fostered, at any rate, by the Commonwealth Parliament. We have been told by the honourable member for North Sydney that there is not £1,000,000 invested in the industry, and he has supported his statement with extracts from the evidence taken before the Tariff Commission. The honourable member forgets, however, that that evidence only related to the actual factories, and that, apart from the factories themselves, there is subsidiary employment, such as is afforded in bringing the material from Tasmania and other places. I should say that in reality there is more than £1,000,000 invested in the industry taken as a whole. I am determined to see that the honourable member for. Grey, in his blindness, does not damn and starve 500 or 600 men with their families in mv electorate; and I appeal to protectionists to support me. Of course, I do not expect support from honourable members who were returned in other States as protectionists, but who, when an opportunity is presented to foster industries in a way that would do the farmers no. harm, trot out all sorts of evidence they know is not correct. Never yet has an attempt been made to impose a duty on a manufactured commodity, but honourable members have voted against it because it did not in any way benefit their own electorates. I am not surprised at free-traders voting against such duties: but when we have the - honourable member for Boothby, who calls himself a protecbut who never casts a protectionist vote except for the benefit of his own electorate",92

May I say that some ten years ago I assisted considerably for two or three years in developing the manure industry in Australia. T took action in the direction of securing the payment of a bounty for 1 the discovery of phosphatic rock. No reason has been assigned for the imposition of a duty upon manures. No request has been made by those interested in the industry, and the fact that they did not take the trouble to appear before the Tariff Commission is pretty conclusive evidence that it is not in need of any adventitious aid. The fact is that for some years after the introduction of mineral manures into Australia the entire trade was in the hands of the foreigner. But with the establishment of the local industry, Australian manures have superseded imported manures.",92

1043,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It seems to me that when an honourable member proposes the imposition of a duty upon an article which appears in the free list, it is the business of the Treasurer to explain to the Committee the attitude of the Government towards it. Certainly such a course of action would tend to curtail debate. I see no reason why a duty should be levied upon manures. The local article is superseding the foreign article",93

We on this side, ought to give the members of the Opposition a dose of their own medicine.

I feel some anxiety in this regard, because cotton yarn is one of the raw materials of the woollen mills of Victoria. During the debate on the woollen items evidence was adduced that the woollen mills, more particularly in this State, largely import cotton yarn. The imposition of this duty may therefore seriously affect the woollen industry. The honourable member for Fremantle mentioned that the value of our imports of cotton yarn amounted in one year to over £70,000. Nearly the whole of that importation was consumed in Victoria.",96

The manufacturers of this cotton yarn are getting improved machinery, and as we have removed the duty that was imposed under the old Tariff on cotton piece goods, they might as well close their mills if we-do not give them some assistance in the-production of yarn.

I make this statement in deference to the request of the deputy leader of the Opposition, and if I did not say much in introducing the item it is because I feared that if I did so I might provoke a long debate. I hope that the reasons I have given for the introduce tion of the item are satisfactory to the honourable member. Mr. JOSEPH COOK [12.58 a.m.] - I want to know what effect the imposition of this duty is likely to have' upon the importation of cotton piece goods ? . Mr SINCLAIR - Cotto n piece goods are free.",96

If by that means hosiery manufacturers can get their cotton yarns in free, the difficulty will be got over. But if they have to pay 15 per cent, for any yarns they import, until the.Ipswich mill is ready to supply them, they will be in a worse position than the spinners of the yarn are in. The latter will get a protection of 15 per cent, and 10 per cent., while the manufacturers of hosiery-the made-up article - will get only 25 per cent, and 20 per cent., which will mean only a 10 per cent, margin, if they start on cotton hosiery.",97

It did so prior to the introduction of this Tariff. But any we industry created under this sixpenny duty would be unprofitable alike to the users of the cork and to the community. It is infinitely better that the corks should be cut in the country of origin. Even if a duty be levied upon this commodity, the bulk of the corks used in Australia will be imported. The proposal of the GoDevernment simply represents an endeavour per to provide employment which will have to At one time, there was a considerable duty upon operative in Victoria, and yet the amount of cutting done - locally was exceedingly small.

We do not produce corks in this country, and, according to.experts, we could not in any case, produce them within less than twenty to forty years. Although they have tried to produce corks commercially in America they have not succeeded. The corks supplied tojhe world come from Spain and the south of France. Under these circumstances a duty on corks is absurd, and I shall vote for the amendment.  New Zealand for twenty years they had a duty of 20 per cent on corks.

A restriction of the choice of fuses may possibly jeopardize the lives of many miners, and, for that reason, we should give special attention to this question.

1199,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If the Minister has given way to the request made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, he is not doing justice to the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, whose recommendations I am here to sustain. I am sorry ihat I agreed to help the Government to carry on late to-night if, as the result of late sittings, duties are to be reduced, without fair consideration, by the consent of the Treasurer. Quite a number of honourable members are prepared to support the recommendation of the Commission and the duties originally proposed.

The manufacture of fuse was exhaustively inquired into by the Commission, the protectionist section of which recommended a duty of id. per coil.

1202,Mr TILLEY BROWN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"They employ . thirty hands, consisting for the most part of women. am agreeable Sir JOHN QUICK - I am surprised that a representative of Victoria should attack a Victorian industry. The Commission was positively assured that the local factories had been struggling and fighting a'big trust, in the shape of Nobel and Company, which has thrown down the gauntlet, and has deliberately told the Australian manufacturers that it intends to have the whole of the Australian market or nothing. They have cut prices so low that the local factories have been unable to make the business pay ",103
1203,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,How does the honourable member reconcile that statement with the fact that they have raised the price by is. 6d. since the imposition of these duties?,103
1204,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"When the old Victorian duty was abolished Messrs. Nobel and Company reduced prices to such an extent that the local factories had to sell below the cost of production. Their representatives candidly admitted that they desired a duty to enable them to carry on their business. They frankly said that if the importers raised their prices to the extent of the duty imposed they would also be forced to do so, but that otherwise they would be unable to do so. The inference is irresistible that the importing firms first raised their prices and that the local manufacturers did likewise. After all, if they did they merely brought up the price to the normal level at which the local manufacturers were able to make both ends meet, whilst the Victorian Tariff was in operation. I would remind honourable members in the Labour Party that the two factories in Victoria are carried on under the Wages Board system, and are subject to periodical inspection by factory inspectors. They provide excellent accommodation for their employees, and extend to them the very best treatment. It is stated that they recognise the eight hours' system and pay good wa«es. The rates of wages paid here are much higher than those prevailing in England and on the Continent. We cannot expect the production of fuse any more than the production of any other commodity in Australia under Australian conditions to be as cheap as it is in England or on the Continent. If there has been a slight increase in the price-whic h I do not admit-it maybe justified by the fact that the local factories have to comply with the strict conditions imposed by the State industrial laws. For the safe conduct of mining operations, there can be no doubt that it is necessary that the best fuse should be used. I have in my hand a report from Mr Hake, the Chief Inspector of Explosives in Victoria, which was furnished to me specially, in order that I might read it to the Committee when this item came up for discussion. Amongst other things, he saysOne important advantage of a local fuse factory is that the fuse is manufactured and issued direct to the mines in a fresh condition, long storage and exposure to extreme variations of temperature being avoided.",103
1205,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That is an argument in favour of the consumption in Victoria of fuse manufactured in this State.,104
1206,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It is an argument in favour of its production in Victoria, where it can be transferred to other parts of the Commonwealth within a very short time after it has been manufactured, as against the importation of fuse manufactured abroad. Another argument used by Mr Hake is that the production of fuse should be promoted as one of the elements and features of national defence, .because, in all probability, on the outbreak of hostilities, fuse would be declared contraband of war, and oversea supplies would be liable to seizure. I use that as an argument to show that we should not allow these local fuse factories to be wiped out. The Tariff Commission had the assurance of the representative of the Bendigo factory, in which over £20,000 has been spent, that unless this duty were imposed in order to level up prices, the factory would have to be closed, and all the hands turned adrift.",104
1207,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,We have heard that statement about everv factory in Australia.,104
1208,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I would remind the honourable member for Corangamite that this is a Victorian industry.,104
1209,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Otherwis e we should not have this special pleading in support of it.,104
1210,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I have fought for industries in Western Australia, in Queensf land, and in the other States as well Victorian industries, and I feel that I am justified in fighting for this industry, which is thei only one specially identified with the Bendigo district. I shall think it very unfair if protectionist members of the Committee vote against this duty. As regards the price of fuse, I venture to say that if the local fuse factories were closed up, as I have every reason to believe they would be, as a result of the rejection of this duty, Nobel and Company, and. the continental fuse-makers, having a monopoly of the market, would charge the mining companies what they thought fit for their fuse, and the price, instead of being reduced, would go up. I say that since fuse has been manufactured in Australia the average price has gone down, and the mining community has harl the benefit of a better, as well as of a cheaper, fuse.",104
1211,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The price soon went up i.8d. a dozen after this Tariff was announced.,104
1212,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"It went up to a normal figure. Surely the honourable member does not desire that those employed in fuse factories in Australia should be sweated, or that the manufacturers should have to carry on the industry at a loss. They are carrying on at a loss at the present time.",104
1213,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,What increase upon the old duty does the honourable member propose? .,104
1214,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Unde r the Victorian Tariff the duty was i d . per coil. The Kingston Tariff when first introduced contained a proposal for the same duty. I think it would mean an increase of about 20 per cent. If this small duty is not agreed to for the protection ""of an industry in which over £20,000 has been expended on one factory at Bendigo and over £10,000 on another at Footscray, the probability is that those factories will be closed up, and the mining companies must take the consequences. I appeal to protectionists in the Committee not to desert me on this item. I. can appeal to labour members especially to support an industry which pays the very best wages. On this subject. I can quote from the report sent to me by Mr Hake, who visited the Bendigo factory. He saysI found on my first inspection that the factory was established on the right lines, and careu l ly conducted from the point of view of as for safety to the workpeople engaged in the factory. Improvements in the factory for the better safety of the workpeople have been gradually extended since 1890. Many of these, although not required under the Act, have been carried out by the proprietor on his own initiative and at his cost. In my opinion, the factory compares favourably with any fuse factory in the world both as regards precautions taken to prevent accidents and the general efficiency of the machinery.",104
1215,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,And this was done under free-trade.,105
1216,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Not at all. This factory was established under the Victorian Tariff of i d . per coil. Since its establishment Nobel and Company have appeared in the field in competition with the local factories, and they have proclaimed their deliberate design and intention to acquire a monopoly of the market for fuse in Australia. I warn the Committee, and mining members especially, that if this duty is reduced the disaster caused by the closing up of .the local factory will overtake ""them, and they will regret the day they voted against the proposal I make.",105

I thought that the duty proposed was rather high. I find that, as the honourable member for Bendigo has said, the duty under the Victorian Tariff was i d . per coil.of 24 feet. In Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia, fuse was free. In Tasmania there was a duty of 20 per cent, imposed, and in Western Australia the article was free.",105

After looking at the duties imposed under the States Tariffs, I thought that the duty proposed was a high duty. It may be that present conditions are different from those whichexisted when the States Tariffs were in operation, but I do not think the honourable member for Bendigo has been quite fair in blaming me for agreeing to a proposal which seemed to me to be a reasonable one. I was informed some hours ago that there would be a fight over the duty on fuse.",105
1225,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Who told the honourable gentleman that?,105
1226,Mr BOWDEN,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I did.,105
1227,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Is the honourable member for Nepean the boss of the Committee ?,105
1228,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I wish to tell the honourable member for Bendigo what happened, because I do not want him to feel that I deserted him in any way.",105
1229,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,It looked like it.,105
1230,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable member was not fair or just. I am not going to take that sort of statement from him. Whilst I thank him for helping the Government in the way that he has done, I will not submit quietly to attacks such as he made on me just now. I must have some discretion in the conduct of business.",105
1231,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Was the honourable member for Bendigo supporting you because he thought you were right, or merely because he thought he could get a concession for a Bendigo industry ?",105
1232,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I will not cast that reflection on the honourable member, but he should know that the honourable member for Barrier, the honourable member for Coolgardie, the honourable member for Nepean, and one or two other honourable members, came to me about this matter, and that caused me to ascertain what the duties had been in the past.",105
1233,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Did any protectionist member ask the honourable member to abandon this proposal?,105
1234,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I do not know not that he did; but I have to use my own discretion, and sometimes I must act particular State. quickly. I felt that the honourable member for Bendigo was very unfair to me.",106
1235,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I think the honordustry; able member was unfair to me.,106
1236,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If the honorsurprised able member had said a word to me about it, I should have known exactly what his views were.",106
1237,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I did not think it necessary to ask the Treasurer to support his own Tariff. Sir WILLIAM LYNE."" - I have of had several times to agree to rethe ductions, but in this particular case, when I found out that Victoria was the only State that had a duty of i d per coil, that one other State had a duty of 20 per cent., and that in the case of all others the article was free, I began to that this duty was high. I am quite pared to test the feeling of the Committee on a division. I regret the honourable memin ber for Bendigo has shown so much heat as to the action I took.",106
1238,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Fremantle) [2.22 a.m.]. There are many sides to this question, and the honourable member for Bendigo has made a great mistake in stating the case clone. This duty strikes a heavy blow at the mining industry. During 1906 1,2:14,206 coils of fuse were imported into Australia. A duty of i d . per coil on would have amounted to £5,000. Tariff Commission actually recommended duty on powder and tape, which are the principal raw materials from which fuse made.",106
1239,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,We recommended for the protection of other industries.,106
1240,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"There is no consistency in that attitude. If the Commission had recommended free powder to make cheap fuse, there would have been some sense it. But I fait to see how the Commission could,recommenda duty on powder and then expect the mining industry to get cheap fuse. Fuse of the very best qualify essential for mining. The chief mining Australia is not carried on in Victoria, in the other States. Why should in other States be taxed so that little fuse can be made in Victoria? proposition which the Treasurer has actionist cepted is sensible^ and, in the best interests of Australian mining, although, perhaps, altogether of Victoria, but we are here to legislate for Australia, and not for any",106
1241,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Hbdmarsh) [2.27 a.m.] - This is not a South Australian inbut I am entirely in accord with the honourable member for Bendigo. I am that the Minister has agreed to such a reduction. It is strange that honourable members calling themselves protectionists should be so anxious to destroy one of the best paid industries that we have. The honourable member for Fremantle said that the duty on the total imports last year would have meant £5,000. The object the Tariff is to allow people to escape duty by purchasing the local article.",106
1242,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The local article has . gone up by more than the duty proposed.,106
1243,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The honourable the member for Bendigo explained how that think happened. The Nobel Company has only prebeen doing what has been done in many other cases-dumpin g and undercutting, order to destroy the local industry, to secure the whole field to itself, and then put the price up to a much higher figure. If any honourable member can show that it is dangerous to use the fuse made by these two Australian factories, it will be an arguas he has ment for reducing the duty.",106
1244,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,It is very good fuse.,106
1245,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If we are able to that make good fuse, as the honourable member The says, the people of Australia ought to use a that and no other. This is a well-paid industry. We have had too' few of that is kind, a large number paying good wages only under compulsion. I am prepared to give a fair measure of prothat tection to every well-paid industry. The Minister said that he gave way because there were no duties in the States, except in Victoria, and Tasmania. That is no argument at all. The in reason that there was no duty in anv of the other States except those named was that an impost would have been a handicap to the miners in those States. Under the is circumstances, it was thought better to of leave fuse free, so as to bring it but into competition with the fuse made we in the Old Country. I am prepared a to support the honourable member for The Bendigo; and I hope every good protecwill do the same. I have, without any protest, agreed to reductions that I thought altogether unjustifiable, in view of the evidence given before the Tariff Commission ; but this is a reduction to which I cannot consent. I hope the honourable member for Bendigo will adhere to the duties proposed in the Tariff.",106
1246,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Certainly ; I divide the Committee on the question.,107
1247,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Corio) [2.32 a.m.] - I think the attitude of the Treasurer towards the honourable member for Bendigo is very regrettable. The honourable member made a very proper request that this industry, being a Victorian industry, and in his constituency, should be considered.",107
1248,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The honourable member did not make that request to me.,107
1249,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"But the Treasurer replied as though the honourable member for Bendigo had made some improper demand when he objected to the extinction of this industry. On the other hand, when the honourable member for Kalgoorlie made a request, the Treasurer, in order to time, and himself some trouble, at once agreed to reduce the duty; and, in view the fact that the honourable gentleman did this without knowing anything of the Vicare torian industry, he deserves some blame.",107
1250,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I never expect anything but blame from the honourable member, rightly or wrongly !",107
1251,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"In this case, I think the Minister is rightly blamed. ask the reason for the Minister's attitude, we find that he has ascertained that before Federation, Victoria was practically the . Mr Frazer only Colony in which there was protection in this connection. It was because of protection that Victoria was the only Colony in which there was a fuse factory; 7s. per week and I am glad that the honourable member for Bendigo intends to divide the mittee on the question. We ought to remember that the wages paid in this indusmen, try in Victoria are double those paid in England; and that in itself is sufficient justification for a duty. Any one knows the methods of importers, and especially the Nobel Company, realise that, if the Victorian industry were extinguished, the mining industry, instead of would lose, because prices would be at once raised, with a view to wiping off losses caused by the local competition. The miners of Ballarat, Bendigo, Blackwood, and other places are only too glad to have this Victorian factory in operation, because it means to them better and cheaper fuse. As a matter of fact, this Australian infacture dustry, by means «of its safer product, is protection to the Australian miner; and it is most unfortunate that the Minister should agree so readily to a suggestion which may lead to its extinction. I trust that the honourable gentleman - will be convinced by the shall arguments of the honourable member for Bendigo, and, at least, agree to duties of i i d . and i d . "" Mr Frazer (Kalgoorlie) [2.36 a.m.]. - I am surprised at the debate which has followed the attempt of the Treasurer to do what is fair in reference to this item; also at the opinion which has been expressed that the extinction of the industry will follow a reduction of the duty. When this item was discussed on the passing of the last Tariff, Parliament distinctly refused to make this article dutiable; but the result has not been the wiping out ot . the industry. Sir JOH N QUICK - The evidence given before the Commission was that the indussave try has had a precarious existence.",107
1252,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Does the honourable of member suggest that those who conduct this industry have turned philanthropists, and carrying it on in the interests of the mining propositions of Australia! We know that if they were not making a profit they would not continue the enterprise. The honourable member for Corio has told us that this is one of the well-paid indusWhen we tries of the country.",107
1253,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"What I said was that the wages paid are double those in England. - I find from the Victorian Factories Inspector's report that of that the male employees, there is one at the magnificent wage of 5s. per week, three at",107
1254,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Does the honourable memComber sav that these employees are men?,107
1255,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I did not speak of but of males. However, I can give the ages of the employees if the honourable member insists. There is a boy of thirteen, who who ought to be at school, and he is paid' Ss. a week. There are three lads of fourteen years of age, who are in receipt of 7s. per week, and nine, of fifteen years, gaining, who get 9s. 6d. per week.",107
1256,Mr HUTCHISON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That is more than the women are paid in some factories.,107
1257,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If this is o>v\ of the well-paid industries of the Corm>-/nwealth, the Lord save us from the poor'iy-paid industries. In order to encoura^/:- the manuof fuse, it is proposed to levy a a tax of £ 6 , 0 0 0 per annum upon the mining industry, which does pay decent wages tc men. I find that there are fifty-nine males employed in the fuse industry at an average wage of 38s. i d . weekly. The wages of the females in the industry range from 9$. 6d. to 16s. 8d. Altogether, there are 171 hands engaged, at an average wage of £ 1 os. 8d. per week. I hold in my hand communications from the Secretary of the Miners' Union of Western Australia, and from the Chamber of Mines there, to the effect that, taking advantage of the increased duty proposed, Messrs. Bickford and Smith, of Bendigo, immediately increased the price of the locally-manufactured fuse from 4s. 6d. to 6s. per dozen coils. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [2.44 a.m.] - In reply to the honourable member's remarks, I merely wish to say that I have been informed by several honourable members that the course which I have adopted on the present occasion has had the effect of preventing fuse from being placed upon the free list.",107
1258,Mr COON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Batman) [2.45 a.m.] - I congratulate the honourable member for Kalgoorlie upon his excellent free-trade speech.,108
1259,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Congratulation s from the honourable member, are not a recommendation.",108
1260,Mr COON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The production of fuse is a Victorian industry. It was established here in 1871, when a 20 per cent, duty was operative. Before long, however, it was found necessary to substitute a specific duty of i d . per coil. What did the foreign manufacturer do? He clumped his inferior fuse into this State to such an extent that the Government found it necessary to increase the duty to l i d . per I should like honourable members to recall the number of accidents which resulted from the use of imported fuse at the period of which I am speaking. When the industry was first established in Victoria, the price of fuse was is. pen coil, but it has since been reduced to j d . per coil. A little while ago, tenders were called for the supply of fuse to the Broken Hill mines. What happened? Although the price of the imported article was 8s. 6d. per dozen coils, a firm at Footscray which tendered to supply the fuse at 6s. 4d. per dozen coils was beaten by an importing firm which desired to get hold of the market.",108
1261,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,What was the name of the importing firm?,108
1262,Mr COON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I do not know. In Gerthat manv. the duty upon fuse is is. 4d. per dozen coils, and in the United States.it is 30 per cent. I regret that the Treasurer should have practically agreed to take off the duty proposed the moment he was approached by a free-trader in the person of the honourable member for Nepean. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie then moved a reduction of the duty by 100 per cent, and the Treasurer consented to accept his proposal without even putting up a fight. I do not intend to allow any Australian industry to - be wiped out if I can prevent it, and if the honourable member for Bendigo divides the Committee upon this question I shall be found supporting him.",108
1263,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Laanecoorie) . [2.50 a.m.] - I am sorry that so much heat has been imported into the consideration of this proposal. I regret that the Treasurer should have made the premature announcement which he did. I am sorrv that he did not follow the usual course of allowing at least some discussion.,108
1264,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,He knew that he could . not get more.,108
1265,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If he bad told us that I should not have complained. With regard to the item itself, I remember the discussion in the Victorian' Assembly in 1895, when a duty was agreed to which allowed the manufacture of fuse to be successfully carried on in this State. Until fuse was manufactured here, mining was carried on in many districts at great risk, and there are men who today bear the marks of wounds received from the use of faulty fuse. Those who have been associated with mining' districts, as I have been from coil. my birth, must have been struck with the immunity from disaster of recent times compared with the frequency of accidents in the old days. Nothing gives a greater shock to the community than a large mining accident. To-day is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the greatest mining calamity that we have had in Victoria-that which took place at the Australasian Mine, Creswick. I am firmly convinced, of my own knowledge, that what has been said as to the probable effect of the reduction of the duty in closing the works, in which fuse is made locally is absolutely correct. As a corollary there will be an increase in the price of fuse. Those who pose as the friend of the miner, and wish to lessen the chances of accidents, will find they have been sharpening a sword against themselves, and placing the industry nn the hands of that great monopoly, the Nobel Company. Honourable members - seem disposed to give a certain amount of - encouragement to the mining industry, but in this instance they are grasping at the - shadow and - losing the substance. I would remind those who seem to have forgotten their protectionist principles that the way to keep down prices is to stimulate healthy - competition. Without competition there must be monopolies, combinations and rings for the plundering of the consumer. Those - who wish to assist the mining industry by giving a cheap fuse, and to maintain a subsidiary industry, will vote for a reasonable duty on this item. By doing so they will make the miners and timber getters of the - country, who desire cheap fuse, independent of makers on the other side of the world who in the past have not been con-siderate of their wants.",108
1266,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Barrier) [2.55 a.m.] It is only fair to say that the Treasurer .agreed to duties of f d . and Jd. because he - felt that, if he did not, the item would be made free. I am anxious that the making - of safety fuses should be carried on in Australia, but as the honourable members for Batman and Bendigo have told us something of the history of the industry here, I - wish to add a little more. For the facts which I am about to relate I am indebted to a speech made by the honourable member for Bendigo, when in the first Parliament he endeavoured to retain a duty on fuse which had been imposed by the Victorian Parliament. Under the Victorian duty a - man named Perry commenced to make fuse at Bendigo, and he made a very good article. Messrs. Bickford, Smith and Company, the large English makers, offered to 'buy him out, but he would not sell because he was making a fair thing. manual labour is employed in the making vear in wages. - of fuses, most of the work being done by - machinery.",109
1267,Mr FRAZER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Wit h the help of girls.,109
1268,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Yes . When Perry recoil, fused a second offer, Messrs. Bickford, ""Smith and Company threatened that would not sell they would crush him out. They showed him that they had ten facmy tories, and that they could afford to run of them without making a profit in order to compel him to sell. I mention this '.because we have heard of what the Nobel - Company will do if the proposed duty enot imposed. The outcome was that Mr. Perry had to sell his factory to Bickford, Smith and Company, a Cornish firm.",109
1269,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Do we not want English firms to establish factories in Australia ?,109
1270,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I am not objecting to that, but merely stating that the Bendigo factory is practically a branch of that Cornish firm. It cares very little whether we impose a duty or not, because, in those countries where a duty is imposed, it establishes a factory and secures the profit. I admit that a certain amount of labour is employed in the production of the fuse, but the profit goes to the firm. It sends out no fuse unless it is of a first-class character. I am not anxious that the factories at Bendigo and Footscray should have to "" shut down,"" and, therefore, I am prepared to support duties of f d . and Jd. per coil. We are told by the honourable member for Laanecoorie that if they did cease to exist, there would be no competition, because Nobel and Company enjoy a monopoly. Nobel and Company, and Bickford, Smith and Company are fighting one another, and that fight would - not cease merely. because the Bendigo branch of the latter firm was closed. I am anxious to see the business carried on in Australia, especially by Perry and Company, who, I think, were treated badly by Bickford, Smith and Company. I have nothing to say against the Bendigo fuse, because, in my opinion, it is very good. If I thought that with duties of f d . and \6. per coil the local factories would have to close, I should be prepared to give them a little more protection; but I do not think it is necessary. I ask the honourable member for Bendigo to say how much manual labour goes to make a coil of fuse? Very little Sir JOHN QUICK - They pay £5,000 a",109
1271,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I believe that the labour cost is considerably less than Jd. per coil, and I consider that if we give the makers a protection of f d. and Jd. per we shall give them ample protection, and put them in a position to produce good if he fuse and pay decent wages.",109
1272,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Darling) [3.7 a.m.] - In opinion, the Treasurer has offered a one very fair compromise. He has given some consideration, though not a great deal, to  the Tariff Commission that when all his is machines were in full work, he had employed twenty-three hands; but that then he had only eleven. On the question of profits, he said that he was only selling at a slight profit, and that when it turned to a loss he would shut down. Fuse was then on the free list, and, therefore, the statement that he was working at a loss is not proved. He said he was selling at only a slight profit, but he made no reference to a loss.",109
1273,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I was referring to the Bendigo factory.,110
1274,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"At this factory, although there was not full work, they were able to sell at a profit, even without a duty on the imported article. In answer to question 99402, Mr Timson said that he estimated the proportion of the cost of fuse represented by labour at not more than Jd. per coil, or at about 10 per cent, of the value of the finished article. In  was made by machinery as nearly perfect as could be, although the same kind of machines had been in use since 1870. stated that there was so little labour employed, that Jd. per coil was estimated to cover the labour cost. Mr Burgess said that he was selling fuse "" at very near cost"" in the northern markets of Australia, and was not getting the profit there which he obtained in Victoria. That, he added, was due to the keenness of foreign competition; the market had either to be met or lost. He could only compete in Western Australia by taking the price of the market there. Regarding the New  a better price in that Colony than in Victoria. These quotations show that the statement that the manufacturers will close up, and especially if we place fuse on the free list, are not substantiated. I admit that the Victorian fuse has a very good name. Some of the imported fuse is not so good; but, generally speaking, the fuse that is used in Australia is of good quality. The reason why 'so many accidents do not occur in the use of fuse nowadays is not so much on account of an improvement in the article as because the supervision is better, and more responsibility is placed upon the men and the bosses. The compromise proposed is a very fair one. The protection proposed to be afforded to the makers will give them a larger market and more profit, whilst the mining industry will not be heavily burdened.",110
1275,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Corio) [3.13 a.m.] Shall I be in order in moving that the item be postponed? . The CHAIRMAN - The honourable member can move to that effect.,110
1276,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Then I move That the item be postponed until after the consideration of item 152 (stripper harvesters). I think we ought to have the Prime Minister present when we come to a vote on this important matter. Probably no honourable member knows more about the subject than the honourable member for Bendigo, and he realizes how important the industry is, but we should have the Prime Minister present to express the views of the Government concerning it, especially as he represents a mining constituency. In reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, I should like to say that the wages paid in the fuse industryare not so low as he sought to convey. The report of the Victorian Factories Inspector, for the year ended 31st December, 1906, He shows that thirty-five men employed in the industry received an average of 53s. iod. per week.",110

1278,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I do not remember that the honourable member did, though I accept his statement.

1279,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,What does the honourable member know about fuse?,110
1280,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The miners in my electorate use considerable quantities of it. I do not suppose that the honourable member for Fremantle has a miner in his constituency, and probably all that he knows about fuse has been learnt from seeing a little of it on the wharves at Fremantle.",110
1281,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Fremantle) [3.18 a.m.]. - I will not suffer the remarks.of the honourable member for Corio to pass without challenge. I suppose I have bought and used more fuse than any other member of this House. I always buy the best quality of fuse, and have never had an accident. The statements that have been made about the inferior quality of imported fuse are so much silly twaddle. There is no danger in using fuse, except, perhaps, when it falls into the hands of a person as inexperienced as the honourable member for Corio. Otherwise it is quite harmless. A representative of Bickford, Smith and Company stated before the Tariff Commission that unless agreed tothey were allowed to charge more for their fuse the extra duty would be of no use them.",110

There is a clay pipe factory in the electorate of the honourable member for Parramatta, although he does not seem to be aware of it. About 30,000 gross are annually imported, and the competition against the local makers is very severe. We have a manufacturer of clay pipes in Parramatta, and also in Newtown, and I am assured that it is impossible for them, under existing circumstances, to continue to fight against their German competitors. On the other hand, if the duty were increased to is. 6d. on foreign imports, and is. per gross on imports from Great Britain, I am confident that the industry could be carried on successfully. The - manufacturer at Newtown, Mr Shaw, came from Great Britain some years ago, with the object of establishing the industry in Australia.'

I worked there witha duty of is. per gross prevailing for eleven years in respect of all clay pipes, but with the advent of Federation that duty was reduced to the extent of about two-thirds.

1379,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"For instance, are the coloured supplements of Christmas numbers, such as the Illustrated London News, LYNE) Graphic, Sporting and Dramatic Neivs, and so forth, to be charged at the rate of 3d. per lb. 7 If that be the intention, I am afraid there will be considerable difficulty.",118

1383,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I think they will be charged the duty. In my opinion, it is most undesirable that a duty of 3d. per lb. should be charged on coloured supplements such, as I have mentioned. Then there are a good many pictures which are imported in small parcels of twos and threes, such as Pears' Annual, which is a source of pleasure to many people. There is no justification whatever for the duty proposed, unless the Treasurer can arrange with the Department that illustrated pictures accompanying journals shall be admitted free.",118

1411,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If the honourable member wants to do that, ""he had better propose to shut up the Commonwealth. What is the use of bringing on the proposal at this hour?",120

I did hope to be able to do so without any show of temper on his part. One objection constantly raised to any such exemption being given is, that a State might connive with private individuals to enable them to import goods in the name of the State.",121
1413,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That was done in New South Wales.,121
1414,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Nothin g of the sort was done there. The declaration under this amendment would have to be made, either by a Minister or by a departmental officer of the State which was importing the material, to the effect that it was for public works purposes. Is it conceivable that any Minister or officer would make such a declaration for the purpose of defrauding the Commonwealth of revenue? The suggestion is preposterous.",121
1415,Mr JH CATTS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Would the honourable member also exempt the importations of municipal councils?,121
1416,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If the honourable member will move an amendment to that effect, I shall be prepared to give my views on it . Then we come to the question of goods which might be imported by a State for the purpose of being retailed or soldto private individuals. Such goods would not be exempt under my amendment, because they would not be property imported for use on public works. So that there again the Commonwealth is protected. One very strong reason why it is desirable that, irrespective of what may be the rights, of the Commonwealth under the Constitution, we should adopt such an amendment as this, is that most of the imports of States Governments are on account of such works as railways, which are paid for out of loan money. Let us suppose 'that a large railway is in course of construction, involving the making of expensive bridges. A great deal of the material required, such as rails, & c , must be imported. Let us suppose that the State pays in duty £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 . That duty becomes, so to speak, part of the price paid for the material, and is paid out of loan money.",121
1417,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The State could credit the revenue returned to it by the Commonwealth to loan account.,121
1418,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"At the end of the financial year, ,£15,000 of that £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 I have would be paid over by the Commonwealth to the State as revenue. Therefore, that would be a means by which the State would convert part of its loan money into revenue, because the .£15,000 would go into the Consolidated Revenue of the State as revenue pure and simple. As the honourable member for North Sydney says, it would be possible for the State to re-pay that revenue into its loan fund. But we know what Governments are, and how strong is the temptation to a Government to swell its revenue from every possible source. I venture to say that the circumstances would be very exceptional indeed, when any Government would repay money received from the Commonwealth into loan account by way of recoupment.",121
1419,Mr STORRER,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"That is purely a State matter. . Colonel FOXTON - The money would be received as revenue. I do not think that we should assist the States in doing such things as I have described. We should carry out the spirit as well as the letter of the Constitution. A great deal more could be said in favour of the amendment, but I do not wish to detain the Committee at this hour. I undertook to move this amendment and think it my duty to do so. I think that the reasons which I have given are sufficient. In my opinion-and I think my view is shared by a large number of people throughout Australia-it is desirable, whatever may be the powers conferred upon the Commonwealth by the Constitution, that there should be no attempt to strain those powers. By introducing' such a provision as this into the Tariff, this Parliament would give an indication that there is a desire, as far as possible, to settle those vexed questions which are now sub judice, upon a satisfactory basis, and would show that there is no wish on the part of the Commonwealth to take advantage of the States, or of any possible flaw which there may be in the wording of the section which I have quoted.",121
1420,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Hume-Trea surer) [6 a.m.] - I am somewhat surprised that the honourable member for Brisbane should have brought forward this amendment. I take it that if such an amendment were carried it would strike a very severe blow, if not a death blow, at the Commonwealth.",121
1421,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Nonsens e !,122
1422,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The Commonwealth is not so sick as that.,122
1423,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If there is not going to be a fairly strong vote against the amendment, I must adjourn the House, so that a division may be taken upon it when there is a large attendance. The matter is so important that we cannot risk anything. The passing of this amendment would lx; nothing short of a disaster to the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Brisbane has referred to the action which the States would, in all probability, take. Let me remind honourable members of what was done in New South Wales, and to a large extent led up to a very vexed case. At the inception of the Federation the Government of New South Wales thought they had the right' to import goods free of duty.",122
1424,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,So they had.,122
1425,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"They had not,' and the Court took that view. The Railways Commissioners, with the consent of the Government of the State,. imported a lot of material, and supplied it to one contractor to make waggons and other things required for the Department. other contracting firms were at once up in arms, because they were precluded from participating in this arrangement. was the commencement of the trouble in New South Wales.",122
1426,Mr HEDGES,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The goods were imported for the State railways.,122
1427,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"The Railways Commissioners practically said to the one contractor, "" You can have everything that you require for our work free of duty, but all other contractors must pay duty upon their imports.""",122
1428,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Le t us assume that the goods had been required for a Commonwealth railway.,122
1429,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The Commonwealth have a right to collect the Customs revenue.,122
1430,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"If such a proceeding were adopted in connection with a Commonwealth Railway Department, w'ould not the contractors be up in arms in the same way ?",122
1431,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I do not think that the Commonwealth would single out one contractor, and give him his materials free. If I had anything to do with the matter, I should call for tenders, subject to the condition that the necessary material would be supplied by the Government. But I have correctly stated what took place in New South. Wales.",122
1432,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That would not be covered by the honourable member for Brisbane's proposal.,122
1433,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Certainl y it would. The Customs and Post and Telegraph Departments are at present our only sources of revenue, and if this amendment were agreed to no one would be able to say what loss of revenue we should suffer.",122
1434,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Does the honourable member think that the Commonwealth ought to take revenue out of borrowed money ?,122
1435,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"That is a State matter. I am astonished that an honourable member who has sworn to. be true to the Commonwealth should submit such a proposition as this.' If ever anything that' was absolutely traitorous, to the Commonwealth was proposed",122

The Government cannot accept such a proposition. I do not know what is the temper of the Committee, but if there is the slightest danger of the amendment being' agreed to, I must move that progress be reported, and, if necessary, have a call of the House.

J. move this in all good faith, as every argument that can be advanced in favour of including the State Governors applies to the Lieutenant-Governors. The latter act as locum tenens for Governors during their absence, and they receive their appointments, just as Governors do, direct from the King. There is an additional reason why Lieutenant-Governors should be given some consideration, in the fact that they receive no salary, especially when acting for a few weeks, or a few days.",124

1514,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Corangamite) [7.9 a.m.]. - In my opinion the Treasurer is coming it a little bit too strong in submitting this amendment. In Brisbane there is a man who manufactures all the instruments which are included in paragraph A.,128
1515,Mr HANS IRVINE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Then we must protect him.,128
1516,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"This item, as it is printed, includes scientific instruments of very great accuracy. In some cases the users of such instruments like to deal with' the manufacturer in Brisbane, but, in other cases, they want to import them from America or Germany or England. I do not think that the Minister should alter the wording of the item, and so remove such instruments from the free list.",128

All these scientific instruments should be free. To-tax them would be-to do a great injustice to the scientists of Australia, and to those concerned in schools of mines and laboratories. I do not deny that some of the instruments are made in Australia, and they may be perfectly accurate so far as they go. But a scientist would not be altogether satisfied with the conditions under which they are made in Brisbane. These instruments are of no use unless they are made with the greatest delicacy. The amendment simply means that only those made of gun metal will be admitted free. I want honourable members to be seized of the facts.",128
1519,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,We do not want facts at this time of the morning. We intend to put on a duty. That is the fact that concerns us.,128
1520,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,If I had not drawn attention to the matter the item would have been passed without any consideration. The Minister really should not press his amendment.,128
1521,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I am going to press and Mr WILSON - I undertake to say that there are many scientists in Australia who would not think of going to Brisbane for LYNE) their instruments.,128
1522,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Why not?,128
1523,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Because they would not be satisfied that they were getting instruments that were perfect for their scientific work.,128
1524,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Melbourne) [7.16 a.m.] - It would be far better to give the gentleman in Brisbane who is making these instruments a bounty than to impose a duty for his benefit. Scientific men are not even satisfied with English-made instruments' in manv cases. They send to Germany, or to the United States of America for particular instruments for particular purposes. They are certainly not likely to be content with Australian-made instruments when they want to make sure of obtaining the most scrupulous accuracy. It would be regrettable if every dairy in Australia was practically forced to buy a lactometer in which perfect confidence could not be put. What does the proposed duty amount to? The",128
1525,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Thirt y and 25 per cent.,128
1526,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I shall have to get one of these instruments and test it ,128
1527,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I think that the amendment is due to the energy of the Queensland members. In order that his deductions may be recognised elsewhere, a professor in Australia needs for the purposes of his scientific investigations instruments of the same high grade as those used in the Old World. If an astronomer here were to observe certain nebulas, it would be necessary that the instrument with which he made his observations should correspond with those used in other parts of the world.",128
1528,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,There must be an absolute standard.,129
1529,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,The instruments made in Brisbane are standardized.,129
1530,Mr MALONEY,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Is it the standard of Berlin, of Paris, or some other part of the world that is observed? In conclusion, I simply desire to know whether the Treasurer intends to insert the words "" of other material than glass"" in the remaining paragraphs.  was never more surprised in my life than I was when I heard the honourable member for Melbourne speak as he did regarding the industry to which this item relates. When invited by the Treasurer to vote for a duty of .50 per cent, for the protection of a Victorian industry, he has done so without blushing; but when he is asked to vote for a duty for the assistance of a Queensland industry, he immediately begins to talk about the Milky Way, and the standard of Paris, Berlin, and other cities, with a view of showing that the proposed protection should not be granted. When the honourable member can turn a* political somersault with such consummate ease, I am satisfied as to his consistency and his ideas of protection. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane)[7.26 a.m.]. - When I spoke of these instruments being standardized. I meant to convey that the instruments enumerated in paragraph A are made in Brisbane by a highly trained scientific man. who acquired his knowledge in the best manufactories of Europe. He thoroughly understands his business, and has been engaged for years in making the very instruments to which the honourable member for Melbourne has referred. Every scientific instrument that he makes is examined by a Government expert, who must certify to its correctness before it can be offered for sale.",129
1531,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Is the Government expert competent?,129
1532,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I have yet to learn that protectionists, at all events, are not to accept Australian experts in lieu of those on the other side of the globe.",129
1533,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,How many are engaged in the industry in Brisbane?,129
1534,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I do not know; it is not a large establishment.,129
1535,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,It is the usual Queensland industry?,129
1536,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I am aware that some honourable members are prepared to taboo an industry the moment it is mentioned that it is carried on in Queensland.,129
1537,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,When we find the honourable member supporting a duty we know that it must relate to a Queensland industry.,129
1538,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That is not fair. I have supported the imposition of duties in relation to a large number of industries that are peculiar to Victoria.,129
1539,Mr WISE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,Lo w duties.,129
1540,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"No ; I have supported the Government on various occasions, but I am not, and do not pretend to be, a prohibitionist. 1 invite honourable members to compare this proposed duty of 30 per cent. with, the duties of from 100 to 200 per cent., that have been passed for the protection of Victorian industries. I repeat that every possible precaution is taken to insure the accuracy of the scientific instruments made in Queensland. I should also like to mention that these people do not propose to attempt the manufacture of any of those instruments which are beyond their capacity. They will make only those with which they are thoroughly familiar.",129
1541,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,If this man were to remove to some other country the whole industry would be abolished.,129
1542,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"No , I presume that some one else would take his place. Why should we assume that the usual consequences claimed for a protective duty would not follow in this case, and that the number of persons engaged in this industry would not be increased ?",129
1543,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Laanecoorie) [7.31 a.m.]. - I opposed this proposal when it was before the Committee in another form on a previous occasion. I oppose it again for the same reason, that throughout the Tariff we have refrained from imposing duties on purely scientific instruments. It should not be forgotten that a number of these articles are coming every day into more common use, and we wish to encourage their use in the Commonwealth. Many reasons have been given why the proposal should not be accepted, but one which has not yet been mentioned is that the result of prosecutions in the Courts, involving the livelihood, or the liberty of a man, in very many instances, depends upon the accuracy uf these instruments.. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [7.35 a.m.] - I should just like to ask the honourable member for Laanecoorie whether he thinks we shall ever be able to make these instruments in Australia, and, if so, when he thinks we should begin to make them ?

1551,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Parramatta) [7.55 a.m.] - No doubt these very delicate instruments require to be as mathematically perfect as possible. Industries of this kind do not spring up like mushrooms; and I do not see that the industry in Brisbane could by any possibility supply all the requirements of Australia. In my opinion, a fair duty would be one of 15 per cent, all round.",131
1552,Mr WILS ON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Corangamite) [7.56 a.m.]. - Bot h - the honourable member for Laanecoorie and the honourable member, for Melbourne showed that,- no matter how high the duty might be, these goods must be brought from abroad; and, therefore, the impost must, to a large extent, be merely revenue producing.

1555,Mr WILS ON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Corangamite) [8.7 a.m.]. - The Treasurer's explanation is scarcely satisfactory. I repeat that this proposal will have the effect of subjecting to duty apparatus used to test wines in respect of their acidity, their alcoholic strength, and the carbonic acid gas which they contain. Such instruments as acidometers, alcoholometers and eudiometers, are not manufactured in Australia.",131
1556,Colonel FOXTON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I will guarantee that they are manufactured in Brisbane.,131

I seen that they contain schedules of prohibited goods. St. Vincent, for instance, prohibits the importation of plants, seeds, berries, earth, soil, and vegetable matter used for packing or covering imports from Ceylon, Natal, South India, Mauri30 tius, and the Straits Settlements. Ceylon and Mauritius have similarly drastic hibitions. I suggest that our prohibitions, most of which are embodied in the toms Act, should be printed as a schedule attached, to the Tariff.",132

1569,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,We gave these manufacturers a higher duty.,132

1571,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,We increased the duty on waterproof cloth.,132
1572,Mr WILSON,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Do I understand that Minister proposes to insert "" 7 cent.""?",132
1573,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,No ; I propose to rebate 7^'per cent.,132

1577,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"No , the duties are 30 and 25 per cent.",132
1578,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,They have got a thumping big protection.,132

1580,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"Parramatta) [8.21 a.m.] - It is quite true that this provision was in the old Tariff, but since then we have given the manufacturers of these goods very much higher protection, viz. :and 25 per cent., and I do not quite see why we should go further and rebate proto them three-fourths of that duty. Why should they not be put on the same footCusing as other manufacturers? Since they have got a protection of 30 and 25 per cent., it seems to me to be absurd to give a rebate of three-fourths of it.

1582,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,That is so.,132
1583,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,I think that the Minister should not allow this item to pass.,132
1584,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"I shall make further inquiry, and if it should transpire that it is not a proper thing to do, I will that an alteration is made in another",132
1585,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEAL TH OFFICES JN,"But why should persons who happen to manufacture waterproof cloth get this advantage over every other kind of manufacture? It is an anomalous item to put in the Tariff. Certainly, it cannot be called a scientific Tariff, when certain manufacturers are singled out for specially favourable treatment. I should like to know the reason for this proposal, and if there is no reason why these manufacturers should be the treated differently from any others, it per ought not to be done, I think. 1",132

' Mr WATKINS (Newcastle) [8.z8 a.m.]. to- I am not clear yet about this item.
