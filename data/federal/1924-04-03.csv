3,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The Government is well aware of the circumstances to which the honourable member has referred. A very acute and critical situation has grown up in the grape growing districts, particularly in connection with the cultivation of the doradillo grape,, which was planted in greatquantities, in some instances, on the advice, if not the direct request, of State Governments. In view of the fact that the crop last year was very large, that there will be a very much larger crop this year, and that, as these grapes are used only for the making of brandy and for t if y in g spirit, they are practically unsaleable, because of the stocks held at present, the matter has received the anxious consideration of the Government, and is still being considered. I hope to be able to make some announcement on the subject before the House rises tomorrow. F LYING OF AUSTRALIANFLAG tion was answered yesterday. ON PUBLICBUILDINGS .",13

NA (ADMINISTRATIO N) BILL . SECOND READING .",19
58,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Wimmera-Minister for Works and Railways) [2.56] - I move That the Bill be notv read a second time. In accordance with the expressed policy of the Government this Bill is introconsists duced to alter the present system of administering the Federal Territory, and to provide for Commissi on to control and manage the affairs of the Territory. The proposal may be understood more clearly if briefly explain the administrative methods of the past. From 1909 to 1912 the Territory was controlled Department of Home Affairs. August, 1912, a Resident Administrator was appointed, who controlled all Federal Capital niatters, subject to the approval of the Minister. In 1916, however, Home Affairs Department disappeared, and the works and administrative tions of the Federal Territory were allotted to the Works and Railways and Home and Territories Departments rei spectively. That dual arrangement continued u n t il the present time, and three years. the affairs of the Territory now rebeen quire the attention of two Ministers, ancl the employment of two Departmental staffs under separate control. While system has worked fairly satisfactorily so dations. fax, the development of the Territory has now reached such a stage that we lieve that new machinery is necessary, done. and will yield better results. In speed up .construction, the arrangement was made towards the end of last year that a. separate works organization be established at Canberra, under the Director-General of Works, who would then ? be personally responsible to the Minister and work in conjunction with the A d visory Committee. That arrangement has otbviated the necessity for PAPERS . administration being controlled in detail from Melbourne, and I think honourable the members who have visited the Territory held must admit that the results from this system have been very good. Still the general administration of the Territory, from works construction, has t continued in the hands of the Minister for Home and Territories. In spite of many obstructions and difficulties, anc much hostile and unmerited criticism, a great deal of good work has been performed at Canberra. In addition to the machinery provided by - sections of the Works and Railways and Home a-nd Territories Departments, the A d visory Committee has been functioning. After the suspension of construction work during the war, this Committee was appointed at the end of 1920. It of the following experts in architecture, engineering, town planning and Capital departmental administration : - John a Sulman, Esq., Consulting Architect; E . M . de Burgh, Esq., Chief Engineer for Water Supply, Public Works DepartI ment, New South Wales; H . E . Ross, Esq., Architect; Colonel P. T. Owen, Commonwealth Director-General' of works; by the and J. T. H . Goodwin, Esq., ComI n monwealth Surveyor-General, Home and Territories Department. The Committee studied the general situation in the light of the changed economic conditions, the and drew up a scheme for the construction of the city, and the establishfuncment of the seat of Government as economically and as rapidly as possible. This scheme was generally approved, and t has been the basis of all the work that has has been carried out during the past The Committee has since engaged in developing its proposals in detail, and in dealing with Federal Capital matters the Government have largely therelied upon its advice and its recommenA t this juncture I should like to pay a well deserved tribute to the beCommittee for the splendid work it has Whatever honourable members order to may think of Federal Capital matters in general, the members of the Committee have undoubtedly rendered good should service to the Commonwealth.",20
59,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Why change them,",20
60,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I shall, if honor- able members will curb their impatience, endeavour to explain the reason for the much works contemplated change..",20
61,Mr FENTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,You cannot explain that.,21
62,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"If the honourable member is determined not to accept any explanation, it will be beyond the w it of a simple individual like myself to satisfy him. I hope, however, to be able to offer sound reasons to any honourable member who approaches this subject with an open mind. We do' not propose to appoint the Commission one day amd scrap this Advisory Committee the next day. It will be necessary for . a time to retain its services. Obviously, it would be unfair to expect any new administrative body to pick up all the threads of constructional problems in a day. Therefore, it is proposed, for the present, and until the Commission is well established, to retain the services and act upon the advice of the Advisory Committee.",21
63,Mr FENTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Why not delay the pointment of the Commission until the present work is finished ?,21
64,Mr SPEAKER,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT," Order ! The honourable the Minister must,be allowed to explain the Bill .",21
65,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"We feel that the time has come when the existing administration should be superseded by a single local authority. Whilst the work done up to the present has been fairly satisfactory, it is not considered wise to continue further a system under which two Ministers exercise control over the Territory. In spite of all that has been said, and is being said today by way of interjeotion, the fact remains that with the activities ahead of us at the capital city, following upon the throwing open of land for settlement, there will arise a large number of municipal problems which could not be satisfactorily handled, by the administrative stalls of the Home and Territories and Works and Railways Departments. We intend to vest this Committee with adequate powers to develop and maintain a proper system of local Government in the Territory, to deal with the land question, the construction of the city, and to take over the whole - of .the existing assets and liabilities. The Territory, as the Bill shows, means not only the Territory in which the Capital City is being constructed, but also that round Jervis Bay. The Minister referred to in the Bill as controlling the Commission, will be the Minister for Home and Territories. W it h regard to the Commission itself it.is proposed to appoint three members for a fixed term respectively of five years, four years, and three years at the inception, and thereafter for a period of three years. This course will prevent the whole of the vacancies occurring in any one year.",21
66,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Are members of the Advisory Committee - receiving any salary ?,21
67,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Mr Sulman, the Chairman, acts without salary, Mr Ross receives a thousand guineas a year, and Mr de Burgh four hundred guineas per annum - The remaining two members of the Committee, Colonel Owen and Mr Goodwin, being departmental officers, receive no special salary, but draw travelling allowances.",21
68,Mr LAZZARINI,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Can the Minister give us the names of the persons to be apap- pointed on the proposed Commission?,21
69,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I cannot. Up to the present no steps have been taken by the Government to make any appointment. We have no one in view. Honourable members may cynically laugh, but I say definitely that, neither directly nor indirectly, have we approached any individual with regard to these appointments. As to remuneration, the chairman of the proposed Commission will receive an amount not exceeding £3,000 per annum, and the other two members a salary not exceeding £ 2 , 0 0 0 per annum. Their remuneration may be by way of fees or salary, or partly fees and partly salary, but if wholly by salary, then they shall be required to devote the whole of their time to their duties.",21
70,Mr LISTER,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,The Government will pay the chairman more than the Prime Minister gets.,21
71,Mr FENTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Will they also draw travelling allowances ?,21
72,Mr SPEAKER,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Order ! Honourable members must leave questions to the Committee stage of the Bill .,21
73,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Yes ; they will drawtravelling expenses. The members of the Commission will be appointed for their special knowledge of such mattersas architecture, engineering, general construction, town planning, finance, and general administration. In selecting .the personnel the Government will endeavour to see that, as far as possible, the necessary qualifications will be found in the members of the Commission. The plan upon which we are working is that prepared by Mr W . B . Griffin. will be the basis of all constructional work. The Bill provides that if any variation of the plan is proposed it may be disallowed by Parliament. short, the Commission will be debarred from mutilating or altering the original plan without the consent of Parliament.",21
74,Dr MALONEY,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Will Mr Griffin have an opportunity of appointment to the Commission ?,22
75,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I refuse to be drawn on that matter. If Parliament approves of this Bill the Government will give consideration to the appointment of the Commission. The Bill provides for the appointment of officers by the Commission and also for the transfer of officers of the Home and Territories Department and the Works and Railways Department who are already employed in the Territory. Certain officers of both those Departments have for a number of years been wholly employed on departmental work in the Territory, and they have a full knowledge of the local situation. It is proposed that such of these officers as the Ministers of the two Departments may. approve may be transferred to the control of the Commission. An y officer of the Public Service who is so' transferred shall retain his existing and accruing rights. He will be granted leave of absence from the Public Service while he is in the employ of the Commission. The procedure respecting the Commissioners is different. is proposed that if a public servant is appointed to the Commission he shall resign from the Service, but will be eligible for re-appointment. It would be a hardship to the lower-paid officers to have to resign from the Service because of being required in the Territory, but the Commissioners will receive a substantial salary, and no such hardship would be inflicted upon them. Provision is made in the Bill for the services of officers of the Works and Railways Department to be utilized as far as possible in connection with constructional work in the Territory. This will make available the experience and skill of officers who have been connected for many years with Canberra work. It will also insure continuity of ideas and plans, and will save the Administration considerable expense. One of the most important parts of the Bill deals with financial matters. This Sub-clause 1, clause 17, reads as follows : The revenue of the Commission shall consist of the following moneys :In (a) rates; (b) charges for services; (c) rents received from lands leased by the Commission, or under any Ordinance made under the iSeot o j Government (Administration) Act 1910; (d) moneys received .in pursuance of any by-law made under this Act ; (e) fines recovered for any contravention of any by-law made under this Act ; and (/) moneys borrowed by the Commission in pursuance of this Act ; and (g) any other moneys received by the 1 Commission. Sub-clause 2 provides that all moneys received by the Commission shall be credited to a fund to be called the Seat of Government Fund. The purpose of that is to dissociate the Commission's financial operations from the ordinary financial affairs of the Government. The Commission will have independent funds, and it will be required to make the best use of the revenue and resources of the Territory. Pending the floating of loans by the Commission it is proposed that the Treasurer shall be empowered to advance money to it , subject to early repayments with interest. That is necessary, because, if Parliament passes this Bill and the Commission takes control of the Territory, say from 30th June next, it will be impossible for it to borrow money immediately. Pending the raising It of the first loan, therefore, the Commonwealth Treasurer will advance money to it . All advances made under this provision must be recouped to the Treasurer from the first loan. The Commonwealth Government guarantees repayment of moneys borrowed by the Commission, and Federal any interest that may be due thereon. The Commission may only borrow moneys to such an amount, and in such manner, and on such terms as the Treasurer shall approve. That is an important provision. The Commission shall apply any surplus to the credit of the Seat of .Government Fund to the reduction of loans. It is quite obvious that in the initial stages of development, when the larger constructional works, such as the building of Parliament House and the administrative buildings, is proceeding, the Territory accounts will show a heavy accumulating deficit, but we are confident that this will be only temporary,, and that later on the revenue will; increase. We are optimistic enough to expect that ultimately the receipts will exceed the expenditure in the Territory. If in the first ten years the general liabilities of tha Commission amount to, £10,000,000- I mention that amount simply for the sake of illustration-and the receipts of the Commission in that period exceed that amount, the surplus must be paid into the Consolidated Re. venue Fund. The Government has endeavoured in this Bill to strike the happy mean. It has sought to give the Commission reasonably full powers so that it may discharge its duties without being unduly hampered, and at the same time to retain sufficient authority to insure that the Commissioners shall, at all times, be under parliamentary control. Very onerous responsibilities are to be placed upon the Commission i u regard to its general management and control of the Territory. The Bill provides that it shall be responsible for the appointment and control of its officers, and the control and management of Crown lands and other land placed in its control by the Governor General. That includes not only land within the city area, but all lands within the Territory. It shall levy and collect rates, and borrow money under the conditions which I have already mentioned. It shall construct, maintain, and operate tramways; construct, maintain, and control roads; provide gas, electricity, water, and sewerage; and, generally, have charge of public utilities and public works within its own territories. Its powers are set out in clause 14 of the Bill', which I invite honourable members to read. It takes over heavy Labilities in regard to expenditure in the Territory, and is given wide scope in the economic management of the finances of the Territory. Generally, the whole future of the Territory, financially and otherwise, is really the responsibility of the Commission. The Bill contains some restrictions upon the Commission's powers. It must conserve and adhere to the' approved plan, and in undertaking works and bviildings it is subject to the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1913-21.  friend tell us whether he refers to the original plan of Mr Griffin, or to an amended plan? Mr Stewart.",22
76,Sir LITTLETON GHOOM,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"The original plan, with minor contour modifications.",23
77,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"There have been slight modifications of the original plan, which have been rendered necessary by circumstances which were not problems in say, Mr Griffin's time, but which experience and the passage of time have shown to be advisable. However, - the main scheme outlined by Mr Griffin is still being adhered to, and it is proposed to adhere to it subject tosuch modifications as the Commission may deem wise. Those modifications must be approved by the Minister and be laid before Parliament. The accounts of the receipts ancl expenditure of the Commission are to be subject to the Committee of Public Accounts A ct 1913-20. By-laws of the Commission may be disallowed within t h i r t y clays after having been laid before both Houses of Parliament. Books of accounts will be sub.iect to inspection and audit by theAuditorGeneral, and the annual report of the Commission on; its operations must be laid before both Houses of Parliament. The Commission's, powers are to be subject to amy Ordinance made under the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910. Certain Commonwealth works may, by Order in Council, be exempted from the Commission's control. The Governor General must approve< of all by-laws, and he may make regulations 1 moreaccurately defining the Commission's powers, aind imposing conditions and limitations n.pon the exercise of those powers. It may be asked what hold the Minister has upom the Commission. The Commission must submit annually to the Minister, for his approval, estimates of receipts and expenditure. No expendituremay be incurred without the Minister's approval. The Commission must furnish a report quarterly, setting out the. approximate expenditure and receipts during the past quarter, the general condition of the works, and the appointments and removals of officers. The Treasurer must determine the amount to be borrowed at any time, and the terms on which the transaction shall take place. If , for instance, the Commission desired to borrow £500,000, it must submit a list of the works upon honourable which it is. proposed to spend that sum. The Minister must give his approval to those works.",23
78,Mr GEEGOKY,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Will the Parliament ''have any control ?,24
79,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Yes . All such reports and documents as the Minister may ""require must be furnished. The Minister's written consent is necessary before the Commission may sell or otherwise dispose of any land upon which public works-, buildings, or public utilities are - constructed. It must also obtain approval for the construction of works and buildings for the Commonwealth. The Commission shall be liable for the whole of the expenditure by the Commonwealth prior to the passing of this Act, in connection with the establishment and administration of the Territory, after deducting the amount of the receipts. It is also liable for interest on that amount, together with interest on the liabilities existing at the commencement iof this Act, which are to be calculated annually and added to the principal - sum.. The prescribed rates of interest will be determined by the Treasurer. The Commission shall be liable for any contracts or agreements in existence at the commencement of this Act , and for the repayment of all loans. It must undertake the construction of all buildings and works required by the Commonwealth in the Territory. Those works will be leased to th© Commonwealth on a rental basis, the only exceptions being Parliament House - and the residence of the - Governor General. Parliament House, obviously, must at all times be under the control of Parliament itself; that control cannot be delegated to any outside body. I? administrative offices costing, say, .£200,000, are erected, that expenditure will be a liabilit y on the Commission, and, together with the interest upon it , will be debited to its funds. Instead of the Government paying, from loan and revenue funds, say, 6 per cent, upon a £200,000 building, the Commission will take over that liability, and the Commonwealth wil l pay to the Commission the interest upon the capital value of the building, together with such an amount as will be necessary to cover depreciation ""and usual charges.",24
80,Mr FENTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"The Commission fixes the rates and we pay them,",24
81,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member's interjection does not correctly state - the position. I repeat that, with the exoeption of works excepted by Order in Council-suc h as secret defence worksthe whole of the works within the Federal - Capital Territory are to be built by the Commission. The whole of the assets will be theirs, and the liabilities also. They are to be separated completely from the ordinary departmental' loan and revenue accounts. The Commission will take over the whole of the present staffs in the Territory. The whole of the responsibility for the erection and maintenance of works will be taken over by the Commission, and, in fact, all the responsibilities set out in clause 14, which is the vital clause of the Bill . If honourable members will carefully read that clause they will find that it practically summarizes the duties of the Commission. In reply to some objections which have been urged by interjection I should like to say that while the present machinery has worked fair l y well up to the present, it will be impossible to secure satisfactory results with it in the future. Mr E . RILEY - Everythin g is going on very well there just now. . Mr STEWART - I am very glad to hear the honourable member say that, but he overlooks the fact that very important new problems will be raised when we in vite private enterprise to take part in the building of the Federal Capital. On the 1st October next we are throwing open the. leasing of land in the Federal Territory, and that wil l be followed by the problems associated with municipal control. I have studied the matter verycarefully, and have come to the conclusion that it will be impossible to continue at the Federal Capital the dual control of the Works and Railways and Home and Territories Departments. That will not work in the future, however satisfactorily it may have worked up to the present. The question of the expense in volved under the Bill has been raised, but I remind honourable members that the Works and Railways Department has at present a very high-salaried officer, the Director-General of Works, stationed at Canberra all the time. We have other officers of the Department engaged who can ill be spared. We have had to concentrate upon construction at Canberra when we have badly required the services of officers for works elsewhere. In order to carry out the policy of the Government as laid down in the Governor General's Speech, we clared all works at Canberra to be urgent, and concentrated upon them. That is state of affairs that cannot continue inproposes definitely. I commend the Bill to careful consideration of honourable mem- £7,000 a year. bers on both sides. It does not deal with a party question, and is not introduced as a party measure. It aims at the control, good management, and good government of the home of the Commonwealth Parliament. Since the formation of the present Government steps have been taken to accelerate the building of the Federal Capital, in the endeavour to determine the earliest possible date might expect to have necessary works there so far completed as to enable the Seat of Government to be removed to Canberra. Honourable members will perhaps remember that in the Governor General's Canberra. Speech, at the opening of the present session, there appeared the following paragraph : The works in progress at the Federal have now so far advanced as to necessitate introduction of a Bill to provide for the constitution of a Commission to control the Terriwill. tory. It is proposed to empower it to raise loans for the construction and the city. It is in pursuance of that promise that this Bill is presented to the House.",24
82,Mr FENTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,It is unnecessary.,25
83,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I have listened the honourable member with due respect, but he will agree that, by reason of duties of my position, I know something of present-day problems in the Federal Capital' Territory.",25
84,Mr FENTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I am prepared to say that the Minister for Works and ways, and those uncier him, are doing very well at Canberra. I say leave well alone, and do not introduce this new machinery.",25
85,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I appreciate the exnow pression of the honourable member's Commission. opinion, but with due respect to him, I repeat that, although the present maofficer chinery has worked satisfactorily to the problems which will confront us when private enterprise is introduced, throwing open of land, and the necessity for local government will be such as not be undertaken by the existing chinery. We must create fresh for the purpose, and the Bill contains the proposals which the Government consider best suited to deal with the problems that dewill arise. Honourable members opposite., apparently, object to the expense involved, a but what does it amount to? The Bill the appointment of three officers, the whose total salaries may amount to",25
86,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,We do not know what staff the Commission will employ.,25
87,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Honourable membersspeak as if the present staff at Canberra were not costing the Commonwealth anything. We have a large staff continuallyemployed at Canberra by two Departments,, and those who compose it are not at which we working for nothing.",25
88,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,We shall have a third staff there when we get the Commission. - Mr STEWART - No . There will be no proportionate increase in the staff at,25

91,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"At least, the Commisdevelopment of sion will be extra.",25
92,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"On the surface, that may appear to be so, but I have already mentioned that the Director-General of Works is at present at Canberra, and is to dealing only with construction work there. He has not to deal with the manthe agement of land, the throwing open of lancl, the running of services, and so on.",25
93,Mr JACKSON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,What are the salaries of Mr Goodwin and Colonel Owen ?,25
94,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Without allowances, Railthey amount, approximately, to",25

98,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,That is so. .Surely canthe honourable gentleman does not desire mathat these buildings should be placed machinery under the Commission.,25
99,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,I am merely pointing cut that we must have other officers there besides the staff of the Commission. The Minister gave the impression that the Commission and its staff would be sufficient to administer the - Federal Capital Territory.,25
100,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"When the Seat of Government is removed to Canberra, we shall require considerably more than the officers required to control the Commonwealth Parliament House and the Governor General's residence. There will be the whole of the staff of this Parliament there.",26
101,Mr FENTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Apar t from the Commission, we shall need a man like Colonel Owen at Canberra.",26
102,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"No good purpose jan be served by a debate across the table on masters of 'detail, which must be threshed out at the Committee stage of the Bill . Much unmerited and unfair criticism has been levelled at Canberra, but I am confident that the results in the future will justify the action the Government has taken, and the support given by honourable members both sides of the House in endeavouring to forward the establishment of the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth in its own territory. am satisfied that, in spite of the adverse criticism we h'ave heard, Canberra will ultimately pay for itself. An endeavour has been made to build Canberra in a way entirely different from that, in which cities are ordjnarily built. may almost assert that the whole of the cities of the world have, like Topsy, ""just growed"" in a haphazard fashion. Canberra is the only city in the world that I know of that will be built from the start to a definite plan, which embodies all the most modern requirements of town planning. Mr A.. GEEEN - What about Washington, D.C. 1",26
103,Mr STEWART,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"That cannot be said of Washington to the same extent as it can be said of Canberra. I believe that Canberra will be a big improvement on Washington in this regard. If we continue its development in accordance with Mr Griffin's plan I am optimistic enough to believe that Canberra will not only not have its equal in Australia, but very few equals in any part of the world. I commend the Bill to the consideration of the House. I repeat that it deals with the control and management of our future home, and is not a party measure. I hope that when, in Committee, we come to the machinery clauses of the B i ll I shall be able to meet some of the objections which have been raised by honourable members opposite. They may vote as they like. If any honourable member on this side objects to it , I would be the last to insist that he should vote against his convictions. When honourable members have had the opportunity to study this Bill a little more they will see that it is not quite so obnoxious a measure as some appear to think. While I believe that in its present form the Bill is a good one-, and will meet the circumstances for which it is designed, I am not prepared to say that it is entirely perfect; and if honourable members will indicate any direction in which it could be improved, I shall be prepared to consider any suggestion for improving it . It is not a party measure, and has not been introduced as such. It deals with a big national problem-the control of our future home-and I trust that honourable on members will debate it in the spirit in which it has been introduced. Debate (on motion by Mr Charlton) I adjourned. LEAGUE OF NATIONS .",26
104,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"In July last I was honoured by being appointed one of the We Australian representatives to attend the fourth Assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva. I remember very clearly the congratulatory words with which the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Charlton) cheered me on my mission. The Australian delegation have drawn up a very exhaustive report, which I shall lay on the table of the House. The representation of one's country at the Assembly of the League of Nations is an extremely difficult task for a delegate attending for the first time. It is surrounded by innumerable pitfalls, because the procedure is very different from anything to which we here are accumstomed. In Australia and in the other Dominions of the British Empii'e the English parliamentary procedure is adopted, but it is not so at the meetings of the League of Nations. There the French and American procedure is adopted, which makes it very difficult for any one who has not a good knowledge of the French language. By the rules of the League, two languages only--French and English - arc permitted at its gatherings. use of the English language was only sanctioned as an afterthought Treaty of Versailles, because America at that time expected to be a member of the League of Nations, and insisted on English being used as well as French. The whole of the agenda paper, consisting of forty to fifty proposals, is not placed before the Assembly, except for a few moments, but the various are each referred to one of six committees, on each of which is a delegate from each of the ""nations Each delegate is permitted two only of such committees. committees meet on alternate days, it is essential that if a country is to be fully represented it should have at least three delegates; while if provision is made for their absence on occasions-which, to the strenuous nature of the work, is very probable-it is necessary to have substitute delegates also. As a rule, Australia has had three delegates and one or two substitute delegates. In my present speech I propose to refer only to what I consider the outstanding features of the Assembly which I attended. Its meetings were, unfortunately, overshadowed by an unfortunate dispute between Italy and Greece. I shall briefly relate what then occurred, because I have found, not only in England, but here also, a very great misconception on the part of the people as to what took place at the meetings of the League. Some of us believe that the League has been somewhat belittled by certain people because of its action on that occasion. It is very difficult to convey to honourable members the atmosphere which enveloped the meetings. reading of its proceedings in cold type is a very different thing from being present. Honourable members, having seen in Hansard the record of speeches made in this House, will appreciate the position. Whilst the accuracy of the reports is beyond dispute, my reading of them prior to taking my seat in this Chamber produced .a very different effect on me from that I received on hearing - speeches delivered. That difference the greater where there sentatives of forty-five or fifty nations gathered together with one .common Sir Seville Howse, and firm intention, namely, to settle their differences by arbitration and disThe cussion, if possible, in order to prevent the possibility of further conflict. On the in the 27th August, the. members of an It a l i a n delegation, consisting of General T e l l in i and others-al l Italians with the exception of the interpreter, who was an A l banian-were assassinated. The staff was appointed by a Conference of A m bassadors, and was under the special protection of Greece. The .murder is bequestions yond discussion; it was foul to the worstdegree. There was nothing whatever to excuse it , nor, for that matter, did Greece represented. make any effort to mitigate the offence. to sit on On the 29th August,, the It a l i an GovernAs those ment presented a Note to the Greek Government, laying down certain lines of conduct to be followed, and demanding an answer without delay. On the 30th August, the Greek Government replied, concedowing ing some of the demands and refusing others. On the 31st August-the first day on which"" the League sat-the Italian Navy appeared off Corfu and occupied one of the important island possessions of Greece. The Greeks then appealed to the League of Nations. That appeal was made on the day of the occupation, although it must have been drawn up before the occupation of Corfu. Repeatedly in the press, and in addresses on the League of Nations, the statement has. been made that the Greek appeal was against the bombardment of C o r f u ; but at no time did that matter come before the League of Nations. The Greeks really complained of Mussolini's action in taking coercive measures without first having recourse to the procedure which Italy , as a member of the League of Nations, had agreed to follow in such circumstances. The CounThe cil listened to the Italian representation, which insisted that the inatter should be left to the decision of the Conference of Ambassadors. They had two reasons for taking that stand:- first, because the Italian Delegation was under the supervision, control, and protection of the Conference of Ambassadors; and, secondly, because they doubted whether they had the right to adjudicate under Articles of such Convention. There is something to supis port that latter view, because the interare repre- pretation of the clause in the Covenant .did not make it clear whether the League had power to .deal with .the question. Dealing with, it , a very eminent jurist said:Reprisals, pacific blockade, aud other like measures of constraint, applied to States denying or delaying justice, are doubtless in ihe nature of acts of war; but they do not create a state of war unless the Statu against which they arc exercised elects to treat them as definitely hostile. If not, they arc consistent with the continuance of peace! Tke Greek representatives,, at all times, recognised the enormity of tlm offence committed, and specifically asked thud it should he dealt with by the Conference respect of Ambassadors. A f t e r protracted negotiations, it was eventually agreed to by both parties-by Italy , which practically demanded that course of action ; and. by Greece, which acceded to the demandthat the question should be dealt with by the Conference of Ambassadors. We all know the result. Personally, J am satismembers fied that it was diplomatic action on part of the League. These matters have since been referred to a Committee of Jurists, who, before the next meeting the Assembly in the latter part of this year, will have dealt with them. action of the League was wise, and i conformity with its dignity, as, after its function is not to engage in wareach year. fare. In any case, the League has no masembly, chinery by which it could take part i a war; no such machinery has been conand stituted. The question has frequently been asked: "" Why did not the League i terfere?"" The answer is that the League legal could not interfere by force, because it for and did not possess that force. In my poned opinion, its main function is to bring about the settlement of disputes by Canadian diplomatic negotiations and arbitration. In fact, no other course is open to it , as amendments instead. it has no machinery for enforcing views. It is generally recognised tically every delegate, with the possible exception of the delegate from Italy but for the Council of the League being in session when this unfortunate episode occurred, It a l y and Greece would have been at war. Czecho-Slovaki could not have stood aloof, raid-Bulgaria also wonld have been involved, and it is impossible to estimate where the conflagration would have ended. I have completed my remarks on the main portion of the Assembly's deliberations, and I ask honourable members, all of whom are interested in the aims and objects of the League, to devote some study to the report which the delegation has drawn up with extreme care. An important matter that was dealt with was Article 10 of the Covenant.. Even ac the First Assembly this Article was opposed by the Canadian delegation, which asked that it should be deleted, and it has since caused more discussion in the Assembly than has any other Article of the Covenant. It readsThe members of the League undertake to and preserve, as against external aggression, the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all members of t.hs League. In case' of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression, the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be f u l filled. I should like to explain to honourable that the League of Nations is the composed of two parts-the Council and the International Labour Office. Each has separate offices and machinery, but of both work with the one aim. The Council sits all through the year; it has a perThe manent secretariat, to which matters can n be referred at any time, but the General all, Assembly meets only in September of In 1921, the Second Asi n view of the great differences of n opinion expressed concerning the _ scope significance of Article 10 and .its relation to the other Articles of the Coven - nant, as well as the importance of the and political arguments both against elimination, postthe question to the T h i r d Assembly. At the T h i r d Assembly, in 1922, the delegation abandoned its original suggestion, and proposed two Those proposals its were communicated to the Governments by pracof the countries that are members of the League, with a request for , that, their opinions before the meeting of the Fourth Assembly, and. prior to my departure for Europe, the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) instructed me regarding the attitude of the Commonwealth Government upon it . On the basis of the opinions received, and after exhaustive discussion, the Juridical Committee of the Fourth Assembly proposed a resolution interpreting Article 10. That resolution declares that the Council should-take into account „rhe special ^circumstances audi geographical position of ' each State member of the' League when recommending the application of military measures as a result of aggression or the threat of aggression. Furthermore, it should be for the constitutional authorities of each State to decide in what degree the State concerned is bound to assure the execution of its obligations under Article 10 by the employment of its military forces, although the recommendation made by the Council should be regarded as of the highest importance, and should be taken into consideration by all the members of the League with the desire to execute their engagements in good faith. In my opinion, and according to the rappoi-teur of the Juridical Committee of the Assembly, the resolution would not alter, but would merely clarify the sense of Article 10,. It is important to Australia, as one of the smaller nations on the outpost of civilization, that Article 10 shall not necessarily require immediate tary intervention, and that the Assembly resolution requesting the Council to take into account the geographical position and special conditions of each State, apply only to cases where the.Council considered it necessary to recommend measures. There is no doubt that the constitutional authorities of each country have the right to decide what effect is to be given to a recommendation of the League Council. I do not think much harm would be done if Article 10 were wholly eliminated, but Canada has raised definite objection to it because of the belief that, in the event of war in any part of the Empire, the Dominion would be compelled, if called upon by the League, to send troops in support of whatever action the Council had resolved upon. It is quite clear, however, that the League of Nations could not override sovereign rights of this Parliament, instance, to decide whether or not the Commonwealth should take any part in a war over seas. On the other hand., we must recognise that a resolution of the Council could not be treated with Having entered into a bond, to act in the best interests of the world, we must accept our share of responsibility ; but that shareneed not necessarily involve the sending of troops. There may be other ways of going to the assistance of the other members of the League. The Assembly was not able formally to adopt the interpretaSir Reville Bowse. tive resolution, but it is quite clear that it will pass at a later date, for out of forty-three delegates present twenty-nine voted for it , and one-^.Persia-agains t it ; the other thirteen abstained from voting. Any resolution involving an alteration of auy article of the Covenant must have the unanimous assent of the whole Assembly. The Assembly, being confident of the importance of the interpretative resolution, and being in accord with it , decided to communicate the results of the voting to the Council. The Budget and finance matters dealt with also were of great importance. A policy of strict but judicious retrenchment was followed. Reductions were made wherever possible, a distinction always being made between the essential features of the work of the League and other activities which, though important and desirable, were not, for the present, absomililutely necessary. The financial procedure of the League is quite different from parliamentary or any other, of which I have knowledge. In 1922 it was would found necessary to constitute a committee of control. It is really a supervisory commilitary' mittee, and I quote the words of the president of the fourth committee appointed to deal with this matter in the 1922 AssemblyIn matters of finance the position of the that Secretary-General of the League of Nations is one of some difficulty. The peculiarities of his situation may best be illustrated by recalling the normal financial procedure in a Government Department. The responsible Minister at the head of a spending Department has to submit estimates for what he considers he will require to enable him to carry out his policy during the next financial year to the Finance Minis!-' who conducts a most careful scrutiny into the demands thus made upon the National exchequer, and only passes such demands as he is the prepared and able to defend in Parliament.. _ In for some countries the estimates, in addition, undergo close examination by a Budget Committee before they are submitted to Parliament. Whatever the precise method employed, the principle is the same, namely, that proposals for expenditure shall, before submislevity. sion to Parliament, first the submitted to a careful scrutiny by some body capable of giving expert advice, and entirely independent of the body which framed the policy involving the expenditure in question. It cannot therefore be considered a most desirable procedure that the Secretary-General should submit his proposals for expenditure to the Council and the Assembly before they have been examined in detail by some such body as that indicated, which is capable of subjecting - them to expert and impartial criticism. It is necessary that the Assembly which has voted a Budget for certain definite purposes should be in a position to satisfy itself that the money has been applied to those purposes. To attain this end close co-operation between the Assembly and the persons appointed to carry out the audit is essential, in so far as, in default of such co-operation, the audit too becomes a formal matter directed to ascertaining whether expenditure is ' supported by vouchers, rather than to inquiring whether any particular item of expenditure has been duly authorized, and whether the intentions of the Assembly have beeu properly interpreted'. It is particularly necessary that all cases in which a decision of the Finance Director may have been overruled by written directions from the Secretary-General be examined. To achieve this it will be necessary that the Committee of Control have power to call upon officers of the Secretariat to appear before .them and explain the circumstances attending any exceptional or extraordinary expenditure. It goes without saying that control will at the same time extend to an investigation of the question whether or not all the rules and administrative or other principles formulated have been scrupulously observed. The Assembly approved the Budget of the League for 1924, amounting to 23,328,686 gold francs-ther e are twenty-two gold francs to the £1-as compared with 25,673,508 gold francs for 1923. From the approved expenditure must be deducted a sum of 95,050 gold francs, the surplus from previous financial periods, so that the actual reduction in the 1924 Budget from that of 1923 amounts to 2,439,872 gold francs. Of that amount only 12,298,449 gold francs is for the secretariat and special organizations of the League; 7,032,295 gold francs is for the International Labour Office; 1,920,168 gold francs is for the Permanent Court of International Justice; and 2,077,774 gold francs is for the working capital fund. Honourable members will see that, although the Supervisory Commission agreed to the expenditure, the Finance Committee, of which I was a member, was able with the approval of the Commission, to arrange a considerable reduction. The first draft of the Budget, which was approved by the Supervisory Commission, provided for an expenditure of 24,870,570 gold francs. The Assembly therefore made a net reduction of 1,541,884 gold franc3 In spite of the constant increase of the activities of the League, the reduction has been made with the full concurrence of the Secretary-General of the League and the Director of the International Labour Office. For reasons of economy IH] the Assembly decided to postpone for the present the building of a Conference Hall on the site offered for the purpose last year by the canton and city of Geneva. The allocation of expenses among the members pf the League again came up for discussion. The scale adopted by the Third Assembly in 19545} is to - remain provisionally in force for 1924, except for certain modifications, of which the most important is a temporary reduction of twelve units in Japan's contribution in consideration of the terrible disaster which has overtaken that country. The Allocation Committee has, moreover, been requested to continue its task of perfecting the existing scale, in order to submit to the Fifth Assembly a definite and final scheme for the allocation of expenditure. The health organization of the League will, I believe, be of the greatest value for the collection of data, and in acting as an advisory body for th© benefit of the world.. I do not propose to deal with the whole of the proceedings, in which I took a very active part, but they are fully outlined in the papers that will be laid upon the table. The International Labour Office, which involves an expenditure of 7,000,000 gold francs per annum, has proved its value by the work it has already done to improve labour conditions in different countries. It has an extraordinarily brilliant staff, and assembles complete data regarding every trade in the world. I remind honourable members that the constitution of this office was an essential part of the Treaty of Versailles, its object being to improve the conditions of labour in all lands. So far it has not been able to do anything for Australia, but that is understandable, because labour conditions in the Commonwealth are so far in advance of those existing elsewhere that they rather represent a model for the guidance of the International Labour Office. It has done something in eastern countries. India has ratified the Convention for a sixty-hour week. It would have been - better had the provision been for an eight-hour day. We in Australia consider eight hours a reasonable time for a man to devote the best of his ability to labour. Labour conditions have also been improved in Japan and Middle Europe.",26
105,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,What were the conditions in India prior to the Convention?,30
106,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"There was no limitation of hours, and the early age at which employment was permitted was appalling. The Convention increased the age limit of labour in Japan and Middle Europe.",31
107,Mr FENTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,It is a great treaty.,31
108,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"As a result of the Convention, the hours of labour in the countries to which I have referred have been very greatly reduced, though we must remember that their people are uot comparable with ours, age with age. For instance an Indian girl, thirteen years of age would be, I suppose, on a physiological level with an Australian girl of, say, twenty-three years. comparing the conditions in what are known as black countries, we must take this fact into consideration. M.r. OKEEFE - Has there been any alteration in the hours of labour in J apan ?",31
109,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Yes , but I do not know what tliey are. The information asked for by the honourable member is, I think, contained in the report, but I am not certain. In any case it could easily be obtained by asking for it , or by consulting the last report of the previous Labour Committee. An important matter, to businessmen, was the Arbitration Protocol. This Protocol, which was unanimously adopted by the Fourth Assembly of the League, is the result of continuous discussions and negotiations, which have lasted for over eighteen months. subject was originally brought before the Economic Committee of the League of Nations as the result of strong representations received by the Board of Trade, with regard to the difficulties thrown by the courts of certain foreign countries, i u the way of giving effect to clauses in commercial contracts by which the parties agree to settle differences arising under the contracts by arbitration. As is well known, the insertion of clauses to this effect is practically universal in many trades, and many thousands of arbitrations take place every year in London alone. Unfortunately, the law of some foreign countries-for example, France-doe s not recognise the validity of general arbitration clauses, and the French Courts would entertain an action brought by one of the parties in spite of the fact that they had agreed in a contract to settle the difference by arbitration. In other countries, which more or less recognise the validity of arbitration agreements, the Courts nevertheless set them aside from time to time, and the commercial community, which attaches great importance to this matter, have become thoroughly alarmed at the process of undermining the sanctity of these contracts which has recently been going on. The object in bringing the matter before the Economic Committee was to obtain an international agreement for the recognition of arbitration claiises in commercial contracts. The Economic Committee set up a special sub-Committee of Jurists and commercial experts, When which met in London under the chairmanship of Mr F . D . MACKinnon, K . C . The report of this sub-Committee, which was strongly in favour of taking steps for the general recognition of arbitration clauses, was adopted by last year's Assembly, and circulated among the States that were members of the League. The next step was to draw up a Convention or Protocol to give effect to the recommendations. A f t e r a great deal of difficulty, arising from the different juridica l systems ancl ideas among the different States, a Protocol was drafted for the purpose, and circulated i u May last. At the recent Assembly the Protocol came up for adoption. It was found, however, that in some points the language still needed amendment to make its intention clear, and the necessary revision was carried out by a special sub-Committee set up by The the Second Committee of the Assembly. The resulting text was unanimously adopted, and the Protocol now lies open for signature. The commercial world, as represented by such bodies as the Associated Chambers of Commerce and the International Chamber of Commerce, have pressed very strongly for the signature of the Protocol. Great Britain has already signed, and it is hoped that as many Dominions as possible will sign also. Legislation will be necessary in the United Kingdom to make a slight modification in section 4 of the Arbitration Ac t 1889, in order to give full effect to the Protocol. AB ill for this purpose will be introduced by the Attorney General in due course. It is not known whether any legislation will be necessary in Australia, but, in any case, such a Bill as would be needed would be unlikely to raise controversy.",31
110,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Does that protocol relate to labour troubles?,32
111,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"No . It refers to contracts entered into by business men, and in respect of which there is provision for an arbitration in certain places. Eor the sake of convenience, the place named has generally been London. It is a commercial convention of extreme importance, I believe, to all business men. In conclusion, I should like to say that the proceedings of the Fourth Assembly of the League of Nations justify the strongest hope for the future of the League, and warrant the Government in sending the strongest delegation they can secure to represent this country at the next meeting of the Assembly. If I may be permitted, I should like to ask the right honourable the Prime Minister to give early attention to the constitution of the Australian delegation for the September meeting this year. I sincerely hope that he will be able to accept my recommendation, and that Australia will be represented by our High Commissioner, who has such an extensive knowledge of procedure, and is able to guide our representatives, especially those who go there for the first time, in matters of very great importance. I trust, also, that the Australian delegation will include a Minister of the Crown, and a representative of the Opposition.",32
112,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,It is time that was done.,32
113,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I am very glad that the Leader of the Opposition agrees with mo, because I am perfectly certain that that is the right spirit in which to approach the deliberations of the League. I am not prepared to accept the view put forward by certain people that it would be unwise io include a representative of the Opposition, on the ground that the Australian, delegation would then be speaking with two voices. I should add that, at the plenary sessions of the League Assembly, only the senior delegate has the right to vote, but all delegates have the right to vote on the several committees.",32
114,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Hav e other countries adopted that procedure?,32
115,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,I do not know.,32
116,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Does not the honourable member think that the work of the League would be more successful if all political parties were represented in the delegation ?,32
117,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I believe it would be a distinct advantage, and I am making a very strong recommendation to the Prime Minister to that effect. My position as the senior delegate representing Australia was made very easy. I received a great deal of assistance from Sir Joseph Cook, v/ho is a great tactician in matters of procedure. Again, in economic matters I had an adviser of marked ability in Mr Herbert Brookes, and in matters military .was helped greatly by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr D. Cameron), who will address honourable members on the questiou of armaments. I was also very ably assisted, and, I may add, guided, by Miss Jessie Webb on the humanitarian problems thai came before the League. I move That the following paper lie printed: League of Nations-Fourt h Assembly (2nd to 20th September, 1923)-Repor t of the Australian Delegation. Mr D. CAMEBON (Brisbane) [3.22]. -(B y leave) - I rise with pleasure to support the remarks made by my very gallant and distinguished friend, the honourable member for Calare (Sir Neville Howse), whoi has given such a comprehensive and eloquent account of the work of the Fourth Assembly of the League of Nations which inet at Geneva on the 3rd September last, and completed its deliberations on the 29th of that month. It was in exactly the same lucid manner that the honourable gentleman conveyed his views at Geneva. Sir Eric Drummond. the Secretary-General, told me that Sir Neville Howse's services were of inestimable value to the two Committees upon which he was appointed to represent Australia. The honourable gentleman has referred to the voluminous report of the delegation which he has placed on the table of the House, and I feel there remains little for me to say. I wish, however, briefly to convey to honourable members the opinions I formed as to how far this great organization has fulfilled the hopes of those who brought it into being. The Covenant of the League, I remind honourable members, is the first part of the Treaty of Versailles. I should like to refer more particularly to the work of the Third Committee, which dealt with disarmament. At the outset, I strongly support my colleague's recommendation that the Australian delegation at the next meeting of the League Assembly should include a Min- ister of the Crown, also our High Commissioner (Sir Joseph Cook), and, most decidedly, a member of the Opposition in this Parliament. It was a privilege and a pleasure to work with my colleagues, Sir Joseph Cook, Sir Neville Howse, Mr. Herbert Brookes, and Miss Jessie Webb. Miss Webb was one of a group of six women, which included Dame Edith. Littleton, who bears an honoured name in the Old Country, and Mademoiselle Vacaresco, a Roumanian poetess, who was wonderfully eloquent, and delivered a number of important speeches on many subjects, particularly on behalf of the smaller nations of Central Europe. Geneva undoubtedly recognises that the women of the world, young and old, can help to move the purposes of men and policies of nations towards eunobling ends. Unfortunately, from my point of view, I was not able to attend many of the sittings of the Committee during the first week at Geneva. The Government of the French Republic had invited the nations which are members of the League, and also other nations, to be represented at a Conference at Geneva, under the auspices of the League, to deal with the circulation and traffic in obscene .Duplications. The Government of the Commonwealth accepted the invitation, and' appointed Mi'. Shepherd as Australia's representative; but, unfortunately, it became necessary for Mr Shepherd to return to'London, afid at Sir Joseph Cook's request I took his place. Convention laid down that-- It shall be a punishable offence, for the purpose of or by way of trade or distribution or public exhibition, to make or produce or have in possession obscene writings, drawings, prints, paintings, printed matter, pictures, posters, emblems, photographs, matograph films, or any other obscene objects. Those of the contracting parties signing the Convention whose legislation was not St the time adequate to give effect to it, undertook to take or propose to their respective Legislatures the measures necessary for this purpose. I did not know very much about obscene publican tions, and I understood that the necessary legislation exists in Australia to deal Mr D. Cameron. with this matter. I think that is so. As it was not possible foy the Conferenceto come to> any decision as to the meaning, of the word "" obscene "" from an international ' stand-point, it was left to each State to decide in accordance with its own views what literature would be considered as obscene. With all due respect to the Conference, I do not think it achieved very much in that matter. I gladly accepted the Government's invitation to proceed to Geneva as. a member of the Australian Delegation to the Fourth Assembly. I went somewhat doubtful as to what the great international organization could do towards maintenance of the world's peace, but I left Geneva feeling that whatever we can do to strengthen the position of the League we should do, butthat it would be a mistake to rely on the League, as it is constituted at present, to preserve its from war. To me the most remarkable thing at Geneva was the confidence, faith, and reliance which' the small nations represented there very obviously had in the British Empire. As a race, we can claim to possess certain qualities which give people the feeling that we can be trusted. Such qualities, for instance, as a keen sense of justice, a rigid adherence to our plighted word, a real democratic practice of valuing a man for what he is, love of spiritual freedom, and a sense of political freedom. Tho League's worse enemies are those who maintain that, as at present constituted, it can keep peatfe throughout the world. The League's business is not to impose a settlement, even when a controversy is brought ""before it . It is to promote agreement, or, in the very words of the Preamble to the Covenant, "" to promote inThe ternational co-operation and to achieve international peace and security."" The League has carried out its duty in respect of international co-operation with remarkable success. The repatriation of hundreds of thousands of prisoners of cine- war, the relief of hundreds of thousands of refugees, the organization of a defence against the epidemics from the East of Europe"", the efforts made to fight against opium, and to deal with the problem of traffic in women and children, which still remains one of the disgraces of our civilization, are only a few of its activities under this heading. Its economic work includes facilitating the increase of transport between nations. The work it has done to induce the nations to agree to a convention for the enforcement of .commercial arbitration is a thing of immense importance to the commercial interests all over the world. The financial rehabilitation of Austria was also undertaken hy the League and the remarkable success secured is one of its most outstanding achievements. Then of course, there was the Brussels Financial Conference, but that was referred to by the right honourable - the Prime Ministei when, as Treasurer, he introduced his first Budget to this Parliament. When we come to its second and most important objectivethe achieving of international peace and security-it would appear that little has yet been done. Unrest still prevails in Europe, though the League has been in existence for four years. As a matter of fact, its fourth official birthday was January 10 last. It is very young, and while we know, as I have already remarked, that it cannot, as at present constituted, insure the peace - of the world, there is nothing to take its place. The League must be given .a fair chance. It i \ necessary to keep it going and to do everything to insure its continuing to function. Turning for a moment to reparations and the attendant problems, I must say that .so long as this great unsettled dispute weighs upon the economic life of the world, and embarrasses the relations between the nations, the work of the League must necessarily be enfeebled. Another limitation of the League's activities, results, 'of course, from the fact that it« membership is not universal. The United States of America, Germany, .Russia, and some smaller countries still remain outside. The Third .Committee dealt with the reduction of armaments. It was my privilege to> sit ou the Committee with Mr. Herbert Brookes as Australia's representative. Article 8 of the Covenant lays down that the members of the League are to proceed to a gradual and progressive reduction of armaments-and it also lays down a method by which that is to ""be accomplished. In conformity with the provisions of that Article the Council appointed the Permanent Advisory Commission and the 'Temporary Mixed Commission, which have been at work for the last few years. The Permanent Commission is constituted entirely of experts in naval, military, and air matters, but the Temporary Mixed Commission includes not only naval, military and air experts, but also civilian representatives and representatives of the Labour party in various countries. The Third Committee of the Fourth Assembly examined the reports of the Temporary Commission and Permanent Advisory Commission, and considered the Draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance, which is the result of the work of these Commissions, and is also the principal work which the League has undertaken in order to give effect to Article 8 of the Covenant. The Draft Treaty commences with a formal condemnation of aggression as an international crime, and a formal undertaking on the part of the contracting powers that they will not be guilty of that crime. There was considerable discussion about the exact meaning of aggression. The second principle contained in this treaty, and upon which the treaty is based, is that of mutual guarantee. It was maintained that no disarmament is practicable unless some guarantee is forthcoming for the States which are prepared to disarm, and unless that guarantee ii included in a general treaty. The Draft Treaty provides for the conclusion of complementary defensive agreements which are, in fact, purely defensive military alliances. In the ..case of these complementary agreements, States not party to them, are still required, on a decision of .the Council, to come to the aid .of the States concerned. .In the Treaty, the moral obligations imposed on a State are much more definite than those imposed in the Covenant. The real point of military interest in the Treaty is contained in these complementary .defensive agreements. As no immediate military support can be forthcoming in other cases, it was decided, at the outset of the discussions of the Third Committee, that no delegate sho.uld in any way commit - his Government to any views that were expressed. Some of the delegates at Geneva were prepared to give expression to the views ;of their respective Governments concerning this Treaty, ;but others did not know what view .their Governments would take. It a-eally did not concern us - very much at the time, because the Treaty must be submitted to all - the Governments which are members of the League. Many delegations considered that the complementary treaties would constitute a grave risk; and, personally, I feel that I must agree with that view. They might cause - an atmosphere of ill-will and suspicion, which so often creates armaments, aud it - is quite possible that they might give rise - to the old spirit which existed in Europe when nations combined to form alliances and then other nations formed similar alliances. The Brussels Financial Conference brought to the world's attention the great need for a reduction of expenditure on armaments. The proposals now 'inder consideration depend for their .idoption more upon the world's general - political situation than anything else. Mutual confidence and good-will must be re-established before there can be any betterment of the situation. The discuseussions of the Third Committee proceeded under a shadow. The trouble between Italy and Greece, following the Janiha murders, has been referred to by Sir Neville Howse. It hung like a dark cloud over Geneva throughout the period of the meetings of the Assembly. problem of disarmament is reduced to this: We cannot at present achieve disarmament, as is contemplated by the Covenant, because we are yet not sufficiently sure that our respective securities will be regarded as inviolablfe. States entering upon the obligations of this Treaty of Mutual Assistance will require to maintain elements of armed forces for use at the call of the League of Nations. commitments would be practically unlimited. The result would be likely to be an increase rather thau a decrease of armaments for some States, for, if the assistance is to be effective, it implies the existence of forces surplus to the requirements of a State for its own protection. During the discussion on the Treaty, it became evident that many of the smaller Powers had no intention whatever of assuming the world-wide liabilities which ihe Treaty would impose to place armed forces at the disposal of the Coimcil for the enforcement of its decision on aggressor States. If this Treaty is accepted by Great Britain and the Dominions, the practically unlimited naval commitments it involves will' have to be borne almost entirely by the British Empire. Third Committee was of the opinion that, although it was impossible to recomWr. D. Cameron. mend to the Governments the immediate adoption of the text of the Treaty, it considered that the draft should be sent. in its present form, and that Governments should be requested to express their views on it as soon as possible. I understand that the Commonwealth Government have received a copy of the Treaty from Geneva. I appeal to honourable members, irrespective of party or politics, to assist the League by encouraging a keener interest in its work. Whether one is for or against the League, he should ascertain what the organization has done, because only so can he formulate an intelligent opinion on world affairs during this critical period of - its history. There is not much excitement about preventing a war. No system can possibly be devised which will stereotype the world into permanent peace. The question to be solved is: ' How are these international troubles and disputes to be met? The outstanding fact is that fiftyfour nations have agreed that they will not go to war without arbitration or conThe ciliation, and that they will work together for the general betterment of world relations. That is to say, for the first time in history, the world's nations have recognised a common moral responsibility for the perservation of peace, and have constituted an organization to make that responsibility effective. The League has become a centre of conference, cooperation, and conciliation amongst The sovereign States. Undoubtedly, its record has fallen short of its ambition. No one can claim that this international organization will bring the millennium. The field for the critic is wide, but that does not help the world to progress. The League exists and functions, and it will continue to exist and function - It is young, but it is the only real hope in today's troubled affairs. It depends for its progress on world public opinion. Some say that the League of Nations is a failure because it hesitated despotically to invoke the powers which it theoretically possesses to enforce its arbitrations upon reluctant or defiant potential belligerents. Had those rash counsels prevailed, the League, ere this, would have been a thing of the past, I am afraid. Between the The perilous rocks of Utopianism on the one hand, and of reality on the other, the League must try to steer a course whicn vvill bring it slowly but surely to the goal at which it aims. It would be entirely wrong to lull ourselves into a false sense of security by imagining that the League is at present a safeguard against any fresh war. The friends of the League must recognise the truth that the task of effectively organizing world opinion against war and Avar makers has still to be performed, and that it will be a difficult undertaking Avithout the help of the United States of America. Nevertheless, I believe that an effective instrument of world peace Avill, in the end, be built up from the beginning at Geneva.",32
118,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Darling Downs-Attorney-General ) [4.44] - I am sure that honourable members would appreciate an opportunity of seeing this report in print before proceeding with the discussion. I shall, therefore, move the adjournment of the debate. But bofore doing so I Avish, with the permission of the House, to express to the delegates and sub-delegates our feelings of gratitude for the able way in which they have represented Australia at the Assembly of the League of Nations. They attended most assiduously to the - duties that devolved upon them, and were present at not only the Assembly meetings, but alsothe meetings of the various Committees. Probably some of the most important work of the League Avas done in the Committees. I trust I sneak on behalf of all honourable members in conveying to the representatives of Australia our sincere thanks for their representation of their country at the League of Nations. I ask lea\'e to continue my speech Avhen the debate is resumed. Leave granted; debate adjourned. LEAGUE OF NATIONS. PROPOSED ADVISOKY' COMMITTEE.",36
119,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Calare) [4.41]. - Wit h the consent of honourable members, I Avish to make a supplementary observation regarding the League. Those Avho have preceded me as representatives of Australia at the meetings of the League of Nations-the late Senator Millen, the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), the High Commissioner (Sir Joseph Cook), and Mr Justice Rich-hav e set a high standard. That has led me to hope that the right honourable the Prime Minister will accept, the suggestion that the men who have attended the meetings of the League' as representatives of Australia should be formed into an Advisory Committee to assist whatever Ministry may occupy the Treasury bench to deal with the difficult questions that are frequently referred to Governments by the League of Nations. Such a Committee could give great help to the Government in power. IMMIGRATION .",36
120,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT," I have here two reports, one relating to migration, and the other to the Spahlinger treatment for tuberculosis. I belieA-e that the report dealing Will migrants Avill prove interesting to honourable members on both sides of the House. We all know that a number of statements haAc been made regardr ing the migrants Avhohave come to Australia. I have tried to look carefully at the matter from every aspect, and I have not attempted to hide anything. We can judge in only two ways the physical and mental condition of migrants Avho come to this country; first, by their condition Avhen they are examined in the ports of embarkation, and, secondly, by their condition Avhen they arrive at the ports of disembarkation. Are they fit for the Avork, to do which they Avish to come to this country ? Out of 55,000 migrants, only sixty-five have been returned. Of these, first in the scale are the mental deficients, of whom there were tAventy-one. ""Mental deficiency"" does not mean that their education Avas inferior to our standard. It is a nice name applied to persons Avhom one has been in the habit of describing as lunatics. It is absolutely impossible by any medical examination here or in England to discover certain diseases without a perfectly clear history of the patient. Medical men are sometimes credited Will being able to discover the disease from which an individual is suffering, merely by looking' at him. It is true that oue can see those diseases which are very near the brink, but certain mental diseases and epilepsy cannot be so discovered. We had the greatest difficulty Will epilepsy during the war. The only possible way in which to discover it is by personal observation, or the observation of a seizure by some one upon whom, we can. rely - Eor that reason a provision wasinserted in the Immigration Act that within a period of two years persons suffering from that disease could be returned to the place from which, they came. Still, some of the cases to which I refer ought not to have been sent out. ""When I presented this report to the Prime Minister Bruce), he said, ""Do your tions interfere in any way with the Commonwealth Immigration Act?"" "" No. The report simply contains certain recommendations which I believe will further aid in protecting against the influx of mental or physical decrepits."" He said, ""I shall write an instruction that the recommendations put into force."" They were thus put intoforce on 1st November, 1923. .There is a special reason why I was very careful i ii dealing with these cases. It is very easy for us to say, "" Send them back,"" 1 after ail, one has to think of the individual. He has sold his home; he has made arrangements in the country in which he was living to settle in Australia, make it his final place of abode. He is not able to go back. Even though he incurs no expense, he cannot himself in the Old Country. it is essential' that, in any action taken, e\'ery effort should be made to see that these men are protected by the most carefill examination in England in order; that 1 lie necessity shall not arise to send them back from Australia. There is another reason which affects The invalid' pension provision the Invalid and Old-age Pensions fixes five years' residence as a qualification for receiving the pension. person in every 1,000-a very small percentage-at the end of five years made a claim upon the Pensions the total paynieuts for the first ten years would be £62,562 ; but the annual in the tenth year would be £11,3'75.

First, there could be appointed special Australian medical officers to carry out the examination in the United Kingdom. But it must not be for(Mr gotten that there are 2,300 medical recommenda- officers now on the staff of examiners. Secondly, it would be necessary to. appoint I said, in Australia observation institutions, so that when these persons landed they would be placed under observation for Australia some months. Possibly that might be a good thing, because you would have an opportunity of continuing their training be and fitting them for the avocationsthey would have to follow in Australia. Those occupations are quite strange to the people who have earned their living in the United Kingdom.

Having reviewed the matter very carefully, I do not believe that there is any justification for the alarming reports which have heen made in reference to the mental and physical condition of migrants coming to this country. Those migrants are not the sweepings of the streets; they are not the criminals of the United Kingdom. The immigration machinery prevents more than an isolated case of that class getting through. I admit that one often sees at disembarkation men, women, or children who are palpably unfit to do any work. When I was inspecting my first boat I was horrified to see coming up the gangway two or three migrants who, one could tell from only a casual glance, were totally unfitted to be citizens of any country. I had them put aside and sent to a hospital, so that I could go carefully into the matter to ascertain how that class could possibly get through. The Minister for Home and Territories has the right, if representations are made by any State, to grant special permission to a migrant to come in so long as he has not a disease communicable by association to people in Australia, on receiving a bond signed by the relatives of the nominated migrant that n claim will not be made against Australia for pension or* other .assistance. These three cases were in that category. Mr ""WEST - It would be safer to keep them out altogether.",36
121,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I looked into these cases very carefully, and honourable members will find them all dealt with in the report. If the guarantee is of sufficient value, these migrants will not become a charge upon the Government. TREATMENT OF DISEASES. SPAHLINGER TUBERCULOSIS TREATMENTINSULIN FOR DIABETES:-CANCER-RE - outline JUVENATIO N TREATMENT.",39
122,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Calare) [ 5 . 0 ] - I propose to refer now to Spahlinger treatment fortuberculosis. The prevalence of tuberculosis is a matter of international importance, and no stone - tuberculosis. should be left unturned in our efforts to discover an effective and permanent method of combating this disease. Tuberduring culosis is responsible at the present time for 10 per cent, of all deaths. Statistics show that in the United Kingdom in 1922 there wore 50,000 deaths fro m this disease. In Australia, where, because of climatic advantages, better housing and other conditions, which one would expect would reduce the number of cases of tuberculosis, there were over 3,000 deaths from the disease in 1922.",39
123,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Wor k in deep mines had much to do with that.,39
124,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"That , no doubt, accounted for many deaths f the disease. We can reasonably assume from the statistics that for every death from tuberculosis there are five cases under medical treatment. This that in the United Kingdom there were about 250,000 cases of tuberculosis i year. That is why I think I am justidotes fied in saying that the prevalence of disease is of international importance. But the death rate in the United K i dom and in Australia is nothing to toll taken by this disease in other counf tries. Our death rate is very small compared with the death rate from disease in some countries and the death rate in the United Kingdom, yet the drain upon our population by the disease is appalling. I , therefore, consider that it is most important that we should deal with the question of its alleged cure and treatment quite dispassionately. In referring to Spahlinger, I want to be very careful to use his own words. He has .spent over sixteen years in the study and treatment of tubercular disease. He is a very keen enthusiast of Swiss nationality, ancl is by profession a lawyer. I refer to his profession because I have to comment on it later. Most of the sixteen years has been devoted to bacteriological study of the disease, which means a study of the lif e history of the causes of the disease. I want to briefly his technique, and explain w h at . his intention and hope is. He has. fitted up a most expensive laboratory at the Geneva, where experiments are carried out with the intention of preparing vaccines for the treatment and cure of I should like honourable members to accept, from me the statement that I make use of his own words the many interviews which took place between us. When I come to the criticism of his words I will make it equally plain that I am not quoting him.",39
125,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Did the honourable member say "" m a n y interviews""?",39
126,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Yes ; many.,39
127,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,I understood the honourable gentleman had only one interview with Spahlinger.,39
128,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I lived in the same hotel with him for a period of one month; but I had only one interview with him at his laboratorj'. If I had r o m spent six months at his laboratory I should probably not have been much wiser, as I am not a qualified bacteriologist. I do not wish to delude the House means as to my knowledge as a bacteriologist, because I possess none, or very little. n one Spahlinger experiments to provide antiagainst various poisons that cause the tuberculosis. To use his own statement, he has isolated, he believes, twenty-two n g - separate poisons which are associated the with the disease. Havin g obtained sera r o m twenty-two horses, he then prepares as a serum which he utilizes in dealing the with his cases. He states that if 100 horses could be provided for him, he could provide sufficient material to deal witli i0,000 cases of tuberculosis at one time. He injects twenty-two horses with certain toxins he jhas obtained from animals, and having produced in the bodies of the horses in a certain time twenty-two antitoxins, he blends these into one to make his complete vaccine. He asks for financial assistance to enable him to continue his research work until he is prepared to place before the public the f u ll details of his discovery. Still quoting Mr. Spahlinger, I may say that he is not prepared to sell his secrets for commercial exploitation, although he assured me on numerous occasions that he was offered £250,000 in cash for them. He purposes preparing a sufficient quantity of sera and vaccine to permit of distribution in the chief countries throughout the world, so that his cure may be exhaustively tested. It will take a period of not less than one or two years to prepare the partial sera and complete vaccine. He has spent all his available money, has hopelessly involved his father's finances, and has disposed of many animals. He says that he will require at least £40,000 to produce the partial sera. His friends, in an interview with them, assured me that not less than a minimum of £100,000 will be necessary. I may say that, subsequently, I heard Spahlinger address a meeting in London in October, in which he said that from £100,000 to £110,000 would bo sufficient to enable him to redeem his property, and continue his experimental researches. He is very keen that no persons should present themselves for treatment at Geneva, as he is not in a position to treat them, owing to the supply of sera and vaccine being exhausted. I should like to say that the treatment by Spahlinger was commenced between 1912 and 1914, and during those years he treated a large number of cases, a certain number of which I had an. opportunity of examining in London. There is no doubt whatever that those cases do not show evidence of disease now, but there is no evidence that they suffered from the disease when they commenced the treatment. I ask honourable members to recognise that that is very important. The British Bed Cross, after exhaustive inquiries by their lay committee and. special bacteriologist, a man of repute, and with the sincere desire to assist, paid £10,000 to the credit of Spahlinger under an agreement which he accepted. I was informed of this by the chief of the British Eed Cross, ancl have no reason to doubt his statement. To this sum, Lord Cowdray offered to add £10,000, and the public of the United Kingdom a further sum of £10,000, making a total of £30,000. Unfortunately the work was not carried out, and the money deposited in the bank by the British Bed Cross was returned by Spahlinger. The British Government have offered every inducement to Spahlinger to treat selected cases-under competent medical supervision Avithout asking for disclosures of the methods of his preparation of vaccine, but could obtain nobetter result. Spahlinger observes the very strictest secrecy as to his methods, ancl in consequence the members of the medical profession have A-ery little material on which to base any opinion as to the efficacy of his treatment. Every effort has been made by the public to induce the British Government to assist him financially, and honourable members are aware that similar efforts have been made in this country. The Public Health Department of the CommonAvealth has been in close touch with Spahlinger since April, 1921, as the files of the Department disclose. I directed attention to the profession of Mr Spahlinger because much is made of the fact that he is not a medical man. It is suggested by some that he has been "" crabbed"" by the medical profession, and some have described him as a charlatan. I ask honourable members to set aside both of these unworthy suggestions. Spahlinger is not a charlatan in any sense of the Avord. He is a man who has devoted years of study to this disease, and has every reason to believe the statements he makes with reference to the progress he has made. As an illustration of the work of a non-medical man, I need only refer to Pasteur, the greatest bacteriologist the world has known, whose name is revered in every civilised country. He Avas not a medical man. He was a schoolmaster when he commenced to study bacteriology, and he advanced beyond any other man in the history of civilization. There Avas no effort to "" crab "" him, and all Avho have any knOAvledgc of the Avork he did must bow their heads when contemplating the marvellous results he achieved during his life. But everything he did, every step he advanced, every progress he made in dealing with disease, was placed before the Avorld Avithout delay. What I feel to he so difficult in Spahlinger's case is that he has never placed his cards on the table. Never at any time has he been able to say, "" I have got so far. Give me money to carry on."" That seems to me to be an extraordinary thing.. I think he would be well advised if he placed all his cards, on the table and admitted the scientific world to his confidence. If he took that course I have no hesitation in saying that he Would have no difficulty in securing all the financial assistance he requires to continue his researches. I know that this matter hasaroused very considerable feeling, because of the amount of correspondence I have myself received since I returned. I have received more abusive correspondence- I mean, oE course, in reference to my profession-sinc e I returned than at any time in my life, and haA^e been begged to intervene on behalf of sufferers Will the Government. As I have tried to show, it is impossible for me to recommend the Government to take actionin this matter. To continue my report, I may add that at the time of my departure from London, in November, nothing definite had been done to provide' the assistance which Spahlinger and his committee ask for. I have since been informed by the press that New Zealand is prepared to make a large donation to Spahlinger. I do not know Avhether that statement is true. I have been unable to confirm it. In revieAvihg this case it has appeared to me very strange that a man Avho has been studying this disease for eighteen years, and Avho claims to have cured so many advanced: oases, is unable to obtain recognition in his OAVU country, or in any country in Europe. Switzerland has not so treated other men AVIIO have claimed to be able to reduce human mortality. Mr E. RILEY - A prophet is not without honour, save in his OAVII country.",39
129,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"-I have carefully reviewed a great mass of evidencej and regret that I am unable to recommend this Government to spend any money in connection with the Spahlinger treatment of tuberculosis. I regret it the more because I can hold out nohope to the many sufferers from tuberculosis' of any recoA'cry by means of this professed cure. I believe, however; that tuberculosis is a disease which tends to cure itself.. The information obtained during the last few years reveals an enormous percentage of tubercular cases in which the patients have so completely recovered that no evidence of itspresence is found onexamination. In confirmation of that statement, there is the evidence, gathered at a large public hospital in Australia over a period of tAvo or three years, that in 60 percent, of cases in which there Avere traces of tuberculosis, post-mortem examination revealed that the lesion had healed. Further, in tracing the history of the cases so far as was possible, no evidence was found that any of the persons had Post a day's Avork, or had been under medical treatment for the malady. That statement is confirmed by statistics from Europe dealing Will cases of persons whose death occurred suddenly, whether' by accident orotherwise. In 90' per cent, of the cases of men and women over foTty-five. years of age the pathologists found no trace of tuberculosis.. Sufferers from this disease will find consolation in the knoAvledge that it has a tendency to cure itself under certain conditions, most of which exist in Australia. That fact causes difficulty Avhen dealing with migrants-; they are so desirous of obtaining for themselves the benefits of the climate of Australia that in various ways they endeavour to avoid the medical examination.",41
130,Mr FEU ION,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,What is the attitude of NeAv Zealand with respect to this matter ?,41
131,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"The information I had obtained up to November last, supplemented by letters received subsequently, indicated that New Zealand had promised support; but I . have been unable to get later confirmation. I tender my sincere thanks to a number of those Avho Avere felloAv students during nay ten years of study - me n 1 Avho now hold important positions: on the teaching staffs of various medical schools-for their invaluable assistanceThey gave up their time willingly, and passed on to me the results of their study of the Spahlinger' method, and of the treatment of tubercular diseases by means of injections. I tender my sincere thanks also to the Minister of Health, and to the British Red Cross, for their assistance.",41
132,Mr MAHONY,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Do the j>ost-mortems to which you have referred show that the disease has a tendency to cure itself?,42
133,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"The authorities followed, so far as they were iiblc, the history of the cases they were reviewing, and found no evidence that the persons concerned had received any medical treatment or had lost a day's work becauso of the Evidently this disease does tend to cure itself Under conditions which exist in Australia. Its incidence is decreasing, as is the mortality it causes. statistics, to me, are conclusive evidence that at least this appalling malady is on the - decrease",42
134,Mr MAHONY,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Then we may become iiiunune to it.,42
135,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I sincerely hope that may be so. This report has not been an easy one to prepare, nor has its preparation been a very pleasing duty, for right from the commencement I could see no hope for sufferers in this alleged cure. I do not say that there is nothing in it, but I have studied the question very carefully, and can see no v.viclence which would justify me in spending one penny of my own money on ie, and, therefore, I cannot recommend this Government to spend the people's money on it.",42
136,Mr COLEMAN,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Did the honourable member obtain the opinion of Dr Dreyer ? - Sir NEVILLE HOWSE - He is one of the illustrious colleagues to whom I have referred. I asked him if he had any hope of the success of his treatment. He said, ""Very little; but we may be one step forward in the history of the germ."" Coming to the subject of insulin, my opinion is that insulin is uot a curative agency for diabetes. That it has been the means of reducing the mortality in certain cases-wher e diabetic coma is present-is not denied. Diabetic coma is clue to sugar in the blood, and persons who get it simply fall down and die within a day or two. That condition has, for the time, been cured by the use of insulin. there is no doubt that this material has an extraordinary effect, and is of very great value in reducing the quantity of sugar in the urine-. In the lower extremities of persons suffering from diabetes, mortification sometimes sets in, and when a surgical operation is necessary to sever a limb or portion of a liinb, insulin is of inestimable value, as it controls the quantity of sugar during the time required for the operation and convalescence from it. The difficulty is that once a person takes to insulin as a cure he must continue disease. to use it. The action of this drug is still being inquired into by scientists, but up to the present their view is that it must be injected into the The blood, and not given by the mouth. Another difficulty attending its use is that it cannot be given generally, as it requires an examination of the blood by a skilled - bacteriologist at frequent intervals. A further question which must be considered is that of cost. Even as late as July last, insulin cost 4s. to 5s. a dose, ancl a dose is required once a day for many months, and possibly for many years. The price has since been reduced to about l f d . a Unit, the dose ueing 14 units, and it is hopedthat there will be a further reduction through the establishment of the Federal Government laboratory.",42
137,Mr WEST,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Would it be against the ethics of the profession for the honourable member, with all the information he has obtained throughout the world, to give a prescription which would benefit persons suffering from tuberculosis?",42
138,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member is asking too much. I .now pass on to the incidence of cancer. While this subject may not interest the younger members of this House, it is of considerable importance to all who are getting up in years. Judging from the rapid increase of this disease in Australia, a good many of us here will have an unpleasant acquaintance witli it wit&in a few years. There is no question that it is on the increase, not only here; but in other countries of the world. Cancer is difficult to detect in its earlier stages, and a great number of persons present themselves for medical treatment when the disease has progressed beyond any possible hope of benefit being obtained from treatment. There are only two possible linesof treatment known to me. One is operative interference, which, however no operator claims to be a cure. Yet there is irrefutableevidence to the effect that such, treatment does prolong the period of life. Let me give one illustration. When, in 1890, I was dealing with the subject of cancer of the breast, under Sir Frederick Treves, the duration of life from the day that the disease was noticed did nob generally exceed months; today the duration following an operation, is from seven to ten years. But while an may give an extension of life, patient should be operated on while the disease is in its early stages. also the treatment by X-rays and radium. The value of both in skin cancers is indisputable; it is quite clear that enormous benefit does ensue and that a great number are cured. But in deep which involves the play of the rays for hours upon the hidden organs of the body, although supporters of this treatment claim that it effects cures, the evidence I gathered in England that ib is not considered to hold out even a reasonable prospect of prolonging The majority of doctors say that have never had any evidence that such treatment cures the disease. An extraordinary fact is the. increase of cancer in the two decades, 1855^65 and 1865-75. The increase among men is so alarming, according to later statistics, the best we can hope for, there be no further increase, is that seven out of eight men who at the age of fifty-five years will escape. I lay some stress upon this fact, because I was able to induce the Assembly of the League of Nations to set up certain for the organization of public health, ancl I am urging by letter that the first act of this body shall be to institute the study of this disease in every country to the League. It has been suggested that an Empire Cancer Research should be established, which would enable - research to be carried out simultaneously in every part of the British Empire; but it will be essential to have one centre wliere results can be co-ordinated, and where investigators in isolated like Australia will be able to ascertain from week to week the progress made by fellow workers. I hope I shall have the support of honourable members when I ask the Prime Minister to set aside a certain amount for such research work. the combating of disease is one of the Sir ""Neville Howse. greatest responsibilities of the National Parliament. We cannot idly watch the advance of diseases on both animal and plant life. There should be a research fund which would enable the employment of the trained brains of the younger eighteen generation; for remember that every Ausof life, tralian who has made even the smallest progress in the scientific world has had to operation leave this country in order to continue his the studies.",42
139,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Is cancer attributable There is to any general cause ? Sir' NEVILLE HOWSE - Medica l science has not even the most rudimentary knowledge of its cause, and that is from it, why the discovery of a cure seems so diffiof cases cult. Once the cause were discovered therapy, the remedy would be in sight. It is not hereditary or infectious. The Australian State authorities take much greater interest in public health than does the Commonwealth, but there is a showed regrettable lack of co-ordination of their activities. I am still hopeful life. that a Royal Commission will be apthey pointed to inquire carefully and full y into the health conditions in Australia, for they are really alarming. If one asks a business man if he is successful he immediately produces his audited accounts for the year. What audited accounts that have we of the health of the community, should which is an asset of national importance ? True, there has been a partial stocktaking arrive in respect, of health. Prior to the war we were able to get guidance from the results of the examination of boys about to become cadets, and, later, of youths passing machinery from the cadet organization into the citizen forces. Those statistics are worth studying. Although the medical officers recognised that the training incidental to belonging the cadet system would be of great benefit, a very large percentage of the boys were Fund unfit toi undergo such training. The examination of invalid and old-age pensioners, also, disclosed a large percentage of persons whose diseases could have been cured _ if they had been treated when they were young. countries Statistics show that 35 to 40 - per cent, of children examined at the school commencement age of five years gave evidence of disease which could have been prevented or remedied in infancy. That is an appalling indictment against Surely those who are responsible foil the public health, and I ask that there shall be definite co-operation between the States in regard to this inatter. The Leader of rejected. the Opposition (Mr Charlton), when enunciating his last election policy, in the very strongest terms on this ject, and the then Prime Minister (M W. M . Hughes) gave the strongest reasons why a Royal Commission health should be appointed. quently, the State Premiers agreed that an inquiry should be held by public health officers, but, although that underunfit taking was given twelve or fourteen months ago, no sitting has yet been held. I ask the House toassist in promoting the knowledge of disease prevention. No 13,808 soldiers. country deals more liberally and kindly than does Australia with those who are suffering, from disease, but is it not reasonable to claim that more attention should be paid to the prevention of disease? Honourable members will ha.rdly credit that the statistics for 1922 that the incidence of typhoid fever, which is a preventible disease, was said greater in Australia than it was amongst the 5,000,000 white troops herded towe gether in France under all sorts of conI ditions during the years 1916 and 1917. The military medical au'thorities were able to eliminate typhoid; otherwise the camThere paign could not have continued for two years under conditions that made decent sanitary arrangements impossible. Sir GRANVILL E RYRIE - Does the honits orable member recommend general inocution lation as was carried out amongst the troops in France?",43
140,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I recommend Territory inoculation plus general hygiene. Inoculamight tion alone is not sufficient. In the Army Jones was not allowed to become a menace to Brown; but in the Australian country districts nobody is concerned about the health of Brown. If a stranger came to Australia to investigate its sanitation, would we not ask him on to avoid many . country hotels i every State of the Commonwealth? - becaus These places, which are established f convenience of the travelling population, are a menace to the public health. Consider, also, the insanitary condition of many emporiums that store and supply food to the public. I assure honourable members that they are a discredit to people. The second part of the auditing of our health is the examination of recruits offering for active service. Of 386,357 men examined, 130,911 were A proclamation issued in October, 1916, called up all single men spoke and widowers without children between subthe ages of 21 and 35 years, and of r . 190,869 who reported only 110,863, or 58.1 per cent., were passed as fib.

There arc sound physiological reasons against introduction. The only possible soluof our Northern Territory problems is, as I suggested some time ago, that if we find it impossible to develop the with white labour, we be able to do something by allowing sterilized black labour in for a certain period. That is the only condition upon which I would admit black labour to this or any other white man's country. In conversation with my medical friends at Geneva, I found that Australia's place the medical chart was between the two n sets of countries-the blacks and whites e of our statistical position with o r the regard to typhoid and other diseases showing that in preventive medicine we arc twenty years behind other progressive countries. This was not very nice for me as a representative of Australia. If ever I have the honour to represent Ausour tralia again' at the League of Nations Assembly, I hope that this charge will not be levelled against Australia then. There is only one other inatter to which I desire to refer, and that is the rejuvenation treatment of aged people. regret that I am unable to offer those who desire that treatment very much consolation.

As the Honourable the Attorney'General has remarked, they are most in formative and will be of very great help to us in our future deliberations, especially with regard to health matters Leave granted; debate adjourned.

143,Mr MANNING,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Macquarie) [S.O] This House is unanimous in regretting, I that the condition of the f r u it industry necessitates the introduction of this Bill . The industry is most important to Australia, and it must be developed if we are to succeed in our policy of closer settlement. It produces new wealth. It has been truth full y said that Australia is being carried on a sheep's back, because of the fine market we have for our wool. Unfortunately that has led some peopio to say that we are devoting too much energy to increasing our agricultural areas, and are not giving sufficient attention to the development of our flocks. If I desire, we divide our sheep into more flocks ancl place them on land now under .agriculture it will not increase the value of the wool produced, and the aggregate wealth of the country will be. decreased by the value of agricultural products formerly produced on that laud. It may be hotter to have ten .flocks of 500 The hon- each, than five - flocks of 1,000 each, but it would not improve our position much. The fruit-growing industry, - which is in such a parlous condition at present, will, under proper conditions, produce new wealth from country that is not of great .value for purposes other than fruit-growing. A great deal of the country on which f r u it is now grown .is of 'little use for grazing purposes. Not long ago we considered that the rich river flats and the beds of creeks were the only .places in which we could expect successfully to grow f r u it . Further experience Jhas.shown that orchards produce best when they are on the sides of hills. Formerly those locations were rejected. The Government has shown that it realizes the wisdom of fostering this industry by paying the bounty which this Bill w i ll authorize. Thousands of tons of f r u it have - been preserved which would have been wasted had the bounty not been paid. Important as that aspect - is, it is ..only .a detail in the real problem . which . faces . us. - The whole industry would have .been in a chaotic condition had the thousands p.m., of tons which have been, preserved owing to ' the payment of - bounty, been forced on the local market. .The-.Minister .for .Trade and - Customs. (Mr Austin Chapman) may .certainly claim'to have helped the ifruit-growers^by - paying. this bounty. Fruit-growers all through the country Tealize that he has heen.a:friend to them. We devoutly hope that there will be no need in the future for such assistance. Wc all wish to see the indiistry put on a better footing than it has had up now, - and we have every reason to hope that the worse days are past. If we the expected Imperial preference for our fruit, it will be a great advantage, and will not increase the price of fruit to British consumer. The proposal is that we shall be given a preference of 5s. per cwt. instead of lOd. per cwt. as at present, that we shall be given additional conwhp sideration respecting sugar. It will amount to much more than the Governcent, ment is paying at present on preserved fruit that is exported, for it will mean about 2d. a tin as against in lfd. A great deal has been done to increase our local market, but more must still be done. More scientific marketing of our frui t both at abroad is urgently needed. A bulletin issued by the College of Agriculture of the University of Wisconsin gives a. definition of ""marketing"" which is well for the lb. worthy of our attention. It is as follows f- Marketing is much more than simply gelling. It is (he rendering of all those necessary vices between the farmer and the consumer which make it possible for consumers to the products of farms. Marketing includes from those in. the shops. such services as assembling, grading and standardizing, packaging, processing, porting, storing', financing, distributing, spreading and selling. Scientific marketing takes into account all the avenues by which the consumer may be reached. The honourable  said that the solution of the problem lay do.. in cheapening the means of transport. Undoubtedly, we need cheaper transport; that is only one way t.o meet the difficulty. The Treasurer- (.Ur. Earle Page) said climod to buy. that a much larger local market had be.eii opened tising. I belieye that it. is possible to secure three satisfied consumers in Australia for every, indifferent one that. have at. present}. We cou,td easily market the. whole of our fruit, in Australia i conditions were unproved. I Avish see a greatly increased local consumption. It should be possible for e w y person in Iwhere, this country who is earning the basic wage to buy as much fruit as he desires for himself and his family and yet give the producer a fair price. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) said that the middlemen, Avhom he termed to ""parasites,"" made undue profits out. of the industry. He gave an instance of ' get citrus fruit, which had been put into cold storage, being sold for three times it the price at which it Avas purchased. I the have some knowledge of the condition of the retail trade in Sydney. The middleman is not the only one Avho exploits the conand sumer. A look at the names of the people .conduct the retail fruit trade in Sydnot ney will convince any one that 95 per of the trade is in the hands of people of one nationality. Without .a doubt they are monopolists. At the fruit barrows the street one may buy excellent fruit ab half, or even a third, of the price which is asked for it in the city shops.",45
144,Mr MCGRATH,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,The street barrowhome and men have no rent to pay.,46
145,Mr MANNING,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,I know that.,46
146,Mr WEST,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,And they only give 14 ozs.,46
147,Mr MANNING,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I admit that it is urgently necessary that fruit shall be marketed honestly. I buy f r u it pracsertically every day I am in Sydney, and my experience is that I get quite as fair iiso a deal from the men in the street as One has to transwatch all of them. Without a doubt risk dishonest lnajvketiug militates largely against an increase in the consumption of fruit in Australia. If people could he sure that they would get the same memquality fruit as they see in the front of a display they would buy more than they They know, however, that the quality of frui t a.t the back is much poorer than that Avliich they see in the front, and, therefore, they are not inDr MA LONE r - Peopl e can be punished up by adverfor "" topping "" fruit.",46
148,Mr MANNING,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"It is a pity that Ave that law is not enforced more often than it is. Honest tmajr'ketjng .of fruit would f the considerably increase the local consumpto tion. Last month I was in Tasmania, which, we are told is the land of fruit. saw fruit hanging on the trees eveary^ bub I came to the conclusion that the Tasmanians grew fruit but did not eat it. The only fruit I saw on the tables at the hotels where I stayed was: a few half-green bananas. The right orable the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) and Senator Wilson, by selling our accumulated fruit in"" England they were there, cleared the of all old stock. That fruit was soaked up by the people there like a sponge soaks up water, showing that there is an unlimited market for us to exploit. we must market our fruit properly. Some useful suggestions have been made during this debate but some of the other suggestions made are amusing to those who understand the industry. The honourable member for Hume said that the solution of the problem was the establishment of State canning factories. He pointed to what the Queensland Government done as a shining example to follow. Apparently know that almost on the of his own electorate he has the largest State cannery in Australia. cent, of the whole of the fruit canned in Australia last year passed through Leeton factory. In the 1923-24 season 4,465 tons of fruit was handled at Leeton and only 2,795 tons in the other New South Wales canneries. A considerable quantity of the 2,795 bons was Victorian and Tasmanian fruit. Sixty-one per cent, of the fruit canned in New Soubh Wales was canned at the Leeton factory. honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay), said truly that Queensland has abig fruit industry. In that State 5,832 tons were preserved, but only 600 tons of that quantity went through the State canneries. Eleven per cent, of Queensland's fruit went through the State factories, as against 61 per cent, of the New South Wales total. The honourable member for Werriwa complained most of this bounty went into pockets of the monopolists were running the canning He said that, to a great extent, it was for the benefit of those factories. the State canning factories in New Soubh Wales, and that in Queensland, draw the same rate of bounty as is drawn by private factories. Yet neither is paying its way, showing that if the private companies are making an undue profit their is better managed than are the State canning factories. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen) said that the capital involved in the Mr Manning. hon- of the Yanco irrigation area at completion would be £10,000,000. In addition, we have a number of other works in while which Government money has been in market vested, and there is a very large amount locked up in private orchards. It is absolutely essential, therefore, that, irrespective of any party advantage, we sliould But endeavour to j>lace the industry on a satisfactory basis. The bogy of overproduction has been held un. We have been told that the only remedy is to produce less. That, would not prove to be a solution of the present trouble. We must produce more, and increase our markets both at home and abroad. It is necessary to give attention to grading, had standardization, and honest marketing. for us There are numerous opportunities for extending our operations in both our own he does not and the Home market. A friend of mine borders has just returned from a fairly extensive visit to the Old. Country. He and his Fifteen per f a m i ly lived there for a few months. On one occasion he asked the local the grocer for some Australian peaches, and was informed that he had none. He said, "" If you get a case I will take a dozen tins from you."" The grocer obtained the f r u it , and was so satisfied that he recommended it to his customers, and sold dozens of cases. My friend asked him on another occasion for some apriThe cots. The grocer replied, "" Do you put up apricots?"" My friend went to Aus^ tralia House and brought at in back. The result was that the grocer placed orders for apricots. I have not the slightest doubt thab there are thousands of similar opportunities for extending our market canning in Great Britain. The little extra amount required to give the growers a profitable price could easily be added if the market that were thoroughly exploited. We have in the New South Wales an organization called who the Fruit growers' Association of New factories. Soubh Wales. One of the leading men in the movement recently said, "" The Both organization and standardization of our f r u it industry is well on the way, and it only requires more synrpathetic consideration from the Government in the matter factory of necessary and long-promised legislation conclusively to enable it to go forward by leaps and bounds."" "" If that legislation is of a business federal character, I trust that the Minister will do his best to> see that it is brought forward at the earliest possible moment. improvement  prohibition of the importation of citrus fruits?",46
149,Mr MANNING,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,I am not sufficiently conversant with the f r u it industry to be able to indicate the nature of the legislation asked for.  things which the New South Wales citrus fruit-growers want is the prohibition of the importation of citrus fruits.,48
150,Mr MANNING,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"The retail trade in Sydney, probably out of loyalty to the nationality of the people concerned, are putting Italian lemons on the market and are not stocking the local lemon. '",48
151,Mr MATHEWS,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,It has not oeen possible to purchase local lemons during the last month or two.,48
152,Mr MANNING,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"L o c a l lemons are not to be bought in the shops even when a large quantity is available. It has been suggested that the proper way in which to deal with this matter is by co-operation, with Government assistance. That is a very excellent idea. In no way would the Government be more justified in interfering than in helping any co-operative movement, but we must have a minimum of Government assistauce and a maximum of co-operation.",48
153,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Y a r r a ) glanced at this Bill when it was laid on the table of the House, and I saw that there was an opportunity to make quite a number of fine suggestions to the Government. Further inquiries and a perusal of the newspaper files, however, showed me that the measure refers to something that has already been donethe bounty has been paid, the f r u it has been canned, most of it . has been eaten, and the money has been spent. Yet the Bill is solemnly placed before the House, and we are asked to discuss and amend it . I siippose that cannot be helped. I have come to the conclusion that the Government brought it down because they had no other business. They expected us to discuss the Imperial Conference and the Imperial Economic Conference, at which nothing was accomplished, and they - anticipated adjourning on Friday, after two weeks' discussion of that question, to enter upon a three weeks' holiday. I did not feel inclined, until this afternoon, to lend a hand to the Government. To-day I listened to a very fine speech delivered by the honourable member for Calare (Sir the Neville Howse). He told us that one person in every eight is due to contract some malignant trouble which willtake him from this world. One of my friends calculated that nine members of this Chamber were due to go. Having listened to the honourable member, and shivered in company with other honourable members, a feeling of brotherly love and kindness stole over me, and suggested that, for once in my life, I might help the Government out of a difficulty. I had many pearls of wisdom which I was going to place before the Minister, but it is useless to do so now. I had much sage advice to offer. I might have suggested some amendment to the definition clause of the Bill . That is the most illuminating clause I have ever seen in a Bill . We are told that "" canner "" means "" any person who cans f r u it ; "" that a cannery means a cannery, that f r u it means f r u it , and that the Comptroller-General means the Comptroller-General. The Bill has given a wonderful scope to honourable members. I do not remember a debate initiated on such a simple proposition, which provided scope for so much discussion of such a wide range of subjects. I think that every subject which can be discussed on a motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply [8.22] - I has been discussed. I heard the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) speak in glowing terms last night. He contemplated fields of apricots, peaches, and bananas, all in a flourishing condition. He viewed from the heights the glorious future of the f r u it industry, notwithstanding the present depression. I listened also to the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) . He descended to the depths of despair. There was no beautiful vision in his mind. According to him , the f r u it industry in Australia can be saved only by the importation of black-grown sugar for use in the canning of the f r u it , the abolition of all Arbitration Courts in Australia, cheap labour in the orchards, and Free Trade respecting everything excepting the article which he and his friends want to produce. This great industry was extended by putting into it returned soldiers, who were promised that they would return to a new world after the war and get all the good things that this country could offer. It is remarkable that the Government should have placed our returned soldiers i u an industry so awful and wretched that it can survive only with black-grown sugar, Free Trade, and cheap labour. That is the prospect held out by the honourable member for Echuca. When he was charged with those things last night lie rose in wrath to make a personal explanation. I thought that perhaps he had said something which he did not mean-that he did. not intend that we should lift the sugar embargo which protects our white-grown sugar industry from the black labour of other tries; he did not mean the adoption of a Free Trade policy, or the abolition of Arbitration Courts. B ut no; the only explanation he had to make was . that not at any time, although he had worked upon the railways and was compelled to leave that employment because - of sweated conditions, had he belonged to a labour organization. My heart sank .further at the thought thab the Parliament of this country should have in it a man who could boast of his refusal to stand by his working mates while, on the contrary, as a representative of an agricultural industry, his whole advocacy was of black labour, cheap white labour, and Free Trade. If he were consistent one oould understand him. He supports this Bill . Is this a Free Trade measure ? It is a measure for the protection of a local industry. I do not go so far as to say that it sets out bo socialize the industry, but it is a step in that direction. Ib, ab auy rate, .indicates social interest in a great industry, or an indxisbry that ought to .be great. If there is one industry that ought to flourish in a country like this it is the f r u it industry, because in the growing of f r u it Australia compares favourably with any country in the world. It amazes me to be told bhat in such a young couaatry, in which we have .nob utilized our resources in the growing of. f r u it to anything like the extent that we ought, the iudustry even in its infancy is faced with ruin, the f r u it rotting on the ground because there is no market for it . I .say there is a market for it . There is a market for it among the teeming thousands of people in our big cities, who never see a bit of f r u it on their tables from one week's end to the other. I If we asked the head of a f a m i l y to . place upon his table sufficient fruit to. satisfy their natural requirements, would cost him in a week as much as the rent of his house should be; and yet fruit is rotting in the orchards of Australia. When we come along as a, party Mr Scullin. with suggestions and proposals, they are - described as the socialization of production. They doi not mean the Government' stroke and Government - control of everything, but they do mean giving some social value to these things, and bhat, as a collective people, we should take an in terest in these industries. We are told that our proposals would only bring r u in coun- to the industries of the country. Here is an industry that has not been interfered with by any of the schemes or so-called "" R e d "" objectives of the Labour party, and yet in its in fancy it is already coming begging to this Parliament to do something to revive it . We are told that there is only one solution of this problem, and that ib lies in increasing the consumption of f r u it in Australia and establishing au overseas market. I used to believe that, and I still 'hope it is true, but I have very serious doubts ahout it when I read this Bill . I believe it is possible to increase the consumption of f r u it in Australia if there is co-operation with Government assistance and control. That has been advocated even from the anti-Socialist side. Their one idea was to do away with all Government control of every description, yet there is nob a session of this Parliament in which some-Bill is not brought down to provide for Government interference, assistance, and control to some extent.",48
154,Mr MOGKATH,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"They are asking it for the growers of grapes today. Mr . SC ¥ LLIN - ^ T h ey ask for it every week in the year, though they have told us that they were determined to get r i d of it . As a preliminary step to getting r i d of it , they sold the most profitable Government undertaking we had in Australia. They sold that business because it was making a profit, and they sold it to their friends; but that is by the Way. I believe there is a solution of the problem in encouraging the consumption of f n i ib in Australia. There are only two ways in which that oa.n be done-on e is toi give the people more purchasing power. When I read the statements of honourable members opposite, who tell us, as one of it them did last night, of the high wages ruling in Australia, I am amazed. The wages now paid may appear to be high as compared with pre-war wages, but for a man with a wife and family the wages Killing today are lower than they were before the war. What is the good of talking about high wages when the purchasing power of wages has been diminished? It has been diminished, .not by the action of trade unions or Labour parties in Australia, but by the action of the gangof people who, without let or hindrance, have been allowed to pile millions upon millions and profit upon profit. They took advantage of conditions due to the war to profiteer.. They have never let up on profiteering, and not a hand is lifted against them by Governments, with few exceptions, in any part of the world. The first solution of the problem of what to do with the firait that is rotting in the orchards of Australia is to increase the purchasing power of the people, and enable them to provide themselves with something more than bread and butter, or bread withotib. butter. I could take honourable members who talk of high wages into the industrial suburbsof any city of Australia, and particularly of Melbourne, and show them houses that are tumbling down, the rent of which a few years ago was 7s. 6d. per week and is today 25s. per week. Houses that were let for 10s. or l is . aweek a few years ago are now let for £ 1 a week. Writers who support the Government of the day tell us thai; the reason is the high wages which have to be paid to carpenters, bricklayers, and plumbers. The houses to which I refer were built before any living plumber or bricklayer was born. It used to be said at one time that the weekly rent of his house should equal about one day's wages of. a working man, but it is now equal to two and a half or three days' wages. A man's labour for nearly half the week goes in payment of his weekly rent. How much f r u it do honourable members think working men can give their wives and children under these conditions? If we proposed a F a ir Bents Court to deal with these landlord sharks, not a single honourable member opposite would be found supporting the proposal. I listened today with interest to the honourable member for Calare (Sir Neville Howse). I pay the honourable member the tribute that hedid raise a voice above the jargon of money making and the sordid business of money grabbing; He raised a voice for humanity. He uttered some telling truths in informing the legislators of the country where they have failed with regard to the people's health; but I tell him that, with all his splendid high ideals, he can never hope to succeed so long as the Governments of the country represent the vested interests-thos e who own its slums and squalid dens. It is of no use to say that we have none of the conditions in Australia that in the Old World breed disease. We have them in Australia, and less than two miles from where I stand. If we improve the conditions of the people we will assist to solve the problem before us by securing the disposal of our f r u it i u our own country. The second necessity for local consumption is that the f r u it shall be brought from grower to consumer without being handled by so many middlemen. It has been said a dozen times, and every one knows it,,, that, although the grower cannot get I d . per lb., for his f r u it at his orchard, the consumer cannot buy it for less than 6d. per lb. in the streets of a city a few miles away from the orchard. There is a. great lack of organization in the industry. We want organization, but we are told that the purpose of organization is to bring everything to a dead level. Co-operation is called for on the other side. I am a believer in , and an advocate of, co-operation, but I believe that there, may be au extension of the principle of co-operation to include the whole of the' people of the State. I believe that by proper organization of society we may have the socialization of the means of production and distribution, and that would be a solution of our problem. An other solution of the problem is said to be the establishment of overseas markets. I cannot pin my f a it h to that, and the provisions of the Bill , it seems to me, j u s t if y a doubt as to its efficacy. Why is it that the teeming millions on the other side of the world cannot eat our f r u it ? We are told that it is because of the distance it has to be shipped, and because the costs of production here are greater than the costs in other countries, and we cannot compete with the producers in other countries on level terms. That contention seems to disappear when we read the provisions of this measure. What does it propose ? - It proposes that a bounty for local consumption shall be given to the .canners of this country. To encourage a certain proportion, of export, and to enable the exporters to compete with rivals in the markets of the world there is a very much higher exportbounty proposed. I find that one of the conditions for the payment of the bounty is that the canner shall pay a certain price to the grower for his f r u it . I take one item, that of ding-stone peaches. 1 find that under the Bill , the canner must pay £ 9 a ton to the grower for peaches. If he takes these peaches and cans them for export he will receive a bounty of £ 1 2 8s. per ton. That means that before this industry can be carried on for export, the canner3 of this country must have the f r u it given to them for nothing and £ 3 8s. per ton given to them to pay half the freight for transporting the f r u it to the other side of the world. It is an awful state of affairs if we have not in this country a canning industry so well established that it cannot purchase our f r u it , put it into tins, and send it across the seas to compete with canners in other countries unless it is made a present of the f r u it , and is paid half the freight on its exports. I suggest to the Government that if this is only a stop-gap expedient, and they promise that they will do nothing more of this kind, we should be told what is to happen next year to the f r u it industry. ""What are we to do next year if this bounty is not to be continued, and if today canners ""must be presented with the f r u it they can, and half the cost of its freight overseas must be refunded to them.",49
155,Mr MCGRATH,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,The honourable member  is not so.,51
156,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member cannot say that, because under the Bill the canners are given for export a bounty of £ 1 2 8s. per ton, and they have to pay only £ 9 per ton to the f r u it grower. That leaves them with £ 3 8s., which is about half the cost of freight. This is what is demanded by those captains of iudustry, Sir Henry Jones, Taylor Bros., and the others who tell us that they can manage business affairs better than any Labour men could manage them. [ say to our friends of the Country party who talk about cheap labour and bringing down the worker's conditions, that they will rue the day if they lower the conditions of workers in this country. If there is to be one satisfactory market for our f r u it it will be found in the home market, if the wages paid our people are such as wil l enable them to buy f r u it . I have every sympathy with the men who toil upon the land. I know them, I have lived with them, and have represented them, and I know that the men who talk of cheap labour and black-grown siigar do not voice the opinion of the best men on the lands of this country. The solution of the problem is to be found in raising the standard of comfort of our people and enabling them to pay for the f r u it grown in the orchards of Australia. This measure does not require any more than formal assent because the money is paid, the f r u it has been canned and some of it has been eaten. Probably the Government could not help that, but although this is only a stop-gap proposal, it should have afforded the Government an opportunity to tell us what it proposes to do to provide a permanent remedy for the evils which by this Bill it proposes temporarily to meet. Debate (on motion by Mr SEABROOK) adjourned. TREATY WITH TURKEY.",51
157,Mr BRUCE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Flinders-Prime Minister aud Minister for External Affairs) [8.45] -(B y leave.)- I move That the Treaty of Peace with Turkey and other instruments* signed at Lausanne on 24th July, 1923; and the Convention between the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Japan, and Roumania, relative to the assessment and reparation of damage suffered in Turkey by the nationals, of the contracting Powers, signed at Paris 23rd November, 1923, be printed. I have adopted this method in order to give honourable members an opportunity to discuss the provisions of the Treaty. Although this is one of the Treaties terminating the war, and establishes peace with Turkey, it was nob signed u n t i l the 24th July last. The Treaties with Germany, Austria, and Bulgaria were each signed in 1920, and that with Hungary i u 1921. The Lausanne Treaty is different from the other Treaties - It does not raise any question affecting the relation of the Dominions with Great B r i tain or one another. Austraha, as a separate nation, was definitely at warwith Turkey. None of us who remembers the war and the episodes of the Gallipoli Peninsula can doubt that. At the time of the general peace negotiations Australia claimed the right, as one of the ""nations taking part in the war, to sign - this Treaty separately. In this parti-oular case no academic or constitutional >question arises.",51
158,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Is this a separate Treaty because of the Gallipoli campaign?,52
159,Mr BRUCE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"No . This is a Treaty which at last brings peace between Great B r it a in , Australia, and Turkey. Against the last-mentioned nation we have been in a state of war since 1914. This Treaty is exactly jiarallel with the Treaty of Versailles, which was signed in 1920, as .it is to re-establish peace. Treaty has been ratified the state of war which has existed since 1914 does not terminate, and its ratification is, therefore, - both urgent and desirable. The Treaty will not actually come into force u n t i l ratified by the K in g, which will not be done until the approval of the British Parliament and the various Dominion Parliaments has been given. August I received a despatch from the then Colonial Secretary, emphasizing the urgency for the ratification of this Treaty, which had just beeu entered into, and pointing out that it was proposed to take action in the British Parliament at the earliest possible date. Australia was asked to take similar action, so that finality might, be reached. Immediately on my arrival in Great Britain I was again approached in the matter, but, unfortunately, the whole situation soon <manged. An election took piace, and the British Parliament did not again meet last year, with the result that the ratification Treaty was delayed. Only last week was it approved by the House of Lords, while this week it is to receive consideration by the House of Commons. A f t e r the new Government came into power in Great Britain I interviewed Mr Ramsay Macdonald, who stressed the urgency for the ratification of this Treaty, so that peace could be re-established between the British Empire and Turkey, and I agreed to - submit the question to this Parliament immediately on my return to Australia. I visited Gallipoli on my way back from England, and saw the necessity for the action I am now proposing to this House. I spoke to several Turks concerning thedesirability of peace being again established between Turkey and the B r it i sh Empire, and they all expressed their regret at the delay. The Turkish authorities treated mc with the greatest courtesy, aud sent two omcers to the frontier to meet me, and to accompany mo to Constantinople, and a British cruiser was permitted, for the first time since the outbreak of the war, to pass through the Straits to Constantinople to convey me on my way. The Turks have the greatest admiration and respect for Australians, because of the important part they played in the war at the Dardanelles, and it will tend to the establishment of better relations between Turkey ancl Great Britain , and between Until the Turkey nnd ourselves, if the state of war between these countries is terminated. Soon after my return to Australia. I received a cablegram from the British Prime Minister, asking whether I could assure him that Australia would approve of the Treaty being ratified. I replied that I would avail myself of the earliest opporLast tunity to place the matter before Parliament, aud assured him that assent would be given. A few days ago I received a further cable, to the effect that the Houso of Commons would deal with the question this week, and asking for definite action on the part of Australia. I again replied that there was no doubt that the Treaty would he ratified, and that I would submit a motion to Parliament this week. The original Treaty of Sevres between the allied and associated powers and Turkey was, unfortunately, never ratified. I ts terms created a great deal of dissatisfaction in Turkey, which resulted of the in the Nationalist movement and the rise to power, and practically to a military dictatorship, of Kemal Pasha. The Nationalists established tlieir capital at Angora, and were 'at war with Greece in Asia Minor. In the early part of that war the Greeks gained a considerable measure of success, but later they were subjected to overwhelming reverses - by the 'Turks, who drove them out of Asia Minor, ancl destroyed Smyrna. The overthrow of the Greeks led to the downfall of K in g Constantine and the establishment of a new regime in Greece. The Turks, having overcome the Greeks, and being imbued with a new national spirit as a result of the success of Kemal Pasha, pressed on to the Dardanelles and the Straits, and created one of the most critical situations we have known since the war. The British and French were there, but the latter retired to the European side, leaving the British alone. Reinforcements brought up, and the Turks were prevented from .crossing the Narrows and entering Europe. After that an armistice signed at Mudania, in October, 1922, negotiations for a Treaty then comexpected, menced. A Conference was held at Lausphere sanne in November, 1922, but the Turks, having achieved a great victory, imbued with this new spirit, aud relying to a great extent upon the dissension among the Allies, adopted a very obdurate attitude. After three months the negotiations broke down in February, 1923, but were resumed in April of that year. Eventually, on the 24th as a result of the second Lausanne Conference, a Peace Treaty was signed between Turkey and the allied and associated Powers. In this Treaty there are issues with which I shall have to deal length. It was signed in a very different atmosphere from that in which the treaties with the other belligerent Croat-Slovene States. Powers were signed. At Versailles the conquering Powers met and outlined the terms they would offer to the nations had overcome. Only after those had been decided were they placed tarized before the defeated Powers, were told that they must accept tliem. The second Lausanne Conference was a meeting between Powers, none of which was in the position of a conqueror. was a round-table Conference, where every clause was discussed before being finally agreed to. This Treaty has criticised, but on the whole it bears orable comparison with that of Versailles. In connection with it, I draw atdefine tention to the position of Turkey uuder Under the Treaty Turkey goes out Syria, Palestine, and Mesopotamia, or, obligations under that Treaty. as it is now known, Iraq. She also ceases to have any power in Arabia, and nounces all rights and title to Egypt and the Soudan. In Europe, Turkey is now confined to the plains and highlands Anatolia, the original Ottoman Turkish territory in Europe. By that I mean the territory up to Adrianople and the boundary line that existed before the recent Balkan wars. Although she is finally still in Constantinople, and retains tain territory in Europe, she becomes - once again practically an Asiatic power. Nations. Ur. Bruce. The most important provision of the Treaty is that which insures the freedom were of the Straits. For many decades this has been one of the most vexed and dangerous questions in Europe, and the was settlement which has been arrived at is and more satisfactory than might have been having regard to the atmoin which the Lausanne Conferencemet ancl the Treaty was framed. Free and access to the Black Sea through the Dardanelles is given to all ships of all nations-wnerchau t ships, warships, and aircraft; although the number and tonnage of warships is limited.",52
160,Mr MANJC,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Is it limited .us regards July, 1923, the Turkish Navy also?",53
161,Mr BRUCE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"^No. A demilitarized zone has been created astride the Dardanelles, and the control of the Straits no is given to an International Commission at .composed of representatives of Turkey, France, Britain, Italy, Japan, Bulgaria. Greece, Roumania, Russia, and the ScrbThat Commission will function under the auspices of the League of Nations, to which it will they report annually. If the freedom of the terms Straits or the security of the demilizone is imperilled, the high conwho tracting parties, and in particular France, Great Britain, Italy, and Japan, will act in conjunction to meet such danger by all means which the Council of It the League may resolve. ""We have to remember that Australia, as a part of the British Empire, is a party to the been Treaty, but honourable members who favheard the honourable member for Calare (Sir Neville Howse) this afternoon the interpretation of Article 10 of it. the covenant'of the League of Nations of will appreciate exactly what are our Under Article 10 all nations which are members reof theLeague undertake to secure and preserve the territorial integrity of every other member; but the honourable memof ber for Calare gave a clear and convincing explanation that that obligation is determinable by the constitutional authority in each State. The sovereign right of the Australian Parliament to determine what action this country cershall take cannot be affected by any decision of the Council of the League of The clause in the Lausanne Treaty insuring the freedom of the Straits, bears, tke same interpretation as does Article 1G. At tke time of tke signing: of the Treaty Russia was bitterly opposed to the settlement which had' been effected regarding the Straits, and there was a fear that the Treaty would actually foment future trouble, and men-ace the world's peace, by reason of that old and festering sore.. Fortunately, Russia, after further consideration, saw her mistake, and without any great parade or publicity signed the Treaty and accepted the provisions relating to the freedom of the Straits. The only other point that concerns Australia closely is the agreement in regard to the safeguarding of the graves on the GalTipolr. Peninsula. All cemeteries, graves, ossuaries, and memorials to soldiers and sailors are to be recognised and respected by the Turks,, who. undertake also to give all necessary facilities for the identification, registration, and maintenance of t h t cemeteries and the erection of memorials on their sites. The Turkish Government further grants to the other Governments in perpetuity land on. which graves-, cemeteries , ossuaries, or memorials are erected, and undertakes to give all facilities to any Graves Commission of any country to. inspect and generally maintain those sacred spots. That arrangement is most satisfactory to Australia, and we appreciate the action which the Turks have taken, particularly in granting to the Commonwealth in perpetuity the soil in which our soldiers are buried. I should like to add that at the present time the Turks are scrupulously observing that undertaking. I recently visited all the cemeteries on the Peninsula, and had a long conversation with the Turkish Governor of Gallipoli. He assured me that his people recognise the sanctity of the dead, and will do everything in their power to insure that Australian graves, cemeteries, and memorials shall be respected not only by the Turks; but by all other people upon the Peninsula. That must be very gratifying to the relatives and friends of men buried there. I am satisfied that we can accept tht. assurances of the Turkish people that these obligations will be scrupulously honoured. The Treaty itself embraces seventeenof distinct Instruments, but very few of themcoucern Australia intimately. shall refer to only two of them. One : is the convention respecting the conditions of. residence, business and jurisdiction of the nationals of the signatory countries resident in Turkey. The rights of Australiannationals are absolutely safeguarded, and they are given the opportunity, equally with citizens of the Turkish' Republic, to carry on their businesses-. There is 'also the commercial convention, and Australia has exercised its right to declare that it does not desire that convention to apply to this country. The convention, if subscribed to, really involves, a reciprocal exchange of most favoured nation treatment, but Australia has very l it t l e trade with Turkey. We have never done a direct export trade with that country, and the export trade done through London is very minute. A f t e r an examination of the question we came to the conclusion that the acceptance of this convention would lead to somo embarrassment, because Australia would not be able to reciprocate f u l ly any favoured nation treatment conceded by Turkey to the Commonwealth. Therefore, we have declared that ""we do not desire it to apply to Australia or any of our mandated territories.",53

There is also a convention in regard to reparations between the United K in gdom, France, Italy,, and Japan, with a protocol for signature by Roumania. That relates to the assessment and reparation of damage suffered in Turkey by the nationals of the contracting Powers. Under the Peace Treaty there is a mutual surrender of all rights to reparations, but in order to meet the circumstances of the nations which are parties to the convention, a certain amount is placed at the disposal of a. reparations assessment Commission, to which claims may be made. The British Government has made available to that Commission £846,100 worth Turkish 5 per cent. Treasury bills. Australia also, adheres to that convention, I andany Australian national who has a claim for reparation is entitled to apply to the Commission in the same way' as can the nationals of Prance, Italy and Japan.

It is well known to every honourable member that the war between those countries was responsible for this Treaty. I give the Prime Minissaid, ter credit for having put his case ably ancl in a very nice way, omitting, of course, the international incident to which I referred, but to which I now direct tention. The right honourable gentleman pute. will, no doubt, declare, as he has done on many occasions, that if ever Great Britain is at war Australia, being a component part of the Empire, must also be Turks. at war. This is a doctrine that has been preached in recent vears. It is a departure from the practice that had been followed right up to the outbreak of the European war, in which we took our part. Prior to 191.4, Australia, as a self-governduring ing Dominion, had full right to decide herself whether or not she should particito pate in any war in which the Mother Country was involved - before the",55
167,Mr BRUCE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,W o have that right today.,55
168,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"We have not. The right honourable gentleman himself said in this House only a few days ago that if we are to remain part of the British E m pire and have a voice in its foreign policy we must necessarily be involved in any conflict between Great Britain and a foreign country. It may be argued that because of these Conferences on foreign policy, and the communications that pass between the Governments, Australia has - I an effective voice in determining E m pire foreign policy. As a matter of fact, the British Government may enter on a war in a dispute upon which we have noopportunity to express an opinion. Let me remind honourable memn bers of what happened in the Near East but a year or two agO, when this Parlia! No one then that Great Britain was on the the verge of war with Turkey, so we astounded to read, in the cable news in the press, that the Prime (Mr W . M .

The issue was of vital importance to the Commonwealth, and the people's representatives .here should certainly have been consulted. We are now told that this Treaty has nothing to do with that crisis. Every one knows that there would have been no Conference at Lausanne and no Treaty but for that war. These issues cannot be evaded. The plain facts must be put before. the people, who must know where they stand.",55

172,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Yes . So long 'as we have secret diplomacy so long shall we be in danger of running into trouble. T believe i u the attitude of the British Labour Government, which stands for open negotiation and for everything being above-board. British Government have decided that all these treaty negotiations must be placed upon the table of the House of Commons for at least twenty-one days, so that they may be fully discussed by the representatives of the people.",56
173,Mr COLEMAN,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,That is the democratic system.,56
174,Mr CHARLTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member is quite right. We want peace. I say nothing against the ratification of any treaty for peace, but I do not want to be misunderstood. I am not one of those who stand for Australia having any voice in foreign affairs that do not affect the interests of the Commonwealth. And I do not stand for the doctrine that Australia must necessarily be involved in any war between Great Britain and other countries. Australia should retain the position she held right through her history, and up to 1914. Ever since we have enjoyed responsible government we have had the fullest right to decide this matter for ourselves. When Great Britain became involved in war with the South African Republics, no one claimed that Australia also was involved. We exercised our own judgment as to what part we should take in that conflict. And that was the position right up to 1914. When Great Britain went to war with Germany, the British Government appealed to the Australian Parliament to send men overseas. This Parliament consented - That marked the change in our attitude. It marked, also, the difference between the right honourable the Prime Minister ancl his supporters and honourable members on this side of the House. There is a spirit of Jingoism in the air today. No doubt the recent visit of the British Fleet was designed to encourage that spirit, with a view to a change in our relationship in Imperial affairs. It is time the people of Australia had an opportunity of declaring where they stand in connection with this policy. I am satisfied that, if their opinion were sought tomorrow, the great majority would be against Australia going any further than she has in the past; that we should preserve those rights which have enabled us todevelop along sound lines up to the present. I do not subscribe to the' view that whenever a Avar occurs The Australia must necessarily' be involved. Nor does my party. I have nothing to say against the Treaty UOAV before the House. If Ave could have treaties to bring about a'Avorld peace, it would be a move in the right direction. The very peopio Avho talk so much about the League of Nations apparently forget that there is such a thing as a League AvheneA-er they truly are in trouble, because they do not appeal to it, or attempt to put its powers into' operation. We had evidence of this in the trouble between Turkey and Greece, ancl that between Italy and Greece, and in the action taken by France in the Ruhr. We cannot expect to bring about peace by our present attitude with regard to disarmament. Instead of the nations of the world travelling along the path of peace, they all appear to be looking for more armaments, and preparing for the next war. At a time when Ave might Aery well r expect them to be talking about further disarmament, almost every country is talking of the necessity of preparing for defence. Prior to the holding of the Imperial Conference, I said that the first question on the agenda paper, should be further disarmament of the great PoAvers of the world. If there is one thing I regret, it is that the British Empire, with all its influence and prestige, did not set the other nations of the world an example in the direction, of disarmament, viting them to travel with hei along the path of peace as far as they possibly could. That sliould have bean the main business of the Conference. The leading men of the various Dominions-tli e brains of Empire-were assembled at the Conferopportunity ence, but they altogether failed to meet the situation which confronted them. I place of devoting their attention to arranging another Conference on disone armament, they confined themselves "" Empire affairs and the League of to. Nations. The President of the United Sbabes of America made overtures to Britain, Prance, and Japan, with a bo holding another Conference on the lines of that held at Washington two at the Imperial Conference. years ago, just, after the last Imperial Conference. He received a cold reply from Great Britain. It was said Great Britain feared that the Singapore Base project would be introduced.",56

Unfortunately, - we are never told the full facts about things. This Treaty would not be here for ratification had it not been for war between Turkey and Greece. It was because of that war that the Conference was held at which this Treaty was I arranged. I speak for myself, and for honourable members on this side of the House, when I say that we shall favour action which she may take. in any Treaty that makes for peace; but we do not wish to become involved in foreign affairs, nor - do we 'wish ib to be understood thab we accept the new docbrine bhat whenever Britain is ab war Australia the - is at war.

There is no option. Other nations regard all parts of the Empire as belonging to one international unit or I think entity. That is a matter of legal fact. If British Empire is at war, then, legally, Australia also is undoubtedly at war. 'Of course, it is now perfectly well estabthese lished that it depends upon Australia herself entirely how far she shall parthe ticipate in such a war, aud whether she shall, or shall not, send, an armed force to take parb in belligerent operations. f Great B r it a in is at war, Australia as exposed to all the risks of war, and she cannot evade those risks by any unilateral The only way in which she can avoid being considered at war when B r it a in is at war is by severing her connection with the E m pire.

180,Mr LATHAM,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Canada' s position is exactly the same as ours. Canada has made efforts to avoid it , but has not been able to do so. She is no more independent than Australia. Canada nor Australia is independent. Both belong to the Empire, and, as members of the Empire, but always as members of the Empire and within the Empire, they have a large measure of independence. No other Empire has been sufficiently elastic to give to its constituent parts the measure of independence which we possess. It has not been known before in the history of the world. ""We are fortunate indeed to enjoy this independence. It confers upon us a great privilege and a great protection, but also it imposes on us an. active and intelligent interest in foreign affairs and in international relationships.

As a legal man, he has emphasized the view that when Great Britain is at war, Australia is also at war. I am not concerned about legal quibbles, but I am concerned about the effect upon the people of Australia of the emphasis he has given to his view. Honourable members opposite have spoken quite a lot lately about the Empire, and the desirableness of solidarity within the Empire. I know of no way more calculated to prevent the Empire from kieeping together than such - remarks as those made by the honourable member for Kooyong. We all desire that the friendship which exists between the family of British nations shall continue. I hope that those ties of kinship will never be loosened. If , as the honourable member for Kooyong stated, it is a fact, that we must take part in a war irrespective! of the cause or the justice of such war, it will not be well for the unity of the British f a m i l y of nations about which wehear so much ",58

There is no need to put forward what the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) calls legal fictions. I was pleased to hear pai'tiouiarly two things from the lips of the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce). We were told by the right honourable gentleman that the original treaty with Turkey, .the Treaty of Sevres, was not ratified. The next thing he told us was that the Turkish people were prepared to honour the dead and respect the graves of the Australians. He accepted their word, and believed they would abide by it . My comment on those two statements is this: In this House, after we had ratified the Treaty of Versailles, aft6r we had listened to the Australian representative at Washington, and were told that Australia was to be at peace for at least ten years, suddenly there was flashed across the wires the news that a Near East crisis had developed. A Prime Minister who was tottering in his position in Great B r itain cabled to another Prime Minister who was also tottering in his position in Australia. These two Prime Ministers were prepared to f an the flame of war, because both were approaching a general election, and wanted a khaki election and a battlecry with which to win it . We have heard much today from the honourable member for Calare (Sir Neville Howse) regarding the League of Nations. That honourable member said he believed that the delegates to the League of Nations were earnest in their desire to promote peace. Yet one of the greatest Powers belonging to that League was not prepared to submit to it the question of war or peace, but sent cable messages to the Dominions-mor e for a political than for any other reason, I believe-asking , "" Will you send contingents ? "" The then Prime Minister of Australia, whose position politically was as precarious as that of Mr Lloyd George, without consulting this Parliament, which was sitting at the time, sent a cable message over the week-end "" Yes, I will send contingents."" thing that we noted about his message was that it did not say, ""Yes, I will bring contingents."" The point I want to emphasize is that the Prime Minister Bruce) to-night said that the Treaty of Sevres had hot been ratified. Prime Minister, who was supported by, the present Prime Minister and the majority of honourable members opposite, said that . this fight in the Near East was to uphold the sanctity of the Treaty of Sevres. was only one excuse for war; the big excuse was the desecration of the graves of Australian soldiers. ""We had not a scintilla of proof that one Turk had touched one grave on Gallipoli; yet that' was the excuse for stirring up the banging the war drum, ancl exciting the people to another war. That is the lesson that we learned from propaganda-to start a fever in the minds and the hearts of the people, induce them to go out and kill because the Turks were desecrating the graves on Gallipoli. Wc have been told by the Prime to-night that the Turk is a man who respects the dead ancl honours graves of the dead. I returned soldier on the very day that the discussion took place in. this Houso. said to. me, "" Go to fight again for the graves on Gallipoli? I hold the title deeds of the grave of my. in Melbourne, and they have taken up his bones and shifted them away somewhere else. Yet they talk about the desecration of the graves on Gallipoli!"" I saw also a cartoon in the press at the time, published with the idea of fanning the flame of religious hatred. picture of the Turk wading to his knees in Christian blood. "" The Turk,"" he was called. To-night we have from the Prime Minister a motion for the ratification of a peace treaty, and how different is the tone! What a different remark he .made about the same "" unspeakable Turk ""-that he is a man who honours the dead and the graves of the dead, and that his word was accepted by the right honourable gentleman. sincerely believe that the right honourable gentleman does accept the word of those men; yet we were asked to fight against them to uphold the sanctity of their written word, and because, it was said, they . Mr Scullin. would not honour the dead! I know of stating, nothing which teaches more finely the The one lesson not to be swept off our feet when the jingoes go howling for more war. In my ears are ringing the words of the honourable member for Calare (Sir Neville (Mr Howse), regarding the sincerity of the League of Nations. I believe that the Yet the ex- delegates to the Assembly of the League of Nations were sincere, and that the thinking men of every nation are so convinced of the awful calamity of plunging into another war that That they will earnestly strive to prevent it . If thab be so, and if the words of the Prime Minister are true in relation to the Turk, would it not be right for this Government and this Parliament to stand behind the British Government in leading the way to the rest of the world imagination, by planning for peace and not for war?",58

The matter covered by this Treaty was referred to by the Treasurer Minister (Dr Earle Page) at Goulburn, when he stated that I had declared openly that Austhe tralia would never take part in any war met a in which Britain was engaged. Last year the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), speaking on the matter which this Treaty has He now finalized, said he agreed that had war taken place with Turkey on that occasion, it would have been the result of a grandfather stupid blunder on the part of the Prime Minister of Great Britain. The ex-Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) told this House that war was averted on that occasion only by a miracle. He also admitted that if it had occurred ib would have been caused by a blunder on the part of the It was a Prime Minister of Great Britain. Lord Curzon, the chief diplomat in the British unspeakable Delegation ab Lausanne, said bo the representative of Turkey at that Conference!! ! What are the representatives of Turkey threatening to do? They would in volve Europe in a war that is not worth the firing of a shot or the spending of a shilling."" Yet the honprable member for Kooyong tells us in cold blood that if the Prime Minister of Great B r it a in makes a I stupid blunder, we must go to war, although the matter in dispute may not be worth the firing of a shot or the spending of a shilling. Honourable members who talk in that way are doing something which is more calculated to disrupt the Empire than to cement it . There are some people, we are told, who are anxious lo cub the painter and sever our connection with Great Britain , but it is gentlemen - who talk, as the honourable member for Kooyong has done, who are forcing Australian people to think on those lines. Are we to accept the policy that Australia, without - having a voice in the matter, must go to war when the Prime Minister of Great Britain makes a blunder or wants to fan the flames of jingoism so that he may throw a smoke screen over the peopje and keep in power, or because Prance or some other country is anxious to start a war not worth the firing of a shot or the spending of a shilling? If the honourable member for Kooyong and the Prime Minister go to their electorates and promulgate those principles on the platform, bh&y will not come back again to this House. people of Australia would nob stand - for such a policy. The proper sentiment of the people is interpreted by honourable members of the Labour party. I rose to put my position right because of a statement about a speech I made at Goulburn.

They have made it perfectly clear that they think if the British Empire is involved in war, our people may please themselves whether Australia takes part in it cr not. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) has properly shown thab when the British Empire is involved in war, Australia as a part of the Empire is legally at war. Of course, it rests with U3 to say what action we shall take, and to what extent, if any, we may participate in any conflict; bfit we cannot consider ourselves in or out of the war just as we please. When the Empire is ab war we are ab war. The honourable member for Werriwa says that we should not be brought in if the Prime Minister of Great Britain makes a stupid blunder just as he may have done at the time Great Britain was nearly in volved in a war with Turkey. What would have been the position of Australia if we had considered that the Prime Miuister of Greab Britain had made a stupid blunder in taking part in tbu last great war? Could we have taken no p a r t ) Had we stayed out of the conflict, the result might have been very different from what it was. Instead of being a victory for us it might have been a great disaster to the world. In all probability the 300,000 odd men who went from Australia had a great deal to do with turning that war into a victory instead of a disastrous defeat. The honourable member for Werriwa has challenged the Prime Minister and others on this side of the House to go upon the platform and pronounce such views as those uttered by the honourable member for Kooyong to-night. I am prepared to The do so. If the Empire is at w a r - I do not care what the cause of the quarrel may be, or who created it-we , as an integral part of the British Empire, are at war, and must take our part in it . Despite the opinions of honourable members opposite, there are hundreds of thousands of splendid fellows in Australia who would rally to the banner when the bugle sounded, and help bo fight the Empire's battles, no matter where they were, or what the cause of the war might be. Great Britain has sons in distant parts of the Empire who will always rally to the standard when the Empire is at war. On the occasion when we were nearly involved with Turkey, the cablegrams appeared in the evening papers, and at 6 o'clock on the following morning there were scores of that young fellows at Victoria Barracks, Sydney, who came to the officer there and said, ""Digger, where do we enlist?"" The people of Australia are as. ready now as they were at the commencement of the last war to rally to the standard. It would be a terrible thing if we went back on"" those comrades of ours who during the Great War laid down bheir lives; but that is exactly what we should be doing if we were to desert the Empire for which they sacrificed their lives. We should be traitors to those men who did such magnificent service for the Empire and made a name for themselves that will never die in its history - I am speaking of the men in the ranks. I am grateful to the Australian boys for the magnificent bravery they displayed and for their loyal cooperation with those in authority over them. The sands of the desert, the arid slopes of Gallipoli, and all the other theatres of war, were saturated with the blood of the men of Australia, and we should: be traitors to the 60,000 who laid down tlieir lives if now we said, "" Let Empire go; what do we care about it ? If the Prime Minister inEngland makes a stupid mistake, we shall desert the Empire. We shall have nothing to clo with any Empire war."" I suppose honourable members would suggest that we are to have some sort of Monroe doctrine to prevent Australia from being embroiled in any war. Other people would have a say as to that. The fact that we might not be willing to take part in an Empire war would not. render us immune from attack. Those who would be warring against Great Britain would assail the Empire in its most vulnerable part, and if Australia was not in. a position to repel an attack it would be the place attacked. I do not wonder now that honourable members opposite remained silent when the Prime Minister asked them to declare themselves upon the Imnerial Conference resolutions. They dared not declare where they stood., but now we see that they really wish to be outside the Empire. They declare that.if the Empire goes to war they do not want to take part in it . As a matter of fact that was the attitude they assumed during the Great War, and if they had had their way no soldiers would have been sent from Australia, to help to defend the Empire. My proof for that assertion is to be found in the resolutions of the Perth Conference and the resolution carried at the Brisbane Conference, declaring that the Labour party were for peace. "" Yes,"" they said, "" we are for peace. Not a man must go overseas; no one must fight for the Empire."" So long as we are under the protection of the British Empire and of the noblest Fleet that ever rode the ocean, we are secure; but once Ave get out of that Empire we are the prey to any hawk that may dart from the sky, and there are many of them ready to swoop down on Australia, the richest possession of the British Empire. Honourable members opposite have declared themselves. They are against the .Empire. We are for the Empire. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [10.0]. - I did not intend to speak on this matter to-night, but I must say something in reply to the honourable gentleman who has just addressed the House.",60
186,Mr FENTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,It was all humbug that he was talking.,61
187,Mr SPEAKER,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt). the - That statement is not in order, and must be Avithdrawn.",61
188,Mr FESFTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,I withdraw it. Mr E. RILEY - The statements we have just heard from the honourable member for Warringah Shire,61
189,Sir GKANVILLE RYRIE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,I object to that designation.,61
190,Mr SPEAKER,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"'Honourable members must be referred to by the name of the electoral division which they represent. Mr E. RILEY - That is so, and I apologize to the honourable gentleman. There was no need for him to make the speech he has made, and to lecture honourable members on this side. This party was in power Avhen the Avar took place, and did not hesitate to take part in it. All the honourable gentleman's flowery talk about Avhat Ave stand for goes by the board Avhen Ave remember Avhat the Labour party did during the Avar. We were free then, as Ave desire to be free, if there is another Avar. I hope that another Avar will never take place, but if there is another war, it Avill be our duty to use our common sense in regard to it, and this Parliament must have the right to decide whether Australia Avill go into the Avar or not. According to the reasoning of the honourable member for Warringah (Sir Granville Ryrie), Ave haAe no say in the r matter. The honourable member talks of what is due to Australians Avho took part in the last Avar. I should like to know what he thinks of the Prime Minister, and the action for which he Avas responsible. The honourable gentleman did his duty in the war, and because he did, he was displaced from the Ministry for a man who never went overseas. The same thing occurred in the case of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. Marks). As a gallant seaman, that honourable member went to sea to fight the battles of the Empire, and yet he was put out of this great composite loyal Cabinet, which professes to be ready to do everything to help the Empire. It did not recognise the Avar services of men who were in the last Cabinet, but replaced them by men Avho did nothing in the late war. The same kind of thing has occurred in thousands of casesthroughout the Commonwealth. Returned men of every rank have been forgotten, their pensions have been taken from them or cut down. Do honourable members mean to say that if another war took place those men are going to run to the standard at ""six o'clock in the morning""? I can assure the honourable member for Warringah that if it were announced that there was going to be a dog fight, at 5 o'clock in the ing, there would be crowds found running to see it. Because a few hundred men get up at 6 o'clock in the morning to do a certain thing, it does not follow that they represent the views of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. make no bones at all about saying that so far as I am concerned, as a representative of the people in this House, I shall insist that this Parliament has a right to say whether this country shall take ""part in any war. The Commonwealth is groaning under taxation due to the last war, and what is the Government doing to lighten its burden? Every time a war loan has to be paid off, our taxation must be increased. Where is the patriotism of the men who lent us money when they will agree to renew their bonds only on the payment of an additional 1 per cent, interest? I dread to think what' the future of this country is going to be, in view of the heavy load of taxation upon the shoulders of our people. The honourable member for Warringah says thab, because Australia is part of the Empire, this Parliament is not to protect the taxpayers of the country, but must take part in a war in which Britain is engaged whether it be right or wrong. That is against common' sense. The public men of this country have a right to shoulder their responsibility should the occasion arise, and not leave our entry inbo a war to the decision of the British Parliament. The members of the Imperial Parliament have a right to protect their country; and let honourable members opposite make no mistake about the fact that we will protect this country. This party stands for the protection of every soul in the Commonwealth, and will be prepared to take the necessary steps for the purpose. We on this side, however, are not prepared to shut our eyes, and blindly to follow the dictates of another Parliament. I do not endorse the statement that if Britain is [15] at war we also are at war. If Britain is engaged in war for a just cause, we will be with her; but, if the cause is not a just one, we shall claim the right to say whether we will take part in the war or not.",61
191,Mr BRENNAN,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Batman) [10.5] We have been living in such a placid atmosphere all the afternoon that I have been pained and surprised by the elecmorn- tricity which has suddenly developed in this. Chamber, during the consideration of a peace measure. I never would have thought, when listening to the honourable member for Calare (Sir Neville Howse),. that we were sosoon and so unexpectedly to hear the rattling of the sabre and the I faint echo of Prussianism which emanated from the honourable member for Warringah (Sir Granville Ryrie) a few minutes ago. I did not intend to speak upon this peaceful matter. Everything seemed to be going so well. Our policy of masterly silence was proceeding so successfully that it seemed to me that I could pursue it at least until the end of bhis period of the present session. I listened to the honourable member for Calare during his interesting and pacific address. I listened to the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) introducing this subject, in the tone of a curate* just about to pronounce the benediction. I was sinking pleasantly into a half-doze while all this was going on, when we were suddenly aroused and precipitated into an important debate on our Imperial relations, which I thought had been definitely settled by our silence last week. As this matter has been so precipitated upon us, I shall say about half-a-dozen words on the subject, unaccustomed as I am, after my long silence, to public speaking. The honourable member for Warringah has made a most unexpected and eloquent address about persons who got up at about the same time as he is accustomed to go to bed, and other matters. He has assured us that, whether on the field of battle, in the prize-ring, or anywhere else, if any one suggests "" sboush "" he will meeb him on terms of his own choosing and in a place of his own choosing. He says that if Britain declares war we are at war, because we are a part of the British Empire. I say that, if we are part of the British Empire, Britain is also a part of that Empire, and if we declare war Britain is, ipso facto, at war. If the honourable member for Warringah happens to be leading a Government in this country and he declares war upon somebodyas he inevitably would within the next twenty-four hours-it would follow that Mr Ramsay .Macdonald. .greatest pacifist the world has ever known, - must, of necessity, also declare The whole of the British Empire be involved in a contest precipitated the honourable and belligerent for ""Warringah calling somebody side to meet him. Thus these tremendous world conflicts about from these very simple It follows from what able member has said that no matter how foolish a British Prime may be, if he makes a declaration Britain is at war, then Australia that fact is also at war. my honourable friends on this of the House for having used the words, "" some foolish Prime Minister other side."" What the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) said was, "" a tottering Prinie Minister on the other side of the world."" And he tottered to his fall, just as a Prime Minister on this side of the world tottered fell as a result of the action of the Country party and other political catas. trophes. If it follows that even the most foolish Prime Minister may bring about a war in that very simple way, we are led to the conclusion that the most foolish Prime Minister of all-the Prime Minister of Great also involve us in conflict. the honourable member for whose tempestuous reasoning I arn following, that this Prime Minister veiy mau who, before the memorable conflict of 1914, advised the people to keep it. Ye gods ! To think that a man is so soon at the head of the British Government who strongly urged the people of Britain to keep out of the war which the honourable member for Warringah so strongly apostrophized to-night! man, who is wholly against war, and who is now the Leader of the Government in Great Britain, may in turn, triumph of irony, precipitate into auother such, struggle. ently, although he was entirely when he declared for peace, we would be disloyalists and recreant to our trust if we declined to follow. him when he declared for war. Australia, so the Government tell us, is a nation. The honorUr.

We are entitled to take our war. place as a nation amongst the nations of must the world. Every day we are told we by owe our happy position largely to the member Nationalist party.

RILEY - That is the strength of the Empire.",63
193,Mr BRENNAN,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Of course it is. Its strength rests on the kinship of a people who compose the Empire and who speak one language. Partnership in that This Empire carries its responsibilities as well as its privileges, and the first responsibility it involves is that the men who by the meet here in deliberative assembly, as Australia representatives of the Australian people, Appar- shall have enough backbone and brains wrong to for m opinions of their own, and in some measure, at least, to influence the councils of the world on the question of peace or war. If the Empire means anything, it means that we shall have the right to express our opinions. I thought that the immoral doctrine of "" My country, right or wrong,"" was dead and damned. We should be recreant to our - trust and conscience if we weakly submitted ourselves, against our better judgment, to the judgment and passions of unreasoning men, who are less than unworthy of the trust reposed in them by the people, or to other men inflamed with the jingo spirit, caught up by the mad and foolish passions which, in other days, urged the people to> further bloodshed. When I , in this House and elsewhere, have ventured to say a word or two expressing my opinions, so that I might not be a mere cipher at a critical time, men like the honourable member have sought to hound me from public life, and have accused me of insincerity and want of loyalty. Now we are told that Australia should have no voice in determining whether this tragedy should be repeated ; that we should listen to the voice from across the water, whether the voice of Macdonald, the pacifist, or of Lloyd George, the jingo and war-maker; that we should put our ear to the ground to find out what men are saying in the British Parliament. In matters of sentiment, in the drinking of toasts aud the waving of flags, Ave are a nation, but in those things which affect the very life-blood of the people, and which might save or damn the lives of the manhood of this country, we are to be speechless. We are to follow the honourable member for Warringah, whose one doctrine is, not only "" My country, right or Avrong,"" but also ""-Britain, right or wrong,"" and "" A British Prime Minister, whether fool or wise man, right or wrong.""",63
194,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Fawkner) [10.1S] The honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) has been most eloquent, as usual, and Ave always listen to what he has to say. But to what does it all amount? He never loses an opportunity of flinging taunts at people who believe in the integrity of the Empire.",64
195,Mr CUNNINGHAM,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,That is not correct.,64
196,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"He invariably holds up to ridicule those Avho believe the Empire, and he even goes to the length of mimicking the pronounciation by some honourable members of the word "" Empire."" Let us consider one or two things that the honourable member for Batman has said. He ridicules of our standing by ""the Empire, right or wrong.""",64
197,Mr BRENNAN,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,I do not ridicule it ; I condemn it as immoral and wrong.,64
198,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"He says that it is immoral, but every honourable member be-- hind him believes in the doctrine, which is more immoral still, of "" My party, right or wrong.""",64
199,Mr FENTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,So does the honourable member - :,64
200,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"That may be. I am pointing out the inconsistency of the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan), Avho ridicules the idea of anyone believing in the doctrine of "" M A Empire, right or Avrong,"" and yet advo cates the doctrine of "" My party, right ot wrong."" The Leader of the Oppositioi (Mr Charlton) spoke of the harmful effects of secret diplomacy. Is the honourable member, and those Avho sit with him. prepared to apply that doctrine in the realm of politics? Will they, as a party, admit the press and the public io all their deliberations Avhen taking counsel in regard to matters affecting the interests of""their party? They will not; bnt Avill stick to their secret political diplomacy.",64
201,Mr WEST,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Would you like to be there?,64
202,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I certainly would. Those members Avho take up this attitude are utterly inconsistent. We heard the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) refer to Mr Ramsay Macdonald as the magnificent pacifist. He quoted Avhat Mr Ramsay Macdonald said and did on the eve of the last Great War; IIOAV he warned the people of Great Britain about going into the Avar, and later did his utmost to pull them out. To-day thatsame man is head of the British Government, strenuously preparing against, the next war.",64
203,Mr WATKINS,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"He cut doAvn the Defence Estimates by £2,000,000.",64
204,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"On e would expect that the greatest pacifist that ever liveda man who objected to, the last warin would, like the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), spend not a penny on defence. If the honourable member for Ballarat adheres to the position attributed to him, and has the courage to act upon it, he is a greater pacifist than the idea even Mr Ramsay Macdonald.",64
205,Mr BRENNAN,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,You quoted Mr Ramsay Macdonald the other night as> having pointed out that there should be no revolution.,65
206,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I am dealing with what the honourable member said about Mr Ramsay Macdonald being a pacifist. He, having assumed the responsibility of office, is now in a different position from that which he occupied previously. He has now to act in a common-sense way; and is doing so, as he is taking all reasonof able precautions to safeguard the interests of his country.",65
207,Mr FENTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Every one does not think that.,65
208,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) had his little joke at the expense of those men who rushed to the barracks at 6 o'clock in the morning. To some of the members of the Opposition the Scotch song, "" It's fine to get up in the morning, but it's better to lie in bed,"" would appeal strongly. Arc we to lie in bed when the Empire is threatened? The Opposition are now discussing the position of Australia as an integral part of the Empire. That subject should have been discussed on the motion of the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), dealing with Imperial defence, but the Opposition on that occasion were absolutely silent.  expedite the business of the country.",65
209,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Thos e tactics were determined upon by secret diplomacy, and a surprise was sprung on the Government, but that was the time when Australia's attitude to the Empire should have beeu discussed. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) made the position clear when he pointed out that Australia was an integral part of the British Empire, and that in the event of Great Britain being at war, Australia, being a part of the Empire, would, in fact, be at war also. It does not matter to me one iota whether it is a legal fact or a legal fiction, as suggested by the honourable member for Batman, that Great Britain, being at war, every other part of the British Empire is at war. The honourable member for Batman knows that a legal fiction is very often an intensely real thing. The important fact affecting Australia is that' the country with which Great Britain is at war will regard Australia as beiug in it, We might meet here in the Federal Parliament and pass a dozen resolutions to the effect that Australia was not at war, yet I contend that the country with whom Great Britain was at war would say: ""A fig for your resolutions! As part of the British Empire we shall treat you as being at war with us.""",65
210,Mr BRENNAN,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"When a foreign country makes war respecting a cause in which we disbelieve, that will be the end this country, and the honourable mem-, ber will be responsible for it .",65
211,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"As the honourable member for Kooyong pointed out, if we do not desire to take part in a war, we need not do so. Let us suppose that some cause for quarrel emerged between Great Britain and Japan, and they were in a state of war.",65
212,Mr LAZZARINI,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable member want war?,65
213,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"No . If a state of war were existing between those two countries, and we said, "" We do not Believe Great Britain is in the right in this matter, and we are going to stand out,"" what would be Japan's reply ? It would be this: "" It ' m a y suit you to stand out just now, but next time it may suit you to take part in the war, so we shall regard you as standing alongside of Great Britain and as part of the British Empire."" There is no escape from that position. Just as we accept every benefit and every privilege that accrues from our association with Great Britain, and with our sister Dominions that form the Empire, so we must face their responsibilities, and, if the Empire gets into trouble, take part in it as one of the obligations attaching to us. This position will always obtain >ntil we have, as it is contended we ought to have, some say in discussing Britain'. foreign policy, making it less possible for the British Prime Minister to make ""foolish mistakes."" If , after the united effort of the various parts of the Empire, war yet comes, then surely it is only fair and just that we should stand in it together. I sincerely believe that, even' if one part of the Empire made a foolish mistake, we would not run the risk of the disintegration and the destruction of the British Empire because of that mistake.",65
214,Mr LAZZARINI,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,Supposin g it was a too. deliberate war of aggression.,65
215,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"That is a different thing. I agree with the honourable member for Kooyong, that if Great Britain were at war, it would be for Australia to say whether she would take any, and, if so. what part in belligerent operations, ancl it is possible to conceive a moral issue emerging, in regard to which we would say as a Commonwealth- "" No, we prefer torun the risk of destruction rather than associate ourselves with such a cause,"" I admit that.  a limit?",66
216,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Certainly , there is a limit.",66
217,Mr SCULLIN,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member, whilst speaking, has converted himself.",66
218,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Most men when a friend of theirs gets into a row, although they know that he practically brought it on himself, say, "" I will stand by you and sec you through."" That is the every-day attitude of individuals towards each other. On the other hand the action might be such as to warrant a man saying to his friend, "" You are so entirely wrong that I cannot stand by you, even in the sacred cause of friendship."" It may be that such a state of things may come about internationally. The Commonwealth would then discuss the matter and take a stand, and every man would have to act according to the dictates of his own conscience.",66
219,Mr LAZZARINI,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,That is what stand for.,66
220,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"If that is all that the Opposition require, then there is no difference between the two parties. I do uot believe that there is any real fundamental ^difference. The vast majority of our people, although they put Australia first, lov^the Empire to which they belong. I Deaieve that they will, in a case of emergency, in days of danger, do as they have done in the past, stand shoulder to shoulder to maintain the integrity of the Empire.  [10.36] - I shall not speak at length, cause the honourable member for Fawkner has said so much that but a few remarks are required from me. He has not only converted himself, but if the gallant general opposite (Sir Granville Ryrie) had listened attentively he, too, would [16] have been converted. The honourable member for Fawkner, in his opening remarks, practically accused the honourable member for Batman of being a disloyalist, to an extreme degree, for advocating something which he himself advocated before resuming his seat. He so completely looped the loop during the discussion that he found himself in hearty agreement with the honourable member whom he accused of disloyalty. The honourable member for Fawkner agrees with the contention that has been repeatedly advanced by the members on this side of the House, that the doctrine of being "" all in a war, right or wrong,"" is an immoral one. He concluded his speech by practically saying that there was no difference between us.",66
221,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I only said that the cause might be so immoral that we could not possibly stand by it .  sure that if the debate lasts long enough, the honourable member will turn another somersault, and I should not like that to happen. I am extremely glad to know of his conversion, and I do not wish to proceed any further, being satisfied with what we have accomplished. I leave the conversion of the other side in the capable hands of the honourable member for Fawkner. The honourable member for Fawkner is so accustomed to displaying his eloquence in support of people, regardless of whether they are right or wrong, that he no doubt finds it congenial to adopt the same attitude towards interwe national questions.",66
222,Mr MAXWELL,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I hope the honourable member will not join the ranks of those who make use of that jibe at my profession as an advocate.  merely endeavouring to find an explanation of the attitude of the honourable member. I do not impute any unworthy motive to him; rather do I congratulate him upon having admitted his conversion. I .respect the honest opinion of every man, but I ask the gallant and honourable member for Warringah (Sir Granville Ryrie) to ponder the be- statement he has made to-night. He said that if Australia did not engage in a war in which the Empire was involved, rightly or wrongly, we would be traitors to the men who died in the last great war. We told our soldiers when they went forth to fight that they were risking their lives in a war that was to end war, and the real traitors to them would he those who would urge our people to rush into the next war, regardless of whether it were right or wrong. If the judgment of the dead soldiers could be obtained, I know whom they would regard as the greatest traitors to them. The honourable member overreached himself when he made that statement. He ,also made sneering allusion to the Perth Conference. The honourable member does not know what was done at that Conference. During the war the Labour party stood for peace by negotiation, and it was by negotiation that peace was ultimately brought about. Had the negotiations been entered into when the Labour party first urged that course, thousands of valuable lives and millions of pounds would have been saved to Australia and the rest of the world.",66
223,Mr WEST,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"East Sydney) [10.45] How many honourable members know what is contained in the Treaty which the House is now asked to ratify? I do not. arid, ^ therefore, I shall not vote for the ratification of it. Why have we not been supplied with copies of the document? We are told that there are to be no more secret treaties. Why then does the Prime Minister keep this Treaty in his despatch box, and ask the House to be content with his statement of what the document contains ? I object to the confirmation of treaties of which we have not a complete knowledge. Some honourable members have said that Australia is not to have complete self-determination in regard to participation in wars. I suppose that applies also to wars precipitated by Canada or any other Dominion. If , for instance, Goneral Smuts involved South Africa in a war with the coloured races, would Australia be necessarily involved? That would be neither logical nor reasonable; indeed, it would be an insult to the intelligence of the Australian people. There is no more educated democracy in any part of the world than the people of Australia, and I , as a representative of the intelligent people of East Sydney, protest against their being deprived of the opportunity of exercising their independent judgment and displaying their loyalty, as they have done on other occasions. When a change of Government takes place, and that will happen very soon, honourable members will not be treated with the discourtesy which has been shown by the Government to-night. Nor will the people of Australia be treated as mere creatures who are not worthy of consideration. I take no notice of the Prime Minister's discourtesy to rae personally, but I represent 42,000 people in East Sydney, and he has no right to ignore them. The seriousness of this Treaty has been emphasized by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham), who said, in effect, that Australia would necessarily be involved in any war precipitated by any unprincipled creature who happened to be in power in Great Britain, and the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan Hughes) seemed to appreciate that interpretation. The people of Australia will not thank those honourable members for such an - unflattering declaration of Australia's position. I ask the Prime Minister to give members of the House an opportunity to peruse the Treaty. I refuse to vote in the dark on a matter that I have not had an opportunity to understand. Do honourable members forget that they hold in their hands the destiny of Australia? Is the subject not sufficiently serious to require that honourable members shall be informed of the contents of the' document? I asked the Prime Minister what penalty was provided for a violation of the Treaty. He would not even answer me. He treated mc with contempt. Surely I have a right to ask that question, and to receive an answer. As long as I have breath in my body T shall stand here, as a representative of the people, and use all the privileges of this House to try and make the Prime Miuister and those who follow him realise their responsibilities. I shall not dwell upon the question whether we are, or are not, part of the Empire. I fought hard for Federation without fee or reward years ago. I spent many nights in that struggle when I ought to have been at home studying my health - It did not do me much harm, I admit. I did that becauso I felt that the consummation of Federation would make me a proud man, and would improve the lot of my offspring and the grandchildren that would naturally follow. It never entered my head that an individual outside Australia would do anything to bring Australia to the verge of war. I thought the poople of this country would have sufficient intelligence and , understanding uot lo permit any other nation to dominate them, but would govern themselves, and exorcise nil the sovereign lights of a nation. Throughout my early life I was told that t.he Turks could not be. trusted. ""We used to sing ditties about them. That is why I asked the Prime Minister whether penalties we're provided for breaches of the Treaty. is the first time that such Treaty has been before this Parliament, and we should delve into it and see what our responsibilities are under it . It may not affect any honourable but through their callous indifference to their responsibilities it may affect their offspring very seriously. The Treaty more closely concerns Australia than Canada or Africa, The Canadians will not have anything to do with it . I would move heaven and earth to piomotc peace, but I will not allow anything to pass this House without ascertaining what is in it . I do not see why my intelligence should be insulted because I protest against the Prime Minister not disclosing the contents of this Treaty. This House has found it necessary to devote time to much smaller matters. A Committee was appointed to investigate the wireless agreement submitted some time ago, and as a result the agreement was materially altered. The House ought to know something about the Treaty.  to know something about the Suez Canal.",67
224,Mr SPEAKER,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,- I ask the honourable  divert the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West).,68
225,Mr WEST,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"The greatestSocialistic piece of business ever done by the British Parliament was when Disraeli bought the Suez Canal shares. good business. I protest against the House treating this matter as a joke, frequently we find that, through some oversight, Bills passed by us do not exactly express the w i ll of this Parliament. A treaty of this character in twenty-five years' time may have very serious consequences to the people. Notwithstanding its possibilities, honourable members are expected to ratify it without knowing anything about its provisions. As a Parliament we have been doing nothing for nearly eight months. It is unreasonable that we should now be expected to pass this Treaty at such short notice. This is not the proper way to conduct the business of this Chamber.",68
226,Mr FENTON,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Havin g made your protest, what more can be done""",68
227,Mr WEST,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I shall make ns much noise as possible. I find that the beat way to create interest in this House is to make a noise and give some evidence of "" g o "" and ""punch,"" This Mr Fsxroy - Eve n nt 11 o'clock at a night?",68
228,Mr WEST,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"It matters not to ine if the hour be 1 o'clock in the' morning. member, I am not responsible for the present position. I am satisfied that the people of Australia will be in hearty accord with what I have said to-night. Honourable members are not thoroughly conversant with the provisions of the Treaty. Tonight we had the honourable member for Warringah (Sir Granville Ryrie) and the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . Maxwell) firing shots at each other. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr . Latham) also had something to Bay about the Empire. Apparently, they take the view that we ought not to regard this matter of treaties too seriously. ' I do, and I take full responsibility for all I have said. As I have never yet signed a document which I did not thoroughly understand, I feel disposed to vote, against the motion.",68
229,Mr BRUCE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [11.5] - There are only one or two points on which I desire to speak in order to clear up a misunderstanding. I must apologize to the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) for not having dealt with the question he asked when I was speaking. I am afraid that I overlooked the matter. By way of interjecI t was tion, the honourable member inquired whether the Treaty contained a clause imposing penalties in the event of any breach of its provisions. There is, of course, nothing of the kind included. A treaty of this character is not framed in the same way as an ordinary contract, with a penalty clause to provide against breaches of its provisions. This is a Treaty entirely dependent upon the honour of the signatory nations. It is obvious that in its terms we could nob imply suspicion of the ?oort faith of one side or the other. With regard to the manner in which the Treaty has been presented to the Bouse, I think the honourable member for East Sydney is under a misapprehension. The Treaty was signed as long ago as July last, and its terms have been - well known for many months. Further, it was the subject of a very long explanation by the Foreign Secretary at the Imperial Conference. That explanation was published at the time. Therefore, the facts with regard to the Treaty arc well known. We are now only asking for its ratification by the adoption of a niotion for the printing of the document. . All the information in the Treaty has been available for many months.",68
230,Mr WEST,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"Not officially. I , as a representative of the people, have not received it officially. I consider that I have linen treated disrespectfully.",69
231,Mr BEUCE,SEAT OP GOVERNMENT,"I oan assure the honourable gentleman that the last thing I wish to do is to show any disrespect, either to him or to his constituents. Full information has been available for some months, and I am sure that, on reconsideration, the honourable member will not vote against the motion. It is most important that the Treaty should be ratified unanimously by this House. At the present moment it is being put through the British House of Commons, and the British Government are now awaiting its ratification by Australia. Questiou resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned nt 11.8 p.m.",69
