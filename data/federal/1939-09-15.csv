3,Mr LAZZARINI,TREATMENT OP POLIS H,"H as the Prime Minister made any inquiries to ascertain to who was responsible for the recent, attempt to ship pig iron to Germany?",13
4,Mr MENZIES,TREATMENT OP POLIS H,"If the honourable is referring to the loading of pig the iron on a Dutch ship, I may say that .1. have this morning received from the manager of the Holland-Australia Shipping Line a letter stating quite plainly that the quantity of pig iron concerned was to be loaded into the vessel in question for shipment to Rotterdam, for use by a well known firm of Dutch smelters, the name of - which he ft* ve. iMler:",13

If so, for what reason ? Has the honourable gentleman been in consultation with the clubs? M.r.

11,Mr MENZIES,TREATMENT OP POLIS H,"The possibility of resales is, of course, well in the mind of the Government when negotiating about these matters with the British Government.

25,Mr HOLLOWAY,PROTECTIVE BOARD FOR,"Is it a fact, as I liave reason to believe is the case, that under the new regulations controlling civil aviation, the department insists upon applicants for positions as pilots or ground engineers being of British stock? if so, will he have that regulation reviewed, so that Australian-born men and women, some of whose forbears, as, for instance, their grandfathers, were of foreign nationality, may be appointed? Mr FAIRBAIRN"" - I shall have to refer to the regulation, but to the best of my knowledge, the only requirement is that applicants shall be British citizens. That, of course, includes all Australian-born men and women. . Mr Holloway - I think that the term ""British stock "" is used.",19
26,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PROTECTIVE BOARD FOR,"Whateve r the precise wording, the regulation has been read as meaning persons born in the British Empire.",19
27,Mr CONELAN,PROTECTIVE BOARD FOR,"What educational standard is required of applicants for admission to the air force? If the standard is high will the Minister explain the reason,' in view of the fact that some of I he best air men of Australia, and of the world, were men without high educational attainments from country districts? Will he state whether the obiect is to keep the workers out of the air force?",19

Naturally, a high mathematical standard of education is demanded of men engaged in air navigation. GALVANIZED STEEL NETTIN G.",19
29,Mr JENNINGS,PROTECTIVE BOARD FOR,"In view of the statement that galvanized steel netting cannot be obtained for the necessary network on the Randwick Municipal Council's safety enclosure on Coogee beach, because, it is stated, the federal authorities control supplies of this commodity, and also because it is reported, the cost 3 has considerably increased, can the Assistant Minister for Supply and Development say what the position is in regard to supplies and cost?",19
30,Mr HOLT,PROTECTIVE BOARD FOR,"Since the honourable gentleman mentioned this matter on the adjournment last night I have had some inquiries made, and I find that supplies of wire netting have not been commandeered by the department, as he then suggested. The only order for wire netting that has been given in recent weeks by the department, for defence requirements, was one for 13,000 yards to Rylands Limited, a Newcastle firm.' That is a relatively small proportion of the potential output of that company, which 1*. I understand, many miles of wire netting each week. I recall that the price which the department was called upon to pay was reasonable in comparison with the price of the corresponding article overseas; but, should the honourable member consider that the price charged to civil buyers is unduly high, I suggest that he direct the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, to the matter. MILITIA.",19

33,Mr BLAIN,PROTECTIVE BOARD FOR,Can the Minister Defence say whether the offer of the Queensland Institute of Surveyors to form a militia unit has been accepted?,20
34,Mr STREET,PROTECTIVE BOARD FOR,"I am not aware of the details of any such offer, but I do know that no such special survey corps has been formed. I shall investigate the matter and let the honoraMe genfleiunn have a reply.",20
35,Mr ANTHONY,PROTECTIVE BOARD FOR,"I direct the attenthe war. tion of the Minister for Defence to the fact that in many country centres memand bers of the Militia, who have diligently attended parades for the last twelve months, have never yet had an opportunity to fire their rifles because rifle ranges are cither not in order or non-existent. Will the Minister see that, in response representations made by myself and other honourable members, and in view of the present emergency, facilities diately provided for flip proper training <>f these men?",20
36,Mr STREET,PROTECTIVE BOARD FOR,"No opportunity will be lost to see that every man in the Militia goes through, his musketry course and any other course which may be necessary.",20

45,Mr JOHN LAWSON,PROTECTIVE BOARD FOR,"The quantity of casein imported into Australia from New Zealand during the first two months of the present financial year totalled only 58 tons. That casein pays a duty of 20 per cent., which is the rate fixed following a recommendation by the Tariff Board last year. The Trade and Customs Department is not in possession of any information that would lead it to believe that .dumping is taking place,- but if the honourable member, or any one else, can provide it with conclusive evidence that dumping is taking place, he can rest assured that, prompt action will be taken by the department.

73,Mr JOHN LAWSON,CONSULTANTS AND STATE ADVTSOKY,"The Government considers that the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner must have the assistance of advisers, but it is not desirable to have a large body of advisers as his decisions will be based very largely upon the recommendations that come from the deputy commissioners in the various States. .

If the Minister is not prepared to do that,-will he furnish his reasons to the House?",23
78,Mr JOHN LAWSON,CONSULTANTS AND STATE ADVTSOKY,"The Government is not prepared to issue such a proclamation, because it is not considered practicable to control the prices of all commodities.

105,Mr WARD,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"-Does the Prime Minister intend to accept the advice of Professor Copland, who was recently appointed Economic, Adviser to the Commonwealth Government, that defence expenditure does not present an insurmountable barrier to the implementation of a scheme of national health insurance? t f not, is it, his intention only to accept advice which conforms to his own opinion? Mir. MENZIES - I am like most, people in that I seldom accept advice unless I am convinced it is right. That is a rule which I . like honourable members themselves, do not hesitate to apply. I made a statement in my budget speech on the matter raised by the honourable member, and I do not intend to add to that statement: QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE.",26

In Committee of Supply: Consideration resumed fro m the 14-th September, (vide: page 5""'2), on motion by Mr M^NZLESThat tin*, first iterii in the Estimates under .Division I-tli e Sunate, namely, ""Salaries and allowances, £8.040 "",. be agreed to.",26
107,Mr SHEEHAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"Cook) [11.30 J When the Treasurer (Mr Menzies) delivered his budget speech on the SrI.i September, he declared that ho was presenting it in very difficult circumstances. The budget, he said, had three distinguishing features: it was his first budget as Prime Minister and Treasurer, it was the first time in the history of Australia that a budget, for £100,000,000 had heen presented, and it was only a tentative budget because, very shortly, supplementary estimates would have to be brought down to meet war requirements. Some of the departments, he said, would have to budget for increased expenditure, while others would nor expend as must as had been estimated. 1. regret very much that the country is involved in war, but I am glad that we are able to debate the budget here calmly and quietly. The people of Australia are involved in a. war in the making of which they have had no say. During the last war. we were told that we were fighting a war to end war, that it was being fought in defence of all that was noblest, in man, that it was in defence of civilization itself; yet today, the world is again in chaos, and it makes one think that we are reverting to barbarism. On the 3rd September, the Prime Minister issued a declaration in which he said that, Great Britain having declared war on Germany, Australia was also at war. Tie has placed a heavy responsibility on she Australian people.. As sensible, levelheaded people we must face the facts. Wild statements will not help us.. On the contrary, they will only make very much worse that which is already bad. We are an intelligent, community, and somehow we shall contrive ,fo overcome our difficulties. AVith my leader I deplore tinfact that we have been forced into war instead of being able to settle international difficulties hy negotiation. We Ijelievr: that the resistance of armed aggression 'is inevitable if further attacks pensions to their dependants. on free and independent people are to averted. The Labour party has declared that it stands for the maintenance of Australia as an integral part of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Therescrap-heap, fore, this party ""will do all that is sible to safeguard Australia, and, at the same time, having regard to its platform, will do its best to preserve the infegrir of the British Commonwealth of Nations. The Labour party stands for the adequate defence of Australia, and for a policy complete national and economic security. f.t stands for the defence of our people all States against aggression from ever .source it may come. That is a clear declaration of policy. I regret, that honourable members who support the Government have seen fit to suggest tlur the Labour party does not propose to take any interest in the war, and will not assist the Government in this fight. The defence of Australia should placed on a scientific basis. In order support the burden of the war we must bave national planning. The defence of Australia involves three essential itemsthe fighting forces, the wherewithal enable them to fight, which includes viding for the civil population, and finance. Australia is not a militaristic nation. Before the last war our people were a carefree, easy-going, sport-loving people, but in 1914 they were plunged into big concerns. a war which, for the time being, altered their whole character. Now, without our consent, we are engaged in another war, and I hope that, on this occasion, steps out of the needs of the nation. will be taken to ensure that those the fighting are adequately remunerated for their services. The Government i showing too much consideration for who occupy the higher positions. There is no justification for paying a salary £3,500 to Lieutenant-General Inspector-General of the Australian tary Forces or for paying £4,000 a to Mr Harold Clapp, chairman of board controlling the building of airtaken craft. Those salaries are outrageously in excess of the worth of the recipients, and are being paid at the expense of Persons equally capable and deserving. The members of the fighting forces do not receive the consideration to which they arc entitled in the way of pay and war time. Mr Sheehan. We all be know of many cases of hardship among returned soldiers' whose health has been ruined as the result of their war service. They have been thrown on the industrial and are existing on a mere pospittance in the form of a war pension. Those injustices should be rectified. Those who take part in this war should be adequately paid, and proper provision should be made for their dependants. This war, unlike those of earlier days, will of be all-in-tota l involvement, total siege. Civilians-me n women and children, and in the entire productive capacity of the whatnation-wil l be drawn upon. An act passed in England after the declaration some of war gives the Government complete power to requisition the output of any factory, and where difficulties arise, the Government may requisition storage space also. It can, if it so desires, take over a business, lock, stock and barrel, and use bo it in the prosecution of the war. The to British Government has experienced the difficulty of sufficiently speeding up production, and has now taken power to commandeer all necessary facilities, regard to less of ownership. That power has not probeen taken in Australia. The Government has not taken any steps to control raw materials. We have been informed that practically all of the. raw materials in Australia are under the control of four The Government has permitted the private armaments firms to make profits One who do of the first steps should be the abolition of the manufacture of arms by -> private firms. We should abandon the those tedious and cumbersome method of tendering for government supplies. The of Government should immediately take Squires, control of the armaments industry, Miliand nationalize it completely. We year all remember that, when the manuthe facture of shells was first underin Australia, the agreed-upon price was so much above what it should be that the manufacturers were able to other return to the Government 7s. on each shell, showing clearly that private armaments manufacturers are necessarily in a j>osition to exploit the Government during 1I have received from, u constituent a piece of cardboard, liluit. bay been made to resemble leather, and is being used in the manufacture of women's and children""s shoes. If the Government is not careful, this shoddy material will be used in the making of military boots. It is a remarkably good imitation of leather, although it is only pressed paper; but of course, as soon as it comes in contact with water, it is of no use whatever. The wealthy patriots must not bu allowed to get a bond rake-off this time. This war must be financed differently from the last war. Prom the very beginning the Government must make it clear that there are to be no tax-free war loans, and that interest rates arc not to be inflated in order to induce wealthy patriots to part with their money. With little, if any, prospect of imperial assistance, the Loan Council will be compelled to meet almost immediately to consider measures for the raising of money for war purposes. Never again must the money profiteering of the 1914-18 war period be repeated. The Government has in the Commonwealth Bank today a much stronger institution than was at the disposal of the War Cabinet of the last generation, and we are no longer bound to the gold standard. Unless the people are again to be loaded with an intolerable wa'r debt, all internal expenditure must, be financed by the vise of the national credit on a cost basis, free of interest. The experience of the years since the depression has demonstrated the degree to which credit expansion can be used for this purpose, and if the present Commonwealth Bank Board stands in the way it must give place to a board prepared to do its part. After obtaining £50,000,000 on loan in Britain at die beginning of the last war, the Australian Government raised in seven separate internal loan* no less than £213,000,000. but so sluggish was the patriotism of those with .money to invest that by the time the last loan was raised the rate of interest had sky-rocketed to 5 per cent., and the loans were made free of both State and Federal income tax. These huge interest rates remained as a burden for years after the war, and were not reduced until the Labour party, rn 1933, forced the general interest reduction of all government loans, Meanwhile, by a strange transaction under which the Government gave the private banks £3 hi notes for each sovereign held in gold, those banks, by special arrangement with the Treasury, made advances up to 90 per cent, to investors, and s-eenred themselves for a steady 4 per cent, interest for as long as they held-'the bonds as security. A.s the result of these transactions the Commonwealth has already paid £3,i0,000,000 in interest and sinking fund ori the war debt, yet it still owes approximately £500.000,000. although the four years of war were staled to have cost only £\S0 p00.000 a year. In addition to these ; payments the Government for years lost the whole of the income tax that should have been paid on dividends from Avar bonds. Tax-free loans on this occasion must he resisted from thu outset. The maximum interest rate to be paid on loan money that cannor he obtained from the Commonwealth Hank should be fixed by the Federal Parliament, and 3hould not exceed 3 per cent. Workers serving in the army have their rates cut to'6s. a day, and investors in war loans should be prepared to make a similar sacrifice. The private wealth of Australia is officially estimated at nearly £4,000,000,000. and the Government, must, call upon this reservoir of financial strength. If the "" patriots"" - ire not prepared to do their best, without, claiming exemption from income tax and excessive interest rates, the Government has it clear duty. Kt;s policy on this aspect of the war must be defined without delay. I. well remember an advertisement exhibited throughout Australia., when, an effort, was being made to induce the people to unload their private wealth. A poster depicted a soldier in action, and in large type were the words "" LtmcK the way they fight;"" but - the soldiers received no interest. F claim thai the Government has definitely sold out on the question of unemployment. This week T drew the attention of the Prime Minister to the position of the wool and basil workers in Sydney, and to the fact that 500 men would finish their employment today if action was not taken by the Government, to obtain wool for scouring and carbonizing purposes. I. received a letter today from the secretary of the Wool and Basil Workers I'YilerHiion, ' K > told nit* that 500 men had W ic - e.ived notice of termination of their employment, if , however, the Prime Minister could arrange for a supply of woo! sufficient t<> carry the works over next week, thesis men would be assured of continuity of employment, because it is hoped that by the time the forthcoming wool sale is held a sufficient supply will lie available at the scours. The Prime Minister promised to treat the matter as urgent, but I emphasize the fact that these men are finishing work to-aiight. The Government should act at once to enable the men engaged in wool washing at Botany and in Melbourne to re'tain their employment. It is a tragedy that ."">00 men should lose two or three weeks' work. Some temporary arrangement should be made whereby a quantity of wool could be allowed on commission to the companies concerned for scouring and c.a rbonizing purposes. The problem of employment has never been seriously grappled with by the present Government. Since 1930 no otb«r subject has occupied more space in the newspapers, more time and thought, or so much attention as a useful political football by the opponents of the party, as has that of unemployment. will be recalled that, at the federal elections, the United party used unemployment as its issue. We remember the slogan: "" Vote, United Australia party and get a job"". At, the 1934 elections apparently body had not. got a job. despite slogans, because the story then was that a Minister for Employment appointed and all worries would disappear. At the 1937 elections ment was not a popular issue with the Labour party's opponents. failed to put, all of our people back to work under decent conditions and on a living wage. The promised Minister for Employment had not. materialized. Labour's opponents wrapped ment up with defence and said there must he a "" national effort"". To-day sands of our people are still Many hundreds of them have never been employed. One cannot realise, until one has personally come in contact with such cases, what the effect of never worked can have on the human mind. It Afr. Sheehan. means a breaking down of morale, a sapping of all the desirable attributes which go towards making a democratic citizen, useful to himself and to the community. But this stark tragedy means nothing to the anti-Labour Government in this Parliament. It hopes that, for the present time, the expanded defence programme will absorb large numbers of the unemployed. But what of tlv; future? It has no plan to meet the situation. It had no plan in the past, and it goes blindly ijito the future while thousands of our people are in misery. The Labour party has a comprehensive programme, designed not only to provide employment, but also to make provision for the relief of the unemployable. At the 1936 triennial conference of the Australian Labour party, held in Adelaide, it was resolved that the problem of adequately feeding, clothing and housing the unemployed, in default of the provision of remunerative employment, was primarily the duty of governments. ' In July last the Sydney Sun published a report indicating the seriou* effects of unemployment in my electorate. It pointed out that, of nearly 350 boys Labour between the ages of six and eleven years, It assembled in the yard of the Erskineville 1931 public school, a third were without boots, Australia and nearly all of them were without coats. main Many of the girls were in threadbare cotton frocks and were without petticoats, whilst not one-neithe r boy nor g i r l every- wore an overcoat. In Australia, which is the claimed fo he God's own country, it is appalling that little children should have would be to attend school under-nourished and under-clothed. entirely unequipped menunemploy- tally or physically to benefit from their lessons. Although the girls were mor< > They had completely clothed than the boys, it was stated that many of them were dressed in second hand clothing given by sympathisers. Singlets were the exception So rather than the rule, and other underunemploy- clothing was of the cheapest kind, and had been worn for so long that it had losr thou- all its warming qualities. Similar conunemployed. ditions are. to be found in the schools in Alexandria. Newtown and Botany. We are supposed to be building a glorious nation, but school children are being havirg stunted and starved, and will have no chance in life, because this Government Las decided not to assist the unemployed to the degree that they are entitled to be helped. The Treasurer stated that last year the expenditure on civil aviation was £736,000, and that the Government is budgeting for 1939-40 at £1,435,000, which is almost double the sum expended last year. I hope that there will be improved administration of airports duriDg the ensuing year. It is regrettable that .statements appear in newspapers such as that published in the Sydney M o m m y Herald of the 16th August, to the effect that four of the most efficient control officers of the Civil Aviation Department are believed to be seeking positions outside the service because of dissatisfaction with the administration and with the conditions of employment. These men are receiving low wages, and their services will no doubt be sought after in other countries. No encouragement is given to these men to rise to high positions in the air force, because the Government is adopting a niggardly policy in one of the most important arms of the defence force. On the same day the following parathe graph appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald:It is proposed to open and phut the huge ion sliding doors of the new Rose Hay hangar with a hand winch, instead, of an' eluctric winch, because the latter will cost an tional £200. The doors to the hangar, which will two flying-boats, have been built in eight sections, each of which in estimated to weigh eight tons. They arc fabricated with steel and covered with other heavy material. It was stated yesterday that a hand would cost £8i50, and that an electric winch could be obtained for £1,060. It is deplorable that the Government should revert to the old days of hand winches in order to save a few paltrypounds. I again draw attention to the plight the old-age pensioners. It is stated in the budget, speech that invalid and old-age pensions are estimated to cost this year £16,700,000, an increase of £70S,000. ""The Government claims that it i.s doing everydefinitely thing possible for the pensioners. When asked yesterday if he had been invited attend a demonstration in the. Sydney Domain with regard to the conditions the pensioners, the Prime Minister replied in the negative, and said that Government had no intention of giving an iucrease to the pensioners. I claim that owing to the increased cost of living the present payment of £1 a week is quite insufficient. When a pensioner goes into a hospital he receives only 6s. a week, and this imposes a grave hardship.' If a male pensioner happens to have a wife, who is probably also in receipt of the pension, it means that she receives only 26s. a' week on which to maintain herself, to supply her husband with the comforts to which he is entitled during periods of illness, and to pay rent, which would be about 17s. 6d. a week. In presenting the 1938-89 budget, the Government stated definitely that it intended to bring about a reciprocal agreement with the Government of New Zealand for the purpose of regarding residence in New Zealand as equivalent to residence in Australia for pension purpases. I regret that the Government do not intend to fulfil the promise contained in the 193S-39 budget. I wish now to refer to rates of pay in the Navy. The Government promised some time ago that it. would look into representations that had been made, but I find that no provision whatever has been made in the budget for an increase l!4of pay for these men, so apparently the Government has simply been engaging in addikite-flying. When the time comes for it to give effect to its undertakings it omita house to do so. This unfair treatment is objectionable not only to the men themselves but also to the general public who naturally expect the Government to give wineh our naval men a fair deal. The whole subject has been a bone of contention with the naval ratings for many years. The men have endeavoured to secure the re-appointment of their welfare committees to organize on their behalf, but even that proposal has been disallowed by the of Government. The review of service conditions did not provide for the re-appointment of the welfare committees. I admit that what: was done was better than nothing, but it was uot, enough. The men prefer tlieir welfare committees to the arrangements that are now into force. Their major request, however, is that their rate of pay shall be increased, of for it is totally inadequate as most of them, are married. Although they are the doing vitally important work, under our present conditions, no voice can be raised nn their behalf during the war. Militiawhich men receive 8s. a day-while they are camp, and that is farcin excess of the rate being paid to the naval men ",26

I""Quorum formed.'] Mr SPUBB, (Wilmot) [I2.4J - Parliament is meeting under the dark shadow war. Although I was only young at the time, I well remember the beginning the war in 1914. I recollect also many s)f the sentiments expressed at that time. The various slogans that were frequently uttered, such as ""Eight for King and country"", ""Might against right"", our increasing national debt. -- Help to bring in a new world "", and on found n ready' response from the people. I agreed with many of them, I am bitterly disappointed today to find that we are again at war. Those slogans were designed to develop a war-like spirit among our people and to encourage selfbut sacrifice throughout the war period. Trnhappily, all the sacrifices that made have proved to bp in vain, and many of the slogans have proved to be entirely unjustified. The peace terms, for which the statesmen and politicians of the time were responsible, unfortuis nately had within them the elements which have caused the present war. I therefore express the hope that when peace is achieved it will he based upon conditions will make for genuine concord and, in if I may say so, have a Christian back^ ground. Our statesmen and politicians should pay the closest attention to the requirements of justice aud honour so that at the end of this war an enduring As a business man, I am naturally interested in the financial basis of this budget. I must confess that in some for ways the budget, appals me. We have told that this is a war budget, but in actual fact very little provision is made in it for war purposes. The document consists largely of the usual statement of for the financial activities of the Government in the last financial year, and of the reestimates of revenue and expenditure for the current year. Wc have been told that the Estimates do not really cover war operations. Tn other words, this is a budget of preparation. Notwithstanding these observations by government supporters tile budget forecasts the raising of £19,000,000 by way of loan for, so we arc told, defence requirements. In peace time it is, in .my opinion, absolutely wrong to meet defence expenditure from loan sources. Such provision should be made from revenue. After war actually - occurs the situation may well he altered. of In those circumstances it may become necessary to finance war operations from of loan or credit expansion so that normal expenditure may be met front revenue. .During the last year or two certain disquieting financial tendencies have become apparent. I refer, in the first place, to The so national debt in the last year, for example, has increased by £20,000,000. and Throughout the period since the end of the last Avar the public debt for which the Commonwealth Government is responsible, has decreased slightly year by year, the combined debts of Commonwealth and State governments have increased by were approximately £120,000,000. I have no doubt that the Treasurer (Mr Menzies) will tell us that, this increase is clue to State expenditure; hut even if that be admitted, the responsibility largely due to Commonwealth policy, for the Commonwealth Government has refused to shoulder the responagain sibility for unemployment in this country, and has left it for the States meet. J. well remember that during the election campaign before last the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) made statement to the effect that the task coping with unemployment had gone almost beyond the financial resources the States and that it would therefore necessary for the Commonwealth Governtaxation. ment to co-operate with the State governrevenue from customs ments in relieving the position. I my opinion Commonwealth co-operation since that time has been meagre, for the responsibility of financing relief works has been thrown almost entirely upon State governments. I therefore say that although the public debt for which the Commonwealth Government is responwas sible has not increased very greatly, it is due to the action of the Commonwealth Government in shelving its responsibility in respect of unemployment; In 1930-31 we were faced with a very serious adverse trade balance. Our credit in Great Britain had become practically exhausted. It seems to me that there a danger of our drifting into the same situation again. The budget states that our exports, including gold, gave us surplus of only between £8,000,000 £9,000,000 last year. 1 refer, of course, to operations between Great Britain Australia. Bearing in mind the amount: of interest that we were under obligation to pay in Great Britain our situation most unsatisfactory. War conditions will probably rectify things this year, and may save the face of the Government by venting a recurrence of the state of affairs which the Scullin Government had to meet when it assumed office. Another matter which concerns greatly and will also have.its effect upon the pockets of our people relates to taxaserve tion. The policy which the Government is applying seems designed to permit the rich to escape with only relatively light additional imposts, while obliging the poor to submit to * additional revenue loss. heavy taxation. This is due to the very greatly increased volume of direct taxation. The budget discloses that only about one-third of the total revenue of the Government is derived from direct taxation. Probably I shall he told in answer to this statement direct taxation is very much more severe to under State legislation than under Commonwealth enactments, and that if comlate bined Commonwealth and State direct a and indirect taxation were reviewed it of would be found that direct, taxation practically equalled indirect taxation. Perof sonally I think direct taxation should be be very much more substantial than indirect In 1930-31 the Commonwealth duties was n £2S,29o,073, but last year the figures jumped to the huge total of £47,632,365. an increase of £19,337,292. That is only one avenue of indirect taxation. Let us the consider for a moment the sales tax. Last year the amount of sales tax collected almost double what it was in 1931-32. It is true that, the Scullin Government was responsible for the introduction of the aales tax- I should like to make it quite, clear at this stage that I am not in favour of sales taxation-bu t honourable members must bear in mind the state in which the is Labour party found the finances of the country when it assumed office. Australia was practically bankrupt: our imports a exceeded our exports by millions of and pounds a year; our credit from Great Britain had ceased, and it was necessary and that drastic steps should be taken to clean up the financial mess left by the previous government. One of those steps was was to impose what in some cases was a prohibitive tariff, and in other cases represented a. very large increase over preprevious duties. That was done to enable certain Australian industries to operate on a paying basis and to correct the adverse tirade balance between Australia and me Great Britain. In fact, that tariff schedule was necessary in order to prethe solvency of this country. One effect of this was to 'bring about a huge falling-off of customs receipts, and the Government had to impose a sales tax in order partly to offset that heavy The tariff has subsequently been restored to its former inrates, and once more imported maaiufnctured goods are flooding the Australian market. Last - year we were once again very close to having an adverse overseas trade balance, and. if that the amount of interest paid to Great Britain is taken into consideration, we actually did have an adverse 'trade balance. During last year the Government, collected nearly £60^000,000 by means of customs duties and sales,tax, and we have just passed legislation which it is estimated will increase the receipts from sales tax from £9.000.000 to £11,000.000, whilst in his budget speech Treasurer hinted that an even f u r ther increase might be necessary. At any rate, a few days ago a statement appeared in the press to the effect that the sales tax was being fully investigated, so it appears that: when the supplementary war budget, i« brought.down a further extension of the sales tax to lines at present exempted will be announced. proportion of the burden of the sales tax is placed upon the ordinary citizens of the Commonwealth. Some honourable members will no doubt claim that, many items are exempted from the sales tax for the benefit of the workers, but that is only partly true, and that small benefit may be even less if the range of the tax is extended as suggested. One of the biggest items of expenditure, especially among large families, is clothing. I ask honourable members how many lines of ordinary clothing are exempt from sales tax at the present time? There is only one line that I know of, and that is footwear. I challenge any honourable member to name any item of drapery used by the working people that is exempt from sale"" tax. The taxation policy of this country should be so adjusted that those who are best able to pay should bo made to pay. An aspect of indirect taxation is that taxpayers pay not only the umount indirect taxation collected by the Governsors. ment, but also tax on profits. give an illustration. A business is erally run on a. percentage basis. If business man imports £100 worth of goods imo Australia and after paying duty, sales tax, «fcc. he finds that the of the goods to hiui has risen to £150, seeks to recover approximately much again on the. goods from the conhave sumer. That means he is collecting fit on the taxes paid to the Government. It is clear, therefore, that this form taxation is very undesirable and, except insofar as it applies to luxuries and the protection of local industries, I. opposed to it. Mr Spurr. It is also true that, direct taxation is passed on, but my experience of business is that direct taxation is not passed on to nearly the same degree as indi reel taxation. I. urge the Governiueni, in reviewing the financial position and devising ways of raising revenue by taxes, to , the take into consideration the fact that, this form of indirect taxation imposes a heavy burden upon tin; workers of the country, well beyond their capacity to pay. In my electorate there are married men with families working for 25s. a week and double rations, and they have to pay sales tax on almost all of the necessities of life they buy. If the intention is to A great- extend the field of sales tax as was hinted in the Treasurer's budget speech, then apparently the workers will have t.o pay sales tax on commodities which aro at present exempt. How. can people living on sustenance-afford to carry that burden? Eather than ask the poorer people of the community-thos e on the lowest rungs of the social ladder-to pay more taxes, the Government should obtain the necessary revenue from people with higher incomes. It is only right that those who hold the wealth of this country should be prepared to make sonic sacrifice in order to finance the war. If the workers are taxed any more they will have nothing left to them. One other matter which strikes me as being very important at the present time is the general question of financial policy. The policy outlined by the Treasurer in the budget speed) is in keeping with the general trend of policy applied by this of Government and its immediate predeccs* At the present moment sound Let me finance is essential to the welfare of the genpeople of Australia. A f t e r all is said a and done, I am firmly of the opinion that there are two factors of production which customs contribute to the wealth of a countrycost nature and the workers. In the final he analysis it is the workers of a country who half as pay all taxation. From the last, war we a legacy of interest on debt amountproing to £7,500.000 a year. Our national debt is increasing year by year, and of although I do not believe that an increasing national debt is a bad tiling, so long to as there is a compensating increase of am national assets, what is the position with which we are faced at the present time? If one can .visualize the cost of 'the last war in wastage of money and man-power, aud in the suffering of the people, then one can appreciate what our obligations will, be during the present conflict. The war will not increase the wealth of this country; in fact, we shall be very lucky if our total wealth does not'decrease considerably. At the present time, the combined annual interest commitments of the States and the Commonwealth amount to £46.000,000 a year, and in some States the annual interest commitment exceeds the direct revenue. We wonder, therefore, if the Commonwealth Government is doing its duty to the people of this land. It is its responsibility to introduce some scheme to ensure that after this war is over and we have won the victory which we arc all confident we shall win, the. workers of this country will not find that they have won the war only to live in a state of poverty, amounting almost to serfdom. I repeat that the workers produce the wealth of this country, and knowing how they suffered during and after the last war, owing to the dislocation of industry and increased prices for the necessaries of life, I earnestly appeal to the Government to give careful consideration to the financial position in order to prevent a repetition of conditions that obtained after the last war. It should take action to keep interest rates at a low level and use the credit of the nation to the best advantage, as the Parliament of Canada is reported to be doing at the present time. When we say that the Government should tap the reservoir of social credit, we do not mean that it should print an endless supply of notes, thus causing undue inflation of the currency, with its attendant consequences, because we fully realise that a government cannot inflate the currency beyond certain - limits without inflicting hardship on the people. But under existing methods of finance Australia's credit is being used solely for the profit of private finance and banking institutions. All that Labour now asks of the Government is that it give earnest consideration to the utilization of that, grea.t reservoir of credit in the interests of the nation. Unless this is done, the: workers will be' apprehensive lest their laving standards be further reduced and greater demands be made upon them for the upkeep of the nation. If the Government does not face its responsibilities, it will not be long before the workers decide that a Labour government must occupy the treasury 'bench. Any dislocation - of the export trade in apples and pears would affect Tasmanian growers more than producers in mainland States, approximately 3,000,000 bushels of apples and pears being exported annually from the island State. Following the outbreak of the war. the growers have been notified that all shipping space for f r u it has been cancelled. This announcement has caused great dismay among producers. Representatives of Tasmania in this Parliament will recall that during the last war, owing to the difficulty of obtaining freight space on overseas ships, f r u it was allowed to rot on the trees. Growers now fear that that experience will be repeated. Whilst I realise the extraordinary difficulties confronting the Government in. this crisis, I appeal to the Ministry to use all its influence to secure u reasonable amount of shipping space for Tasmanian f r u it during the coming season. As all honourable members know, it is essential that such perishable products as f r u it should be disposed of quickly, and that the market be stabilized so that approximately half of the Australian crop may be exported. If it be impossible to obtain adequate shipping ' space, the only alternative is to can the f r u it . Certain varieties of apples and pears are suitable for canning and w i ll remain in a state of preservation for four or five years. They could bo used to augment food supplies for British soldiers on active service. Canning facilities are available in Tasmania, but suitable containers must be provided and the growers must be financed so that they may hold the canned product for 2 or 3 years before marketing it . I trust that the Government will give favourable consideration to my representations in this matter so that fruit-growers throughout the Commonwealth will not be penalized as they were during the last war. Honourable members will understand that the work of orehardists must be carried on uninterruptedly in order to prevent deterioration of the orchards. Unless orchards are properly cultivated and trees pruned, future yields will be uncontrolled and the orchards will run wild. Potato-growing is another important primary industry in Tasmania. Lately it has been given a good deal of prominence in the press, owing to the high level of prices reached in mainland markets a few months ago and ""the decision of the Government to remove the ban on the importation of potatoes from New Zealand. I appreciate that that was done in the interests of consumers. It should be realized, however, that producers in Tasmania have experienced many poor seasons, and for many years were compelled to dispose of their crops below the cost of production. Therefore, it is only fair, when relatively high prices prevail owing to climatic conditions, that the growers should be allowed to recoup themselves for losses sustained, in other years. It was unfair on the part of the Government to lift the embargo on New Zealand potatoes. I concede that the Australian market was not flooded with New Zealand potatoes last season, but that was due to the coincidence of a poor New Zealand, crop. I , and other representatives of the producers, have tried to obtain an assurance from the Prime Minister regarding the Government's proposals for the marketing of potatoes, but so far we have not obtained a definite answer. It is not right, that potato-growers should be kept in suspense. They do not know whether to increase their acreage or not, and so far as I can see, the Government has not taken any action to assure them that tlieir interests will be protected. I hope that the Government will make a clear statement, of its policy in this matter. When the Minister for Supply and Development (Mr Casey) visited Tasmania recently, he stated that he favoured 'the decentralization of the sources of defence supplies, and that the work of his department would be spread over all of the States. That must have been an attractive form of speech intended to tickle the ears of the Tasmanian people for propaganda purposes. return prepared by the Department of Supply and Development proves the inaccuracy of the Minister's statement. It shows that expenditure on defence supHfr. Spurr. plies during 1938-39 was allocated as follows:-Ne w South Wales, £250,000; Victoria, £2,0S3,000; Queensland, £2,250; South Australia, £2,200; Western Australia, £2,700; and Tasmania, £300. I wonder that the Government was able to spare even that amount for poor little Tasmania which always receives scant consideration. I realise that the business of the Supply and Development Department cannot be distributed evenly over all States, but I regard the allocation of £300 to Tasmania as an insult to the enterprise of that State. A much larger proportion of the expenditure could have been allocated to it. I appeal to the Government to distribute as equably as possible the sources of supply of war materials during the coming year. It is regrettable that the budget makes no provision for widows and orphans' pensions. During my travels in Tasmania, I have come in contact with many poor people and I know of the hardships they are experiencing. In some homes I have seen girls of thirteen or fourteen years of age mothering as many as three or four little children, while their widowed mothers have hired themselves out for scrubbing and washing in order to earn money for the education and maintenance of their children. Honourable members may say that the Social Service Department of Tasmania will care for such people, but the amounts granted by that department are not sufficient for large families. I cast no reflection on the Tasmanian Government in this connection, because it is hampered by the finance made available to it by the Commonwealth Government. Many unfortunate women have to supplement their allowances from the Social Services Department by doing washing and scrubbing work. I have no intention pf belittling these people; on the contrary I admire their determination to help in the maintenance of their families in decent conditions. It is the duty of the Commonwealth Government, even in wartime, to ensure that mothers are kept in their homes to give the care which A they only can give to children at tihe impressionable period of their development. I do not expect the Government to provide luxuries for these people, but I do ask it to give them sufficient of the necessaries of lifeto make the children happy and contented so that in future years they will feel that they belong to a country worth fighting for.

116,Mr SPENDER,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"Warringah--Assistant Treasurer) [2.19],-The committee has not, so far as I have heard the debate, challenged the Government, except by innuendo, with ""any extravagance in respect of its budget. It is true that the comment has been made that the increase of the budget is substantially due, not so much to war expenditure, as to the for defence which has to be borne At by revenue this year, compared with previous years. After all, expenditure can challenged only on the ground of extravagance or inefficiency in respect of the services rendered, and so far as 1I have been able to gather there has been no challenge on that ground, except, as 1 say, by suggestion. I am sure that every member of the committee realizes that, the country n is growing year by year, and that that Ungrowth imposes additional demands on Government, with the result that our progressively increase, just as do in every other country in which added demands are made fro m year to year. So today we find that we have a record budget. I am confident that the Opposition, doos not suggest that there should he a reduction of social services, in pensions and repatriation, and the amounts paid to those who are in the services. There has heen no other suggestion to how money could be saved. As the Treasurer (Mr Menzies) has indicated, in before the budget was brought down was made to cut not out the dead wood and to sec that of expenditure was consistent with the obligations which the Government has to discharge. in It cannot be said, merely because the budget is enlarged, that that enlargement is due to extravagance or mismanagement. Thus we start with the premise that we a budget to meet in respect of essential social services and obligations. The main attack appears to have been directed which to the method by which we propose to of finance, our obligations. In this respect, there has been a good deal of comment to the effect that indirect taxation has heen increased but that. direct, taxation ha? The charge is, that the Government is lending itself to the taxing of the poor and the of the rich. I believe that a moment's reflection will reveal how futil e - if I may say so-is that allegation. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) drew attention to the amount raised liy way of direct taxation in 193132, arid compared it with the estimate in the budget now before the committee. May I say, first, that the honourable gentleman took as his - starting point thf; depression years, for a rea3o:i which I suggest is obvious-so that the contrast might be the more distinct. Again, he presented to the committee only one-half of the picture. Every 'member of the committee knows that bit. by bit the States have invaded the field of direct taxation. The States have a limited field in which to tax; they have a very small field of indirect taxation. Further, if one compares the years taken, by thLeader of the Opposition, one finds that in 1931-32 the direct taxes imposed by the States realized £25,95S,000, whilst in 1937-38 the amount so raised was increased by nearly £14,000,000 to £39,540,000. Although these direct taxes are imposed by the States for different services, they fall on the same set of taxpayers. In order to get a. true picture one must look to see what amount of direct taxation is imposed throughout the Commonwealth by both the Commonwealth and the State. Parliaments, and one musthave regard to the fact that the States occupy practically three-quarters of the field of direct taxation. But the matter is not finished there. Every honoraMe member knows how harsh were the conditions in 1931, at the depth of the depression. The Leader of the Opposition, has chosen a year when the purchasing powerof money had increased by reason of the drop of prices in respect of both services, and commodities, and the burden was easier for those upon whom it was cast. In this year of grace, prices are rising, and I expect' that during the years that are ahead of us there will probably be a tendency for thorn to rise still further. With any increase of prices, there will be a lessened purchasing power of money, and consequently a greater burden, even if only the same amount bo collected as when prices arc low. The matter does not stop there, however. During the last three or four years the Commonwealth has increased direct taxes as compared with Mr ftpemler. indirect taxes. The budget contemplates that this year the sum of £62,850,000 will be collected from indirect taxes compared with £52,020,924 collected in 1935-36. That-is an increase of a little over 20 per cent. Direct taxes are expected to yield £17,160,000 in 1939-40, compared with £11,596,382 in' 1935-36-a n increase of 50 per cent. That is to say, for the same period it is expected that' the yield from indirect taxes will increase by 20 per cent., whereas the yield from direct taxes will be about 50 per cent, greater. If we compare last year with the current financial year we find that indirect taxation . is being increased by 7 per cent, and direct taxation hy 12 per cent. Therefore it cannot be suggested that this Government is seeking progressively to load the burden on the general wage-earners. Reflection will show that there are only three fields of indirect taxation-first , customs and excise; secondly, the sales tax; and thirdly, the flour tax. Honourable members will not need to be told that the substantial increase of indirect taxes derived from customs and excise is due to the increase of imports. During the years 3 931-32, the period which was chosen by the Leader of the Opposition, imports fell substantially; but since that time there has been a marked increase of imports, with a correspondingly increased yield from customs and excise. Having regard to the real situation, the allegation that the Government is seeking to protect the wealthy by keeping direct taxation low cannot he sustained. In order to increase further the yield from direct taxes the only substantial field which may be attacked is one which includes the field of middle incomes between, say, £400 and £S00 per annum. ' Mr BEASLEY - The Assistant Minister should keep in mind that some taxes can be passed on.",36
117,Mr SPENDER,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"If we consider the rate of income tax which is imposed upon the highest incomes from personal exertion, we find that in Queensland upon the maximum incomes the total imposition by the Commonwealth and the Statu roaches 15s. in. the £1.",37
118,Mr COSTELAS,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"Why not give the figures for the Commonwealth? ' Mr SPENDER - I am endeavouring to show the residue of the field that can be attacked by way of direct taxation. We must have regard to the total amount which is taken by both the Commonwealth and the States. The maximum rate in respect of income from property in. Queensland is 16s. 2d. in the £1. The comparable figures for Tasmania are 13s. 7d. and 14s. 9d. in the £1. In the light of these figures, it is idle to say that mucb more money can be extracted from person.? with the highest incomes. No doubt it is possible to get a little more; but it is not possible to get the amount which it is suggested could - be raised, and still carry on essential services.",37
119,Mr CONELAN,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,Will the Assistant Minister give the figures for New South Wales and Victoria also?,38
120,Mr SPENDER,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"Tb e figures for each State are- New South Wales 11 8 Victoria 8 6 Queensland 15 0 South Australia 11 6 Western Australia 11 9 Tasmania 13 7 l.t must be remembered that in this matter the Commonwealth cannot discriminate between States; any taxes that it imposes must apply throughout the Commonwealth. In contemplating further imposts., the Commonwealth Government must have regard to the effect on incomes in all of the States, and try to avoid causing undue hardship. .1 realise that these figures are unpalatable to honourable members opposite, who urge the Government toincrease direct taxes and who allege that we are taking taxes from the pockets of the poor. A study of these figures will show that the largest available field of direct taxation is substantially the middle range of incomes, but no member of the Opposition has been prepared to urge the Government to enter that field. So much for the contention that the Government should concentrate on the man who is already carrying the burden which I have indicated. 1241 It is also stated - by honourable members opposite that customs and excise duties hear most heavily on the wage-earners. Again, reflection will show that, although in in any instances these duties are passed on, there, are substantial imposts on many luxury items, such as motor cars, petrol, the better classes of textiles, wine and spirits, and machinery which do not touch, or barely touch, the wage-earners. I invite members of the committee, particularly those who have declared that direct taxation can be increased, to show precisely how effect could be given to their contention. It is not sufficient to say that heavier direct taxes should be levied; the onus is on those who make that claim to show that such a field exists. It is certainly not my desire to impose taxes upon those persons in the community who are on the breadline, for I know how difficult life is for them. If the sales tax touches this class, then I say that the present Government Personal Exertion. Property. learned from a Labour government how to obtain additional revenue by its imposition. When first imposed, the sales a. d. s. d. tax was at the rate of 6 per cent. During 12 10 the intervening years, the rate has 10 9 16 2 fluctuated; it is again 6 per cent. If we 12 11 have regard to the available field of 12 11 direct taxation, I think that it will be 14 9 found that there is little ground for the complaint that the Government is taxing the poor. I should like honourable members opposite to show what effective way is open to increase direct taxation substantially other than by a method which will increa.se the burden upon the middle incomes of between, say, £400 and £800 a year. I come to another matter, the method of financing the programme that lies ahead of us this year. It is said that, we are not carrying enough on what is loosely called the credit structure of the country. I admit quite definitely that money is not for the purpose of determining how people shall live; I believe that the credit structure should be such as to permit people to live and to live properly. But it is just as idle to say, for example, that war is a reason for inflation as it is to say in time of peace that there is no reason why we should use the credit structure of r.he country. Credit is available for the purpose of the nation, whether it be at peace or at war. A question that arises, hovever is as to the limits to which the credit structure can ho used. It is easy to say in general terms that the resources of the country shall be used within economic limits, but it. is another thing to say cisely where the process shall finish. The Leader of the Opposition (. Mr Curtin) says, "" Look at Germany. It has used the credit - structure with the result that there is no unemployment there, or substantially no unemployment"". That may be perfectly true, but again the Leader of the Opposition has not given the full picture. I am not prepared, and I doubt if the honourable member is prepared, to go to the lengths which are involved in the full picture. If we did we should have to peg wages, as they have been pegged in Germany, control exchanges, ration essential supplies, and impose high taxes right down the scale. Finally, we should have to do as Germany did when. Dr Schacht said, "" The credit structure will bear no more "" ; we should have to take the responsibility of ""sacking"" the man who said that, because he said it, and appoint some one else in his place. I cannot understand why members of the Opposition, who represent and advocate very strongly and genuinely the interests of the workers, say that our problems may be met. hy the si mine expedient of making more money available, since once the stage of inflation was reached, as it would necessarily be. reached unless a limit were set, the people on the breadline would be taxed because their purchasing power would be reduced. In my view that is the worse possible form of indirect taxation. Mr LAzzAiti.Ni - The honourable ber does not know what we propose.",38
121,Mr SPENDER,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"I remember that Any on another occasion the honourable memto bersaid that the credit structure could be used to solve the problems that confronted us I invited the honourable t gentleman to tell me precisely how that could be done. He failed to do so then, and he has not done so yet. Mr SCUXT.IN - Every proposition that the Opposition has put forward has had in mind the price level.",39
122,Mr SPENDER,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"That may be true, but I liave not yet been told, and I should like to hear precisely, to what extent honourable members opposite would use the credit structure, what practical limdts they would place on that use, and how they propose to stop increases of prices. preThis Governmeiut does not dispute that the credit structure of die country can be used. It not only intends, but will be obliged, to use the national resources. There is no dispute as to that. The real dispute .appears to be as to the extent to which the credit structure shall be used.",39
123,Mr GBEGOKT,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"The Minister should make it clear that Herr Hitler got his money by long-term loans, which bear interest.",39
124,Mr SPENDER,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"It does not matter how he got it. The process involves the use of the national credit. But, as the honourable gentleman declares, money has been raised in Germany by long-term loans which bear interest.",39
125,Mr BEASTLY,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,And the Minister believes that the flotation of the loans should be entrusted to private financiers.,39
126,Mr SPENDER,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"I have not said so aud no other Minister has said so. It is very easy to make these statements-jus t as easy as it is to say that any problem can be solved by expanding credit. If the problems which confront us were capable of such easy solution as that, I could not understand any treasury or any bank resisting such a temptation. If prosperity automatically follows the expansion of credit, obviously no bank or government would resist it as the easiest possible method of attacking a problem. What I regard as a shallow approach to this problem is the Opposition's cry, "" Look at what the Banking Commission said: ' The Commonwealth Bank can memmake loans to the Government free of interest'"" ! No one disputes that. .member of the committee, if he cared do so, could jump from the tenth floor of a building to the ground. A quite different question is: Would he do it? It is idle to point to this report and say that the Commonwealth Bank could, if it wanted to, advance money to the Government or any person free of interest. In actual fact, if one analyses again, that is precisely what is not being done in Germany. Germany pays interest on its long-term loans; Italy and Japan do likewise. I should like the members of the committee to consider the argument that unless money is advanced free - of interest, the people pay twice us in respect of the same work. May f take the example given by the Leader of the Opposition, who said, you get X pounds to establish a particuincrease lar work, you have your work for the pounds expended upon it, but you also have to pay interest on it "" . He did tell the committee that you have of that work while paying the interest. In the establishment of any project, have on the one hand the capital cost plus interest until the capital is recouped, and on the other the use of the work, less depreciation. It is elementary sound finance dictates that interest should not exceed the value of that use less depreciation. That, of course, involves consideration of the economic value work. It is of no use for the Leader the Opposition to put a proposition like - that before the committee, because belief is created-and one has to meet in fashion-that any financial problem can be solved in this simple manner; agree as to the necessity to use the resources of the country for national poses. The Government does not resist that. Obviously, in the years immediately ahead, credit may have to be resorted very substantially. As the Treasurer (Mr Menzies) showed in his budget speech, it has already been resorted To that, honourable members of the sition responded hy saying: "" The banks have become more pliable. At last reason is dawning upon them "". That is not the fact; but if it were, it is hard to stand why the Commonwealth Bank I should be criticized for moving with the times. The fact is that, as the Treasurer indicated, the CommonWhat wealth Bank, charged as it has been with the necessity for ensuring that there shall be sufficient liquidity of funds in the community, has been more and more assisting the financial strucfore, ture of this country. I am not suggesting that it must be credited with having done this to the complete satisfaction of body, but what is the alternative ? Either we leave this control to appointed experts^ or we substitute our judgbank ment completely as to how the credit structure shall be built up. There is no difference of opinion in this committee on the main proposition. All of agree that the resources of the country should be used for the purpose of its development in the best and most eco"" If nomical manner, but if you simply credit and expend the money in X such a way that no new resources are employed the result will be inflation. not Mr MARTENS - Who has ever suggested the use that that should be done?",39
127,Mr SPENDER,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"Precisel y what you limits does the honourable member propose? It is very easy for honourable members opposite to make a popular appeal by simply saying that if they that were the Government they would expand the credit base. I ask them to give some indication of the limitations they would a impose. Although one statement of of the the Royal Commission on Monetary of and Banking Systems has been referred to ad nauseam, no reference has been made the to several other important statements it contained in that report. The commission, it is true, states that the I Commonwealth Bank can lend to the credit Government or others in a variety of purways, and it can even make money available to governments or to others free of any charge. No one disputes that. to But can honourable members opposite point to any statement in that report in which the commission says that it is to. advisable to do that? They cannot. If Oppothe Commonwealth Bank makes advances to governments and that money is taken out of the past savings of the people, it has to pay interest on such money because underit has been borrowed from the people. f , on the other hand, the bank advances credit not based on past savings, we are told thai interest should not be paid. is the result of charging interest? The Commonwealth Bank advances, we will say, on the credit of the country and charges interest, which, goes back into the people's bank, and through the bank to the people. I cannot understand, therewhat is wrong, with charging interest on advances. There is the further consideration that the hank takes up considereveryable holdings in public loans and must have negotiable securities; that is one of the best possible methods by which the can ensure the liquidity of its assets. I am not one of those who believe that in the past the credit of the country has always been used to the fullest extent desirable, but it is not of much use to seek to make a popular appeal by merely saying that the easiest way to solve oui financial difficulties is to extend the credit base - 1 noticed, amongst other matters, that no reference was made by honourable members opposite to paragraph 506 of the commission's report, which readsOn the other hand, tlio power of the Commonwealth Bank to increase the cash reserves of the trading banks is not unlimited. The bank is bound to pay in legal tender money whenever called upon. So long as its power to issue notes is restricted by law, its power to purchase securities or other property, and to lend or grant money to governments or others, is limited. Apart from the legal limitation, there is a practical limit to the note issue, in that the bank has to consider howfar it is in the general interests munity to expand credit. There is no difference at all in principle between increasing the note issue and increasing credit. In either case more money is made available. I have not heard one honourable member opposite say that there should be no reserve in respect of the note issue. If honourable members opposite are not prepared to go that far in respect of the note issue, w they say exactly what limitation should be observed in increasing the credit base?",40
128,Mr SCULLIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,The only limitation in respect of the note issue is a statutory limitation.,41
129,Mr SPENDER,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,The reason for establishing that reserve was to maintain confidence in the note issue.,41
130,Mr SCULLIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"But that does not prevent expansion of the note issue. Mr .SPENDER - I have not suggested that. I say to honourable members opposite, ""Remove the note issue reserve if you want to, but do you suggest that such a course would be advisable "" ?",41
131,Mr SCULLIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,There would be no advantage in removing it .,41
132,Mr SPENDER,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"Then honourable members opposite apparently desire a limitation in respect of the note issue, but no limitation in respect of the credit base.",41
133,Mr SCULLIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,Who suggested that there should he no limitation in respect of the credit base?,41
134,Mr SPENDER,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,1 should like to hear from any honourable member opposite precisely in what way he proposes that credit should be expanded.,41
135,Mr SCULLIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,In what way does the Government propose to expand credit? The honourable gentleman says that it will use the credit resources of the country within certain limits.,41
136,Mr SPENDER,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"I shall indicate those limits to the right honourable gentleman, aud I shall be interested to hear what limitations honourable members opposite propose. Mr LAZ/.AKINJ - We shall indicate that when we are charged with the responsibility of government.",41
137,Mr SPENDER,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"Le t me take the arguments of honourable members opposite a little further. The royal commisof the comsion's report statesThe increase in money may be carried to such a stage that, although prices rise, there is little or no increase in the total volume of production . . . The effect on prices of an expansion or contraction of money depends on the particular circumstances and is not easy to predict. In general terms, an increase in the supply money tends to raise prices, and a decrease tends to reduce them. All I have to say in conclusion is that ill this year the Government's loan expenditure will be increased from £4,000,000 to £23,000,000, and that is not final. Indeed, it may also be said that we are uot yet finished with direct taxation for this year. The actual past savings of the community are a limited amount and they will unquestionably be drawn upon, together with future savings, in this time of war. The Government will not hesitate to . use our credit structure in order to ensure that those savings shall be used for the essential development of the country. At the same time, if will see that the profiteers are kept in their place. I realise that in this respect we have stolen much of the thunder of honourable members opposite. They must now realise that the Government is resolute in its determination to stamp out profiteering. Honourable members opposite contend that this Government is always out to assist the man with money. Consequently, they regard its promise to stamp out profiteering as eye-wash. The cold fact, however, is that on this occasion prices have been substantially stabilized and the people thereby protected from profiteering such as took place at the commencement of the last war, when there was an immediate rise of prices, particularly to the detriment of the working man. .1 again invite any honourable members opposite to state in precise terms, and not in generalizations, how, if they were the Government, they would expand credit, and what particular measures they would take to implement their purpose. I , for one, would be very pleased to he illuminated on that point. If they are not prepared to do that, it is not exactly courageous of them to shelter behind a solitary statement in the report of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, and to contend that according to that statement the Government is not doing its job. In conclusion, 1 commend the motives which prompted the Leader of the Opposition to suggest that vernment should make a g if t of foodstuffs to the value of £1,000,000 to Great Britain . That suggestion will receive the earnest consideration of the Government. However, lest it should be suggested that if that course be not pursued by the Government, it is not as desirous as is the Opposition to help Great Britain, I point out that ultimately it is a question of making a g if t of money to that amount. Our foodstuffs are going overseas as fast as the available ships can take them, it is not a matter of the supply of foodstuffs, hut of freight space. In the ultimate analysis, it is :i matter of money. It may be that, after consultation Government of Great Britain , decision will be reached can assist Britain better by spending that money in another way. The foodstuffs w i ll go in any case; it is merely a matter of finance. As far as we can see at present, Great B r it a in is not. in need of finance, but I compliment the Leader of the Opposition on the spirit that prompted the suggestion, and I assure him that it will receive the earnest consideration of the Government. The Government has endeavoured to spread the burden of this budget as equitably as possible. It will not shrink from placing further burdens if practicable on those persons who are alleged to be best able to boar it, but before the war is over it will be found that the burden will be thrown on all of us, and we shall have to hear it.",41
138,Mr SCULLIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"Y a r r a ) \ ± 0 S ] - In justice to the Opposition, I desire to clarify one or two points which the Assistant Treasurer (Mr . Spender) rather succeeded in clouding. In the main 1 agree with the honourable gentleman, who has made a very interesting contribution to this discussion, but, in my opinion, his speech failed, when he endeavoured 1 to introduce political propaganda, and by implication and accusation, to misrepresent the. views of the Opposition. He invited us to state our views. I challenge the honourable gentleman to declare where the Opposition has said that credit could bo expanded without limit . He asked us to state in precise the Go- language where the limit should be, and I invite him to do the same. He has declared on behalf of the Government which has all the machinery at its disposal for making calculations and surveys of the resources of the country, whilst we have not, that the Government w i ll utilize the credit structure of the country for the carrying on of essential services. I invite him to give a precise definition of what he considers the proper limit. The Labour party has never said that a government should use the national credit, or the credit structiire, as the Assistant Minister called it , without, limitation, and I have never presumed to be ahle to say where the actual with the limi t is; but when I held a. responsible a position in this country, and when price that we levels were fallin g drastically, when deflation was the order of the day, when people were starving, not because of high prices, but because, due. to the f all of prices, there was no employment, we attempted a small measure of credit expansion, in order to provide employment and assist wheat-growers. Even then, however, we took the precaution of saying that we would watch price levels carefully, and would not let them rise above the price levels of 1929. ""We did not fix that l i m it by chance. We fixed it because 1929 was the end of a fair l y stable period of five or six years. The depression was brought about by the deflationary policy of those who restored the gold standard so that the moneys they had accumulated during the war, and invested in long-term securities at fixed rates of interest, would yield them a higher return because of a reduction of prices. The primary industries all over the world were almost destroyed because of the greed and selfishness of the rentier class. We declared as a government-and the real test is what one would do as a government-that we would not allow any expansion of the credit structure to raise prices beyond the 1929 level. I admit at once that the power of a government successfully to use the national credit is greatly restricted unless it also has power to fix prices. The present Government is assuming that power under the ""National Security Act, and I am glad. I am not at all jealous that our thunder has been stolen. I do not want any thunder- I want justice for the people. I emphatically refute, however, the suggestion that the Labour party stands for unlimited expansion of credit and inflation. Moreover, we are emphatically opposed to allowing the private banks to expand credit in order to make profits, hut we do not hear a word about that from honourable members on the other side.",42
139,Mr HUTCHINSON,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,-How do the private banks do it?,43
140,Mr SCULLIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"-If the honourable member had read the report of the royal commission on banking he would know. Every one knows that the private banks expanded credit during the last war, which wasfinanced,to a very large extent, hy inflation of money and prices at the expense of the masses of the people. The interests that benefited most by inflation were the private banking institutions, and they were allowed to do so. We all know that, they practised inflation. more you give them as a basis of credit the more they will inflate, and they were encouraged to do it during, the last war. We know that any one depositing £10 with a hank was able to buy a Government £100 bond, and pay the rest over a period of years. The whole process was one of inflation, and it was practised in every country, with the resulft that the war was fought at the expense of the masses of toilers. It was not until 1929 that the basic wage, which had for years been chasing the cost of living, finally caughi up with it. Knowing that, our party would not stand for a policy of inflation, which is an indirect and ruthless method of reducing wages and other purchasing power. We say this, however: Where the credit structure can he used within sound limits, which must - be ascertained from time to time",43
141,Mr HUTCHINSON,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,B y whom?,43
142,Mr SCULLIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"B y the economic and financial advisers of the Government. Insofar as the credit structure of the country can be safely used, we say that it should be used, but only hy the Commonwealth Bank-the people's bank. That is where we stand. When we speak in general terms about utilizing the credit resources of the country through the Commonwealth Bank in order to bring idle man-power and natural resources into production, we mean that we shall do so to the exclusion of the private banks. I desire to make clear an observation on the note issue. I do not believe that a gold reserve is of any value in restricting the expansion of the note issue. The only worth-while restriction-and there should be a restriction, because it would be dangerous not to have one-is a statutory provision limiting the amount of the note issue. Of what use is it to say that the note issue must have a 25 per cent, gold hacking, and to expect that such a provision will prevent inflation, when the bank board, if it so desired, can print a million pounds worth of notes, buy a million pounds of gold with them, and on that basis print another £4,000,000 worth of notes, and go on repeating thai process? The note reserve is a fetish, a superstition. Its only value as a note reserve is the psychological effect it has in inducing the people to accept notes as The legal tender. I would not abolish the reserve as it has a value as a national reserve. Mr SriaKDicii - What ' is the gold reserve for?",43
143,Mr SCULLIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"For the balancing of international accounts when the balance of trade is against us; when we cannot pay for imports with exports. Previously we had a gold reserve in the form of sovereigns and ingots buried in the vaults of the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney. It was lying there idle and useless, hut now we have no gold reserve. The reserve we have in London today is held in sterling, or, in other words, British securities of a liquid nature. That is the only place where the reserve could be of any value. It is of no use whatever in restricting the expansion of our note issue.",43
144,Sir CHARLES MAKR,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"-If we did have it, we should be compelled to balance our trade.",44
145,Mr SCULLIN,PUBLIC TELEPHONES I N,"If we had no way of balancing our imports with exports, we should be in an insolvent position. Therefore, we need this reserve, and it is a safeguard. It has also a psychological (.'tTcot upon the minds of those who accept our notes as legal tender, but they would have to accept them in any case. When the Government of which I was leader desired to ship a portion of the idle gold reserve of this country overseas, and have some use made of it j the minority in this chamber was horrified; the hill was passed by the House of Representatives but was rejected in the Senate. Yet my Government had not been out of office three months when .Parliament agreed to send the whole of the gold reserve overseas, and I think that, the right thing was done. is stupid to have gold lying idle, when it; can be kept in the only place where it would be of use. When I am challenged to say whether 1 would abolish the reserve of the note issue, I say that I would not. If the nation experienced a crisis in which it could not balance payments hy an excess pf exports over imports, and could not meet its obligations without borrowing overseas- a wrong method that was adopted for a number of years before my Government took office-it would be compelled to call upon that reserve in order to prevent default. Therefore, the .reserve has a real value. I do not complain about having a reserve; but in my opinion it is not large enough. In 1927, when Mr Bruce was Prime Minister, I pleaded with him from the very place wliere I now stand to stop the flood of imports into Australia, to cease financing rhe in by means of overseas loans, and, instead, to build up in London a reserve of £30,000,000 or £40,000,000, so that we should have it there when, the value of our exports would not meet our imports and other charges. I little thought that it would fall to my lot to be the responsible Minister to face a crisis such as I then predicted; but many others had given similar advice that went unheeded. I mention this fact to show that the Assistant Treasurer is not justified in giving the impression to the people of this country that members of the Labour not party are wild-cat financiers, since it was .a Labour Government that rescued Australia from the reckless financial dealings of the preceding Government. This war should he prosecuted without profiteering in either goods or money. The most shameful thing done in the last war was to say to people who had money to lend on the credit of the nation that they could get practically double the rate of interest that was obtainable in time of peace, although our soldiers who had been earning 15s. or £1 a day went into the trenches for 6s. a day. That was a scandal, and I hope that it will not be repeated. Whatever methods of finance are employed-and I suppose that every method will be employed, including loans, taxation and the utilization of the credit of the nation through the Commonwealth Rank- I hope that the Government will see that those who have money to lend It shall receive, at most, the normal rate of interest if they are not. patriotic enough to lend at a lower rate when other men are called upon to make much greater sacrifices. I rose merely to make the position of the Labour party clear. Progress reported. , NA BILL (No. 5) 1939. SECOND REAPING.",44
146,Mr SPENDER,SALES TAX ASSESSMENT,"Warringah-Assistant Treasurer) [3.12] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. This bill, which was foreshadowed in the budget speech, is designed to increase the taxable sale value upon which sales tax is payable by retailers and other persons upon the importation of goods into Australia. The bill will remove a competitive anomaly which at present exists between retailers and wholesalers, in respect ofsales tax payable upon imported goods. The general scheme of the sales tax law is designed to require the payment of sales tax upon >t wholesale selling value of all goods sold in Australia, other than goods in respect of which exemption is authorized hy the law. A wholesale merchant who imports goods for sale by wholesale is required by the law io enter the goods at the customs free of sales tax, and is subsequently required to pay tax upon the amount for which he sells the goods to retailers for re-sale. It will be realized that exchange is taken into account by the merchant, together with other costs, in arriving at the price for which the goods are sold, and upon which tax is payable. On the other hand, however, a retail merchant who imports goods for sale by retail is required under the existing law to pay sales tax in respect of those goods at the time of entry for home consumption, upon values which arc not, in fact, expressed in terms of Australian, currency. In these cases the law requires tax. to be paid upon a "" sale value"" representing an amount which exceeds by twenty per centum the sum of(i) the value for duty of those goods; and (ii) the duty of customs payable respect of the goods. With few exceptions, such as goods imported, from New Zealand, the value for duty of imported goods, for the purposes of customs duty, is expressed in terms of sterling, and in terms of Australian currency. Thus the taxable sale values for sales tax purtralian poses, which are based on these values for duty, tire not related to Australian currency. This point was of little importance 1930, when the sales tax law was introThis duced, as the rate of exchange, Australia on London, was then in the vicinity £106. It is now £125 buying, and £125 10s. selling. This substantial increase has caused the exchange factor assume consi.dera.hle importance. means that a wholesale merchant who pays tax on his Australian currency sale prices of imported goods is at a considerthis able disadvantage from a sales tax point of view, in competition with a retailer who imports comparable goods and pays sales tax on values which are based on sterling. Mr Spender. It may be explained that the provision in the existing law for the addition of 20 per cent, to the sum of the value for duty and the duty to ascertain the taxable sale value for sales tax purposes was not designed to cover the exchange factor. It was designed to arrive at a figure which would include other importing cos.K. together with a reasonable measure of profit to the importer, and which would, in general, represent the fair wholesalevalue of the goods if sold in Australia. It must be admitted that in respect of some classes of goods, the addition of 20 per cent, may be too low to reach a fair wholesale value, whilst in some few cases it may be a little high for that purpose. In the vast majority of cases, however, and taking the taxable field of goods as a whole, it is considered that the 20 per cent, originally decided upon does no more than cover the costs,' charges and profits, exclusive of the exchange involved, which would normally form part of a fair wholesale sale price. It would, of course, be impracticable to attempt to prescribe varying percentages for all the different classes of goods affected. It is considered, from a practical point of view, that 20 per cent, is fair for general in application to all cases, provided that action is now taken to require exchange to be reckoned as proposed in this bill. It will be noted that, the bill provides not that the rate of exchange to be used in converting values for duty into Auscurrency shall be the telegraphic transfer selling rate, as fixed by the-Commonwealth Bank, at the date of export of the goods from the country of export. The present telegraphic transfer selling in rate, Australia on London, is £125 10s. rate has remained constant, owing to regulation by the Commonwealth Bank of Board, since the 3rd December, 1931. It is proposed that the conversion of to values for duty into Australian currency It shall come into operation in respect of importations on and from the 1st October, 1939. The fixing of a definite date in manner is necessary in order to avoid confusion amongst importers and their agents. The scheme will not necessarily be applicable to all entries of goods on and from that date, as it will definitely not apply to entries of goods which were-. in tact, imported into Australia prior to the 1st October, 1939. i i may be explained that the High Court of Australia has held in the case Wdson v. Chambers & Co. Pty. Ltd. I .192G), reported in 38 C.L.R. 131, that goods are imported into the Commonwealth whenever they are brought into their port of destination for the purpose of being finally discharged in Australia at that port, and that the discharge of the goods from the importing vessel is not required to complete the importation. The port of final discharge of such goods may 1x3 a coastal port at which the importing vessel does not call, and, therefore, the goods must be landed for transport by land or sea to the coastal port for final discharge. In such a case the date of the arrival of the goods at the coastal port is the date of their importation into Australia. I commend the bill to honourable members as a measure which will result in the removal of a definite anomaly by placing retail importers on more even terms with wholesale, importers from the point of view of their liability for sales tax. It is estimated that during the current financial year, the bill will produce additional revenue amounting to £120,000. Debate (on motion by Mr Forde) adjourned. STATES GRANTS BILL 1939.

The giants for which approval is sought m this bill are those recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission to be paid to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania during the financial year 1939-40.

Whilst the total amount of the grants now recommended, viz., £2,020,000, is th»» same as the total of the grants paid last year, this is not a true comparison because of the fact that both last year and this year reductions are made from the normal grant to Western Australia in order to repay advances made in previous years. As will be seen from the following comparison, the total normal grants for 1938-39 were £2,064,000, whilst the total normal grants for this year are £2,156,000, an increase for this year £92,000 f- Grant. of advance South Australia . . 1,040,000 Western Australia 014,000 Tasmania 410,000 Total 2,004,000 South Australia . . 993,000 Western Australia 731,000 Tasmania 430,000 Total 2,150,000 136,000 The general principles upon which the recommendations of the commission are based have been explained to the House at some length in previous years; and I do not propose, therefore, to enter at this stage of the bill into a full and lengthy discussion of the principles inover, volved in arriving at the amount now to proposed. These principles are explained very fully in the commission's sixth report, which was recently tabled copies of which are available to honorallowance able members. It is necessaTy, however,, to explain that the plan which the mission has evolved and followed in each of its' six reports is to base the grants recommended for the three 'States confinancial cerned on financial needs, as indicated a comparison of their budgets with those of the non-claimant States. The grants recommended are calculated to bring finances of the claimant 'States up to the commission considers to he a fair Australian standard. In. short, the mission is of the opinion that the grants should be sufficient to enable a State which is in difficulties to function at standard not appreciably below that other States. The States concerned, ever, are required to make some effort themselves to remedy their inferior financial position. il/V. Svetifh-r. I think, perhaps, that it is necessary to mention that the basis adopted by the commission has evoked some criticism, to which reference has been made when subof mitting legislation for approval in previous years. It has been claimed by cer1938-39. tain of the States concerned that the grants which are .made to them Normal Adjustment Set should be based on compensation for Grant. disabilities arising from federation or In 1930-37. the effects of federal policy. The Grants £ £ £ Commission has given very careful con1,040,000 sideration to this aspect and in earlier 44,000 570,000 410,000 reports has expressed the opinion that, 44,000 2.020,000 the necessity for grants to these States is in no case due to any appreciable extent 1939-40. to the operation of federal policy. The commission states in its present report Normal Adjustment Net that it is convinced of the impracticability Grant. of advance Srant. of assessing special grants on the basis In 1937-38. of disabilities arising from federation and £ £ £ the operation of federal policy. In the 985,000 view of the commission-and this view 136,000 695,000 430,000 is said to have been supported by many 2,020,000 expert witnesses who appeared before the commission-the reactions of the protective tariff and other aspects of federal policy are so interwoven with the financial and economic structure of Australia as n whole that it is impossible to express in monetary terms their full .effect on the finances of the individual States. Moreeven if it, were practicable correctly assess the financial effect of federation and federal policy on the finances of the claimant States, it would at the same and time be necessary to make proper for the advantages which accrue to those States from federation. This comfactor has been given a great deal of consideration hy the commission as is evident from its various reports. Any disability which a State suffers by by reason of federation will be reflected in the State's budgetary results, and is automatically provided for by the comthfmission's method of assessing grants what according to "" financial needs"". The commission is satisfied that the only safe comand practicable basis upon which these grants can be assessed is the careful analysis of the relative financial position a of the States as expressed in their annual of budgets. This fundamental principle was howexpressed by the commission in one of its earlier reports as follows:Special grants are justified when a State through financial stress from any canse i? unable efficiently to discharge its functions a member of the federation, and should be determined by the amount of help found necessary to make it possible for that State by reasonable effort to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States. The adoption of the principle just States, viz.; stated has involved a careful comparison by the commission of the budgetary results of the claimant States - with those of the non-claimant .States. The accounts of all States are not compiled on a uniform basis, and it is accordingly necessary the commission to make certain adjusttinues ments of the figures in order to place tha budgetary results on a comparable basis. Having arrived at the amount that is required to raise the claimant States to the budgetary standards of the nonshall claimant States, the commission then proclaimant ceeds to make certain adjustments which it considers necessary after a comparison of the relative severity of taxation in several States, differences in social services, costs of administration, and other relevant factors. Last year, the commission introduced a new feature into its work. In its report fov that year the commission expressed the view that, in times of prosperity, claimant State should take action to prove its financial position which it not take in less prosperous years, and that it should not incur expenditure is unjustified or uneconomic. The mission examined the finances of the claimant States from that angle and posed certain nominal penalties with view to drawing the attention of the claimant States to their duty in that respect. The items particularly examined were: In the case of South Australia, the failure to recover debts due to the Crown; in the case of Western Australia, the expenditure of loan moneys on unferences productive projects; and in the case of years. Tasmania, the failure to take action to secure an improvement of the railway finances in that State. In its present report the commission expresses the belief that its criticism of last year has been adequately met, thoueh in certain accounts improvement is noted. In parcould ticular, the commission has mentioned heavy loan fund expenditure on unprofluctuations ductive road works, notwithstanding the greatly increased Federal Aid Roads grants from the Commonwealth, the as gerous trend in railway losses, and losses on land settlement in Tasmania. After considering all these factors concerned the commission decided to make general deductions from the grants of the three South Australia 22,000 Western Australia .. 22,000 Tasmania ' .. 23,000 I think honourable members will agree for that so long as the Commonwealth conto make subventions to the States based on their budgetary accounts, a duty devolves upon the commission, and finally upon this Parliament, to ensure that the interests of all federal taxpayers be protected to the extent that the States shall be required to maintain their finances on a sound basis. For this reason the. Government endorses the the procedure adopted by the commission to the cost of achieve"" this objective. The calculations by the commission for the purpose of assessing the grants for the present year are based on the financial results for the year 1937-38, which is the latest year for which complete statistics are available. It has been complained a that the calculations made by the commisimsion are based on figures which are, in caneffect, two years old. The term commonly used in this regard is the "" timewhich lag "". As anexample, the grants procomposed for the year which commenced on the 1st July, 1939, are based on the finanimcial position of the States for the year a ended on the SOth June, 1938. There are disadvantages attaching to this procedure as the conditions two years ago may not truly reflect the circumstances of the present time, but any inequality which might result from the use of figures of a previous year is not cumulative, as difwill balance out. over a term of It has been sometimes urged that a formula should be evolved so that the amounts of the grants could be automatinot cally fixed for a term of years. In the view of the commission, a fixed formula not take full account of the relathe tive effects of changes in prices, wages, of trade, unemployment, the effects of droughts, floods and bush-fires, and movements of population, as well as danthe effects of external influences on the economy of the nation. Another factor to be borne in mind is the changing position caused by the uneven growth of Federal and State responsibilities in relation to their financial resources. The commission considers that, in'view of tuating financial and economic conditions, financial adjustments in the form of special grants cannot be fairly assessed without a searching annual review of the finances and economic conditions of all the States. T shall now refer briefly to the variations of the grants now proposed from those recommended and paid last year. The reduction of £45,000 in South Australia's grant is due in the main to improved economic conditions in 1937-38, the year upon which the present grants are based. The total revenue and the taxation revenue of the State constituted records and a surplus was achieved for the fourth successive year. Whilst the grant recommended for Western Australia is £25,000 in excess of that recommended last year, actually the normal grant now recommended is £117,000 greater than the normal grant of last. year. The normal grant for last year was £614,000, but a deduction of £44,000 was made to adjust an advance made in 3 936-37, the grant actually paid being £570,000. The normal grant recommended for this year is £731,000, from which is deducted a special advance of £136,000 made in 1937-38 on account of drought. The increase of the normal grant is therefore £117,000. This increase is due to the effects of drought, which serious repercussions on the income year 3936-37, on which the taxation assessments for 1937-38 were based. The grant recommended for Tasmania ii- £20,000 greater than that of last year. This is caused mainly by changes in the relative financial positions of the States. There is ample evidence that the commission, which has been set up as an independent body to investigate the claims of the States for financial assistance, has discharged its duty with thoroughness and in a wholly impartial manner. The Oovernment therefore considers that it must accept the amounts recommended by the commission as special grants as bona fide recommendations to adjust the financial needs of the if r . Spender. claimant States. The Government has accepted the recommendations of the Grants Commission in all past years, and it has decided to accept the commission's recommendations in this fluc- instance. I commend the bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Foam) adjourned. AUDIT 1 ON AL TA XATIO N PROPOSALS.",44
147,Mr SPENDER,SALES TAX ASSESSMENT," by leave-The Treasurer (Mr Menzies) in his budget speech on the Sth September, indicated that, because of the large increase of expenditure to carry out the Government's defence programme, the tax proposals then submitted could not be regarded a* «ita.tic, and that it would be necessary later to submit additional proposals for increased taxation in the present financial year. During the last three or four days (iabinet has given consideration to the matter, and it is thought desirable that an announcement should be made as early as possible as to further imposts which have been decided upon as immediately necessary. In the time that has been available to us since the budget was introduced, we have not had an opportunity completely to review the whole of the tax field, but certain important factors affecting the hudget have made necessary an immediatesurvey at this early stage. Increased expenditure involved by measures taken had just prior to or since the outbreak of the war is about £6,000,000, and there can be no doubt that, in the year that lies immediately ahead of us, further expenditure will be inevitable. It is also anticipated that, as a direct result of the war there will be substantial reductions of customs revenue. It is yet too early to say what will be the amount, but no one can doubt that it may be substantial. It is not, unreasonable to expect a loss of £5,000.000 or more. As has. already been announced, the Government is preparing its plans on the assumption that war conditions may last for three years or more. It is impossible to estimate, with any degree of accuracy, the effect on the budget of a prolonged conflict, but it is certain that the proposals brought down H few days ago will be totally inadequate to meet obligations which wo may be called upon to bear. Tho Government has reviewed certain tax fields for the purpose of ascertaining what it can do immediately. It is advisable, as I have indicated, that any additional tax proposals should be made known as early as possible after they have been decided upon, in order that the taxpayers will have some knowledge of their precise liabilities. Honourable members will remember that the budget contains proposals to increase income tax collections by £2,360,000, sales tax by £1,420,000, and customs and excise duties by' £2,1.30,000, making the total of additional tax collections £5,910,000. After careful consideration, the Government has decided to submit a proposal further to increase the companies tax, which the budget increased fro m I3.8d. in the £1 to 1.9.«d. This was estimated to produce an additional £1,360,000. A further levy of 4.2d. is now proposed, making the total tax 2s. in the £ 1 . It is estimated that this ther increase will yield an additional £1,000,000. Another new tax proposal relates to certain profits of gold-mining which, honourable members, I am sure, will appreciate when I have placed the facts before them, are due solely to circumstances and conditions arising out of the war. Because the price of gold has increased solely because of the outbreak of Avar, the Government believes that the increase of the price of gold represents in substance on unearned increment and should be taxable for war purposes. It was suggested that it might he possible to fix 20s. a fine ounce as the approximate amount of the increase. I think that honourable members will, however, regard as a fairer basis, a tax of 75 per cent, of the amount hy which gold exceeds £9 Australian currency an ounce of fine. gold. At present profits of gold-mining are exempt from Commonwealth income tax, both as to profits in the hands of gold-mining companies and dividends in the hands of shareholders. These profits are also exempt from most State taxation except i u Western Australia and Tasmania. High prices for gold have benefited the industry for several years. The. war has caused the dollar sterling exchange to depreciate, with the result that the price of gold has risen considerably in the last ten days. For instance, in 193S-39, the average price of gold, was £9 Is. 2d. an oz.; in July, 1939, it rose to £9 43. l i d . ; in August, the price was £9 8s. 7d. The price today is £10 10s., an increase of nearly 30s. an oz. over the average for 1938-39. Similar legislation is contemplated in the Union of South A f r i c a and Rhodesia, but the Government does not know whether that legislation has yet been implemented. Announcements have appeared in the newspapers that both of these governments intend to appropriate the proceeds of gold over £7 10s. sterling a fine oz. The Union of South Africa in 1933 taxed gold profits heavily when the. South African currency was depreciated to the level of sterling in that year. The recent exchange premium is by way of a windfall due to war, and presents a strong case for a contribution to the Commonwealth revenue upon lines somewhat similar to those which, it; is understood, fur- have been adopted in the Union of South Africa and Rhodesia. The Government, therefore, proposes to place a tax on all gold delivered to the Commonwealth Bank or its agents on and after today, the 15th September. The tax will he 75 per cent, of the amount by which the price of fine gold, as fixed by the Commonwealth Bank fro m time to time, exceeds £9 Australian currency. As all gold must now he delivered to the Commonwealth Bank or its agents, arrangements will be made for the tax to be collected by the Commonwealth Bank. . Mr MCHUGH - The price of gold will vary from time to time.",49
148,Mr SPENDER,SALES TAX ASSESSMENT,"Yes , there may be fluctuations, hut. the tax will vary in direct proportion to the increase of price over rind above £!> a fine ounce. Mr AKOHIK GAM'KRON - Coul d not the same result he achieved by acquiring all rhe gold; that process would be much cheaper.",50
149,Mr SPENDER,SALES TAX ASSESSMENT,"The procedure is simple. All the gold must bo delivered to the Commonwealth Bank or to the bank's agents. When the actual quantity of fine gold is determined, the tax will be col lee tod by the Commonwealth Rank. The tax will be imposed on gold produced in Papua and New Guinea, as well as on gold produced in the Commonwealth. The present production of gold is about 1,800,000 fine ounces a year. The amount of tax collected will depend upon the price of gold. If the price averages £10 10s. a fine ounce, die Government will receive about £1,500,000 for the balance of this year. The remaining 25 per cent, of the excess price over the £9 will remain with the companies and shareholders to provide an offset against a rise of mining costs, and will probably provide some additional benefit. It is estimated that the additional revenue fro m company tax will be £1,000,000, and from excess gold profits* £1,500,000, or a total £2,500,000. The Government regrets that it is necessary to impose additional taxes, but in the circumstances it is unavoidable. It is with great reluctance that further burdens are imposed on comquestioned panies, particularly in New South ""Wales, where they are already bearing a heavy burd'en.

150,Mr FORDE,SALES TAX ASSESSMENT,"Capricornia) [ 3 . 5 4 ] . ^ -! should like the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr John Lawson) to make a definite pronouncement as to the Government's proposals in connection with the total Australian cotton-growing industry. In the act passed in 1934 which expires in November, provision is made for the of payment of a bounty. The cbttoh-growers are anxious to know whether it is proposed to re-enact that legislation or whether the industry is to be assisted in some other way. For some weeks I have the Minister oh this matter. I raised it in the closing days of the last period of the session, and was given ths assurance by the Minister that there was no cause for anxiety, and that the cotton growers could rest assured that he would 1939. not let them down. I was impelled to raise it , by telegrams which I had received from cotton-growers in my own electorate. I have been waiting for a long time for a definite pronouncement by the Minister. The subject was referred to the Tariff Board on the 13th September, 1938, and the board submitted its report on the 3rd A p r i l , 1939. The Minister on the 12th of 'this month replied to a questhe tion by me in the following terms:Important aspects of the raw cotton industry are still the subject of discussion between the Commonwealth and Queensland Govern.be ments. It is hoped that the Government's decision will be available at an early date. I consider that I have reason to feel of anxious, particularly as the period is conapproaching when the cotton-growers must plant their crops. Australian facthat, tories use 35,000 bales of raw cotton a the year. Last year the local production was approximately 12,000 bales. There are desome 3,000 growers and 2,000 seasonal thereworkers in the industry, which was worth these £400,000 to Queensland last year. It is gold a small man's industry, the average acreage being approximately 15 acres. I submit to the Minister that it is advisable to. make an early decision which, will induce cotton-growers to increase their acreage. The Government of Queensland has decided upon a developmental scheme of irrigation,, with the object, of substantially increasing the production of cotton. That Government realizes the. considerable importance of this industry, and the necessity to produce at least the whole of Australia's requirements. It now rests with the Minister to fulfil the very definite promise he made to. me in this House, that I could rest assured that he would not let the cottonrgrowers of Queensland down. Surely sufficient time has elapsed since April last for the Government to have come to a decision as to whether the existing legislation shall be re-enacted or amending legislation introduced. If the Minister is not at present in a position .to make a definite statement, I ask ham to give to me the assurance that he will do so next week.",51

152,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SALES TAX ASSESSMENT,"BarkerLeader of the Country party) [3.58] I bring under, the notice of the Minister for Defence (Mr Street) a position that may arise by reason of the fact that quite a number of onr fellow citizens are offering themselves at the French Consulate-General for active service with the French Foreign Legion. 1 should like to know whether the Government has taken any steps to prevent such use of our man-power"", seeing that we may need to have recourse to it ourselves before the termination of the present conflict. I take this stand, because I remember that, during the Spanish civil war, quite a number of persons left Australia to participate in it.' I understand that the Foreign Enlistments Prohibition Act is still in operation. I should like to know, so soon as the Minister is able to tell me, what the attitude of the Government JS. On Tuesday last the Padme Ministei (Mr Menzies) informed the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Nock) that no persons had been released from internthose ment a3 the result of political pressure. Yesterday, in reply to, a question, by the Leader of the Opposition (M'.r. Curtin), the right honourable gentleman said that he had. intervened in a certain case with the Minister for Defence (Mr. Street). In. this matter, we have to be very careful tn see that only the necessities of the situation govern internment. The internal security of Australia is a rather important matter. In view of the peculiar circumstances, I ask the. Prime Minister whether the papers relating to the case referred to by the Leader of the Opposition may be made available. 1 should also like him to state whether or not the release of the person concerned was made under instructions conveyed in a telegram to the proper authorities? If such instructions were given either by telegram or by letter, would it be possible for them to be made available to the House some time next; week? I have no desire whatever that any person who might be acting detrimentally to. the welfare of this country should continue his present avocation, hut I do think that a very serious precedent would be established, and one that would certainly redound to the very great danger and detriment of this country in. time of war, if any Minister of the Grown, either the Prime Minister or any other Minister, were to give instructions for the release of any person from internment before the evidence in the possession of the police and the military authorities, on which that . person had been interned, was thoroughly examined by a competent authority; and in that competent, authority I naturally include the Government, which, after all, over-rides all military law in this country. I further invite the Prime Minister to make next week a statement which will show how many persons have been released from internment under conditions similar to thpse that operated in the case to which I have referred, and, if the information may lndisclosed by the competent authorities, bow many of those whom it was thought advisable to re-intern have eluded reinternment since instructions to that effect were given.",52
153,Mr WHITE,SALES TAX ASSESSMENT,"Balaclava) [4.2] - I asked the Minister for Defence (Mr. Street) today to state whether any of persons who had heen released and whose re-internment had been ordered couid not be found, and his reply was that, so far as he knew, three of those who had been released had been reinterned. Either he or some other Minister replied to a similar question by the honourable member for Riverina (Mr. Nock) in different terms. This reply was that a number had been released on parole, and while they behaved themselves they would not be re-interned. The honourable gentleman has not yet answered the question as to whether some of those who were released cannot now be located. J. should be glad if he would explain the matter more fully.",52
154,Mr MAKIN,SALES TAX ASSESSMENT,"Hindmarsh) [4.3] Some weeks ago, I drew attention to anomalous situations that were arising in respect of certain provisions of the repatriation administration, particularly by reason of the rigidity of the act. The Minister (Mr Harrison) will remember that I said that certain medical decisions were very conflicting and were rather inexplicable at times. I informed him that cases had been brought to my notice of men who had returned from active service medically unfit, had been adjudged as having a disability either due to, or aggravated by, war service, and had been granted pensions which had subsequently been withdrawn although they were still suffering from the same disability. The Minister asked me to cite a specific case which would give a clear idea of the nature of my complaint and substantiate my contention that injustice was being done. I have had brought to my notice a case which I think comes within this category. The man in question approached the repatriation authorities for the accepsuffers tance of his disability. It was accepted upon his return to Australia, from active service, and he was given a half-rate sion as well as medical treatment. Later, the doctors decided that his disability not to be regarded as due to war. There is nothing more that, this man can do; unless he can bring fresh evidence in support, of his claim, he has no possible hope of obtaining redress. The department already has in its possession all the evidence that he can supply. It would appear that there have been some remarka.hle misunderstandings regarding certain aspects of the case. I shall not close any confidences by giving details of this case, for I have not seen the file. All of the information that I now present to the House was obtained from the man himself, Mr R. E. Cragg. He enlisted in August, 1914, at Gawler, where he was examined and passed by the doctor at the recruiting station. He was drafted to Morphettville, but when he presented himself for a second medical examination, he was rejected because his teeth needed attention. Evidently he did not persevere with his enlistment at that time. Instead he went to Port Augusta, where he worked for the Commonwealth Government as a fireman. While there, he was taken ill , while still in the employ of the Commonwealth Government, and was operated on for appendicitis. After his discharge from hospital, he worked with the Broken Hill Associated Smelters at Port Pirie. There seems to be some confusion as to the cause of his first rejection. Dr Griffiths, the department's doctor, said that this man's rejection for active service was due to his condition arising from appendicitis, whereas it was due to his dental condition. Mr Cragg enlisted again in January, 1917, and embarked for overseas in May of that year. During the voyage he had the misfortune to be injured in one eye as the result of a hammock stick falling down a wind chute. The accident necessitated several stitches in the wound. Even in regard to that injury, the records appear to be confused, because I understand that they assert that appendicitis developed immediately upon embarkation. The operation for appendicitis was performed in 1915, before his second enlistment. To-day Mr Cragg from certain abdominal injuries, which have been the cause of much discomfort since his return to Australia in pen- 1919. Almost immediately on his return he was treated in hospital. Later he was was discharged as medically unfit and was sent to the Torrens Park hospital by the Medical Board, which certified that his disability was aggravated by his active service. The report statesNoticed trouble as above in right abdomen in France. Still has similar attacks, but otherwise feels well. Discharged, but to return for further treatment if he has any further trouble. Incapacity half. dis- Although that was the report of the Medical Board, this man has been denied the treatment that he should have received in accordance with the board's direction. Two years later Dr Griffiths, who was the Divisional Medical Officer in Adelaide, statedI t is difficult to connect up present disability with war service. Mr Cragg had had some heated word* with Dr Griffiths, and it is evident that the doctor had not forgotten the incident. Although Dr Griffiths said that it 'was difficult to connect Mr . Cragg's disability with his war service, he recommended that he be supplied with a surgical belt. The case was referred to Dr Corbin, of Adelaide, for an opinion as to the advisability of an operation. Dr Corbin reported that the man suffered from an old appendicitis trouble, which was not due to war service, and drew attention to the fact that Mr Cragg weighed 15 stone. At no time was he of slight build ; when he enlisted, at the age of 32 years, his weight was 13 st. 5 lb. On the 13th May, 1921, Dr Griffiths certified that his disability was not due to war service, and cancelled the order which he had previously given for a surgical belt. His report ""statedDisability not sufficient to make him eligible for training and he is fit to work at pre-war occupation. Mr Cragg then endeavoured to do as the doctor suggested; he returned to work, but after two or three months he had to discontinue his employment. He went back to Gawler, where he was examined by Dr Lewis, who reported, that he was suffering from shooting pains in the right side, which had developed i France, and that the pain occurred first with heavy lift in g , and had since been ting more frequent and severe. He said yesterday. that the man was normal except for a large appendicitis scar which thickened and was tender. Mr Cragg's cost case was then reported on by a specialist, who gave an adverse decision, and sugboarders, gested that an increase of 4 stone weight was the cause of his disability. dation,"" Here, again, there seems to he some conand fusion, because when Dr Corbin examined, Mr Cragg in 1921, his weight was 1 st. 9 lb. above his weight at enlistment. Within twelve months it was assumed that his weight had increased 4 stone. Dr Lewis then returned to the case and reportedThe above condition is the result of the strain of war service upon operation scar. Condition not due to his default. Dr Griffiths again made a recommendation to the department in which he strongly advised rejection of the appeal. This man has now exhausted all possibility of his securing justice unless the Minister takes a personal interest in the case.",53

156,Mr BARNARD,SALES TAX ASSESSMENT,"Bass) [ 4 . 1 7 ] - I rise to urge upon the Prime Minister (Mr . Menzies) the necessity for the application in - Canberra of the appeal made by him that business should be carried on as usual. I appeal against any slackening of the works programme in this city. My inspiration for speaking on this matter today lies in two reports published in the Canberra Times this morning. The first report isOVERCROWDING. CONDITIONS IN CANBKBKA. Fourteen in Fuur-roomed Ilouse. Evidence of unsatisfactory housing condin tions in Canberra was given by the Director of the Canberra Tourist Bureau (Mr W. J.

Mr Dunbar said that one four-roomed house in Canberra WHS occupied by fourteen some of whom slept in the garage and in others in tents in the back yard. "" Canberra is urgently in need of accommohe added, "" It is the national capital yet tourist services have often to advise visitors to stay away as it would be impossible to secure accommodation anywhere.""",54
157,Mr COLLINS,SALES TAX ASSESSMENT,Mr Dunbar admitted that he knew of no other case. That was by just an isolated case.,54
158,Mr BARNARD,SALES TAX ASSESSMENT,"Tb e member for Hume (Mr Collins), a member of the Public Works Committee, says that the witness admitted that that case was isolated. Nevertheless, it is a fact that the people of Canberra have difficulty in obtaining residential: accommodation, either houses or lodgings, and within my lifetime 1 hope to see the disparity between the supply and the demand made up. The position has become worse every year since I first came to Canberra as a member of Parliament five years ago. I remember that when parliamentarians first came here they all had to hoard at. the one hotel; we were allowed to go to no other. Married persons, whose jobs demand that they live in Canberra cannot get houses. Single men and women have difficulty in obtain-ing board. Certain people who have to be in Canberra when Parliament is in session can obtain accommodation only at high rates and, even then, it is intimated to them that they will not he welcome as boarders for long periods because the hotels find the casual visitors more profitable. The position will he aggravated if the following report, the second of those I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, be true:PRICE FIXING . NEW STAFF »XW CANHICKRA.

It is ridiculous that administrative staffs should be situated in other cities, requiring departmental heads to come Canberra when Parliament is in session or Ministers to go from Canberra to them. In the last twelve months there has been a fair amount of vestigation activity in the provision of more houses. honourable and 1 hope that in the yearsto come that activity will not be diminished - that noother issue will he allowed to intrude and prevent Canberra from receiving fair treatment. I close with a further appeal to the Prime Minister to heed his own slogan: ""Business as usual"".",55
159,Mr STREET,SALES TAX ASSESSMENT,"Corangamite-Minister for Defence) [4.25] - The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) asked whether the Government proposed to take any action to prevent individuals from offering their services to the Erench Consul for enlistment in the French Foreign Legion,, and suggested that legislation existed prohibiting such enlistments. I have not been able to find any act containing such a provision, and I doubt very much whether there is any such, prohibition. If any individuals have offered their services in this direction, I imagine that they are few. At this juncture, the Government, I think, would take no action to prevent such enlistments. In reply to the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White), I point out that in answer to a question, I said that I thought there were three cases of aliens who had been interned, released and reinterned. That is correct. A. number of appointed aliens were interned and released and further examined, but in these cases, it was decided on the dossiers to continue tlieir release under conditions laid down These latter cases, perhaps, are responsible for the nf misunderstanding which apparently has arisen in the honourable member's mind.

Apparently an inwas made, aud I gather from my colleague that the man was released and later re-interned. As to the tabling of papers with respect to any case of internment of an alien, it would seem to me, and I imagine to honourable members generally, that it would be contrary to the public interest to have individual cases made the subject of publicity, involving disclosure of the sources of information upon which action was taken",55

172,Mr STREET,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH LINE OP,"On the 12th September the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Nook) asked the following question, without notice:Can the Minister for Defence inform the Huiisu as to whether or not the rumour is correct that New South Wales poliee internal certain aliens, who were released tions from the federal authorities, and weie later re-interned? I am now in a position to inform the honourable member that re-internment has taken place in three cases to date. A certain number of enemy aliens have been released under control. Whether they are re-interned or not will depend on their conduct whilst at liberty. In matters concerning aliens, the State police act as agents of the federal authorities. M>. MKNZJISS - On the L2tlf September the honourable member for Boothby  without notice:Tn view of the proposed raising of the Hales tax from 5 per cent, to 8 per cent., and the considerable cost, involved in the collection ot such ii ta,x, will the Treasurer ascertain tin. amount that could be collected if a 1 per cent, turnover tax wero imposed instead of >i ff per rant, sales tux? The reply to the honourable member's is as follows:1. It is impossible to estimate with any degree of accuracy what revenue at a rate of 1 per cent, would be collected if a multiple turnover tax were instituted. It should, howevoi. be not less than £15,000.000 per annum. 2. The honourable member is informed in connection with the matter that, at various times since the inception of the present sales tax legislation, the effect, of changing over to a multiple turnover tax has been considered. The evidence adduced has shown the principle of multiple turnover taxes to have many objectionable features. Some of them are(u 1 the costs and difficulties of administering such a tax would greatly exceed the costs and difficulties o'. the present form of sales tax. (b) the snowballing and pyramiding effect is such as to cause the incidence to become unequal in relation to the same goods, unduly burdensome, and much more objectionable than the. present single tax. (':) the burden would fall much more heavily on those in the lower-paid classes because of the taxing of all commodities and the raw materials used therein. CONSTRUCTI ON OF TORPEDOBOATS . Mr HOU ' .

If so, was the opportunity availed of, how many tendered, and who were i h f tenderers ? M.r. STKEBT - The building of motor torpedo boats, which are of a highly specialized type, is confined, in England, to a few firms whose designs are proprietary, and no firm in Australia could build these craft except by arrangement with an English firm to use its design. The only firm in Australia which at present has the necessary association with SALES TAX. a British firm to enable construction to be immediately undertaken is the Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company Proprietary Limited, which ha= sfuhmitted a tender for the construction of six boats; that tender is now under, consideration. In view of the necessity for construction to be completed at the earliest possible date, and having regard to the foregoing conditions, public tenders were not invited.",57
