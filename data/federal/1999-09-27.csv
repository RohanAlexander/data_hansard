In of the issues and of what led to the events had the Prime Minister making certain He did make the point that governments of have been responsible for far too much acceptance and the role of the Indonesian military and that is a correct proposition. But he also went this, somehow all parliamentarians had been important point needs to go on the record. parliamentarians----obviously not the majority-on about East Timor. The Parliamentarians for in relation to the Timor question. Today, the Leader of the Opposition referred he said that he criticised the left of Australian East Timor. The Prime Minister, in his reply deal with the question. He referred to the certain position but he did not address the left I might say-although a lot of them were concerns in the community and in Therefore, I have to say that what has happened the excessive influence of the executive over sides of parliament and they were not able, irrespective message or ideas across that things were actually happening to the people of East Timor. foreign policy areas there ought not to be a government, irrespective of who is in government. In Westminster, foreign policy is discussed issues offoreign policy do need to be debated our foreign affairs committees and the like-and a long time-nevertheless, I think that it is very in these matters because we can make mistakes. times, we have made mistakes.

We do have I have participated in those committees for important that parliament asserts its authority And in the case of East Timor, even in recent recent position on East Timor, and it has been to that position. But the facts of the matter . REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 27 September 1999 are these: in April 1998 I moved a motion seconded by the shadow foreign minister position which Labor had held before then in then followed up by the shadow foreign minister he explained where we were coming from-that to events in East Timor. Hardly anyone could but it is true that the Labor Party's change President Habibie and the others in relation supposedly offered to the people of East Timor. Many people in this debate have spoken foresee what would happen following the referendum, to be made about this. We have an expert department which is culturally dominated by in this case was this: a certain culturally least in democracies such as the United States, speaking democracies, let us call them-people, they wrongly assumed that this was going to If they had been sensitive to the intelligence the cultural milieu in which these events were because a referendum passed, it does not follow to automatically accept the result and go off peacefully. It was this cultural failure to understand response was likely to be in this matter which of the government but on the part of the advisers in the multicultural society we have in Australia the department of foreign affairs who are broader that the reactions are not always the same. Indonesian psyche-where they were coming the East Timorese-we might have recognised situation and that we should avoid it. I think this is a lesson which we have to further errors if we bring to this exercise a narrow, which presupposes that other people background, in the same way, for example, Therefore we should try to make our foreign to the understanding that other people have to it. We are facing very dangerous times in East especially in Indonesia where it is possible coup, the government itself, when it is elected-if in a policy which is detrimental to the people it does not.

That significant shift was in a number of important speeches in which is, the Labor Party since that time-in relation have seen the dramatic nature of these events, of position predated the announcements by to the referendum and to the choice that was about the failure of the government to actually and I think there is a point that needs Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but a certain attitudes.

It was not what happened. which they received and, more importantly, to taking place, they would have realised that, just that those who lose the referendum are going people of a different background and what their led to false propositions, not merely on the part to the government in foreign affairs. Maybe we should get some government advisers in in their cultural outlook, who understand If we had done that, if we had understood the from, what they were encouraging in terms of that we were facing an extremely dangerous take on board straight away, because we will make mentality and an approach which is culturally vety behave and act, notwithstanding their cultural as people in English speaking democracies do. policy more sensitive to the cultural situation, and not merely to the understanding that we bring Timor. It is not clear what is going to happen, that there could be a coup. Even if there is not a there is an elected government-may persist of East Timor.

The point of my rising in this debate is to absolute support for the remaining people in force. I say 'remaining people' because the of the population.

The failure of the Indonesian of media representatives, United Nations and being forced to leave East Timor, would lead Indonesian military was supporting a media blackout were being inflicted on the East Timorese people. The Indonesian military in East Timor has to that were committed in its name and committed the military personnel, and who, it now appears, people if it did not agree with their point told its military generals not only to stop under instruction never to start the killings face.

(2) Did he indicate to the former member for Braddon that (a) he would personally take an overview of the proposal and (b) Mr Bob Mansfield of the Government's special projects team would be asked to take a leading role in advancing the proposal. (3) Is the proposed Crest Resources 51 billion magnesite project in Tasmania on the Government's special projects priority list; if not, why not.",249
34,Mr HOWARD,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The former Liberal state government and the former Member for Braddon both argued strongly for support of the project. I received information which was provided to the Commonwealth on the nature of the proposed investment and its importance to Tasmania. (2) During the last federal election, the Member for Braddon announced that the Major Projects Facilitator attached to my Office, Mr Bob Mansfield, would oversee the project and make sure there were no unnecessary delays or impediments in terms of satisfying Commonwealth government requirements. This announcement was cleared with my Office prior to release. (3) The Minister for Industry, Science and Resources grated the proposal Major Project Facilitation status on 21 April 1999. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Long Term Operating Plan Concerns (Question No. 801) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 9 August 1999: NA (1) Further to the answer to question No. 154 (Hansard, 30 March 1999, page 4778), how many incidents where language differences have been a factor have been reported since March 1996. (2) How often do Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) inspectors conduct random inspections of foreign operators at their first port of call in Australia to assess the ability of the pilot in command to understand and speak the English language. (3) How many random inspections referred to in part (2) have been conducted by CASA inspectors since March 1996. (4) What percentage of foreign operators which have entered into Australia since March 1996 have been subjected to random inspections referred to in part (2). (5) Do Air Operator's Certificates issued to foreign operators contain a condition that the pilot in command, and any other crew member making a radio transmission from the aircraft, must be able to read, speak and understand the English language; if so, are operators other than the pilot in command ever subjected to random inspections carried out by CASA inspectors; if not, why not. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Transport Safety Bureau has advised that BASI has received sixty incident former reports since March 1996 where language was identified as a factor. These reports included instances where the reporter referred to language as a factor and those where the Investigator has detennined that language was a factor in the incident. (2) As part of the international safety oversight program, CASA conducts inspections of two foreign operators per month. While these inspections are planned (and therefore not ""random""), they are unannounced ie. the operator is not aware that they will occur. Additional unplanned inspections may be undertaken as a result of incident reports or information obtained from other sources. (3) Eighty-six inspections have been carried out since the program commenced in October 1996. (4) At present, seventy foreign operators hold Australian Air Operator's Certificates that pennit them to conduct commercial flights into and out of Australian territory. Thirty-nine operators conduct regular passenger flights into Aust\:alia and seven conduct regular cargo flights. Nine operators carry out only a few passenger or cargo flights per year, and fifteen have not visited Australia for some time. Ninety-two per cent of the regular passenger operators and fifty-seven per cent of the regular cargo operators have been inspected on at least one occasion. Thirty-three percent of the operators who visit Australia infrequently have been inspected, and occasional inspections have been conducted of operators who do not hold an Air Operator's Certificate but have received approval for one-off non-scheduled flights. (5) Air Operator's Certificates issued to foreign operators contain a condition that states: ""The language for radio communications within Australian Flight Information Regions is English and for this purpose the pilot in command and any other crew member making a transmission from the aircraft must be able to read, speak and understand the English language."" CASA inspectors endeavour to speak to each member of the aircraft technical crew during an inspection to assess their ability to converse in the English language. This will include the Captain, the First Officer, and any other pilots carried as part of the operating crew and the flight engineer if carried. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Long Term Operating Plan (Question No. 802) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 9 August 1999: (1) Further to the answer to question No 157 (Hansard, 10 March 1999, page 3703), has progress been made to introduce a system which will result in Airservices Australia being advised of the reasons why pilots have had an operational requirement for other than the runway nominated in accordance with the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport (KSA); if not, why not; if so, what are the indications which have been received by Airservices Australia in relation to this system. (2) Will the system also record the number of times pilots have refused LTOP based landing directions at KSA; if not why not. (3) If the answer to part (2) is yes, and the system has already been established, how many times have pilots refused LTOP based landing directions at KSA. (4) What steps must be taken for Airservices Australia to obtain the information which I requested as to whether pilots have refused L TOP based take-off directions since it was implemented and will he direct Airservices Australia to take those steps. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1 ) Yes. Airservices Australia advises that it has introduced a reporting system under which operators whose pilots have required a ""non duty"" runway are contacted and are asked to provide Airservices Australia with reasons for their use of the ""non duty"" runway. The results so far show that it is overwhelmingly the departing or arriving long haul B747 aircraft that are requesting a It non duty"" runway for operational reasons. Pilots' requests are for the use of the main north-south runway and departures are requiring the use of the runway more often than arrivals. (2) The primary purpose of the ""non duty"" runway reporting system is to give an indication of the type of aircraft requiring a ""non duty"" runway, to determine whether there were other than operational reasons for pilots requesting such runway and to assist in the education of pilots on the operation of LTOP at KSA. The system does not therefore seek to record with absolute accuracy the number of times pilots have had an operational requirement for a runway other than the nominated runway. See (2) above. (4) I am advised by Airservices Australia that due to difficulties in clearly defining ""non duty"" runway use particularly during LTOP runway mode changes it would not be practical to develop a reporting system that would comprehensively and accurately record all ""non duty"" runway use. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Current Operating Plan Concerns (Question No. 803) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 9 August 1999: Further to question No. 1735 (Hansard, 28 August 1997, page 7369), will he direct the appropriate body to keep and maintain consolidated records in relation to complaints made by air traffic controllers employed at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport; if not, why not. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Airservices Australia has advised that it currently maintains a mandatory (electronically submitted) air safety incident reporting system which is the primary vehicle for air traffic controllers to voice their concerns on any defmed air safety incident. Within this system there is a function encouraging air traffic controllers to report ""events"", which are defined as those occurrences which do not fall within the definition of an incident but which may because for concern in certain circumstances. Air traffic controllers may also report their concerns formally through either of two independent, confidential reporting mechanisms - the Confidential Aviation Incident Report (CAIR) system managed by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI); or - the Safety Management Information System (SMIS) managed internally by Airservices Australia's Directorate of Safety and Standards. The above systems are subject to formal registration, recording and any related issues are managed. Additionally, there are always avenues for air traffic controllers to report their concerns or complaints through the standard management protocols. Airservices Australia advises that any issue raised to management is assessed and acted upon in a manner appropriate to the impact of the issue. Such issue would normally be responded to via a formal letter or e-mail and the response kept on file. Airservices Australia management at Sydney also advises that it has an issues management policy which encourages controllers to raise concerns with management and management has undertaken to respond to concerns in writing. Bureau of Air Safety Investigation: (Question No. 805) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 9 August 1999: (1) Did the answer to question No 156 (Hansard, 11 February 1999, page 2632) in part state that International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standard phraseologies have been adopted to the maximum extent possible; if so, will he give similar importance to the ICAO recommendation that compliance with published noise abatement procedures should not be required in adverse operating conditions such as when the crosswind component, including gusts, exceeds 15 knots; if not, why not. (2) Will he amend the Australian Aeronautical Information Publication (AlP) Sydney noise abatement procedures so the use of runways is only allowable where there is a crosswind component of no greater than 15 knots; if not, why not. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question as follows: (1) Airservices Australia has advised that it fully accepts its International Civil Ayiation Organisation (ICAO) obligations and has adopted ICAO recommendations on standard phraseologies to the maximum extent possible. However, Airservices Australia advises that ICAO recommendations recognise there are matters on which ICAO member states have different needs and requirements arising from differing local operating circumstances and that member states can adopt different practices to those recommended by ICAO without the need to file a difference (as is the required case with ICAO standards). The maximum crosswind criterion at Sydney Airport was increased to 25 knots in 1989 as a noise abatement measure in order to maximise departures over Botany Bay. (2) Refer (1) response. Australian Defence Force: Active Reservists (Question No. 862) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 24 August 1999: (1) How many active reservists in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) are estimated to be' (a) tertiary students, (b) unemployed, or (c) otherwise without employer provided superannuation coverage. (2) What would be the estimated annual cost of the ADF making a superannuation contribution on behalf of active reservists equivalent to 7% of their Report ADF-provided pay and allowances. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Approximately 11 %. (b) Approximately 11 %. (c) Figures requested are unavailable. (2) Based on the figures available, it is estimated that it would cost Defence $1.5 million to make a 7% superannuation payment on behalf of active Reservists. Employment of Scientific and Technical Enemy Aliens Scheme (Question No. 868)  the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 24 August 1999: (1) Was the Chifley Government involved in bringing suspected war criminals and Nazi party members to Australia as part of the Employment of Scientific and Technical Enemy Aliens scheme (ESTEA) between 1946 and 1951. (2) Were the backgrounds of prospective scientists covered up and were the objections of the Commonwealth Investigation Service and normal security clearances ignored. (3) Did the former deputy hcad of the A:ttorn-y­ General's Department, Mr Andrew Menzies, give the ESTEA scheme a clean bill of health in his 1986 government report; if so, is the Minister able to say whether Mr Menzies was misled and that his 1986 assertions that proper procedures were foHowed is incorrect. (4) Will the Government reopen the Special Investigations Unit and launch a full investigation into these allegations. Mr Williams--The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Cabinet approved the Employment of Scientitic and Technical Enemy Aliens scheme (ESTEA) in December 1946. I am advised by my Department that it has been unable to establish that any allegations of war crimes were made against any persons who entered under the ESTEA scheme. However, some may have been former members of the Nazi Party. (2) I am informed that nothing has been located on file to suggest that the backgrounds of prospective scientists were covered up nor that the objections of the CIS and normal security clearances were ignored. Those were matters that were reviewed by Mr Menzies in 1986. (3) Yes. Mr Menzies was satisfied that appropriate security clearances had been obtained by those German scientists and technicians who entered Australia under the ESTEA scheme. None of the available records indicate that Mr Menzies was misled. (4) No. Any allegations of substance concerning alleged war criminals which have come to light since the closure of the Special Investigations Unit have been referred to the AFP for investigation in the same way as any other alleged offence against the law of the Commonwealth. If specific information identifYing particular viduals overlooked by the Menzies review is forthcoming it will be investigated by the AFP. Migration Review Tribunal: Backlog of Applications (Question No. 883) Mr Sciacca asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 25 August 1999: (1) How long is the backlog of applications for review by the Migration Review !ribunal (MRT), accumulated since the amalgamatIOn of the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Migration Internal Review Office. (2) What is the breakdown of the backlog by (a) application category and (b) registry or MRT office. (3) What criteria are being used to select and process the inherited backlog. (4) Have criteria be-n est-blished for the pr-­ cessing of new applicatIOns; If so, are these applications simply being added to the backlog. (5) What are the estimated processing times for applications for review by (a) registry and (b) category. (6) How many appointments have been made to the MRT, by registry, as at 25 August 1999. (7) How many appointments referred to in part (6) are on a (a) part time and (b) full time basis. (8) What is the breakdown of appointees by registry. (9) How long is the tenure of appointments. (l0) What are the professional qualifications of each of the appointed MRT members. (11) Has a tribunal member been. given the responsibility for training newly appomted members; if so, which member. (12) Will a next round of appointments be announced; if so, when. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) On 1 June 1999 the Migration Review Tribunal received a handover caseload of 5550 cases. There are, as at 31 August 1999, 5829 cases on hand. (2) (a)-(b) The following is the breakdown of the backlog (unconstituted cases) as at 31 July 1999 by indiapplication and registry. Only th?se.visa subclasses containing more than 100 apphcatlOns have been separately identified.

In the first months of the Tribunal's operation regard is being had to members and staff expertise. This is done in the context of the overall criteria for processing which are as follows: (a) ""Time-limited"" cases-bridging visa refusals or cancellations where the person is in immigration detention as a result of the refusal or cancellation; (b) Visa refusals and cancellations (other than those covered in (a» where the review applicant is in immigration detention; (c) Visa cancellations where the person is not in immigration detention; (d) Long Stay or Short Stay (Visitor) visa refusals (onshore or offshore) where: (i) visiting parent, spouse, child, brother or sister (ii) visa applied for to participate in an event of special family significance in which applicant is directly concerned (iii) the event and the applicant's involvement identified in the visa application (iv) visa application refused on ground that genuine visit not intended or on basis of risk factor (v) the application was made long enough before the event to allow for internal review and review by the Tribunal.

Depending on the circumstances they may take precedence over the cases listed in (c) and (d) above. (The effect of this is that cases with compelling reasons for early processing ahead of other cases are being constituted to members for early decision); (f) If there are none of the above cases awaiting constitution in the Tribunal any members who were previously members of the Immigration Review Tribunal (IRT) should have constituted to them any cases which had been constituted to them in the IRT and which they had not completed on 31 May 1999; (g) If there are none of the above cases awaiting constitution members should have constituted to them any cases transferred from the IRT or MIRO in which applications for review were lodged prior to 1 January 1997. In doing these constitutions regard should be had to members' specialisations. If there are none of those awaiting constitution applications for review lodged prior to 1 June 1999 should be constituted. (4) The applicable criteria listed in answer to question 3 above are also applied to new applications. (5) (a)-(b) Estimation of processing times at this stage in the Tribunal's operation (3 months after start up) is difficult. Applications for review currently being lodged in each registry of the Tribunal and not falling within criteria a) to e) above are not expected to have been processed before 1 June 2000. (6)-(8) There have been 29 appointments made to the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) as at 25 August 1999. Broken down by registry, the figures are: NSWSenior Member 1 Full-time Members 2 Part-time Members 11 VICSenior Member 1 Full-time Members 2 Part-time members 6 WAPart-time Members 2 QLDPart-time Members 1 ACTPrincipal Member 1 Part-time Members 2 (9) All MRT member appointments expire on 31 January 2001 with the exception of the Principal member whose Acting appointment expires on 31 January 2000.

Such training activity is an integral responsibility of all members and they perform this activity under the direction and supervision of the Principal Member. (12) I have yet to consider this matter. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Air Space (Question No. 887) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 26 August 1999: Further to the answer to question No 155 (Hansard, 11 May 1999, page 5073), how is use of the crossing runway modes of operation at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport consistent with the concept of segregated airspace as developed from the study conducted by Ratner and associates. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Airservices Australia advises that the purpose of segregated airspace is to minimise the interaction between air traffic and reduce air traffic controller coordination requirements. This is achieved through airspace design that provides to the greatest extent possible separate airspace volumes for traffic patterns managed by individual controllers. Additionally, Airservices Australia advises that Standard Arrival Routes (STARs) and Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs) are utilised to define altitudes and traffic cross-over points. These airspace design and management procedures are equally applicable to all modes of operation at Sydney.",252
