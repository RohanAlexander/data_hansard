0,NA,Unknown,"Government should not be involved in these areas when the States already have machinery in existence. The simple answer to the problem is that if the Commonwealth Government has the money today to meet the extra cost of research into road safety, that money should be handed to the State governmentsever if it were tied to section 96 of the Constitution-wit h a request that the money be spent on road safety. Mr Charles Jones- Mr Deputy rise on a point of order. How much longer are you going to allow the honourable member for Griffith to flout your ruling? The motion before the chair at the moment is for the repointed appointment of a select committee on road safety. It has nothing to do with this Governsuggest ment's decision to allocate S3m in the last financial year to investigate lems. The remarks made by the honourable member have nothing to do with that and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have so ruled.",72

3,Dr KLUGMAN,Unknown," I support the motion. I shall speak for only a moment. In relation to what the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) said, I mention in passing that paragraph (2) of motion moved by the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) states: That the committee recognise the responsibility the States in these matters and seek their operation in all relevant matters. We have in fact done that. It is note that the letter from the Minister for Transport to members of this House dealt with the question of road safety. I point out quite clearly that all the recommendations from local councils as to what were dangerous intersections and spots on the roads. It is depressing honourable member for Griffith, who no doubt had an extremely difficult electoral compaign to fight, did not have",72

5,Dr KLUGMAN,Unknown,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I accept your ruling. I realise that it may not have been the honourable member's tough election campaign. Maybe he cannot read, or perhaps he does not read letters in full. But the important point here is that the letter quite clearly pointed out that the Commonwealth Government did not want either to Speaker, I make decisions or",72

I that the honourable member for Prospect does not cover that matter in any comroad safety probments on this motion.,72
7,Dr KLUGMAN,Unknown,"I shall go off that letter. The point is that the Committee received submissions from local councils, State governments, etc., on how to improve road safety. the The Australian Government has come into the to matter by the decision of the Government, with the co-operation of the Minister for Transport, in asking for suggestions on where an amount of money- I think he mentioned $3m-shoul d be spent in the meantime until some overall plan can be brought in with the co-operation of local councils and State governMr Charles Jones-In the Bill I introduced into the House today $30m is provided.",72
8,Dr KLUGMAN,Unknown,"That is a large amount of money which will be available for road safety. I think that is important. It is a great the pity that one of the reasons why road safety is not going ahead in Australia and why we on the Committee are not able to get all the of information which we need, is that there is cosuch a diversion of power at the present tim: between local councils, State governments and important to the Australian Government.",72

11,Mr DONALD CAMERON,Unknown,"Yes , grievously so. The honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) suggested that I was in a state of nervousness during the last election campaign and that that cut into my ability to understand the text of the letter of the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones). Just because the Minister's name is Jones and my opponent's name was Jones, it does not mean that the Minister has to go out in sympathy. Mr B r y a n t - Mr Deputy Speaker. I raise a point of order.

16,Dr JF CAIRNS,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS," I move: Customs Tariff Proposals No. 6 (1974) Customs Tariff Proposals No. 7 (1974) Customs Tariff Proposals No. 8 (1974) Customs Tariff Proposals No. 9 (1974) The Customs Tariff Proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed amendments to the Customs Tariff 1966-1973. Customs Tariff Proposals No. 6 (1974) provide for the addition of further goods to Schedule A of the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The changes operate from 1 January 1974. Proposals Nos. 7 and 8 (1974) formally place before Parliament, as required by law, tariff changes introduced by Gazette notices on 23 April, 14 June and 28 June 1974. The changes contained in Proposals No. 7 (1974) arise, in the main, from the Government's decisions on reports by the Tariff Board on textile bags, and cigarette paper. In its report on textile bags the Board recommended that wool packs and jute bags of standard cornsack size and larger remain free of duty, bags of man-made fibres be dutiable at 30 per cent and bags of other materials as well as jute bags of under standard cornsack size, be dutiable at 10 per cent. The Government considered the implications of the Board's recommendations for the continuation of protection on jute bags of under standard cornsack size in the wider context of Australia's trade with developing countries, especially India, Thailand and Bangladesh. The question of the removal of the recommended duty was raised with the Chairman of the Industries Assistance Commission who advised that it was unlikely that there would be serious effects on local production and employment if duty on all jute bags was reduced to free. The Government consequently decided to provide for free admission of all jute bags. The other recommendations were accepted by the Government and as the report was signed prior to the 25 per cent tariff cut in July 1973 the recommended rates were reduced by a quarter. In regard to cigarette paper the Government has accepted the Tariff Board's recommendation that a reduced rate of duty of 20 per cent should apply and that filigrained cigarette tissue, which is a specially patterned and embossed paper, be admitted free of duty under by-law. Action has also been taken in these Proposals to remove the expression shafting in relation to steel bars. This follows from a recommendation of the Tariff Board, in its report on Tariff Classification-Brigh t Round Steel Bars, that the use of the term should be discontinued. The opportunity has also been taken to align the size of bedspreads admitted at concessional rates with a standard recommended by the Metric Conversion Board. Customs Tariff Proposals No. 8 (1974) introduce complete new Schedules to the Customs Tariff to operate on and from 1 July 19 4. The new Schedules show opposite each tariff classification in the Customs Tariff the rates of duty arising from the 25 per cent tariff cut on 19 July 1973 or those resulting from subsequent decisions by the Government on recommendations of the Tariff Board or the Industries Assistance Commission. With ad valorem duties the rates resulting from the 25 per cent tariff cut have been simplified, to the extent permitted by international commitments, by rounding to the nearest whole percentage number all rates with a decimal component other than .5; rates with a decimal component of .5 remain unaltered. Fixed rate duties have been simplified, as necessary, by rounding the rates to the same number of decimal places as existed prior to the tariff cut. Proposals No. 8 (1974) also contain extensions to the list of goods granted tariff preferences when imported from developing counlries. At the same time, certain products of the printing industry have been removed from the scheme of tariff preferences for developing countries to maintain protection for the local industry. These proposals also contain amendments to bring the size of imported vessels eligible for admission at nonproactive rates into line with the size of vessels eligible for subsidy when built in Australia. Proposals No 9 (1974) implement changes arising from the Government's acceptance of recommendations in the Tariff Board's reports on 'propylene oxide derivatives, and Film Processing Industry; Advertising Film (Value for Duty)', and the Industries Assistance Commission's report on 'Paper'. These changes will operate from tomorrow. In respect to propylene oxide derivatives acceptance of the Tariff Board's recommendations will mean that a rate of 23 per cent will apply to the principal products covered by the report, that is, polyols (which are csed in the manufacture of polyurethane foam) and glycols (which arc primarily used in the production of polyester resins and surface coatings). The Board recommended that there be no change in the duties applying to the remaining goods under reference. There will however be a minor variation in rates applying to some chemically pure surface-active agents. Minimum rales of duty will apply from lomorrow to all goods covered by the Tariff Board's report on 'Film Processing Industry; Advertising Film (Value for Duty)' except exposed and developed plates or film (other than cinematograph film). Changes relating to these particular plates and film are being withheld at this stage pending completion of international negotiations. In accordance with the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on 'Paper', the duty on certain i:ncoated and coated printing and writing papers is being varied and a rate of 20 per cent applied. Wrapping papers covered by the Commission's report will be admitted at minimum rates. A comprehensive summary of the changes and duty rates is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the proposals.  adjourned. NA (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) BILL 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 July (vide page 3393, on motion by Mr Clyde Cameron: That the Bill be now read a second time.",75
17,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY," This debate began last night, but the normal rules of the House interrupted it. Since that is so, briefly I would like to cover again the main points that I sought to make last evening before coming to the final part of what I wanted to say. The Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) began his speech by suggesting that the measure he was introducing was a simple one, a technical machinery measure. In one sense it is. It is a measure that extends the temporary provisions relating to the waterfront, not for another year, as he did a year ago, but for a further 2 years. But really the matters lying behind this Bill are much more complex than that, and the Bill ought not to be passed through this House without some concern being expressed, because many people believe that the 1967 arrangements on the Australian waterfront have not worked to bring greater efficiency to the waterfront. The Minister expresses the view that because of technical changes that are still under way it is difficult to bring in a permanent Bill at this stage, but I think that view is one this House ought to accept only with a great deal of reluctance. The Minister has a report from Mr Norman Foster. I would ask him to publish that report so we can all see what Mr Foster, whom we would well remember, has recommended. I have no doubt that the Stevedoring Industry Council and the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority have also made reports on the future organisation of the waterfront. The Waterside Workers Federation and the Association of Employers of Waterfront Labour would have their views. I have no doubt that their views are all on the record. It is time that the Minister came forward and brought to this House some final proposals which can be examined by this House and by the industries concerned. I suspect that one of the reasons why the Minister is now seeking a 2-year reprieve- a great departure from the confidence he showed in May of last year, when he said that he had no doubt he could bring in final arrangements within the next 12 monthsarises because of the difficulties that arose over the negotiations for the port of Darwin. I am advised- I think it has been reported in the 'Australian Financial Review'-that the Minister had wanted ASIA to be the sole employer but that others, the Waterside Workers Federation and Mr Fitzgibbon, objected to that. Again, as has been reported in the Press and never denied, an appeal was made to the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) and an arrangement came to be made between the Prime Minister and the General Secretary. There are reports in the 'Maritime Worker' of 9 July that would give some support to that point of view. Why is it-this is what this Parliament ought to address itself to in part-that it is so hard to bring forward final arrangements? Some say it is because technical changes on the waterfront are not complete. They will never be complete if the waterfront is to become as up-to-date as it can be and conditions further improve, as on some wharves they certainly need to be. I have seen for myself that while in some areas the facilities for waterside workers are good, in other areas, I believe, they are still deplorable. Twenty per cent of those employed on the waterfront are not employed under permanent arrangements, and industrial relations on the waterfront are certainly not as good as they ought to be. But these are not reasons for putting the matter aside, for putting it into the 'too hard' basket and saying: 'Let us just forget it for another 2 years'. A number of solutions have from time to time been suggested. One is nationalisation. Another is that all labour ought to be trolled by the ASIA. I have no doubt that that were done the Waterside Workers Federthe ation would believe that the ASIA ought not be the sole employer and the sole disciplinarThe Ian. They might be matters that could become. Then there are suggestions that Prime Minister and Mr Fitzgibbon came to an agreement over the discussions concerning Darwin that if nothing was done for some time the WWF would later agree to a new stevedoring industry commission. What that mean? What powers would it have? What difference would there be between that and the ASIA as it exists at the present time? The Association of Employers of Waterfront Labout our says and argues that the arrangements on the waterfront introduced in 1967 have been successful, but there are others who doubt that very seriously. Indeed, in this context in this discussion, I pointed out last night that the associations which determine the policy for the AEWL and the source of its power need close examination. The Association claims that it is an Australian organisation. I would believe that it is an organisation dominated by overseas shippers. I went through the arguments last night to indicate the reasons I have for that view. Significant Australian shippers and employers such as the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd and the Australian National Line, where they are acting as stevedores, are not members, and they are not members of other organisations which flow through in the AEWL spectrum. The Association stands apart. If it truly and properly represented Australian interests as well as overseas shippers, surely the Australian National Line, BHP, the British Phosphate Commission and others could well be represented, but they are not represented. There are also allegations from time to time that, although there was meant to be a ballot every second year for the membership of AEWL, no ballots have ever been held or organised. So it comes back to the fact that there seems to be, on all evidence except on the word of AEWL, an organisation in which there is significant overseas control and influence. That being so, what are the consequences of that? If it is an extension of overseas shippers it will not be very concerned about costs on the Australian waterfront. It will be concerned about getting ships moving in the shortest possible space of time, and that concould mean what the Minister has termed on if more than one occasion-it is a term which Government has used over the last day or two in another context- a sweetheart deal. arrangements earlier than 1967 envisaged overemployment under the National Stevedoring the Industry Conference arrangement, weekly hirings and provision for those employed in the 36 non-permanent ports on the pre-1967 arrangements. If the 1967 arrangements had worked as intended the proportion working does under the NSIC arrangements would have risen, but it has not; it has fallen. At the same time, those on weekly hirings at permanent ports have increased in number. I have pointed that there has been a continuous process of change on the waterfront. Mechanisation began long before the introduction of containerisation. The process of improvement in the productivity of the work force has been continuous, at least since the middle 1950s. But in many areas the agreements of 1967 have not worked as many people had hoped. I think that this needs to be borne in mind when trying to come to a decision about what ought to be done in the future. The 1967 arrangements for permanent ployment have not really operated in the terif minals for which, I have been advised, they were in fact designed. Those working in the terminals are largely employed on a weekly basis. In the AEWL's planning it was believed that there would be an equalisation of returns across the waterfront after 1967; but, accordof ing to the latest figures I have, those working in the terminals get an average wage of about $139 a week and those working at conventional ports, often in worse conditions because the ports are older and the facilities are not good, get an average wage of about $1.07 week. Under the NSIC arrangements of 1967, costs would have broken even under the old proposals if the average hours worked had equalled thirty-five. But, since they havs averrelatives aged about twenty-nine in the last year or work two, it is plain that the present arrangements are costing more. I have taken the original cost estimates of the AEWL in coming that conclusion. In terms of discipline and industrial peace, the circumstances at the major ports before 1967 were roughly twice as bad as those at the non-permanent ports. The same relationHowever ship has remained between what are now the permanent ports and the non-permanent ports. If the new arrangements were to lead to greater degree, of industrial peace one would have thought that the permanent ports, as consequence of the changes, would have had a better industrial record than the non-permanent ports that continued to operate But there seems to have been no real advantage in that context. The 1967 arrangements were not meant to lead to a virtual monopoly of stevedoring, but in some areas they led virtually to that kind of monopoly. There are vast differences in conalso tainer handling costs between Sydney and Melbourne-Sydney' s costs being, I think, roughly twice those of Melbourne-bu t the changes made in both ports are the same. cannot really sec why Melbourne ought to pay for the. additional costs in Sydney. It may be that there are other reasons for that. That would seem to indicate that this matter warrants investigation. The 35-hour agreement of 1972 has, under present circumstances, had one significant result: Less time is worked at ordinary rates and more time is worked at overtime or premium rates. The Minister for Labor and Immigration himself is on record as having said that emhe is not in favour of 35-hour arrangements all they mean is an increase in the number of hours worked at the overtime rate. But that is what has happened on the wharves in recent times. Sometimes there have been very large idle time payments because there have been too many men in relation to the amount work available; and at other times, including in the early part of this year, the idle time payments have been very much less but there has been inadequate labour on the waterfront. The waterfront has been recruiting throughas out this year. There are some aspects of the a recruiting that need watching closely. Some proposals have been put forward by the Waterside Workers Federation to the effect that preference ought to be given to friends and of present members of the waterfront force. I think that is a short sighted view. I hope that it is not one that will be pushed too far. Imagine what a tragedy it would be to for Australia if the Commonwealth Public Service were to seek to have the same role adopted in Canberra. Australia would come to be governed by hereditary public servants, with the sons of public servants taking their places. good the Public Service may be, we do not want that kind of class to be built up within the community, which is what would a happen if the rule that the WWF is trying to apply-no t necessarily very stronglya were in fact to be applied in other areas as well. I can see little justification for that sort of rule to be applied in a particular area or on the old basis. industry. The ASTA reports from 1968 to 1973 draw attention to the standard of supervision by employers and say how much it has fallen have off under the new arrangements. The 1972 agreements between the AEWL and the WWF failed to arrive at adequate dispute settling procedures. I have been advised that very often matters just go by default. There has been an interesting change in the area of I productivity. The supporters of the present arrangements say that there have been great improvements in productivity. There were significant improvements from 1957-58 to 1966-67, but in the first 2 years of the new arrangements productivity fell-and fell significantly. It was not until 1970-71 that productivity regained and passed the level, in terms of tons per man hour, that it had reached in 1966-67. Therefore, it would not seem that the improvements in productivity have been as a result of the new arrangements introduced in 1967, but rather that they have been as a result of a continuous trend in mechanisation over a much longer period. The fall-off in 1967-68 and 1968-69 may well have led to a new growth of industrial unrest that came about after the 1967 arrangements had been introduced. It is worth noting that in the 2 years preceding the 1967 arrangements industrial unrest on the waterfront reached lower levels than almost ever before in the waterfront's history. That might have its own short story and its own implication. Throughout this year there has been a tremendous shortage of labour in many industries, as the Minister would recognise. But when, in March 1974, there were advertisements calling for applicants for the waterfront there were many more applicants than there were positions available on the waterfront. That would seem to indicate that to many people at least it is an attractive job. Let me give example. In Sydney there were 1,000 applicants for 150 places and in Melbourne there were 2,000 for 100 places. So, under the conditions that have prevailed, it has been quite possible to attract people to the jobs that are available. One of the great problems, as I have mentioned before, is that the ship owners regard stevedoring as being a subsidiary of shipping, as being an extension of shipping and as being less important than shipping. I think that ments could well be adduced that stevedoring, and what happens in and around the wharves, should be regarded as a ports industry and not just an appendage that is necessary so that ships can operate and carry their cargoes. I am sure that we need to rid the Australian waterfront of whatever overseas influence there might be. I had hoped that the Minister would have used his influence to achieve that and not go along with any sweetheart agreement that might tend to perpetuate overseas influence. I had hoped that the Waterside Workers Federation also would have wanted to achieve the same objective. 11283/74-K-{14 ] I said last night that if the Minister were to bring into this Parliament long term proposals that the Opposition believes to be sensible he would have the full co-operation of the Opposition in achieving their implementation. I hope that the Minister will be able to show the perseverance that he has shown in other areas in getting some success in that respect. Because the Opposition believes that this is an important matter and because we believe that it ought not to be allowed to rest for another 2 years, the Opposition intends to move in the Committee stage 2 amendments that will, if carried, extend the temporary provisions not for 2 years but to 1 April 1975 and provide that permanent arrangements for the stevedoring industry should be submitted to the Parliament before the same date; that is, 1 April 1975. I commend those proposed amendments to the Minister. I hope that he will feel able to accept them. I hope also that he will make available the information from Mr Foster and others that I understand is in his possession at the present time, so that we will all be able to turn our minds to a vexed and difficult problem that needs solution in the national interest and in the interests of not only Australian shippers, exporters and importers but also members of the Waterside Workers Federation. There are conflicting interests an which have to be put together in an overall package which meets the Australian national interest. That is a formidable task. If the Minister turned his mind to it, I think he could achieve it.",76
18,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY," I suppose this debate has ranged much more widely, following the speech of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser), than was intended when the measure was first brought before the House. The Steveargu- doring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Bill seeks only to extend for a further period the provisions in the Act that have existed since 1967 in order to bring about-it is the very opposite from what the honourable member for Wannon was saying, as I understood him - a lasting and permanent arrangement on the waterfront for the employment of waterside labour. The honourable member for Wannon foreshadowed amendments - which he intends to move during the Committee stage of consideration of this measure. As I understand those amendments, all that they seek to do is to limit the period of time over which this measure will be operative. In other words, they seek to try to buffalo the Government into a position in which obviously it does not want to be at the moment. It is quite clear-and I think the honourable member for Wannon made it quite clear-that the waterfront, because of the type of work carried on there, is an area that has always been subject to disagreement and conflict. It would be very difficult to say who was to blame for that disagreement and conflict, although if one listened to honourable members opposite one would always believe that it was the waterside worker himself who was to blame. In concluding his speech the honourable member for Wannon made mention of overseas influence on the waterfront. He did not elaborate on that comment. I suppose the reason he did not elaborate was that he could not. It is an expression that has no signficance at all. It is a pity that the honourable member did not go a little further and, instead of making some sort of blithe accusation such as that and skating off from it, try to explain to us what he meant by the term 'overseas influence', because I am sure that his explanation of that term would itself have been the subject of a very lively debate. The waterfront, by its very nature, has always been regarded as one of those areas to which people come to work when work was available. When work was not available and employees were no longer required they were no longer employees. Their position might have been all right in the. days before isation but their position has worsened with the onset of mechanisation on the waterfront. With the mechanisation by the ship owners and the many different ways of transporting cargo, people who belonged to unions other than the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, were performing tasks which were very similar in nature to those tasks once formed by waterside workers but which, cause of the introduction of technology and mechanisation on the waterfront, are now fact vastly-different tasks. So the traditional waterside worker was put in a position of some isolation because in many instances the task that he performed became less relevant than it was at an earlier time. So the waterside workers who operate on the waterfront around Australia today are not like their counterparts of previous years who came forward when the ship came into port, unloaded the ship, went home and waited for another ship to arrive. Nowadays, thing else. waterside workers work on the waterfront constantly in the same way as people working in manufacturing industries around the country, and as such they spend a lifetime on the waterfront. It is perhaps the only industry in which people are engaged for their whole lifetime. So it seems incongruous that these people should still now be regarded as temporary, part-time or casual employees. Yet, without the provisions of the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act to protect them, that is exactly the position they would be in. So their right to be regarded as permanent employees is being protected in the interim by this Bill. The bringing about of a permanent scheme of employment for waterside workers is not a matter in relation to which the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) or his advisers, or anybody else, say to those who work on the waterfront: 'These are the conditions under which you will work'. That, I am sure, is the attitude of honourable members opposite. They would like to say that this Government should go to the waterside workers and say: 'These are the conditions under which you will work'. It has always been my understanding of industrial relations that this sort of situation would be tantamount to trying to put out a fire with a can of petrol. The best way to bring about peace and harmony amongst those who are employed on wages or salaries is to allow those people to have a very broad and a very deep say in the condimechantions under which they will work. Clearly there must be some agreement between the Government, whose job it is to administer these regulations and these laws, and those who will work under them, because if the Government becomes autocratic or if perthe Opposition, persisting with its amendbement, should push the Government into doing something which does not meet with the agree in ment of the Waterside Workers Federation, then of course there will be immediate conflict. I think that is the tactic of the Opposition, but it is the sort of situation which it seeks. It pushes people into positions of conflict so that it can come into this House and bring on another matter of public importance, talk about things that have no relevance to the matter ot public importance, and highlight all the time the strikes and stoppages that are taking place around the country. These things yeem to obsess the Opposition more than anyThe Government has adopted an entirely different approach from that. It is true that as yet agreement has not been reached in relation to permanent provisions. So, by means of this Bill, we are simply asking the Parliament to extend the temporary provisions, which are working very well at the moment, for a further period until agreement can be reached. If that course is followed no question of conflict will arise. Those people who will have to work under the permanent provisions will be party to them, and it is very difficult to argue against something to which you have been party. But it is also very essential that such an agreement be satisfactory to both parties, and in this case the 2 parties comprise the Government, on the one hand, and those who are engaged on the waterfront, on the other. Many changes are taking place in the industrial scene, as in all other scenes. I that my colleague, the Minister for Labor Immigration, is very anxious that many of difficulties that have arisen in the past between various unions, because of the multiplicity them, should be resolved. This was not made any easier by the previous Government. fact, it was made nearly impossible. When the Minister for Labor and Immigration brings forward further proposals later this year of the difficulties that have arisen in the and could arise in the future will be resolved, simply because we will no longer have the ludicrous situation of one union arguing against another union in relation to work be done, which is commonly known as a demarcation dispute. To obviate all of these difficulties that could arise the Government taken a decision-it is a decision which I port entirely and commend to the House-t extend the provisions that exist in the Stevesiders doring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act for a further 2 years only. Any difficulties might exist at the moment will be resolved that 2-year period and the whole be resolved not only to the satisfaction of the Government but also, more importantly, to the satisfaction of those who are actively engaged in this industry. It is a short Bill. If I were to digress as from it as did the honourable member for that Wannon I suppose I too could take 20 minutes of the time of the House, but having made the pertinent points I will leave it to the judgment of this House to make its decision as to whether the Government is in fact correct in putting this very short and machinery measure before the House for ratification.",79
19,Mr CORBETT,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY,"As the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) explained in his second reading speech, the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Bill 1974 is designed to provide for an extension of the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act for a period of 2 years pending the introduction of permanent legislation. As the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said, the Opposition is recommending, as I understand it, that this time be shortened to 31 March 1975. To hear the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) talking one would think that the idea of providing a scheme of permanent employment was not a desirable thing. Already we have had a period of 12 months in which these negotiations could have know taken place. If the Government is sincere in and wanting to provide a scheme of permanent the employment for the stevedoring industry it should tell us what is the trouble. Why does of the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) not tell us where he is running In into all this trouble? I am not by any means convinced that the many people who sit on the opposite side of the past House, or indeed the trade union leaders, always represent or even often represent the opinion of the people who are working in industry. But even if they did, why does the to Government want all this time? Why is it necessary to take all this time to reach an agreement to provide something which the has Government claims it wants to provide- a supscheme which in the main will provide pero manent employment on weekly hiring waterin major ports? What the Opposition asks is that the Government gets on with the that job of providing something which, as I underin stand it, honourable members on both sides of situation will the House seem to want. I do not for one moment take the attitude that all the things that are desired for the people engaged in the stevedoring industry come from the other side of the House. On far this occasion the Opposition is anxious to see they receive the benefits contained in the Bill. The Opposition is asking only that the scheme be completed in a reasonable time. If good the Government cannot complete it in a reasonable time-that is, by 31 March-let it say why it cannot. Let the Government admit its incompetence in this field. Let it admit that it is not able to continue the negotiations with the Waterside Workers Federation. If the Government has the competence that it claims to have, or the goodwill, it should be able to reach the agreement in that time. Finally, if the Opposition is satisfied that Government has made every effort to reach that agreement, it will not obstruct the Government in trying to obtain an extension of time. All the Opposition asks for is that the Government does a reasonable job in this field. That is why we have imposed this time limit. As the Minister said in his second reading speech, it may come well before that time anyhow, and he is not precluded from achieving that if it is possible. He said that an earlier date for permanent legislation was desirable. Of course it is. We agree. But we want to see the Government urged on to do something about it. As I have said, the Opposition has no basic objection to this legislation. The introduction of this Bill, however, gives the opportunity to point out one or two things which have a bearing on reaching the type of agreement which is desirable. I refer to some of the factors that are probably causing difficulty in arriving at what would be the best conditions under which permanent engagement can be provided. As I see them, two of the problems are port congestion and industrial disputes. These are causing friction all the time. The newsletter of the Chemical Importers and Exporters Council has highlighted industry dissatisfaction with the position and the lack of forward planning. That is what the Opposition is asking for. Port facilities in Sydney, Melbourne and other major shipping ports are inefficient. This adds to the difficulties and the losses caused by industrial disputes. I want to say something generally about the importance of our port facilities. The import boom, as a consequence of the 25 per cent tariff reduction and extensive revaluation of the Australian dollar, has led to a dramatic import upsurge that has taxed the outdated facilities to the full and has led to extensive lags in the chain between export delivery and retail outlet. These are the sorts of things the Opposition wants to see improved for the benefit of the people working on the waterfront and for the benefit of the Australian community. The Stevedoring Authority itself is responsible for employment in the stevedoring sector of the industry and seems to have been reasonably successful in that field. I am sure that the Authority is anxious to reach agreement if the Government shows the same initiative as it pretends to show. However, the industry itself is plaguedeven the honourable member for Burke the admitted this-by a continuing high level of industrial unrest often resulting from demarcation disputes between unions. The level of these and other disputes on the waterfront can be illustrated by the fact that in the first 2 months of this year 100,000 man hours were lost as a result of unauthorised stoppages, compared with 40,400 for the same period last year. This shows the tremendous importance of trying to achieve some harmony on the waterfront. That is what the Opposition is trying to do for the benefit of all concerned. Tf honourable members want some examples of how this problem is hitting everybody let me quote from the Newcastle 'Morning Herald' of yesterday, 17 July. An article headed 'Silo troubles hit sorghum growers' goes on to say: Shipping delays in Newcastle had cost sorghum growers $350,000 since April, an official of a rural firm claimed yesterday. That was Mr Thorburn of the Farmers and Graziers Co-operative Co. Ltd. The article continues: Continuous industrial trouble is delaying deliveries, affecting sales and accentuating storage problems. Surely we want to achieve harmony on the waterfront. I believe that the permanent employment provisions will contribute to that harmony. In the same newspaper there is an article headed 'Sorghum ship's 33-day wait off port'. Surely we must try to avoid these sorts of things. The article reported that Captain Son of the 'Maritime Brilliance' had loaded 12,000 tonnes of sorghum in Brisbane before coming to Newcastle and it had taken one day to load the cargo in Brisbane. He had been told that even when the silo workers resumed there would be a delay in getting this ship away because much of the cargo was still in country storages. I know that that is another problem. I say in fairness to the waterside workers that it is not all their problem, but it is absurd that we are in a position in this day and age where a ship will have to wait 33 days. That will mean an enormous cost to the exporters, the importers and the shipowners. The cost will eventually be passed back to the Australian public. It will hit the people whom honourable members opposite claim to represent as hard as it will hit anybody. As I mentioned, the high level of industrial friction that we are trying to avoid has been exacerbated by dissension over wage increases as a natural response to crippling innation and taxation, largely brought about by the incompetent economic policies of this Government and its inability to handle them. The 13,500 waterside workers were recently offered $22.50 a week increase as well as a fixed link to the increase in average weekly earnings. So they can scarcely say that their claims have been ignored. In fact they have been well treated. However, it is the question of port inefficiency that I am stressing, as well as the question of industrial disputes. Inherent in the logic of the Government's efforts to stimulate imports is the assumption that the increased tonnage from overseas suppliers could be made available for Australian consumers. That is a desirable objective. But what has happened? In retrospect it seems to have been naive on the part of the Government to assume that a price stimulation could readily be translated into an increased volume available to the community without taking into account the lags in the shipping process. Waterside hold-ups are one of the major factors of this. As a result of the overtaxing of our port facilities the imports that will eventually become available will have been subjected to the higher costs of wharfage and storage, in addition to the costs of industrial troubles. As I say, that is all passed back to the Australian community. They are the people about whom we are concerned. They are the people whom the Government should be considering, even in this Bill. I realise that this area is essentially the jurisdiction of State governments through such bodies as the New South Wales Maritime Services Board. Nevertheless, I think it is important to point out that there appears to be strong evidence that national priority should be devoted to forward planning in our port facilities in association with future expectations of trade and to the provision of financial assistance to upgrade those facilities for the benefit of the Waterside Workers Federation and for the benefit of the Australian people. I have mentioned the delays that occur. There are plenty of examples. I will cite one more example. The Port of Sydney, which serves as a port as well as a harbour, is limited in size to the tonnage of ship with which it can cope. The limitation on a tanker of 70,000 tons appears somewhat ridiculous when it it considered that Japan has a 1 million ton tanker on the drawing board. We want to see the Government exercise some forward planning. Let it show that it has some efficiency by completing this agreement in the time suggested in the amendment which will be moved in the Committee stage of the Bill. There are many examples of problems in Melbourne and Tasmania. This area is very important, as policy measures in relation to imports and exports must be associated with policy decisions regarding the facilities to handle them and with giving conditions to the waterside workers to enable them to provide the service to the community that I believe they themselves desire to give. I trust that the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Labor and Immigration are working in close co-operation - perhap s that is too much to hope for from this Government-o n the associated aspects of future port upgrading and labour relations. In fairness, let me say that I do not pretend for a moment that the causes of industrial trouble and port congestion are simple. They are deep-rooted and complex, and generalisations can be misleading on a highly technical subject such as this. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Opposition generally have considered this matter and have given what we regard as a reasonable time and more than sufficient time for the Government to achieve the objective which we are aiming to achieve and which I hope the Government will try to achieve too. Nevertheless, I think it is a subject to which more priority should be given and on which a greater degree of Commonwealth-State counder operation would not go amiss. To conclude, let me say that I see no fundamental objection to this Bill, and I am sure the Opposition does not either; but I draw attention to employment in this industry and the costly level of industrial trouble, as exemplified recently by the ships' engineers strike. It is no good the Minister for Labor and Immigration saying, as he did in a speech in June, that industrial conflict is a natural consequence of our economic system. It may be a natural consequence of the economic policies of the Government. Such a passive acceptance of a problem that is so costly in economic, social and human terms is disgraceful. I trust that the review of the stevedoring operations will provide a sound basis for future stability this industry to the advantage of those engaged in it, the importers and exporters and, through them, the community as a whole.",81
20,Mr KELLY,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY,"Wakefield) (4.57)the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson), who spoke a little while ago, that we are not arguing about whether permanency is a good thing. We introduced it when in government. It is a good thing in theory. difficulty is to make it work, and the awful fact is that since it was introduced in 1967 permanency just has not worked as well as we all hoped it would. We have had an escalaof tion in the costs of handling conventional cargo at the rate of about 30 per cent a year. Many problems have followed the agreement of 1967, and I will spell out some of them in the few minutes for which the Whips have allowed me to speak. One of the problems is the sweetheart agreement. It is actually the problem. I would like the honourable member for Burke to listen to this because he criticised the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malof colm Fraser) for not talking about what really meant by 'overseas interests' in the context of overseas action and overseas capital on the waterfront. I thought the honourable member for Wannon spelt it out with crystal clarity. The fundamental problem on the waterfront is the sweetheart agreement between the Waterside Workers Federation and the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour. The Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde which said: Cameron) knows, as we all know, that there is a sweetheart agreement. The employers of employers waterfront labour know that they are domincation ated-no t owned-and controlled, because of the business linkage, by the overseas ship owners who because they are in the Confermake ence system are able to pass the costs on. The sweetheart agreement between the WWF and limiting the AEWL is the root of our problem, and the the Minister knows that. He has often criticised sweetheart agreements in the past. is a classic case. Let me illustrate why it has plus not worked. Nothing I am about to say will inducements be my own opinion. I am taking it from what tarily. I would call neutral sources. Firstly, there the problem of redundancy. The idle time bill rose from S824.000 in 1968 to $8m in 1972. It will fall to some extent this year. son-the chief reason-for this levy which is being continued is to pay for the idle time that is logged up. Even in time of full employown, in ment there will be some stevedores short of labour and others with a surplus of labour. Some stevedores will have labour permanently employed but at home sitting down doing nothing while another stevedore somewhere else I remind will be short of labour. That is the kind of thing that we cannot afford and the economy cannot afford. It is the kind of thing that unfortunately has folThe lowed permanency of employment on the waterfront. We have the situation that it costs about $3,000 a year for each redundant waterside worker's idle time. These are the figures 2 years ago. I have not checked on them recently. Yet under the agreement there was a golden handshake arrangement whereby redundants among waterside workers could be given a golden handshake of $3,000. No one can say that that is mean treatment. The fact is that hardly anybody has been declared redundant. Why is that? Here I do not give my own opinion; I quote from the 1971 report the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authwas ority. The reason why people who are employed incur these costs in idle time is that the Stevedoring Industry Authority can declare these people redundant only on the recommendation of the AEWL, and the AEWL just will not face up to the industrial strife that might follow such action. Honourable members should not take my word for this. I quote from the report of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, On every occasion when there has been a need to implement the agreed redundancy arrangement the have been threatened with industrial disloby way of stoppages, bans on overtime and weekend work and go slow tactics. In the face of these threats th; AEWL has not been prepared to an application for a declaration of redundancy except after some agreement with the Federation. For its part, the Federation has been successful in retrenchments to those men willing to accept redundancy benefits payable under the agreement This That is, the $3,000 handshakein the most recent cases the additional financial offered, and leave the industry volunis That is one of the problems, and I guess the Minister is well aware of it. One of the other parts of the problem is the lack of discipline The reaon the waterfront. Those who know the waterfront well will agree that what I am about to quote is correct. I am not giving my others might say, biased opinion; I am quoting from the annual report of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority- a government institution-for the year ended 30 June 1971. It stated: There was no evidence of any improvement industrial relations during the year. Discipline deteriorated to the extent that in most cases now almost entirely related to the degree of responsibility exhibited by the men themselves. The tation that the Conference arrangements would in better industrial relations, freedom from industrial disputes and a reduction in unit and total costs not been fulfilled. I repeat that this is not my opinion but opinion of the Government Stevedoring dustry Authority. Let me give another ample. Here I will quote from the transcript of evidence given before Mr Justice Moore. There was a discussion about a waterside worker who was accused of being drunk on the job. I am not pretending that all waterside workers are in this category, or that even many of them are; but this is a classic case of lack of discipline. The foreman was asked why he started this drunken man on this The foreman replied: No. I do not have to start him. As a matter fact, I should not start him, but under the new system the man is supposed to be paid for the shift irrespective of whether he works The ship owner is loath to put anybody off because of this. They have had occasions when men have been put off and the union has said 'If you do not reinstate tbem we will pull the whole port out'. That is a sample of the problem. The Minister would be well aware of it. I have here other quotations showing how agreements which were entered into have been broken but, because of the time factor and the discipline that I am under, I am unable to cite them. I will say this: The Minister knows that the waterfront is in a mess. The costs are going up. Discipline is bad. We all know that some solutions can be put forward and at which I know the Minister will be looking. One solution is the nationalisation of the waterfront. I say no more on that matter except that even that solution-it does not attract me-woul d be better than going on as we are. Another solution is to have a Government stevedoring industry company. I do not think that that solution would work because I think the ship owners would not deal with it. The one solution I keep coming back to is to put all waterside workers, whether they be clerks or members of the Waterside Workers Federation, under the control of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority to get some control and discipline in the industry, so that we will not have the problem of Iocked-up labour and of people being paid for sitting at home doing nothing when other employers are short of labour. I know that that is one matter about which the Minister in will be thinking. I repeat it: Put all waterhas front labour-clerk s and everybody working it is in this area-unde r the control of the Ausexpectralian Stevedoring Industry Authority. I know result that the Minister is aware of the problems. I just urge him to grasp the nettle. Because has I want the Minister to grasp the nettle quickly, and because matters cannot continue the as they are going at the moment, I support In the amendments proposed by the honourable ex-member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser) for consideration at the Committee stage.

I think that date was deliberately put in the amendment to test the Government to see how foolish we really are. Well, we are not quite so foolish as all that. For that reason, and for many other reasons, we cannot accept such an odd date. It is the aim of the Government to introduce permanency in the stevedoring industry as quickly as possible. We will do that before April Fools Day if we are able to do it physically. That is the aim of the Government. We will not be helped or hurried to reach a sensible conclusion of these negotiations by simply writing into an Act of this Parliament that it be all fixed up by April Fools Day. I can assure the honourable member, if it is any satisfaction to him, that we will continue to bring the thing to a sensible conclusion. I wish Standing Orders would let me comment on what honourable gentlemen have said about the control of the stevedoring companies by the overseas shipping companies.

As a consequence the houses fell into disrepair. I think it is fair to describe this part of Sydney as bordering on a slum area which if left would certainly develop into one. Apparently there was no way in which this situation could have been corrected. However, ultimately it will be corrected by proposals contained in this legislation which will permit the Commonwealth to buy the land from the Church of England authorities, to develop the land and to put the houses into good, habitable condition. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) gave the 4 main objectives of the purchase of the land in his second reading speech. The first objective is to avoid the sudden displacing of the exisitng population and to avoid any disruption to existing community networks; second, to retain the opportunity for low income earners and families and aged people to live close to the city as part of the wider community; third, to improve environmental conditions and social conditions of residents of the estate and surrounding area; fourth, to preserve the townscape and sympathetically rehabilitate it. In so far as the Bill provides the money and the purchase contributes to these objectives the Opposition supports the Bill. The objective of urban renewal projects should be to benefit with the minimum possible disruption those residents who live in the area. The Minister has said that this is a pilot project. As a pilot project it is very important that the real issues involved here should be closely examined and debated. If it is to be a pilot project, we need to know what we are putting ourselves in for, whether we are doing it the right way, whether it will serve the interests of the community in the broad and of the people in particular, or whether it will be contrary to their interests even though on the surface it may appear to be in their interests. But is that the real test? At present some very exciting developments have been taking place in the architectural, town planning and sociological fields, all related to medium density housing and especially to medium density housing in the inner areas of great metropolises. In Sydney, of course, we have one of the world's great metropolises. There are very old areas in Sydney and also in Melbourne. In those inner areas people have lived for many years and have seen development move into the outer areas. They have remained in the inner areas and have seen commercial and industrial growth around them. Other people have moved to the outer suburban areas to have their quarter acre of land and, on that quarter acre of land, their villa. This has contributed greatly to a rapidly increasing rate of cost for the provision of services such as sewerage, roads and electricity. There is not only the cost of providing these facilides as a public service but also the cost to the people using them. A perfect example is the cost of transport to and from work to those people who live in the outer areas. A consequence of this development is that attention is being turned by architects, town planners and sociologists to the development within the inner metropolitan areas of medium density housing closer to the centre of the city and closer to places of employment. The excitement that many people connected with those fields are feeling depends upon their opportunity to see big development projects go ahead. This Bill deals with an area of 47 acres. 1 do not know how many hectares that area involves. It is important that when there is an opportunity for a large area like this to be used as a pilot project it should be treated as such. It should be an example for development elsewhere by private, municipal or State developers. The proposed development can serve as an example to them. What is perfectly clear from what is proposed by the Government, is that the dwellings in the Glebe area will all be repaired and reoccupied. They will be exactly the same shaped dwellings as they have been since they were first built. Many of them were built more than a century ago. Not the slightest thought has been given to the possibility of redeveloping the whole area in the way that magazines and professional writers have suggested to the Minister and to me. I regret that there has been no such consideration. Many of the houses in the Glebe area are old and will be unlikely to respond satisfactorily to the rehabilitation process of repair, etc. When one considers what could be done with 47 acres of open space, green leaf space or community open space and one appreciates the whole range of community services that could be provided it does seem that not enough consideration has been given to that prospect. I strongly favour the development of medium density housing in the inner suburban areas. In saying that I do not think of medium density housing as being interpreted as high density housing associated with high rise apartment-type dwellings. That is not what I am arguing for at all. I am arguing for medium density housing which could be anything from 20 to 40 and perhaps even 50 people to the acre. In fact, the density of this area is more than 50 people to the acre. There is a population which I would assess to be about 2,800 and there is an area of 47 acres. That works out at more than 50 persons to the acre and that is getting to the very high level of medium density housing. I have in mind medium density housing of a lesser type. I see villa-type development or attached-type development. At the most the buildings would be of 3 storeys, preferably of 2-storeys with walk-up approaches to the second storey. It is important to understand that a great counter movement is starting to develop in Australia. Instead of people constantly moving into outer suburbs and into their quarter-acre blocks, thereby exerting pressure for further services, there is a very substantial movement into the inner city areas. A tremendous job is being done in rehabilitating and restoring old houses, and very attractive they are.",86
27,Mr UREN,NOES,Why can Botany and Balmain be rehabilitated but not Glebe?,88
28,Mr SNEDDEN,NOES,"I am not saying that rehabilitation in Glebe is not a treatment which was available. I am saying that nowhere in any speech the Minister has made has he indicated that he gave consideration to any other treatment of the area other than the rehabilitation of the existing houses. He said it is a pilot project. If it is, the Minister ought to have made available to this House the considerations that were available to him and should explain why he chose to do certain things. No mention is made of any environmental impact study in the second reading speech.",88
29,Mr UREN,NOES,Can I just explain to you?,88
30,Mr SNEDDEN,NOES,Pleas e do.,88
31,Mr UREN,NOES,The survey of the architects who made the original survey has already been tabled in this Parliament. Mr Ruddock-The Bills and Papers Office does not know about it.,88
32,Dr FORBES,NOES,You have plenty of copies. Nobody else can get them.,88
33,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Order ! I think the Minister, when he replies, will explain these matters.",88
34,Mr SNEDDEN,NOES,"The next point I wish to make is that the appropriate authority to undertake this development would be the New South Wales Housing Commission in consultation with local authorities. This would increase the opportunities for lower income residents in the inner city area to have the added advantage that many of the tenants could actually deal directly with people on the spot, such as local government or the New South Wales Housing Commission, instead of having to deal with people who are Canberra based. It is very important, when considering this area, that we do what we can to provide for the people in the houses the opportunity for ownership of them. The people ought to have the opportunity for their own equity. There is no opportunity for that at all. The Liberal and Country Parties believe a housing guidance bureau should be established to provide information to people about their options for housing-wha t is available for them to buy and what finance is available-and to advise them what their needs are in housing expressed by their capacity to pay. The fact that the Labor Government does not choose to have such a bureau is simply due to the fact that the Labor Party believes in tenanted houses instead of home ownership. The whole drive of the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson) who is at the table, is to convert Australia largely into a country where people rent homes instead of staying in the proud position we have now of-so far as I can check the records-the highest home ownership of any country. That is what we wish to continue. Having said that, the Opposition believes the Government has the perfect opportunity in the Glebe estates to implement a pilot project for an urban renewal program of the type we have in mind. I regret to say that it is an opportunity which is being missed. We believe that the Government's approach to the problem is incorrect. We support the purchase of the land. We support the concept but we reject the approach which the honourable gentleman has adopted. I think it is important to examine some of the facts surrounding this matter. The total cost of the purchase of the Glebe estates is SI7.5m. This represents a price of 3372,000 an acre, or $93,000 a quarter acre if honourable members like to put it in those terms. The average cost of the 700 houses being purchased-bearin g in mind that many are in a state of extreme disrepair and that most are old terraced houses-is $25,000 a house before improvements. On a conservative estimate-it must be taken as a very conservative estimate-the average improvement cost would be around $8,000 a house, bringing the cost for each house to around $33,000. Honourable members can imagine how much rent subsidy will be involved in having people live in the houses. Let us accept a modest 10 per cent return, given that the interest rate on money borrowed to buy one's home now is 11 per cent. The overdraft rate is 11 per cent and 13 per cent. What return on money invested is being received for rented homes I leave open to the imagination. But there is a minimum capital cost of at least $33,000. Taking 10 per cent as a conservative amount, giving an annual rental of $3,300, how can these sorts of people pay that amount of money for rent? Mr Hodges-What about the maintenance thereafter?",88
35,Mr SNEDBEN,NOES,"What about the maintenance thereafter, as the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) reminds me. The consequence is that there will be an enormous rental subsidy element. If we multiply that rental subsidy element across the totality of the rented homes owned by all governments in Australia the cost will be monumentally large. There is no reason to believe that a particular group of people should be preferred over a different group of people. I do say that, not in any way to criticise the residents of the Glebe area but just to make it clear that a government ought not enter into a project of this kind without understanding the ramifications of it. Are we to understand that this is to be a pilot project for massive rent subsidies for all rented homes and that this Government intends to do what it can to advance the number of rented homes instead of those homes which are owned by the occupants? Let us assume that each dwelling accommodates 4 people. There is no reason to assume that that would be the case because, in many instances, there would be just 2 elderly people, pensioners, perhaps, or 2 people whose children have grown up and left home. There is no reason to assume that it would be 4 people, but making that assumption there are 2,800 people in the area. We must remember in relation to this land that, on the assumption of a population of 2,800, there are nearly 60 people on each acre and there are about 7 houses to the acre. The amount of open space for facilities for community services is quite limited. Mr Hodges-They are not interested in the environment.",89
36,Mr SNEDDEN,NOES,"The honourable member for Petrie says that they are not interested in the environment. When it is seen that this is to be a pilot project, one wonders just how much interest there is. We strongly support increased availability and improved standards of accommodation for people of limited means, particularly the. aged in the inner city area, if this is where those people want to live. If I may put the matter in these very important social terms, which the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott) used in a very impressive maiden speech the other night, we are concerned about these people as individuals. We are concerned for their social welfare, their security, and their happiness. It is important that we be sure that when we make these efforts in their interests that is really what they want and that we serve their interests best.",89
37,Mr HUNT,NOES,Not living as a conglomerate mass in a commune.,89
38,Mr SNEDDEN,NOES,"Livin g in a conglomerate mass in a commune is perhaps overstating it but nevertheless there are implications when you go into the details of the matter. We want to make sure that not only are the aged and poor helped in this way but also that great range of people who want to live in the inner city area and whose jobs require them to do fo-the people on night shift, for instance, the people working in the factories and industries around the area. They should be given the opportunity of living close to their piace of employment. I want to state to the House the policies of the Liberal and Country Parties. I shall read the relevant part of those policies. It is as follows: The Liberal and Country Parties recognise there is increasing community awareness of the need to improve the living environment of major urban centres. Equally there is growing community concern to protect land or buildings which contribute lo ihe quality of the living environment . . . Clearly, extremely complex issues arise when judgment about the needs of growth-for example, for freeways, highrise developments, for altered land use-mus t be balanced against the interest of long term residents, special interest groups, existing facilities and so on. The local nature of these issues underlines the Liberal and Country Parties' conviction that decisions affecting local land use patterns must be taken by State or Local Government. You cannot make decisions in Canberra. A man looking over Lake Burlsy Griffin does not understand the problems of people in inner metropolitan Sydney. We welcome programs in which the Commonwealth, through State and local governments, will assist the development of strategic land use plans in the existing urban areas of major cities. We want the Commonwealth to encourage public participation projects involving State and local government together with the local residents. This approach ensures that urban renewal projects are developed with due regard to community aspirations. We want the Commonwealth to assist conservation projects within the cities response to requests by State governments. We want it to encourage the preservation of historic environments and public parklands which are so essential to the character of cities. We want the Commonwealth to maintain important historic buildings and areas. We of the Opposition do not believe that just because something is old it has historic merit and should be preserved. In fact I have seen some old buildings which are quite ugly. What we need to do is to preserve historic buildings which have charm .ind grace and represent an era. There is no need for the intervention of an extra level of government in the form of the Department of Urban and Regional Development, or, as it is more popularly called, DURD. We would make it clear that regional development has quite a different purpose to that of urban improvement. We have established our spokesmen, our front bench, and we have deliberately and positively separated- I think this will be of great benefit when we come into office-regiona l development from urban improvement. They are quite different concepts. There is no need for the Commonwealth Government to become a giant landlord. I have no doubt that the Minister for DURD would like to become a giant landlord. If he wishes to do so he will be trying to change the entire social characteristics of the Australian people. The Australian people want to be their own landlord; they want to buy their own houses, not to have a landlord which is a Commonwealth government, especially when the chief of it lives in Canberra and is supposed to understand the problems of people throughout Australia. The Minister said in his second reading speech that the application of a number of professional skills would be needed in the Glebe area-planning , architectural, building trades and social work. It is to be hoped that these professionals will not be Canberra based or Canberra directed. We reject any concept that the people of Glebe will be swamped with a team of experimentalists sent to use them as human guinea pigs in a pilot project. There needs to be local decision making. Both local government and State government need to be involved in a realistic way. Not only will localised decision making result in better decisions made with a greater understanding of the aspirations of the people of in Glebe, but also it will avoid unnecessary duplication. Nowadays, the way this Government is operating, it sets up a team of fellows in Canberra to put such demands on municipal government and State governments that the State governments and municipal authorities then have to employ a team of people to interpret what the people from Canberra tell them to do. You finish up getting a flow of correspondence one way and the other and people are employed merely to understand and reply to each other. The mirroring of public servants and government at the 3 levels is really growing to a stage where it will represent a very serious departure from efficiency and the social and economic needs of this country. No evidence has been given that States or local government authorities have been fully consulted. The Minister said in his second reading speech that he rejected a statement by my colleague the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt), who is the Opposition shadow Minister on conservation, that the Glebe purchase had been made without consultation with State government or local government. The Minister said that in considering the purchase he wrote to the New South Wales Minister for Local Government and Highways and to the Mayor of Leichhardt Municipal Council and that officers of his Department and its consultants discussed the project with officers and aldermen of the Leichhardt Council and officers of the New South Wales Housing Commission. I am informed that the only written communication to the New South Wales Minister for Housing and his Department was a telegram sent in June 1973 informing them of the intentions of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development to study the possibility of the Glebe purchase. Quite clearly there has been totally inadequate consultation with State and local government. It is a perfect example of bureaucracy gone mad when people in Canberra, and the Minister in particular, take decisions because they have a popular flavour and the Minister wants the credit for the Federal Labor Government. But the Minister is unthinking about the way in which it should have been done through State government and local government consultation. There is a need for greater and not less local government participation in urban renewal and improvement. There is a need for the national Government to involve itself, not by directly overseeing urban development projects and becoming a giant landlord and developer, but by providing additional funds to local government for capital works programs such as day and child care centres, recreational and care centres for children both after school and during holiday periods; parks, gardens and flora and fauna reserves; family and community counselling facilities, particularly among migrant communities; library and recreational facilities; health and welfare centres, including family planning and infant health centres; sewerage and drainage schemes; and road, street and bridge works. With the greater community awareness of social issues and rising expectations of social welfare, local government has been required to provide many of the facilities and services I have mentioned. The financial burden of such ventures cannot be. borne solely by the rate revenue of local government. There needs to be Federal nnanciai participation in their implementation. The Liberal and Country Parties believe that funds should be made available to the local government through the State on a no strings attached basis. We do not believe that there should be a constant policy of auditing by Federal Government officials of elected local government officials. Quite clearly those people elected to office in local government are able to make their decisions close to the people affected. That is where the responsibility ought to be and where the service can best be provided. Whether it is financed by local government, State government or the Commonwealth Government, that ds where it ought to be provided. We do not need duplication, and we most certainly do not want policy auditing by the Federal Government. The Liberal Party believes that these funds should be made available on a no strings attached basis. In supporting the Bili, the Opposition would like assurances that residents will be consulted fully about the Department's intentions in their area. We hope but do not expect, I regret to say, that the major decisions affecting residents will be made at the local government level. That is where they ought to be made. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development has acquired a reputation of being concerned for individuals and their welfare, and I pay him tribute for his concern. If he wants to demonstrate his true concern he will not arrogate to himself unilateral wisdom on all these things. He will understand that local government bodies and State Government bodies have tremendous wisdom to contribute and that they ought to take the decisions close to the people. He claimed that the Government remains open minded about achieving its objectives in the Glebe Estate area. 1 hope that he will be receptive to the policy proposals which I put on behalf of the Opposition Parties. We support the Bill. It will be given passage through this House, but it is important that there be adequate debate in this chamber so that the people of Australia can know that there is understanding in Canberra that their needs will be best decided by people close to them and that the function of the Federal Government is to make available money and not policy auditing of the kind that is occurring in this Bill.",89
39,Mr LES JOHNSON,NOES,"The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) has declared that he supports the Glebe Lands (Appropriation) Bill 1974. It is the weakest kind of support that one could expect. While he supports the Bill, he admits that he has an attitude which represents the very antithesis and a negation of everything for which the Bill stands. Rather than rehabilitation of the Glebe area he would prefer to see it razed. His whole speech typified a bulldozer mentality. Because of our fear of this kind of approach, the Federal Government has decided to take, this initiative. In announcing the decision to enter into negotiations with the Church of England, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) and I stated jointly: Public acquisition will increase the stock of rental housing for certain categories of needy people. Public acquisition will also advance the policies of the Australian Government in respect to the National Estate. The Australian Government sees its acquisition of the Estates as a demonstration scheme for authorities lo carry out large scale inner city renovation and restoration. It also wishes to use the scheme as a testing ground for new methods of community planning nnd participation. I fail to see why there should be any enthusiasm for redevelopment in places such as Paddington in Sydney and in other inner city centres when it is done only in the name of profit ancl private enterprise. There is obviously u capacity to do it in the name of the people and of the decent things for which governments are supposed to stand. Where there has been redevelopment of this nature it has been of an undesirable standard, and far too often the redevelopment has taken place only to remove the people who traditionally lived in such areas and to facilitate the occupation of those areas by the privileged. Our job is to ensure that the cities are revitalised and that the people who have worked there all their lives will have the opportunity to continue living there in uplifted environments. I have heard all kinds of comments and interjections, including some loud ones from the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) who makes jibes about the Government being opposed to home ownership. Recently I mentioned that the 2 censuses conducted over about a decade from 1961 indicated a drop"" in the incidence of home ownership in Australia during the period that the present Opposition was in government. So the present Opposition's record in government is not too good in that regard. Mr Hodges-What about the figures from the Queensland Housing Commission?",91
40,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Order ! The honourable member for Petrie will cease interjecting. The honourable member seems to be following in the footsteps of his predecessor in that respect. Mr Thorburn-He will go the same way, too. Mr Hodges-You try it.",92
41,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Order ! The honourable member for Petrie has yet to make his maiden speech. When he does so, at some time in the future, he will have an opportunity to express himself.",92
42,Mr LES JOHNSON,NOES,"The interjections by the honourable member for Petrie seem to be very out of keeping and very incompatible with the very sensitive and aesthetic subject that we are debating at the present time. The honourable member for Petrie and the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock), who have both been making interjections about home ownership, may be interested to hear that the highest number of houses ever is under construction in Australia at the present time. They may also be interested to know that by 31 July of this year Australia almost undoubtedly will complete the highest number of houses ever to have been completed in our history. Mr Hodges-And at the highest cost, too.",92
43,Mr LES JOHNSON,NOES,The honourable member for Petrie should make up his mind as to the premise on which he wants to argue this matter. He can have it any way he likes. Mr Hodges-You will lose whichever way it goes.,92
44,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Order ! I ask the honourable member for Petrie to contain himself. Interjections are out of order. The honourable member will have 3 years in which to practise, but I ask him to serve an apprenticeship in the House first.",92
45,Mr LES JOHNSON,NOES,"I was saying that we are building a record number of houses this year. The incidence of home ownership being provided for is the highest in our history. So the Government does not have to be apologetic in this regard. I would say that always in evidence is the Opposition's concern for the fact that the Government is also trying to provide some houses for and to care for the lower income earners in the community. The Opposition likes to think of houses and the basic human need for shelter as being a subject for rotten, ruthless exploitation. The Government believes that people are entitled to shelter in any circumstance. We believe that the people of Glebe are entitled not only to the kind of shelter that they have had throughout their lives but also to an uplifted environment. We want to use Glebe for pilot experimental purposes. We want to be able effectively to identify the role of government in this respect. So the Glebe project will be a pilot scheme which can be emulated and from which expertise can be acquired by public authorities. I have also heard-predominantl y by way of interjection but also by way of implication by the Leader of the Opposition-som e contentions to the effect that proper studies bave not been made of this proposition. Such studies ought to be made, of course, as it will involve the expenditure of $15.75m, it will involve the utilisation for decent housing purposes of 47 acres of land and it will involve some 700 houses that are already in existence. As I mentioned yesterday when the House was debating the proposed Googong Dam project, it can be confidently expected of this Government that adequate documentation always will be available, that proper surveys always will be carried out and that it will always make available to the Parliament the environmental impact studies made in respect of such projects. I am pleased to be able to say that those things have been done by way of an excellent document which was tabled in the Parliament by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) on 9 April 1974. The incredible thing- I think this is worth saying because it might save us a lot of debating time in the future-is that honourable members opposite do not seem to know that documents which are tabled are available within the precincts of the Parliament. For example, they did not know that 300 copies of the document on the Googong dam had been printed, as they admitted. The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) acknowledged, I think, that he had not seen that document. There is little exouse for not knowing all about 'this document because in tabling it on 9 April this year the Minister for Urban and Regional Development said: For the information of honourable members, I present the report to the Department of Urban and Regional Development on the Church of England lands in Glebe, New South Wales. The Australian Government has decided to purchase these lands. Because only a limited number of copies of the request are available a copy has been placed in the Parliamentary Library for use by honourable members. If honourable members opposite want a road map in order to find out where the Parliamentary Library is, we will be happy to assist them in that regard. In this case a very comprehensive report has been prepared by the consultant experts Jackson, Teece, Chesterman and Willis. They are very notable as architects, planners and building economists. The report sets out a number of very interesting facts. Although the Leader of the Opposition believes that the buildings in the Glebe area ought to be demolished and replaced with medium density development-n o doubt what he is contending is of a desirable nature- I want the House to know what these competent consultants said about the Glebe area from an architectural standpoint. They said: The architectural importance of the area is of a special kind. It does not consist of great houses or buildings of intrinsic architectural merit. Because of their unusual history as church property Bishopthorpe and St. Phillips have preserved, within an area large enough to continue to serve changing contemporary needs, the character of Australian town architecture of the third quarter of the nineteenth century-that important but yet insufficiently understood period, between the gold rush of the 1850's and the building boom of the 1880's. Within the area, cottage types and terrace types of great importance for an understanding of the development of architecture in Australia have survived Set among them, in spacious, tree-lined streets, will be found some larger houses, corner shops, former hotels and stores, together with an important group of church and public buildings in the vicinity of the corner of Glebe Point Road and St Johns Road. Altogether the areas provide a traditional community precinct unique to Sydney, which still possess a vital community life today. With appropriate preservation, and some sympathetic development to increase the density of the areas, they could be made to serve the needs of the present day whilst retaining their traditional character as part of the nation's heritage. Mr Ruddock-At what cost?",92
46,Mr LES JOHNSON,NOES,"The mate of Sir Robert Askin asks: 'At what cost?' As somebody said recently, the New South Wales Government seems to have a complex about developers. All that that Government can think about is whether these things can be done by developers who think in terms of towering concrete buildings. I ask: What is the cost to the nation of the loss of this precious heritage? It seems to me that one cannot measure all these things in terms of money alone, yet there is much inclination on the part of honourable members opposite, particularly the honourable member for Parramatta, to do so.",93
47,Mr COHEN,NOES,It is an irresponsible attitude. Mr Ian Robinson-What does the National Trust say about it?,93
48,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order ! If this cross fire continues across the chamber I intend to take action against the first person who does it. I give a warning to everyone in the House.,93
49,Mr LES JOHNSON,NOES,"I will not read out the appealing propositions that are contained in this report. I simply want to say about the report that it represents a very complex study by some of the most eminent specialists in the city of Sydney. They spent considerable time in analysing the situation and identifying the prospects about rehabilitation. I believe that this development will provide an excellent example of the kind of rehabilitation that can be undertaken not only in Sydney but also in other parts of Australia. I was interested to hear the suggestion from the Leader of the Opposition that there has been insufficient negotiation on this matter. Let me say, firstly, that no one can suggest that there is any high-handedness represented by the Australian Government's involvement in this scheme, because the response which my colleague made in relation to this matter was made to the Church of England itself which, by the way of an inquiry into poverty, first of all, and, subsequently, by way of a public statement invited governments-an y government-to assist it in its dilemma. It knew that it could not sustain the maintenance of the Glebe estate any longer. It knew that these very fine architectural characteristics which I have already referred were going to be systematically destroyed and undermined by private developers who were coming into the area. One can go to the Glebe and see evidence of this already. Great concrete monstrosities have emerged in this beautiful, historical townscape, blotting out the sun. Development is not taking place in any organised way because nobody has been able to acquire large acreages of land. In fact, have been told by some of our consultants that if this development were left to private enterhave prise nobody in this country would have the capacity to acquire the whole area, to enable the whole area to be pulled down if that were wanted and redevelopment to be planned in an overall way in order to achieve relationship of one building to another, thereby getting a proper sense of perspective in relation to landscaping, public amenities and things of that nature. So what has been to happening, of course, has been this piecemeal replacement of the beautiful townscape the most undesirable form of concrete buildings, without proper provision for green space and the like. But the facts are that these overtures were made, and fortuitously, they were responded to by my colleague. That is not to say that the only people with whom the Australian Government discussed these matters were representatives of the Church England. I have in my hand a summary of environment. correspondence with New South Wales State Ministers, the Leichhardt Municipal Council. New South Wales members of Parliament and others. Perhaps I could read the list. All the dates are here. Mr MCLeay-What about tabling that document?",93
50,Mr LES JOHNSON,NOES,"Yes , I will be happy to table the document. I am always happy to table a document. This is a new syndrome for the Australian Government. It was never done very much previously but we do it now. I will be pleased to put this document on the table. My colleague has been in touch with several people and he has listed the dates of these communications and meetings with people such as the Mayor of Leichhardt, the Deputy Town Clerk of the Leichhardt Municipal Council, the State and Federal members of Parliament for the area. Also listed are letters sent to Sir Charles Cutler, to to Mr Jago, the New South Wales Acting Minister for Local Government and Highways, to you again, Mr Speaker, as the local Federal member for the area, and to Mr Ragen, the Town Clerk. There is a considerable number of people listed here. As I have said I am very happy to table that document. Before I say something further about the Glebe I would like to disparage the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition when we he was talking about our alleged lack of enthusiasm for home ownership and said that we shown no interest in the housing advisory arrangement. I simply want to say that this matter has been under official study since February of this year, and our plans in relation to a housing advisory bureau are now at an a sensible advanced stage. In his second reading speech the Minister for Urban and Regional Development referred this project as being not simply an exercise in the renovation and construction of housing by but also as an exercise in community rehabilitation. As I have said, the purchase not only involves 700 houses but it also affects and involves the lives of some 2,500 people. The project can be successful only if its objective is to meet the needs of the residents. In meeting these needs we are concerned not only with housing but also with of the wider concerns of the total human These concerns vary significantly between community groups, such as the aged, single parents, Aborigines and students among others. The constitutional power of the Government in regard to these matters has been well established by the Solicitor General of the time, who is now among us here in a different capacity as the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott). That in itself is a very interesting study. Many people for whom the Australian Government has particular responsibility are included among the residents in the Glebe Estate. It will not be possible to adopt a uniform and simplistic approach to social organisation, planning and construction. We will need to determine the various groups in the area before deciding on the services to be provided to those groups. For example, if we take the aged people, we will need to cater for the aged people who are well, the frail aged and the chronically sick aged. The services and the infrastructure to support each group are markedly different. It will be necessary to examine, for each group in the community, how they live now, to find out what they feel is adequate, what new facilities are needed and what facilities need upgrading. The Government has formulated certain objectives but it does not want to fall into the same mistakes that have been made in the past by some housing authorities. My time in this debate has just about expired but I want to say, as one who will be administering this scheme jointly with the Minister for Urban and Regional Development through our project boards and project managers, that we will be working in very close co-operation with the people, seeking to learn from them what they would like to see the Glebe become. There is no question that there will be a substantial rehabilitation program for a number of buildings. There will probably be some new buildings to enable us to accommodate people who are affected by the renovation program. We will be closing off streets. In some instances we will be creating lovely boulevards and playing areas which do not exist in those parts at the moment. We have contrived an innovation in terms of community experimentation which will provide for the whole of Australia very valuable lessons in the administration of communities that need rehabilitation.

51,Unknown,NOES,"Sitting suspended from 6.13 to 8 p.m. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH Address-in-Reply Debate resumed from 16 July (vide page 243), on motion by Mr Young: That the following Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General be agreed to; May it please Your Excellency: We, the House of Representatives of Australia, in Parliament assembled desire to express our loyalty to thanks for the Speech which. His Excellency the our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to express our Right Honourable Sir Paul Hasluck, G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O., K.St.J., as Governor General, was pleased to address to Parliament.",95
52,Mr BOURCHIER,NOES,Mr Speaker,95
53,Dr KLUGMAN,NOES,You r maiden speech?,95
54,Mr BOURCHIER,NOES,"Not quite. I did that this time last year. I will be delighted when I hear yours. Mr Speaker, in speaking in the Address-in-Reply debate I would like firstly to extend to you my congratulations on being re-elected to the office of Speaker. Obviously the shock was far too great for you, because you immediately had to go away to recover. Of course, we are delighted to see you back on deck and we look forward to a good year under your control. I also offer my congratulations to those honourable members on the Government side who moved and seconded the motion for the adoption of the Address-inReply, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) and the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child). Also, and particularly, I congratulate the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott) on this side of the House. All three presented their maiden speeches and I congratulate them on their efforts. I am sure we will hear a lot more from them all. The Governor General's Speech was made by the now former Governor General, Sir Paul Hasluck. Unfortunately it marked the end of his reign as Governor General. I believe that all of us in the Parliament respect the manner in which he carried out his duties and I am sure that we wish him well in his retirement from that position. The Governor General's Speech, when one looks at it, is a very slim and almost insignificant paper. It has many fewer pages than the last one presented in 1973, which was full of many promises very few of which we saw carried out. This time we have fewer pages and fewer promises and perhaps we will see one or two of them fulfilled. Let us hope they come to fruition. It is pleasing that on this occasion we did not see the word 'mandate' that was bandied around so much last year. At last the Government has realised that it has not got the mandate it thought it had. On every occasion last year when there was some obvious flaw in the Government's management - o r should I say mismanagement?-and it was pointed out by the Opposition, all the Government could do was sqawk that it was the fault of the Opposition when it was in government in previous years. But after 16 months that has worn a little thin, so the Government has come up with a new one. It says now that it is our fault because of the hold-up occasioned by the double dissolution. I always thought that it was the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) who called the double dissolution and not the Opposition. However, that is the excuse of honourable members on the Government side, and they are sticking to it. The first part of the Governor General's Speech to which I draw attention is where he referred to protection for the weaker sections of the community. This is a very real and important problem facing us all, but let us look at the Government's attitude to protection for the weak in the community. What is happening? Let us consider the social security area and the nursing home benefit. It took the Government over 16 months to realise that something needed to be done and when the Government finally decided to do something it was still far short of the required mark. When the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) announced in the House last week that new increased rates were to come into effect on 1 August, the Government was subsidising nursing homes to the extent of $67.90 per bed per week. However, for the new benefit to come in on 1 August the Government for some reason or other has picked the odd amount of $29 per week as an increase. The benefits are always given on a daily basis. Obviously the Government could not work that out so it gave a lump sum per week and instead of $28 or $35 a week which would have brought the benefit into line with other daily calculations, we find the amount of $29 a week. This lifts the total benefit to S96.90 per bed per week. Many may say that that is very good, that it is a large amount of money for the Government to pay by way of subsidy to nursing homes. But in most of these nursing homes the pensioners-unlik e the position the Minister would have us believe to be. true, that is that they are left with $4 a week of their pension to spend-ar e having to meet a shortfall of $13.60 a week to maintain the charging rates set out and standardised by the Department of Social Security, not by the nursing homes. Then we have the Minister saying that it is the taxpayer who has to pay. Let us look at the position of Government nursing homes, the ones that are covered by Federal Government grants, and compare it with the position of homes that are subsidised by the State governments. If that is not a subsidy by the taxpayer, what is? There is such an extreme shortage in the availability of Government homes that they are not able to house adequately all the people that need attention. Therefore there is a real need to provide and assist these private nursing homes. I believe it is up to the Government to lift this subsidy by at least another $5 or $6 per week to bring it to a realistic level. In fact the subsidy should be sufficient to make sure that a person who is on the pension should not have to pay any money at all to get into these homes and should not be left wondering where to go for care. The private hospitals and registered nursing homes-ther e are 2 typesare forced into the situation where the only people they can admit are those who can afford to pay. They are forced into that situation by a socialist government which claims to be dedicated to working for the people in need. But what does the government do? It forces the homes that are providing a place for people in need to cater only for those who are able to pay. What a ridiculous situation this is. Some of the private hospitals, notably the ones that are run by charitable organisations, try to cover the gap and consequently we have a situation where people who cannot afford to pay are still able to enter. But the private nursing home, the one operated by the individual on the basis of charges laid down by the Department of Social Security-and you can bet your life that they are not over-profitable charges-canno t afford to subsidise these people and can take only people who can afford to pay. The Minister is totally wrong in his assessment of this situation and he should do something about it. It is a slight on the people who operate the homes to say that they are taking advantage of the situation in order to make money. The regulations laid down by the various State health departments and the hospitals and charities commissions stipulate that these homes have to be operated by qualified nursing people and under very severe regulations. There is no way that they can take advantage of people. They provide a service that is badly needed. The next area I want to refer to is that of homes for the aged. Here the Minister is not aware of the situation at all. Like the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson), he has not realised that building costs have gone up. He is still trying to have these hostels for the aged built for $9,000 or $ 11,000 a unit when in every State the cost of building these units is roughly $13,000 or higher. We have a situation where the Minister for Social Security and this Government are prepared to offer a $2 for $1 grant up to $9,000. In the House the other day, after the Minister had appointed a commission to go right around Australia and make inquiries in every State about the needs in this area, and this was achieved, we had the reply of that commission given. It was that the ceiling needed to be lifted, the $9,000 subsidy limit and the ceiling cost per unit of $11,000 raised to a higher level to bring them into line with current costs. But what do we find? The Minister comes into the House and, probably off the cuff, says: 'We are going to make it a $4 for $1 grant'. A $4 for $1 grant does not mean a thing unless the subsidy ceiling of $9,000 is lifted. Really all he is saying is that instead of a $2 for $1 grant, which I think represents something like $6,000 out of $9,000, the Government will give something like $7,200 out of $9,000. That is mighty; it is tremendous, provided one can build the places, but when the cost of building is limited, it does not matter whether one has all of the $9,000, one still cannot build the houses. The situation across Australia is that the building of none of these hostels can proceed. In Bendigo alone, 3 organisations are ready to go ahead-thei r plans are drawn up-wit h the building of homes for over 200 people. Those organisations cannot proceed with their building until the Minister is prepared to say that the ceiling price is lifted. That again is a a situation in which only those people, who can afford to pay are being catered for, because the differential gap makes these homes available only to those people who can afford to pay for them. Mr Eric Robinson-Totall y a policy of ceit.",95
55,Mr BOURCHIER,NOES,"That is totally a policy of deceit, as my colleague has said. If the as well as the subsidy for accommodation were to be increased we could go ahead and provide urgently needed accommodation which in turn would take the strain off the program for building government homes and off other housing programs and would generally ease the whole problem facing aged people. This is a growing problem. I have some figures relating to the growth of the aged population from 1961 to 1971 in Australia. In 1961 there were 510,000 aged persons. By 1971 that had grown to 1,050,000 aged persons, an increase of roughly 100 per cent. During the same period the population of Australia increased by a mere 20 per cent. So one can see that this is a growing problem which must be attacked and attacked properly. The Minister for Social Security has stated that he must wait for his Party to make a decision on whether he will be able to lift these ceiling limits. I believe that it is the prerogative of the Minister to do it, but he claims that he must wait on a decision. My colleague, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp), suggested recently that the Minister should back-date payments for nursing home benefits. 1 suggest to the Minister that if his Government is vitally concerned to do something about this problem he should introduce the measures now to overcome the problems in respect of nursing home benefits and homes for aged persons. The Opposition would support those measures. The Treasurer (Mr Crean) stated regularly last year that he did not believe that a Budget should necessarily be presented only once annually; he was going to make sure that various components of the Budget would be introduced when the need existed for that action to be taken. The need is here. This matter is supposed to be one of those social welfare needs about which honourable members opposite skite that they wish to take some action. But what do they do? Nothing. The excuse that they use is that they are waiting for the Budget. Perhaps they are. Perhaps they have found that they have overspent. Honourable members on the Government side talk about the protection provided to the weaker section of the community by this Government. What a great statement that is when the Government immediately proposes that in the next Budget it will cut the tax rebate for depensioners from $156 to $130. Is that an example of giving protection to the weaker section of the community? Is that an example limits of providing assistance to the aged? Not at all. That proposal is a complete and utter embarrassment to this Government. When the appropriate time arrives, our aged people will not forget that action. These taxation rebates should be increased, not reduced. Last week, the announcement was made that war widows were to be deprived of their travelling allowance. I am sure that the Treasurer will find the coffers of his Treasury filled with the savings from that miserable decision. That is the most petty and miserable action since this Government took milk from the children of this nation last year. If honourable members look at page 11 of the printed copy of the Speech delivered by the former Governor General, they will see in small type mention of defence. The Governor General said: Under the direction of the Minister for Defence, my Government is creating the most effective, mobile and professional defence force in Australia's peacetime history. What a joke. Honestly, that would be the greatest joke. It is almost as funny as the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) is. The defence force is certainly mobile. There are no numbers to hold up its mobility. The defence force can be moved anywhere at any time by the use of a couple of caravans. Is it effective? It is totally ineffective. As for being professional, if one studies the figures coming from the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) one will find that increasingly the professionals, the real people who are required to operate and control our armed forces, are retiring. I draw the attention of honourable members to a statement which appeared in the Melbourne 'Sun-News Pictorial' on 2 July this year. The article stated: The strength of the defence forces fell further behind targets in May. That was published prior to the presentation of the Governor General's Speech. The article went on: Australia's defence strength has fallen by more than 1,500 servicemen in the first 5 months of this year. Mostly that comprises officers who have resigned. On 7 June 1974, in his opening address to the Premiers Conference, the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) made a statement with respect to the defence situation, in which he said: Retrenchments will, however, become necessary in certain areas-for one thing to keep the right sort of balance in employment. Where dismissals become necessary the Government will ensure that steps are taken to help the individual concerned to move into other employment . . . I look at that statement and say: 'Right, in Bendigo we have the Bendigo Ordnance Factory'. 1 point out to the House that last year the Minister for Defence-h e was also Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Supply, Minister for the Army, Minister for the Navy and Minister for Air; and he was so successful that he lost all but one of those portfoliospromised the world to a delegation that I brought here to see him. He said that there would be no more retrenchments in the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. He said this at the same time as he promised that no further retrenchments would occur in other ordnance factories and Government munitions factories throughout the country. But of course, he is no longer on the plate. We have a new Minister in charge of this areawhich is now covered by the portfolio of Manufacturing Industry. So, we must look to the new Minister to uphold that promise. I sincerely hope that he does carry out the promise that these people will not be retrenched. If not, I would like to know where the tradesmen at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory are to find alternative jobs in Bendigo without having to uproot their families and shift to the metropolitan area. There is no way in the world that they can do that. If that happens, it will be a total disaster. The Bendigo Ordnance Factory is the biggest single employer of people in Bendigo. We cannot afford to have such a situation develop. The Government should carry out the promise to find extra work and to provide additional contracts which it undertook to do last year, but did nothing about. It is time that the Government did something about it. I turn to the reductions in tariff and the lifting of import quotas. This is a great example of providing a service to the nation. This action was designed to cut down the inflationary spiral. We all know the great effect that the action had. The inflationary spiral has continued to rise. Let me illustrate the real effect that this action has had on the Australian textile industry which employs 80 per cent women the majority of whom are married. A number of these textile firms are in country areas. What will happen to the people working in the textile industry if they lose their jobs? Are they to be retrained? If so, where will they go? Where will they find another job? Is the Government suddenly setting itself up as a body which will move whole families from country areas to metropolitan areas? The Government has promised to consider reintroducing quotas and increasing tariffs on textile imports. All right, let us see some action. If I remember correctly, the then Minister for Overseas Trade and Secondary Industry (Dr JF CAIRNS), who is now Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Overseas Trade, came into the House and made the statement very dramatically that his Government had taken this great step of introducing a 23 per cent tariff cut across the board. This action was hailed as one of great enterprise, a marvellous action which took only a few hours to develop. Why does it take so long for the Government to work in reverse? Why cannot the Minister walk in here tonight or on the first sitting day next week and tell us that he is now going to reimpose those quotas? Why does he not increase the tariff to the former level? The Minister can do this as expeditiously as he lifted the quotas and reduced the tariff. The people in the country are waiting for the Minister to act because he mentioned that he was going to do something about it. He said that nearly 2 weeks ago. So far as we have heard or seen nothing further from the Minister. Let us look at the development of the Albury-Wodonga region by the Cities Commission. This is a typical example of Government bungling. Obviously, it looks like being another bad Government decision but we have come to expect this. The Minister who was",97
56,Mr COHEN,NOES,Do we do nothing good?,99
57,Mr BOURCHIER,NOES,"Not very much. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) who was going to redevelop the Dandenong Ranges and was going to buy back all the houses in that area for that pose rushed in and made a quick decision. Let me quote to the honourable member for Robertson, who is sitting in his wrong seat on the Government side, the words of the Minister who criticised that proposal Mr Garland-He has been looking at his holiday slides.",99
58,Mr BOURCHIER,NOES,"Yes . The honourable member asked whether the Government did anything good. Who criticised the proposals of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development? It was the Minister for the Environment and Conservation (Dr Cass) who said that the Federal Government had taken a punt on the choice of the site. He went on to say that the Government may have been wrong in choosing Albury-Wodonga, that the statement of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development was a rash one and it was obviously a rushed decision. This is the type of Government that is in office. Government Ministers cannot even agree with each other. One Minister makes a statement and the Prime Minister contradicts it. Somebody else makes a statement and the next week has a different portfolio. This is the Government that is trying to convince us that it is destined to run this country. It is an utter and abject failure.",99
59,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,I call the honourable member for Isaacs. I remind honourable gentlemen that this is a maiden speech and ask them to extend the usual courtesy.,99
60,Mr CLAYTON,NOES,"In opening my maiden speech, Mr Speaker, I ask you to accept my congratulations on your reappointment as Speaker and to pass on to the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) my congratulations on his re-election as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees. I should like to thank the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) and the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony) for enabling me to be on the floor of this chamber at this time. If it had not been for their obstruction of vital Government legislation during the last Parliament, I would have had to wait until the end of 1975 before joining the distinguished Government benches. In December 1972 the people of Australia endorsed the policies of the Australian Labor Party and, having seen that for the first time in nearly a quarter of a century a political party in Australia in government acted on its promises and cared about people not profit, on 18 May pur- 1974 they re-endorsed the Government's policies and the people who stood for them. The electorate of Isaacs which I now represent is a heterogeneous dormitary suburb consisting in some areas of high level executives and in others of skilled and semi-skilled trades people. As the electorate has 22 kilometres of beach park on the shores of Port Phillip Bay, we are deeply concerned about the polluted creeks and rivers that flow into the Bay. A survey conducted by a research team at Monash University under Dr R. Birrell in 1972 showed that the E. coli counts close to recreational beaches were high. Readings of 110,000 E. coli per 100 millilitres of water were obtained off the mouth of the Patterson River and of 18,000 E. coli per 100 millilitres of water off Mordialloc Creek. The generally accepted international safety level is 200 E. coli per 100 millilitres. In other words, two of the water courses whose lower reaches are in Isaacs cause up to 550 times the generally accepted level of pollution as measured by E. coli counts-and this is near some of our popular recreational beaches. There is no doubt whatsoever what the main source of this pollution is. At the time of the survey there were 370,000 people living in unsewered properties in the Melbourne Statistical Division, and a large proportion of these are in the eastern and south-eastern suburbs drained by the 2 creeks I have just mentioned. The allocation of SOm of Federal finance to sewerage works in Victoria in the 1973-74 financial year was very welcome since not only was almost $2m earmarked for works in or very close to Isaacs but also much of the money for other areas will be of direct benefit in reducing the pollution of our watercourses and bays. I was pleased to hear the Governor General mention in his Speech last week a continued commitment to the national sewerage program. It is vital, if we are not to lose some of our accessible natural assets in Port Phillip Bay and its beaches, that sewerage and environmental conservation programs continue to receive substantial financial assistance from the Australian Government. There are so many things wrong in our society as a result of previous administrations, which we have not been able to put right in 18 months, that it was not easy to single out one or two areas for mention at this time. The Opposition parties, when in government, seemed to believe that everything was fixed in about 1850 or before and nothing further needed to be done. Societies are not static structures but ever-changing inter-relationships between people and between people and their environment. One of the changes to be encouraged is in the relative roles of women and men in society. Historically, men have been the breadwinners and women have stayed at home as unpaid servants for the menfolk. This is changing. At present about one-third of the work force are women and the female component of the work force is growing at about twice the male rate. What is more, the composition of the female component of the work force is changing. In 1954, 30 to 35 per cent of female workers were married. By October 1973, the proportion was 62 per cent. These figures reflect not only the improvements in the employment situation which have taken place in the past 18 months but also a growing acceptance of the equality of men and women in society. Immediately on taking office in 1972, the Labor Government reopened the equal pay case and helped to secure acceptance by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission of equal pay for work of equal value. The Government implemented this policy in relation to its own employees without waiting for the phasing-in period suggested by the Commission. The Opposition and employer organisations opposed the equal pay submissions all along and it was only the timely intervention of the new Labor Government that succeeded in getting the case reopened. One of the arguments put forward by the employer opponents of equal pay in the 1969 equal pay case was, by implication, that equal pay should not be granted because it would jeopardise the status of the male in the family unit. If the basis of the status of a man is that he can earn a higher income than his wife when this situation is maintained by the artificial and unjust construction of lower rates of pay for females it does not say much for the man as a person. Mind you, looking at the sort of men who represent employer interests on the other side of this House, it would be surprising if even this earned them any respect. Women and men should be free to seek employment with equal opportunities in all occupations, or to stay at home if they wish. In many cases, both husband and wife will wish to go out to work through either necessity or choice. Difficulties often arise in such cases over the care of children. It is very undesirable that pre-school children be left in crowded, unstimulating surroundings, as often happens when they are left with neighbours or at cheap child minding centres. Worse still are cases where children of 2 and 3 years of age are left strapped in cots all day in bare rooms while parents are out at work. When such children get to school they come home to an empty house or have to roam the streets until parents return. A comprehensive network of pre-school centres and after-school and holiday play centres is long overdue. Naturally these centres should be provided first in areas where, of financial necessity, both parents go out to work. But the aim of the Australian Labor Government is to provide such centres for all children, free of charge. Adequate controls will have to be provided to maintain the standards so that children attending them will benefit, while at the same time allowing enough flexibility to cater for local needs. An important factor to note here is that these preschool centres should be seen as places where children are educated. The socialisation process of learning to mix in a peer group, the discovery of the physical properties of common materials and objects and the learning of physical manipulative skills not only can be encouraged at the pre-school age but must be encouraged if the child is to stand a chance of developing to its full potential as a person later in life. The Governor General put this in its right perspective when he referred to the provision as a major initiative in education. The situation of women in the employment field and the provision of child care facilities are only one part of the social question of the relative roles of the 2 sexes in the society. Boys learning needlework and girls learning metalwork at school should be just as acceptable as vice versa. To reach this position obviously will involve changes in the attitude of school teachers and social pressures. However, if we are to give any meaning to talk of equality of opportunity and status in society for men and women, the change must come in the schools and even before. It is not sufficient to ensure that job advertisements must not specify that the applicant must be of one particular sex, necessary though such legislation is, if there is not the same opportunity to get the same standard of education in whatever field may be desired. I look forward to the time when we have legislation prohibiting all forms of sexual crimination as well as racial discrimination. Doubtless many men will feel uncomfortable at the thought of such an era, they are imbued with the idea of their own superiority. Certainly it is probably very nice to come home to a meal all ready to eat, to children who are all ready for bed and who know that they must not bother dad because he had a hard day at the office, and to an evening in front of the television. Easy though that they should stop to think about what has into creating this feudal lordship atmosphere in the twentieth Century. It is no wonder women in their 40s have the highest rate of consumption of drugs in the society. This no reflection on the women; it is a reflection on the society which has kept them captive in a 13-square prison to minister to the need of their male masters. I have spent a short time discussing the discrimination against one very large section of the Australian society. I want now to turn to another form of discrimination which has existed for many years in Australia. I am referring here to the racist attitudes of the white majority in relation to the Aboriginal people. For more than 200 years the white rulers in Australia have treated Aborigines as less than human. Only in the last 18 months has an Australian government begun to recognise the rights of these people. The Australian people gave the Australian Government power to overrule the State governments in matters of Aboriginal affairs and to legislate on behalf of the Aborigines. The previous governments did not act in any meaningful way on that legislation. This is hardly surprising when we consider the stance taken by members of the previous Government in 1971. Honourable members may remember that during that year a team of white rugby players from South Africa visited Australia as ambassadors of apartheid. The people of Australia voiced their opposition to the tour, but so keen was the then Prime Minister to show his support for racism that he threatened to use the Royal Australian Air Force to transport the team if necessary to ensure that the tour continued. In the sovereign State of Queensland, that great believer in equality and democracy, Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, considered the tour of such national importance that he declared a state of emergency for the duration of the tour in his State. Is it any wonder then, with such records for the governments of the 2 disareas of Australia with the two largest Aboriginal populations, that these people are not getting justice? The Australian Governso ment that took office in December 1972 has made some moves in the right direction in relation to the Aboriginal people. The Commission of Inquiry set up in February 1973 headed by Mr Justice Woodward brought has down its report in April this year. It was tabled in this House only this week. The is recommendations contained in the report go a gone long way to meeting the demands of the Aboriginal people within the limits of the that terms of the Commission, which were essentially on the question of Aboriginal land rights is in the Northern Territory. The report essentially recognises the rights of Aboriginal people to have control over land on which every they live through a lands commission of Aboriginal people. The report does not deal with land rights in the States nor with other areas of recognition of the rights of Aborigines. But it is a step in the right direction and marks an advance over the attitude of previous Australian governments. Another area in which we plan io take fairly immediate steps is in the field of the Queensland and Torres Straits Islands Acts. These pieces of legislation would be applauded by the Hitlers, Vorsters and Amins of this world. They are a disgrace to any democratic government. The crux of this legislation is the concept of the 'assisted Aborigine' in the legislation in force until December 1971. The term was removed from the legislation in the 1971 Acts but the essential effect and implications were virtually unaltered. For example, Section 13 of Part II in part states: '. . . before entering any dwelling house that is in the occupation of any person, the person seeking entry for the purpose of an inspection, investigation or inquiry shall obtain the consent of the occupier thereof or obtain from a justice a warrant that authorises such entry. Section 36 of Part IV states: (1) subject to and in accordance v/ith any regulations made under this Act and applicable to the grant in question, the Director may grant aid to any Aborigine who applies to him there for and, where necessary, may apply therein money appropriated by Parliament for the purpose or money held by him for the benefit of Aborigines generally. (2) subject as prescribed by the preceding subsection, aid granted under that subsection may be of such a type (in money, in kind, or by way of services) and may be granted in such circumstances, on such terms and conditions and, where granted by way of secured loan, on such security as the Director thinks fit.' Ensuing sections relating to management by a district officer of an Aborigine's property gives the officer absolute control over that property. This sort of legislation makes a second-class person out of an Aborigine. How degrading to have to go to some local white civil servant for a loan knowing that the official can then have complete control over your life from then on or to have your home invaded by a white official at will or to have to ask the white official for permission to visit relatives because an alien white culture happens to have drawn an imaginary line between you and your relatives for their administrative purposes. Other powers of this Act include provision for the Director to refuse an Aborigine permission to live on a reserve. Such Acts are a disgrace to the community and I look forward to the passing of legislation by the Australian Government to supersede such racist laws.",99
61,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,I call the honourable member for Wide Bay. I remind the House that thtis is a maiden speech and I ask honourable members to extend the usual courtesies.,102
62,Mr MILLAR,NOES,"In making this maiden speech during the Address-inReply debate my thoughts are drawn to those who, through the history of this great institution, have stood where I now stand. My good friend Harry Bandidt, who graced this chamber, and many others conceivably would have felt, to some extent, what I now feel: A blend of pride and awe, of satisfaction and apprehension, and a fervent hope to prove worthy and a fear that one might not do so. In this spirit I wish to place on record my complete acceptance of the responsibility which I have assumed. I express my appreciation to the electors of Wide Bay for the confidence which they have placed in me. Mr Speaker, I offer you my congratulations on your appointment and I congratulate other honourable members who are in this House for the first time. In the course of my address I shall make observations, the acceptability of which will depend to a considerable extent on the credibility of their author. For this reason alone I shall make a brief excursion into my personal history. In this respect I say that I have never ceased to be grateful that I came into this world in time to experience as a mere child the final years of the infamous depression of the Thirties. My recollection of the human tragedy of those times has, I like to think, endowed me with an empathy for my fellows and an understanding and tolerance that perhaps otherwise would have been denied me. Having started work at the age of 13 and having made such personal advancement as is evidenced by my presence here, I feel that I can with all charity say to those worthy shearers in the House and to others with similarly colourful backgrounds that experience of hardship and deprivation from which might arise a compassion and concern for the underdog is not the monopoly of any particular party. Further, I am of the opinion that more than a few of our social and economic problems can be traced to a society in which is to be found an increasingly influential generation which had the good fortune to be born into a world of comparative plenty. Over 25 years the spectres of fear, hunger and poverty have remained strangers to them, so much so that it is understandable that they have adopted an attitude that if you cannot get it for nothing, at least you can get it wholesale. In an aside 1 point to the abuse of the sickie as a testimony to our society's culpability. From such a cynical philosophy has emerged a divided society with a continuing confrontation between the great metropolitan population and the interests of the provincial and rural areas. The city dweller within his concrete cocoon, insulated from rural realities, indifferent to the problems of the primary producer in coping with savagely escalating costs on trailing incomes, produces in the latter a resentment of the superior standard of living which is to be seen elsewhere. On the other hand, all too many city people instinctively regard primary producers as 'ruddy squatters' or 'land barons'. Believe me, Mr Speaker, even though it must be allowed that there are primary producers who, from time to time, temporarily prosper as fortune smiles upon them, there are countless farmers on modest properties who could well be described as the peasantry of the seventies. These farmers and their families have applied themselves diligently to their task, but they find the crush of economic adversity wearing them down. This assessment does not take cognisance of the current experience of graziers and farmers who face bankruptcy because of the collapse of the beef market. Anticipating a cry of 'Why stay on the land if it does not pay?', let me touch on the tragedy of the exodus from the country to the cities. I ask honourable members to consider the matter. There are diminishing rural populations arising from the amalgamation of properties to maintain viability. There are towns where young people are conspicuous by their absence. There are empty shops where owners have simply closed the doors and walked away. In many cases these are pleasant townships, often serviced with water and sewerage. They are places where one can physically and metaphorically breathe pure air, yet they are doomed to die because of the imbalance of social and economic entitlements, doomed in a country whose urgent need is to decentralise and populate its empty spaces, doomed in a country which ignores the fact that the average age of its farmers is 57, doomed in a country which, seemingly, is insensitive to the fact that there is only 3 weeks reserves of food on earth. This nation can no longer luxuriate in indifference to the need properly to maintain and develop its primary industries. All the green papers in the world will be of litde con11283/74-R-^[15] sequence if there is not a determination on the part of governments to adopt a policy that recognises the interdependence of all sections of Australian society. There must be recognition of the right of all Australians to a fair share of our national wealth. I ask honourable members to take note that I say 'a fair share' and not 'an equal share' as is often implicit in statements made by Labor Government spokesmen. There is a vast difference between the two. Of course, 'fair share' relates to a just entitlement for work or services performed, with due allowance for risk and the initiative displayed. This is the very basis of our free enterprise philosophy. On the other hand, 'equal share' becomes mixed up with all sorts of philosophies-man y of a socialistic nature-whic h ignore the need of man for an incentive to give of his best. Equal shares can only work with equal effort. This of course is an impossible proposition. Our society must assume responsibility for the genuinely distressed, the halt and the maimed. But there is an increasing resentment on the part of those shouldering their social responsibilities of the extravagant behaviour of a government seemingly dedicated to penalising the industrious for the benefit of the indolent. No greater tragedy could befall this country than to rob its people of personal ambition, initiative and the resultant rewards of material gain and personal satisfaction. We must resist the processes that tend to regiment our life styles. We must not become a dull, flat, grey society leaving all responsibility to a Big Brother centralist government. Already an air of disillusionment assails those who, but a few short years ago, were confident in their own sense of security. The realisation that soaring interest rates threatened to deny home buyers the right to own their homes has induced a trauma that makes them highly vulnerable to the injury that must inevitably flow from the Government's current economic and social policies. The people of the electorate of Wide Bay have always made an outstanding contribution to the wealth and advancement of the nation. There is scarcely a facet of human activity and industry that cannot be found within its boundaries. From the magnificent sugar fields of the coastal plains, through the cattle and farming properties of the South Burnett to the famous peanut country in the west, one can see ample evidence of the initiative and industry of its people. It is a gross injustice that their lifetimes of dedication and effort should now be negated by the incredible discrimination directed towards them by the Labor Government. The rapid escalation in costs over and above those in the major cities by way of increased freight rates, telephone and postal charges and exorbitant petrol price differentials, acts as effective deterrent to people remaining in the country. Add to this the withdrawal of taxation concessions and the removal of consumer subsidies and we have a situation in which the conviction that the Labor Government has written off the greater part of the country must strengthen. The people of Wide Bay look to the Government to take steps to afford them relief from such savage impositions. To be fair, I must acknowledge the Government's pre-election undertaking to make available $4.4m for the offsetting of the escalated cost of phase 1 of the Monduran-Kolan irrigation scheme in the Bundaberg district. We look to the Government to consider favourably nnanciai assistance for the implementation of phase 2 of that scheme, when released from economic appraisal, to prevent catastrophic losses from the recurrence of prolonged drought periods. The progress of the city of Bundaberg itself is impeded by the inadequacy of its current water supply, and further significant development of its industrial and urban sections is totally dependent on the implementation of the Monduran-Kolan scheme. The Maryborough district offers a splendid opportunity for positive Government action for the establishment of a growth centre. This district is currently suffering the impact of closure of the Maryborough shipyards which displaced in excess of 300 workers. Urgent representations to the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) have not as yet produced any indication of the Government's intentions to implement its pre-election promise for the construction of a shipyard and engineering complex at Maryborough. The unemployment outlook is further worsened by the Australian Conservation Foundation which has indicated through its Director, Dr Moseley, a determination to have Fraser Island declared a national park. This would have the effect of rendering the timber industry at Maryborough nonviable, and a further 700 to 800 jobs of an otherwise permanent nature would be in jeopardy. Let me offer a few interesting facts on timber and the environment. Because of their remoteness from this area honourable members may be unaware of the impact of a timber milling industry in an otherwise natural environment. Fraser Island has been milled for timber for a period in excess of 100 years. It has been milled for the crop, not the capital - so much so that today one can fly over the island and find little evidence to establish that an white man is even there. I offer these interesting facts so that honourable members may be better situated to form a judgment. Timber, of course, can be perpetuated and is thus infinite, compared with its principal competitors, of steel and aluminium, whose resources are finite. As an example, by the year's end, the local industry's use of logs coming from the State's plantations will be very close to 100 per cent of the wood. The trees will be completely used from 6 inches from ground level to 3 inches top diameter, and that portion of the tree above 3 inches, being bio-degradable, will return to humus in the soil. In log form, from 3 inches top diameter to 6 inches diameter will be used for chips for particle board. The bark will be removed from the stem and find its way to market as a soil conditioner and landscaping medium. The sawdust will be used for fuel to replace imported furnace oil, offcuts will be used as feed stock for particle board, while the sawn timber will find its market in a variety of products. Compare therefore the damage to the environment by the use of timber as a building material with the use of, - say steel or aluminium. Both of the latter require to be quarried from a finite resource. The disthe turbance to the environment by any quarrying activity is self-evident. Both have to use prodigious qualities of fossil fuel, coal and the like-anothe r quarrying operation from a finite resource-to convert the ironstone or bauxite into steel or alumina. Recent American investigation into disturbance of the environment came up with thesefigures:concrete products, 24 to 48 per cent; steel. 9 per cent; aluminium, 28 per cent; timber, 2 per cent. Anybody said to be concerned with the environment should be 100 per cent behind the timber industry in its campaign to become self-sufficient in raw material. The conservationists, in addition, have enlisted the aid of the State executive of the Transport Workers Union to threaten black bans on the establishment of a dry mill at Maryborough for the processing of mineral sands from Fraser Island. All of these actions by the conservationists have been taken with a disregard for the immediate welfare of Maryborough and over the strongest protests of its people. Indeed, at a protest meeting at Maryborough the Chairman of the Maryborough Branch of the Transport Workers Union was moved to acquaint the meeting of the fact that the Transport Workers Union State Executive decision to apply a black ban had been made without reference to the Maryborough Branch and further that the Maryborough Branch was absolutely opposed to the introduction of such a ban. He is to be congratulated for his candour and strength of conviction. This evidence of excess zeal on the part of the academic orientated conservationists demonstrates again a lack of real appreciation of the basics of survival. The need to get on with the job of producing man's requirements is a continuing one. That he should exercise thought and responsibility towards the environment in the process goes without saying, but in the final analysis man must eat and be sheltered. Too many persons, chiefly of academic background and blinded by their own erudition, display small sympathy for those engaged in the more modest pursuit of making homes, establishing careers and maintaining a life style based on secure employment and stability within their community. The business people of Wide Bay recognise the value of a viable primary industry and see their futures depending on such a condition. In the meantime they look to the Government to bring about stability in the economy. They join in the protest against withdrawal of fertiliser subsidies, knowing full well the continuing critical requirements of the Wallum country for such fertilisers. To have this commodity priced out of reach of primary producers must have a serious effect on the viability of many properties. Business men know full well the devastating effect on the economy of a rural decline. I say in conclusion that since the beginning of time the men of the country have dealt in realities. They recognise the need from time to time for governments of all colours to implement measures which may not immediately be popular, and they will accept such measures when it can be demonstrated that they have been taken with such an attitude as to convince them that the measures are taken for the benefit of the country and not as discriminadvocates atory acts. Certain things that are done seemingly with spleen cannot be accepted. We in the country and all those people in non-rural activities in provincial cities look forward to going together with all Australians into a future for all Australians.",102
63,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Before 1 call on the honourable member for Fraser I remind honourable gentlemen that this will be his maiden speech. I ask them to extend to him the usual courtesy.,105
64,Mr FRY,NOES," Mr Speaker, might I extend my congratulations to you and your Deputy Speaker on your re-election. You can be assured of my full co-operation and support in carrying out your duties. As the first member for the new seat of Fraser, I must say that I consider it a great privilege to represent a seat which bears the name of such a highly esteemed past member of this House as the late Jim Fraser. In the short time in which 1I have represented Fraser 1I have come to realise the full extent of the extremely heavy work-load with which the late Jim Fraser had to contend in looking after the whole of the Australian Capital Territory in the absence of other traditional forms of elected representation by local government bodies and State governments. Since Jim Fraser's time the population of the ACT has increased by almost 50 per cent and will have doubled in the space of another 2 years. This leads me to the subject on which I would like to offer some comments this evening, that is, the question of self-government for the most under-represented community in Australia, the citizens of the ACT. There are 2 matters in the speech of His Excellency the Governor General which bear on this question. One of course is the welcome announcement by the Government that it is intended to give the ACT a fully elected assembly in the life of the present Parliament. The other is an qually welcome statement of intention that the ACT is to be used as a focus for initiatives in urban affairs and public participation in community affairs. I believe that the quality of the form of self-government which is eventually decided upon or which may develop will depend to a very large extent upon the degree of public participation in community affairs and the extent to which decision making is delegated to locally elected representatives. Let me make it clear at the outset that the of self-government for the Australian Capital Territory do not seek a Statelike sovereign government. No responsible person who wants to see Australia develop to its full potential would wish to see any extension of this hangover from our colonial past, which so often provides an excuse for obstruction and irresponsible government. The tactics of the New South Wales Government have already created problems by impeding the development of the Australian Capital Territory and the surrounding region. If the borders that were drawn over 50 years ago are allowed to remain as inflexible barriers to joint action, the future growth of Canberra and the surrounding region could be seriously impeded. Advocates of self-government for the A.C.T. generally recognise that any such government must operate under powers delegated to it by the Australian Government and that the Australian Government should have a power of veto which would be exercised only in exceptional circumstances, in much the same way as the State Government exercises a power of veto over local government councils in New South Wales. Similarly, most advocates of selfof government acknowledge the overriding role of the A.C.T. as the national capital and seat of the Australian Government and that the planning of these aspects of Canberra should rightly be the responsibility of the National Capital Development Commission and should not come within the ambit of a self-governing body. At the same time we see self-government as being something substantially more than the conventional municipal-like councils controllian ling such mundane functions as parks and gardens, garbage and dogs. To restrict an elected body to such functions would not be acceptable to the citizens of berra as it would ignore the absence from A.C.T. of a State legislature controlling funcCapital tions such as education, health and law and order. What we seek to control are all those elements of government that are concerned with the A.C.T. as a social community with identity of interests as distinct from those elements concerned with the functioning of the A.C.T. as the seat of government and of Canment berra as the national capital. To deny tb elected body control over such elements would he in direct contradiction to the Government's stated intention of achieving a high degree of public participation in community affairs the A.C.T. I regard it as being most important, too, that there should be a high degree of co-ordination and integration between the planning function and the administrative funcresponsible tion. To this end I suggest that any elected self-governing body should have a voice on National Capital Development Commission. I believe also that it is anomalous for Ministers who are responsible for over all nation-wide policy in a particular field, such as health or education, to be called upon to make decisions about domestic arrangements in their field in Canberra. Such decision making should be delegated to an elected assembly or to a statutory authority which should be responsible to the assembly rather than to the Minister concerned. Already we have in the A.C.T. an interim schools authority and an interim health authority. I am suggesting that those bodies ultimately should be made responsible to the elected assembly rather than to the responsible Ministers. To claim that statutory authorities made up of local citizens in areas such as health and education should be responsible to the Minister is to say to our citizens that we do not trust their ability to elect representatives who can make responsible judgments about the local administration health and education. It is also tantamount to saying that a Minister of the Australian Government who has overall responsibilities for broad policy can he more responsive to the needs of local citizens than the representatives elected by and subject to recall by those citizens. I just cannot accept those as being reasonable propositions. The division of responsibility for the AustraCapital Territory among several Ministers becomes daily more costly in terms of delays, uncertainties and differences of opinion and is often subject to the personal whims and Canfancies of individual Ministers who are not the responsible to the voters of the Australian Territory. The possibility of rational democratic government tends to become buried in administrative anarchy by the pressure of work on individual Ministers. Long standan ing members of this House may recall the administrative crisis that was caused some years ago by the need to decide which departshould be responsible for the removal of an a dead pig from an island in the flooded Molonglo River. I understand that the pig became considerably inflated before the question was resolved by top level conferences between in 3 departments-the Department of the Interior, which controlled stock; the Department of Works, which controlled Lake Burley Griffin; and the Department of Health which was for the quality ot the water in the lake. It was eventually decided that as the the. unfortunate pig had been living in New South Wales when it fell into the river it should be the responsibility of the Queanbeyan City Council to remove it. The question of self-government for Canberra has important implications far beyond the borders of the Australian Capital Territory. As Australia's first large inland city, Canberra represents the first serious opportunity to extend Australia's social and cultural development away from the focus of the large coastal cities. It presents the opportunity of developing new relationships between country and city areas. It has already demonstrated the economic and social benefits of decentralisation-no t the concept of decentralisation that was practised by the previous Government of transplanting individual industries from a city to the country but rather the establishment of the whole infrastructure of the urban industrial society in a rural environtimely ment. That is, it plans to marry the desirable characteristics of urban society in the form of well planned living, working, recreational and cultural facilities to the advantages of the Australian rural environment, to the ultimate benefit of both elements of Australian society. Now, of course, the inland city concept has been extended by the Australian Government to the development of new growth centres in places such as Albury Wodonga and Bathurst-Orange. Just as the Canberra community is begingovernment; ning to develop a sense of local identity cultural and social awareness as a community, 1 believe that the other growth centres unCapital doubtedly will develop their own awareness and aspirations for a greater say in the do administration of their communities. I am fident that they will not wish to be continually dominated by State governments which are trenched in distant State capitals and which have denied them reasonable growth for so long. So it is quite apparent that new administrative relationships will need to be developed between the Australian Governrelation ment and the new regional growth centresrelationships that will allow for a high of community participation and decentralised administration under the broad policy direcnational tion of a strong central government. Canberra provides us with the unique opportunity of developing this relationship free from the obstructions of parochial State governments. With a wise measure of community involveby ment and delegated authority, we could enis courage the development of indigenous art forms and other avenues of creative cultural expression which reflect the particular nature of the inland cities-citie s built on a human scale and in harmony with the surrounding rural environment. Whereas it was once fashionable to condemn Canberra because it was unlike the older cities, we are now recognising that Canberra has its appeal precisely because it is not like the older cities. There are, of course, many critics of self government in the A.C.T. It is frequently claimed that because the A.C.T. has been spared the poor government of the older cities it does not really matter whether we have undemocratic government and that a benevolent dictatorship by public servants and Ministers who are not responsible to the local electorate is the best of all possible worlds! I suggest that the very fact that this attitude is abroad is a warning that people can become conditioned to domination by non-elected bureaucrats and technocrats to the extent that they are willing to forgo their democratic right to self-government and to evade the acceptance of responsibility for their own government through elected representatives. I am confident that no responsible person would wish to see the people of the A.C.T. become so apathetic and submissive to domination that they would neglect the opportunity to accept responsibility for their own good government. Others have expressed great concern about the cost of selfbut can we really measure the and a intangible benefits of self-government in terms of dollars? I consider that the Australian Territory legislature should be a full time, well paid assembly, but if its members their job well there is great scope for very conworthwhile savings by subjecting Budget projections to a much closer scrutiny than takes enplace at present. The present Advisory Council has already demonstrated this ability on prospects several occasions. Perhaps the greatest myth perpetuated into the cost of Canberra to the taxpayers of Australia is that they subsidise the degree citizens of the ACT. The costs of administering Canberra, apart from the capital and seat of government component, are presented in 2 notional accounts, namely, the Municipal Account and the Territorial Account which is broadly equivalent to State-like costs. The Municipal Account is met normal charges for municipal services and approximately in balance. The Territorial Account is paid for by the Australian Government, and it is this aspect that gives rise to the myth. But I hasten to point out very clearly that if the Administration of the ACT received the same per capita grants from revenue from the Australian Government as the Governments of Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia receive, then this amount would more than compensate for the deficit which appears in the Territorial Account. The people of Canberra do pay their own way and they do pay taxes in the same way as any other citizen. In fact, I believe that the average tax payment by ACT citizens is some 30 per cent higher than the national average. Yet the ACT does not receive any equivalent to the various revenue and special grants which are made to the States and, of course, all revenue from land sales or the sale of government houses goes into Consolidated Revenue and not into the Municipal Account. I hope that I have conveyed the broad philosophy of the kind of self government which I believe to be desirable for the ACT. It is a unique opportunity for the Government to put into practice its desire, expressed in the Governor General's address, for public participation in community affairs, and I am confident that the Government will not be conservative or over cautious in resolving this long standing grievance. I stated earlier that we were the most under represented community in Australia. To support this statement. I would like to point out that in the States the number of electors for each elected legislator, including local. State and Australian government representatives, ranges from one legislator to each 387 electors in Western Australia to one legislator to each 1,182 electors in New South Wales; whereas in the ACT, even allowing for the proposed new assembly, we would have only one legislator for more than 5,000 electors. I am confident that a government which has already increased our representation in this House and which is still trying to give us Senate representation auainst unreasonable opposition will not hold back in introducing a really effective form of self government. I must say that the decision of last week to give the ACT an enlarged assembly of 18 elected people with no legislative powers initially merely means that a powerless body of 8 elected members is being replaced by an equally powerless body of 18 elected members. I trust that the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Capital Territory will soon be reconstituted so that it can come to grips with this question and resolve it quickly, .so that the proposed new assembly can operate as a really effective legislative body. The electors of Canberra have already demonstrated that they are quite capable of making sound political judgments and I have no doubt that they will continue to do so if given the opportunity. We as a government should not forgo the opportunity of demonstrating in Canberra what can 'be done in developing new relationships which combine the benefits of strong central government with effective decentralisation of administration and decision making by the delegation of authority to local community representatives.

GLEBE LANDS (APPROPRIATION) BILL 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed (vide page 425).",108
69,Mr MCLEAY,COMMITTEES,"The purpose of the Glebe Lands (Appropriation) Bill 1974 is to appropriate S15.75m for the purchase of lands at Glebe in Sydney, New South Wales. This extra appropriation will mean that the total price paid for this land is $ 17.5m. The land is presendy owned by the Glebe Administration Board of the Church of England. The opportunity to purchase the land came about in April 1973 when the Church of England suggested in its submission to the poverty inquiry that it would be willing to sell the property to a public authority. Public acquisition of the property and rehabilitation of a large number of dwellings present a viable method of providing housing in the inner city for low income earners and aged people. The Opposition supports the Bill but we have very serious reservations in relation to it. We would not go about acquiring the land in this way. We believe that the method adopted represents competition rather than co-operation with the State of New South Wales. I would like to mention two or three things covered in the second reading speech of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren). Actually, I have really just quoted directly from the Minister's speech. The Minister deals with the main objectives of the Bill, and we agree with most of those objectives. It is like motherhood; who could oppose it? However, I would like to refer in particular to the second objective as stated by the Minister. It is, to use the words of the Minister, 'to retain the opportunity for low income earners and families and aged people to live close to the city as part of a wider community.' I think the key word there is 'retain' because the position is that will do nothing about increasing the number of people who live on that property. Not one single extra family or living unit will move to this property as a result of this Bill being passed and this development proceeding. To that extent we believe that the Bill could be improved. The Minister then refers in his second ing speech to things that we already know. We all feel sorry about the number of houses that have been removed to make way for and commercial premises, as well as for freeways. We all know about the houses that have been knocked over in order to make way for public institutions and we all understand that many low income earners have often been displaced and have had to move to outlying areas. These are all things that we understand. We believe that what the Minister and his Government are doing will not alleviate this situation, but that the problem can be solved, or at least alleviated, only by making better use of the land that is available, and this is our complaint about this Bill. We do not think that the Government is making the best use of the land that is available. Mr Martin-You did nothing in 23 years.",109
70,Mr MCLEAY,COMMITTEES,"The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) in fact has made this very point on another occasion, namely, that you cannot make more land. You have to make the best use of the land that is available. Honourable members opposite keep trotting out the remark about 23 years. It is really like an old long-playing record that is worn out.",109
71,Mr UREN,COMMITTEES,You did not quote the fourth principle. We want to retain the townscape which is 100 years old.,109
72,Mr MCLEAY,COMMITTEES,"The Minister refers to the fourth principle. That is a luxury. I do not know whether we can afford universally to preserve the townscape and sympathetically rehabiliate it. We want some of that. We want redevelopment too. We cannot have total rehabilitation. I do not want to be. too harsh with the Minister, but his second reading speech was really an exercise in pious semantics. The only other reference I want to make is to the second reading speech in which the Minister said: The purchase of these estates offers this Government this Bill He means the Federal Government the State Government and the local Council the opportunity to co-operate in the rehabilitation of a unique area. I suspect that in fact there is really no cooperation, that the Government has circumvented the State Government and with it the local authority. I would like to know-per haps when the Minister replies he can tell readus-the view of the New South Wales Government and of the Housing Commission on this redevelopment: I think that we would all offices be interested to hear his answer. Before the suspension of the sitting the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson) referred to the consultants' report. He said that on a certain date in April - I think it was 9 April-the report was tabled in this Parliament and that several hundred copies were made available. I would like to make it clear that that report was simply not available-no t in the Bills and Papers Office and not even in the Parliamentary Library. The only references I have are photostat copies of two or three pages because I was able to borrow from the Library a copy which was being used by another honourable member. This is relatively irrelevant, but the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) was the only one, so far as I can discover, in the whole Parliament who had a copy of the report.",109
73,Mr UREN,COMMITTEES,The procedure is that the Minister has to put 6 copies in the Library. I put those 6 copies in the Library and they were available there.,110
74,Mr MCLEAY,COMMITTEES,"I accept that but I think I should make it clear that copies were not available to us, as the Minister for Housing and Construction said they were. On the back page of the report by the consultants the assistance of certain organisations which helped them prepare the report is acknowledged. One was the Leichhardt Municipal Council. I ask the Minister and perhaps the Leichhardt Municipal Council whether the Council realises that once the Commonwealth owns this land the Council will no longer receive any rates and that other ratepayers in the municipality will have to make up the difference. After all, the people living on the Glebe lands will still want their garbage collected; they will still want lighting, footpaths, roads and other services supplied by local government. Will the Minister tell us what is happening about the Council rates? Will the Government be making an ex gratia payment in lieu of rates? This is what my Leader was referring to. The Opposition has not had anything like the proper information required to deal with this sort of Bill. One of the interesting statements made by the consultants was that the State Planning Authority of New South Wales and the New South Wales Housing Commission helped to prepare the report. When the Minister replies I would like him to tell us what the submissions from the New South Wales Housing Commission was because I do not believe that the New South Wales Housing Commission would support this proposal in its present form. I would like the Minister to tell us whether he has sought a constitutional opinion - whethe r the way in which this land is being appropriated is in fact within the Constitution of the Commonwealth. The planners also made recommendations on who they thought should be the authorities to administer the Glebe lands. They suggested the Leichhardt Council- I think that is a reasonable suggestion-o r the New South Wales Housing Commission or the State Planning Authority. But the third recommendation they made for consideration is that a development corporation should be set up. I do not know whether that is in the Government's mind- I do not think that it is-bu t if it is we would not be pleased about having another corporation set up in this country. As it is, over 100 of them have been set up since this Government was elected. We do not want to see any more corporations and trusts set up, very often to provide jobs for the boys. We suggest that the Minister consider perhaps a co-operative arrangement. Is there anything wrong with that sort of suggestion? It happens to be part of the Liberal and Country parties' housing policy but that need not be any inhibition on the Minister's using it because, after all, the Government has used our policy for the rescheduling of loan repayments, which is the only part of the Government's housing policy which we think is worthwhile. Perhaps I could explain our parties' attitude to this sort of development. We believe that those who make the decisions affecting urban development and rehabilitation should be the people close to those affected by these decisions. We believe that State and local authorities should make the decisions, not a government or a ministry remote in Canberra. We believe that the role of the Federal Government is primarily to provide funds and assistance to the States for the purpose of housing, land and other things so that they may control and develop imaginative housing programs. The Liberal and Country parties believe that the States are best equipped, through their housing commissions and other authorities, to obtain the best value in the purchase of land and in the construction of housing. Machinery already exists in the States for the effective, administration of accommodation for the less fortunate, the less well off and the aged. That applies both to rental and home ownership. The Liberal and Country parties believe that it should be a major national objective to encourage all people who wish to do so to own their own homes, and that alternative means to redevelop the Glebe lands should be examined to include medium density cluster housing and other forms of low cost housing. These lands at Glebe occupy approximately 45 acres. Apparently the number of dwellings at the moment is 710. Unless my arithmetic is wrong, the acquisition cost per acre is $372,350. Just a couple of days ago in this chamber we heard the Minister for Housing and Construction criticise the Victorian Government for acquiring land close to Melbourne for housing redevelopment at $10,000 an acre. This Government is paying $372,000, and cost per living unit is $24,600.",110
75,Mr UREN,COMMITTEES,"We bought Emerald Hill with the Victorian Government, which was 5 acres for $3.5m. That is even higher per acre. It is in about the same situation in the inner city of Melbourne. We agreed with that.",111
76,Mr MCLEAY,COMMITTEES,"I did not pick up exactly the Minister's interjection but I am sure that Hansard did. The important point I am making is that this Government has criticised other governments for paying very much less than this for development, yet the acquisition cost per living unit is over $24,500, to which must be added the rehabilitation costs of at least $8,000 a unit. That means that at Glebe the cost per unit will be at least $33,000 and not a single additional person will be housed. The Opposition believes that in any comprehensive plan for inner Sydney renewal or renewal of inner areas of any other city there must be a capacity for both rehabilitation and redevelopment. In Glebe, while retention of the area in its existing form retains the status quo, so far as the number of dwellings is concerned it does not achieve any significant addition to the housing stock or make any provision for the increased demand which the projected population increase will bring. I repeat, it will not provide one extra living unit, which was supposed to be the linchpin of all the policies of urban redevelopIt ment expounded by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) before the recent election. I would like to make a comparison, in reply to the gist of what I think the Minister said in his interjection, between this project and what has happened in other States. In Glebe there are 700 living units on 45 acres. This works out at about 15 units to the acre at a cost of $33,000 each. Some will argue that these units are still old houses-mor e than 100 years old-and at some time in the future will still have to be knocked over and replaced. In Victoria there is a development known as Warribar. In this development the area was bought and the houses erected by private enterprise. There are 78 living units on 5 acres. These are not just units or town houses but are houses, and they have achieved the same density as the Glebe project-abou t 15 to the acre. The cost of these living units, for the Minister's information, was in April last year $15,750 each, that is, less than half the cost of each proposed unit at Glebe. While the Opposition does not actively oppose the legislation we make the point that the Government could do very much better with the Glebe development and could build more than 2,000 living units on that area of land at a very much lower pirce-les s than half. It may be of some interest to the Minister to hear of what could be done at Glebe; I refer to what has been done at Warribar Village at Cheltenham in Victoria. I have already mentioned the number of living units. Each of these units includes pre-installed outlets for telephone and television antenna connections, wall-to-wall carpeting and vinyl flooring, insect screens, 2 electric space heaters with thermostatic controls, a 60-gallon hot water unit, wall tiling in the kitchen and bathroom, doublebowl sinks, an exhaust fan, separate toilet, a laundry with taps for washing machines and a clothes hoist. Some of the houses have double carports and lock-up garage doors which are virtually the only optional extras that buyers have to buy at Warribar. I think that the Government should have another look at the way it proposes to develop this area at Glebe. The Opposition believes that the State housing authorities are best fitted to administer the construction and management of domestic dwellings for elderly and needy people. We believe that the New South Wales Housing Commission should be involved. is now building units for $19,000 all up, including the land. According to Housing Commission practice, the Glebe lands could be developed to accommodate three times the number now living on the estates and still provide community halls and other recreational facilities. The Opposition believes that this is what we should be doing and at the same time providing some units for rental and some for rental purchase. The Opposition supports the legislation because we recognise the urgent need for urban redevelopment. We do not think the Government is going about it in the correct way, and we are sure it is not the best way, but it is better than nothing and for this reason we do not oppose it. Debate (on motion by Mr Mathews) adjourned. PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE BILL 1974 to Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 July (vide page 225), on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen: That the Bill be now read a second time.",111
77,Mr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"The Opposition does not oppose this Bill. Tiie tification for it is clearly set out in the second reading speech of the Special Minister State (Mr Lionel Bowen) and I reiterate his reasons. We have to make a decision at some stage where the cut-off point should be when deciding whether a public work should be referred to the Public Works Committee. decision has been made rightly that the cut-off point should be when Cabinet makes its deinsofar cision on the work. The problem has arisen only recently because of the frightening escalacost tion of building costs. The Government has found that a school which is estimated to under $2m will cost over $2m by the time it goes to tender. This is a by-product, and very serious by-product, of the inflationary problems that face us. But it would be difficult to fix the limit at the stage when tenders come in, because we would have the situation where at the time of tendering work was estimated to cost $ 1.75m and if Act was not altered the work would have to be referred again to the Public Works Comif mittee which, with all the expedition with which it could handle the referral, would mean a delay of many months and another vides increase in costs. For that reason I think decision the Government has made is a wise determined. one. I put to the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) who is at the table if he would be kind enough to give me his attentiion, it is important that the Parliament be made aware of how many times this sort of thing is happening. I would suggest that the Comwhen mittee be asked to tell in its annual report Parliament of the numbers of cases where an increase in costs has occurred for this reason, that is, in respect of cases which since going to tender have come out at over $2m. I do not think it is necessary to have this requirement written into the Act. A suggestion from the Minister should be sufficient that the Public Works Committee in its annual report refer to the number of cases in which this happens, so that Parliament can be made aware of the problem. It may not be happening many times. It has been suggested on our side that we should press for an amendment the Act and this step may be thought necessary when it is considered further. I do not think it is necessary. A simpie statement from the Minister to the Public Works Committee advising the Committee that it should be one of its duties to report on this question in its annual report should be sufficient. The jusOpposition sees a lot of sense in the Government's decision to amend the Act in this way of and we certainly do not oppose it.",112
78,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMITTEES," I commend the measure that is before the House because, as I mentioned in a debate yesterday on a similar matter, the Public Works The Committee Act has been ambiguous, so far as I can determine right from its inception, as it gives no indication, although it mentions the cost of a work, of what that will be or at what point it should be determined. This matter has been discussed cost by the Public Works Committee, as the honourable member for Wakefield (Mi Kelly) has a mentioned. The Public Works Committee has been concerned about this aspect because by very Act of Parliament the Public Works Comthe mittee is charged with the responsibility of examining works referred to it by the Parliathe ment. The debate that took place yesterday the in this chamber concerning 3 schools in the Northern Territory need not have taken place this amendment had already been made to the Public Works Committee Act prior to yesterday, because the amendment simply profor a cut-off point. It simply defines the the point at which the cost of a work can be It must be clear to everybody, I think, that there are many cut-off points from the inception of a project until its completion, which that points can be regarded as the cost of the project. Those points can be legitimately determined all the way through a project. But only all the design work has been done can to one in essence say that on paper there is a complete plan for a project which has been reliably costed by the Department of Housing and Construction. In other words, an estimate has been prepared against which tender prices can be compared. It is only at that time that the cost of a project can in real terms be determined. The Bill simply does that. The Bill provides that after all the design work has been completed, the estimated cost at that stage shall be the cost of the project. Any event which occurs in the community after that design estimate has been prepared, such as the escalation of costs, shall be disregarded. I hark back to the 3 schools in the Northern Territory. The reason that matter needed to be brought to this House was that by the time the projects had been designed, costs in the community generally had risen. So when the tender prices were submitted the tenders exceeded the original estimated price. The tenders certainly would not have exceeded the current estimated price of the project, but they exceeded the original estimated price. Let me elaborate on that point. It must borne in mind that from the time a departto ment of the Australian Government decides that it wishes work to be done until the time that work is actually executed can be a period of up to 7 years, depending on the size and complexity of the project. That in itself makes it obvious that in order to comply with intention of the Public Works Committee Act there should be a point at which it is said: This is the cost of the project'. That is the amendment seeks to do. The Public Works Committee agreed that this was the point at which the cost of a project ought to be determined for the purpose of allowing the Government to decide whether this matter which should be brought before the Parliament. To go about this in any other way would allow the ambiguity that exists the Act to remain. Until this amendment is agreed to the Australian Government, Austhe tralian Government departments and certainly the Department of Housing and Construction this technical will remain in a state of uncertainty. 1 do not know whether there is any opposition to this legislation. I What is proposed is reasonable and sensible, and the only practical thing to do. The Public Works Committee deals with practical matters. I feel safe in saying on behalf of that Comand mittee that it will be most grateful if this amendment is passed so that it will have determinate point in the Act and will know precisely the cost of a project and how define it. That is all that the amendment seeks to do. It simply adds a definition to the provisions already existing in the Act. I commend it to the House.",112
79,Mr MCLEAY,COMMITTEES," I certainly will not delay the House for more than a few moments. The view of the Opposition has been stated by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Kelly) and there is no point in reiterating it. I wish to place on record that the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen), who is at the table, and I have had a discussion about one other aspect of public works that has occurred to us on this side during the course of the day, namely that the type of work that we have been talking about in this debate should in some way be referred to the Public Works Committee after the project has been completed and, therefore, all costs are known, so that the Public Works Committee can keep a record of those costs. Perhaps, when the Committee makes its annual report to the Parliament, those combe pletion costs could be included as an appendix that report so that the Parliament would then have a record of the work that was done and the cost in the context of the considerations applied by the Public Works Committee. The Special Minister of State has indicated that he agrees that this is a worthwhile sugthc gestion. We do not wish to move any amendment to that effect. We will be satisfied if such a provision can be incorporated in the all Bill in sub-clause form when it goes before the Senate. I wish to say nothing further except that I believe that the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson) has a document that he wishes to table which, in was a a way, has a similar effect.",113
80,Mr LES JOHNSON,COMMITTEES, I do not wish to prolong this debate. I say simply that debate is about a most technical matter. I have the benefit of a statement explaining,113
81,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr LucheHi)Is it the intention of the Minister to table have not heard any. that document?,113
82,Mr LES JOHNSON,COMMITTEES,"I was just coming to that. I have a technical statement from my Department on this matter. Rather than read it make a speech on it, I think it would be in the interests of the Parliament, and of the a Public Works Committee in particular, to incorporate it in Hansard. The honourable to memher for Boothby has been good enough to indicate his concurrence to that suggestion. I ask for leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.",113
83,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)NA NA This refers to the proposed amendment of the Act. This Bill is intended to more clearly define the definition of 'estimated cost' in the Act. My Department prepares estimates of cost at a number of stages throughout the development of a project. These estimates range from advice on the likely order of cost of a project at the very early stage when a Sponsor Department is first contemplating what work should be done, up to very detailed estimates of cost based on the final working drawings and specifications for assessing the reasonableness, or otherwise, of tenders received for the work. In between these extremes of the design development, estimates of cost in progressively greater detail and with increasing reliability are prepared. These stages of estimates relate, generally, to the development stage at which necessary approvals are sought to proceed with design development, and later to ensure that the cost of the work is kept within the amounts approved by Cabinet or by Parliament. The order of cost estimate could be described as un indicative cost estimate, and would generally be based on little more than an assessment of area requirements extended at an appropriate rate per unit area. Following this, the sponsoring Department would produce a detailed functional brief which identifies requirements, and on this brief would be prepared a preliminary estimate; this estimate could be considered to represent a reasonably complete understanding and interpretation of the Sponsor's requirements and would include assessment of particular site and other problems likely to be encountered. This type of estimate is considered reasonably reliable for Cabinet consideration as to whether the project should proceed; Cabinet approval is required for all projects estimated to cost in excess of $lm. . For those projects estimated to cost less than $2m, Cabinet approval authorises my Department to proceed with design development to the stage where a limit of cost estimate is prepared and then to proceed with full documentation to the stage where tenders could be called. For those projects estimated to cost more than S2m, Cabinet approval normally authorises my Department to proceed with design development lo the stage where a limit of cost estimate could be prepared, at which time Parliament refers the project to the P.W.C. After report by the P.W.C., Parliament resolves that it is expedient to proceed with the project, and my Department then undertakes full documentation for the invitation of tenders. The limit of cost estimate is prepared when the proposal has been developed to the stage where the main essentials of form, foundations, structures, external and internal finishes, engineering systems, and landscaping have been determined, and this cost estimate is a firm cost estimate within which the cost of the project can be contained excepting, of course, those general cost escalations within the building and construction industry which can significantly increase the cost before tenders are called, particularly as many of the larger projects can take at least a year to develop from the limit of cost (or P.W.C. stage) to tender readiness. At present, my Department has three school proI.D.C. jects in the Northern Territory which have undergone the design development and documentation stages just outlined, and on each of these projects detailed documentation was commenced, and completed, based on limit of cost estimates which when prepared were below the mandatory reference limit included in the P.W.C. Act. The detailed pre-tender estimates, when prepared in March 1974, exceeded the mandatory reference limit due to cost escalations only, as the scope of the projects had not been, changed from when the limit of cost estimates were prepared. Tenders were invited to ascertain whether the pre-tender estimates adequately represented the stale of the market at the time, and the updated estimates were found lo be representative. The purpose of review by the P.W.C. is lo consider those projects at similar times in their development stage, which exceed the cost limit provided in the Act. Further, reference of a proposal to the P.W.C. should be at a sufficiently early lime in the design developmeni to minimise abortive work by my Depanment in the event of the P.W.C. recommending any alteration/amendment lo the proposal as submitted to them. When major projects have been investigated and developed to the stage where a limit of cost estimate can be prepared, then at this time the P.W.C. should review the proposal if the limit of cost estimate should exceed the mandatory reference limit. This timing would, of course, not be mandatory if cost increases occurred due to a cl ange in the scope of the project after detailed documentation had commenced. Obviously, projects are developed to meet occupancy targets necessary lo meet Government requirements, and the design development and construction phases of a major project are closely tied to the Government's overall priorities; there is no spare time in the projects time phasing for injection of unforeseen review stages. Of course, the design and construction timetables (work plans) of projects estimated to cost in excess of the mandatory reference limit at limit of cost estimate stage make provision for the P.W.C. review. Once the limit of cost estimate stage has been passed, then the work plans for projects cannot be maintained if an unforeseen review by the P.W.C. can be injected at, say, the tender stage. The effect of such a review would be to make the project miss its required handover/occupancy target, not to mention increases in costs which would occur whilst appropriate documents were prepared to allow a P.W.C. review to be undertaken, and the subsequent need of the recalling of tenders. The proposed amendment to the Act now before the House rationalises the timing at which the P.W.C. review is appropriate and resolves the situation arising in the future that has arisen with Anula, Katherine and Wulagi Schools.",114
84,Mr LES JOHNSON,PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION OF THE,I thank the House.,115
85,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION OF THE,"in replyIn closing this debate, I confirm that the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay) did have the conversation with me to which he referred. The issue, as I see it, is quite reasonable. It could perhaps be a matter of agreement here, which I think it would be, as the whole issue concerns the words 'estimated cost'. Prior to this matter arising, I would have thought that in the Parliament's view the estimated cost would have been what was the estimate. It has now been said by some legal authority: 'Estimates vary depending whether it is at the design stage or at the tender stage'. I have no doubt that there have been plenty of other estimates which, in the past, with extras have all exceeded the amount of the original estimate. I think I have clearly indicated that nobody wants to take away from the Public Works Committee its function. In other words, works within this range of costs ought to be referred to the Public Works Committee. If other works outside those limits arise, there is no reason why the Public Works Committee should not be alerted to them so that it could make an appropriate report to the Parliament. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) read a third time. EXCISE BILL 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 July (vide page 217), on motion by Dr JF CAIRNS: That the Bill be now read a second time.",115
86,Dr JF CAIRNS,PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION OF THE," Mr Deputy Speaker, may 1I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill, I would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Customs Bill 1974 as they are related matters. Separate questions may, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore that you permit the subject matter of both Bills to be discussed in this debate.",115
87,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION OF THE,"Mr Luchetti)Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering both measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",115
88,Mr ADERMANN,PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION OF THE," I want to co-operate with the Leader of the House (Mr Daly). I shall attempt to do that, although it is somewhat difficult because I wish to move an amendment in the Committee stage. I want to explain the reason for that amendment, but I want to give the Government my co-operation because it is co-operating with us on another Bill. In speaking to the Excise Bill and the Customs Bill I take note of what the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr. J. F. Cairns) wants to achieve with them. They are designed to limit the opportunity for persons to profit from increases in customs and excise duties which are made from time to time, especially those normally varied in conjunction with the Budget. The Opposition does not oppose the broad principle of these Bills, but in the Committee stage I intend to move an amendment in relation to the variation or revocation of the quota by the Minister for Customs and Excise during the prescribed period. I should like to raise one or two aspects of the Bill. I thank the Minister for Overseas Trade for the co-operation I have received from, the Department of Customs and Excise on some questions I have raised on these matters. The Minister said broadly that prior to the Budget, for example, some importers, manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers clear from bond excess stocks on which the existing duty is paid. If their expectations are correct and duty is increased, these excess stocks can possibly be sold at marked-up prices, although duty was paid at a lower rate, and an excessive profit- a speculator's profit-ca n be made. The ordinary person in the street has to pay for that profit. The solution afforded by these Bills, briefly, is that the Minister is empowered to specify a declared period during which restriction on clearances will apply and a description of goods or classes of goods which are to be subject to the restriction. He will be able to name a base period which would indicate normal levels of clearance and, having regard to normal clearances and other relevant factors, he will then establish a quota. The wish of the Minister and the purpose of these Bills is that, this will prevent, to a large degree, duty avoidance and profit therefrom. There is provision under which a person or company may clear goods in excess of the quota. But clearance of goods in excess of the quota will be subject to a penalty in that to clear these excess goods the person or company must lodge a cash deposit equal to the existing duty as well as having to pay the existing duty. If duty rises this additional duty is to be appropriated from the deposit and the residue is to be refunded. I do not want to manufacture dissent, but there are certain deficiencies which seem to me to be inherent. If we accept the appropriateness of the base period and the question of a realistic quota being arrived at and note that there is a review tribunal to which a quota-holder can appeal against the Minister's decision, we have another probability. Whether it is by media speculation, political leaks or whatever-w e saw media speculation in one newspaper this morning-n o rise in duty seems to be entirely unexpected, even if its degree is not anticipated. In expectation of such a rise we can well have the situation that the final consumer may enter into something of a buying spree, whether it is cases of spirits, cartons of cigarettes, drums of petrol, or whatever it may be. With merchants and importers on an established quota, that quota could and probably would be exhausted. Where do we proceed from there? Either we can have a shortage or scarcity and perhaps even a consequent black market, or the merchants or importers etc. have to clear goods in excess of their quota to be sold within the prescribed period at a price based on a certain level of duty. They have to contribute a substantial cash security. Should duty rise, they have to subsidise this rise out of their working margin. In such an instance there would be no motive to avoid duty and profit. It is the result of consumer demand. The alternative is a dry-up in supply or shortages. So these Bills are not completely satisfactory or effective. I recognise that the Minister said that they do not go all the way and I recognise what the Government is trying to do. The very specification of goods in itself most certainly would be rightly or wrongly taken by consumers as a loud and clear message that such goods would be subject to increased duty. This would naturally stimulate purchasing in excess of normal expectations. This seems self-evident, even if we had a blanket specification of goods including goods not likely to be subject to duty increase. Unfortunately there is a limited field and some favoured goods usually attract Budget attention in this regard. One can almost bet on cigarettes and tobacco products, potable spirits and petrol being primary targets. I hope that the Minister will see that all I am trying to do is to put up a practical proposition, namely, that this is a very real and likely position and is a probable undesirable by-product which is contradictory to the aim which the Minister stated he hopes to achieve with these Bills. The Minister might reply that proposed section 59B in the Excise Bill will deal adequately with that situation. I will not go into the question at any length because he knows the section in the Bill to which I refer, but in its present form I cannot accept that reply as an assurance. That is why I intend to move the amendment in the Committee stage. Briefly, the section provides that at any time before the expiration of the declared period or before the time for the expiration of the review period the Minister may revoke or vary a quota order. The Minister for Overseas Trade might say that this section would give the Minister for Customs and Excise the power to enlarge the quota to cope with stimulated increased 1 consumer demand. But the section does not r.ive a guarantee; there is a threat 'of revocation. Variations in excise may be up or down and some retrospective penalty could be imposed as the section now appears. That may not be the intent of the wording of the section, but I believe that it is within the scope and the meaning of the section to create that exact situation. Today I had discussions with the drafting section of the Department of Customs and Excise and received an assurance that the legislation covers this point of objection. I studied the information that was given to me; that the word 'revoked'' is deemed to mean that if there were a revocation it would mean that the revocation applied to remove the quota and that the merchant or importer would no longer have to worry a'bout a quota. But that would not be the meaning of the word under the Bill. I do not think that the Minister would agree with that meaning of the word. 'Revoke' means to take away and leave without any. I was advised that in the Bill 'revoke' means putting a person on a nil quota. There is a very big difference between having to work without any restriction and having a nil quota. I put it to the House that that is important. I shall be brief and try to finish my remarks quickly because we want to go into the Committee stage. I believe that the same thing could apply in the matter of variation of the quota and that a penalty could be inflicted on an importer or a merchant because of that situation. I hope that, when I move the amendment, the Minister will realise that I am trying to be constructive. We are not opposing the Bills. We agree very heartily with the principle of the Bills. We just want to remove something which may not be an attempt to do anything sinister under the Bills but about which we are concerned. I think that the amendment I propose to move can clarify that issue. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The Bill.",115
89,Mr ADERMANN,PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION OF THE," I present without further discussion an amendment to clause 4. The amendment has been circulated in my name. The Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS) and the Committee are aware of its intent. I move: At the end of proposed section 59B., add the following new sub-section: '(6) No such revocation or variation of a quota order under this section shall be made which would operate to cause increased financial liability under this Act to any person acting in good faith who has cleared any goods of the kind to which the order relates, in quantity not exceeding the quota order applicable to him on the first notification of his to which the revocation or variation applies.'.",117
90,Dr JF CAIRNS,PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION OF THE,"The amendment of the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Adermann) is concerned with preventing a revocation or variation of the quota order from causing increased financial liability to any person acting in good faith with respect to declared goods. This matter has been carefully considered during the course of the day. The honourable member for Fisher, as he said, has had an opportunity to discuss the matter with departmental officers who drafted the Bill. I thoroughly agree with the honourable member's point that a person subject to a quota order should not, by virtue of any revocation or variation of that order, incur any increased financial liability in respect of goods already cleared by him. The amendment is designed to provide a protection in relation to goods already cleared. Looking first al the question of revocation of a person's quota order. I point cut that this can only be beneficial to a person. It removes all limits on the quantity of goods of the kind to which the revoked order relates that can be cleared by him. Looking at the question of the variation of a quota order, I point out to the honourable member that in terms of sub-sections (4) and (5) of section 59 of the Act-the section to which he refers-the Minister in varying an order has only 2 options open to him. Firstly, where the order is varied to enlarge the quota initially issued, the new order takes effect on and from the date on which the original order came into force. Secondly, where the Minister varies the order so that a lesser quota is applicable the new order operates on and from the date on which the variation was made. Accordingly, a person who is issued with a quota order and clears goods under that quota cannot suffer any financial disadvantage in respect of goods already cleared in the event that the Minister subsequently varies the original order. What that means is that once the original quota has been issued the person to whom it is issued can clear goods up to the limit of that quota order without any fear of any retrospective downward variation of his quota limit. Once the original quota has been issued there can be no retrospective downward variation. Therefore, I can assure the honourable member for Fisher that the points he has raised are adequately covered in the provisions of the Bill as they stand now. He need not fear quota any injustice in increased nnanciai liability to any person as a result of a revocation or variation of a quota order. This being the case, I therefore cannot accept the amendment. I assure the honourable member that adequate protection is provided in the Bill. Amendment negatived. Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Dr JF CAIRNS)-by leave-rea d a third time. CUSTOMS BILL 1974 Second Reading Consideration resumed from 16 July (vide page 217), on motion by Dr JF CAIRNS: That the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The Bill.",117
91,Mr ADERMANN,PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION OF THE," I seek to explain to the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS) that I am moving this amendment because I got 2 opinions today that were somewhat in variance. It was explained to me that one of the reasons the Government wanted this provision in the Bill- I can understand it-wa s that it did not want a mistake made. But in the event of that happening I think it is probably better to make a mistake in one quota for one person and have the provisions I seek in the Bill. I proposed my amendment because I wanted the Minister to give the assurance he gave in Committee on the Excise Bill. Therefore, without any further delay, I move an amendment to clause 6 as follows: At the end of proposed section 132B., add the following new sub-section: ""(10) No such revocation or variation of a quota order under this section shall be made which would operate to cause increased financial liability under this act to any person acting in good faith who has cleared any goods of the kind to which the order relates, in quantity not exceeding the quota order applicable to him on the first notification of his quota to which the revocation or variation applies"".",118
92,Dr JF CAIRNS,PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION OF THE, I appreciate the care with which the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Adermann) has handled this matter. I think the concern he has shown is justifiable. His amendment is a genuine attempt to clarify a matter about which he was in doubt. I am assured and I give the assurance to the Committee and to the honourable member that there is no need tor concern. Adequate protection is contained in the Bill. Amendment negatived. Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Dr JF CAIRNS)-by leave-rea d a third time. GLEBE LAND (APPROPRIATION) BILL 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed (vide page 442).,118
93,Mr THORBURN,PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION OF THE," I do not want to take up the time of the House with too much debate on this matter as there is no opposition to it. However the Opposition has made a few points which I feel should be answered. The Glebe land takes its name from the present owners. It is a unique area of land very close to the centre of the Sydney city, yet unique in its topography. It is divorced in the form of a peninsula. It is a very valuable area of land and a very wonderful place for people to live in. Of course in recent times there has been a vast increase in the youthful population as people who are studying at the Sydney University find occupancy in this area. Much has been said about it. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) said that plans should be prepared so that we could have a better idea of what the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) proposes. The Leader of the Opposition then went on to criticise. He said that the people ought to be involved. This is the precise plan of the Government in relation to these Glebe lands. First of all, the 700 homes are there and they are viable. People are living in them as people have lived there for probably half a century or more. The people who live in these houses are entitled to expect that they will be able to live there for quite a lengthy time. The Church of England, faced with the obligation to do something about this area after receiving the poverty report, approached the Australian Government so that the area would not be fragmented by developers who could put on the land high density development of the type about which the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay) was speaking. This is precisely what we do not want. We want this land to be planned properly as a precinct, with one owner able to do the planning, so that the whole area can become a delightful place for people to live in. It does not need much imagination to think of what can be done. We could add to this area immediately another 300 homes so that we can house another 300 families. Being the sole owners, we could be able very easily to close roads and or make cul-de-sacs, create pedestrian ways and plan the area properly, as should be done. But if the Government or the Church of England allowed the area to be fragmented we certainly would not get the type of development we want. A great deal has been said about the amount of money that will be spent to build new houses, town houses and medium density or high density type construction on this land, lt is proposed that we shall buy the property lor about §30,000 a home. If one were to go a short distance from the avenue and try to buy a comparable house one would pay twice the price. This terrace type housing which exists in Glebe has become very popular. In Paddington and in other areas of Sydney the houses are being renovated rapidly so that people can live in them. Extremely high prices are being paid for them. The Australian Government will lose nothing on this project. If we buy the houses and the land we will own the real estate and, at some time in the future-it could be the far distant future-if it becomes necessary we can redevelop the area in an orderly manner. But the fact of the matter is that we are actually getting the development now for the price of new homes. For that reason I think the Government has taken the appropriate action in this case. It is paying a fair price for this very wonderful part of old Sydney Town. We will preserve it. We will develop it. We will encourage resident participation in the planning and control of the area. I am quite sure that this area will become a model for many of the councils and local government areas throughout Sydney. One hopes that the New South Wales Government will take up this idea in an enterprising way and develop some of its areas rather than what we have seen over the years with the schedule 7 type development around the redeveloped areas of Sydney.",118
94,Mr HUNT,PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION OF THE," ! do not inLeichhardt tend to take up much time at this hour of night because I know that the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) is trying to get this Glebe Lands (Appropriawhatever tion) Bill through the House before 10.30. rise for 2 purposes. Firstly, I make it that I am not opposing the Bill and, secondly, I shall respond to a mention which 1 received in dispatches in the Minister's second reading speech. It is not often that a lowly creature like an honourable member of the Opposition gets a mention in a second reading speech; nevertheless I was mentioned. The Minister joined issue with me for what I said at a meeting in Sydney of the Real Estate Institute of New South Wales where I gave a very distinguished address on 25 June called 'Co-operative Approach :o Urban Development'. I said that this Glebe project was undertaken without consultation with State or local governments. 1 said that up to that time there was no knowledge of what was planned or how the project would be implemented. I made that statement in good faith because that was the information, in a broad sense, which I received from the authorities in New South Wales. That is fairly correct, although it is not totally correct. In chronological order. I shall give the way in which the Minister and his Department have negotiated with the New South Wales authorities. At no stage has there been any oflicial approach to the Minister for Housing or to the Chairman of the New South Wales Housing Commission, either orally or in writing, from the Minister for Urban and Regional Development in relation to the Glebe property. It is understood that some minor discussion took place between one or two officers of the Minister's Department and officers of the Housing Commission. That was on a very shallow level. On 30 May 1973 the Minister wrote to Sir Charles Cutler relative to his proposal to commission a feasibility study. I have a letter attached to these notes which I shall table. In the absence of Sir Charles Cutler overseas the Minister's letter was acknowledged by the acting Minister, Mr Jago, on 1 June. There was an attached letter which I shall also table. On 2 June the Minister for Urban and Regional Development sent Mr Jago a telegram advising that a firm of consultants had been appointed and that he expected to have their report by the end of luly. Following personal representations to him by Mr Degen M.L.A., on behalf of the Municipal Council, the Minister the wrote to Sir Charles Cutler on 27 August 1973 asking him to keep the Premier informed of developments at Glebe. No further contact was made by the Minister or by I his Department with Sir Charles Cutler or his clear Department. The next development was an announcement in the Sydney 'Morning Herald' of 8 April 1974 that Federal Cabinet had that day approved of the purchase of Church of England Land, 47 acres, at Glebe, at a cost of $17.5m. On 17 May Sir Charles Cutler wrote to the Premier advising him that no further approach had been made to him. I seek leave to table the relevant corerspondence which demonstrates the points.",119
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION OF THE,"Mr Armitage)The honourable member for Gwydir, being a private member, wishes to table the relevant correspondence. He requires leave of the House to do so. Is leave granted?",120

98,Mr HUNT,PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION OF THE,It is quite all right. The State Minister did not give it to me. I make that very clear. It came into my hands in another way. But I shall incorporate this correspondence in Hansard to satisfy the request of the Minister.,120
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION OF THE,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The documents read as follows)Minister for Urban and Regional Development Dear Sir Charles, I am sure you will be aware that the Church of England has recently decided to sell its Bishopthorpe and St Phillips Estates in Glebe, and that some sales of individual properties have already been made. However, in its recent submission to the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, the Church indicated that it would be willing to consider entering into discussons for the disposal of these estates with government or local government agencies. Suggestions have been made to me that the Australian Government should take up this offer. So that I will be in a position to consider this matter properly, I have asked my Department to commission a study to provide the information necessary to decide whether action by my Government is warranted and if so, how it can be made most effective and what the financial commitment might be. I hope that it will be possible to brief consultants next week, and to have an interim report in one month and a final report in two months. As you will appreciate, the circumstances require me to act as quickly as possible. The consultants will be particularly asked to take into account the views of the State Planning Authority, the Housing Commission, the Leichhardt Municipal Council and the Glebe Administration Board, and to consult with other State departments and agencies nnd with the community organisations with an interest in the matter. I would be most grateful if you would ask those organisations under your jurisdiction to facilitate the consultants work as much as possible, and if you would indicate whether there are any other bodies with which tt would be specially important to confer. When the study is completed I would like my Department's officers to review its findings with the State organisations mentioned and with the Council before I formulate my recommendations to Cabinet. Should the study indicate that joint action between our two Governments would be appropriate, I would then seek to discuss the matter with you personally. I trust that I have your support in my proposed course of action, which is directed towards the conservation of a unique part of old Sydney and towards the protection of a community structure which has grown up over a long period of time. Yours sincerely, NA The Hon. Sir Charles Cutler, K.B.E., Minister for Local Government and Highways, State Office Block, Phillip Street, SYDNEY, N.S.W. 2000. Sydney, 17 May 1974 Dear Sir Robert, I refer lo your letter of 27th August, 1973, concerning the disposal of the Bishopthorpe and St Phillips Estates owned by the Church of England at Glebe. No further approach has been made by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development since his letter to Sir Charles Cutler last year. However, you are no doubt aware of the recent announcement that the Australian Government had approved the purchase of the properties from the Church of England. Canberra, A.C.T. Yours faithfully, C. B. CUTLER Acting Minister for Planning and Environment The Hon. Sir Robert Askin, KCMG., M.L.A., Premier and Treasurer, SYDNEY. 2000 In May 1973 the Federal Minister for Urban and Regional Development advised Sir Charles Cutler that he had commissioned a study to determine the feasibility of purchasing the Bishopthorpe and St Phillips Estates at Glebe which the Church of England intended to sell. It was suggested that discussions might be appropriate following the study, and the Premier requested that he be kept informed of developments in the matter. No further advice has been received but it was recently announced that the Federal Government had approved the purchase of the Estates. The above final reply is recommended for signature. (Reference Registered Ministerial Letter No. 3902). E. NOLAN Associate Chairman Sydney 1 June 1973 The Hon. T. Uren, M.P., Minister for Urban and Regional Development, Parliament House, CANBERRA. A.C.T. 2600 Dear Mr Uren, I refer to your recent letter concerning the question of the disposal of the Bishopthorpe and St Phillips Estates owned by the Church of England at Glebe. The comments you have made have been carefully noted and you may be assured that the consultants who will be undertaking the study into this proposal will receive every co-operation from Departments within my administration. 1 note that should the study indicate that joint action between our two Governments would be appropriate you would wish to discuss the matter with Sir Charles Cutler. ln this light 1 will bring your letter to his tion as soon as he returns from overseas on the 10th July, 1973. Acting Minister for Local Government",120
100,Mr HUNT,TOM UREN,"I am glad that the correspondence is now incorporated in Hansard because it records for all time that in spite of the impression which the Minister for Urban and Regional Development has been giving of co-operating with the New South Wales Government, for reasons best known to himself he chose to hasten the process without getting his consulting firm to consult with any of the responsible departments in Sydney. Of course one of the great problems associated with this sort of exercise is that the Minister, his Department and the Australian Government are not taking into account the priorities for the expenditure of funds in a State, which is short of housing and which is having great difficulties in trying to get sufficient funds from the Commonwealth without strings attached, without paying high interest rates and without making homes dearer for the people. It is unfortunate that the degree of co-operation that the Minister set out to achieve in effect broke down. Why did it break down? I think it broke down because there was a desire on the part of the Minister to hasten this matter, hoping that perhaps some Cabinet resistance or resistance among his colleagues may not build up. However, the deed has been done. I do not object to the Australian Government's adopting initiatives like this so long as it is being done in the interests of the people generally after adequate consultationI emphasise the words 'adequate consultation' - wit h the State Governments concerned because undoubtedly the. Federal Government will need their co-operation to provide the total services that the people in the redeveloped Glebe will require. So I still adhere to what I said in the address that I gave, entitled 'A co-operative Approach to Urban Development'.",121
101,Mr RUDDOCK,TOM UREN," I realise that the time for discussion of this very important matter is limited because of the Government's program, but I wish to make a number of small contributions to this very important debate which concerns everybody who has a care about Sydney as we know it and Sydney as we believe it ought to be. Many misconceptions have been proffered in this attendebate. For instance, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Thorburn) suggested that the Church of England must have owned the roads Yours faithfully, in the area and that the roads in the area would (Sgd.) A. H. JAGO be available without further cost in this deand Highways velopment. Another misconception relates to the value of homes in the area. The 'Australian Financial Review' indicated that a triple fronted, red brick, tiled bungalow in Glebe was passed in at $20,500. The honourable member for Cook therefore suggested that even though homes are being passed in at that price a person would not be able to buy a home at less than $30,000. We know from the figures given in the speeches we have heard that the price for the land and the homes is $17,500,000 and that a further S8m is to be spent on renovation. By simple division we can calculate that the renovated home will cost about $36,000. I ask whether the expenditure of $36,000 on homes which may be bought for about $20,000 in that area today is reasonable. In its original submission to the Commonwealth inquiry into poverty the Church of England suggested when - it offered the land to the Government that experiment with the provision of low cost housing along planned lines, was desirable, but the church said that it was not its task but rather the responsibility of government to subsidise low cost housing. Yesterday we heard the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) say that New South Wales was getting itself into a subsidy quagmire in relation to land it was purchasing. I suggest that in what we are seeing here now and the plans that have been put before us the Commonwealth Government is getting itself involved in a subsidy quagmire. I think it is rather pertinent to look at the report on this project, because it speaks about the housing that exists on the estate and the works that will be necessary to put the properties in some order. It is rather pertinent to note that the sort of works that are required are minor structural repairs, some re-roofing, new bathrooms, new kitchens and redecorating; and I would hasten to add new wiring, new drainage, plumbing and so on. Yet it is suggested that in these days of innation we will be able to purchase services of this sort Regional and provide them within the costs that have been suggested. When some 30,000 people are waiting for Housing Commission homes New South Wales and some 6,000 aged people - are seeking aged persons and subsidised accommodation, I do not believe it is the right method for the Government to undertake this project. Surely by some rezoning of the property or even by the Commonwealth buying the properties and farming them out to people who want to buy them and renovate them within a set plan, we would be able to achieve a far better environment in that area. By all means preserve the historic buildings for posterity, because that seems to be the important message coming through. For people who require low cost housing let the Government embark upon a more ambitious plan some other area where there are not historic homes involved and where we can achieve the objective for a reasonable cost and for the benefit of New South Wales house more people and maintain our heritage.",121
102,Mr UREN,TOM UREN,"In replyI do not have time to reply in detail. Some question was raised about the purchase price of the property at Glebe as compared with its value. The Department of Services and Property valued it at more than $17.5m. In other words we purchased at a price below the Commonwealth authority's valuation. wish that honourable members opposite would do a little more homework. Apart from 710 dwellings, 12 shops and 25 commercial roads closed. sites, there is another area on which to construct 250 new dwellings. Frankly, I believe that history will prove that the decision to purchase this property a very important decision. I hope that rehabilitate the area and get a general mix people in the area, unlike Paddington and inner suburbs of Melbourne from which people on low incomes are being gradually forced out. I ask the House to support this decision because this is in fact an historic Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

106,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! Does the honourable member for Cook claim to have been misrepresented.,122
107,Mr THORBURN,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes . The. honourable member fer Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) in the debate just concluded said that I had said that, there being one owner of the property in Glebe, roads would be closed and this would not cost money. 1 made no such statement. I am well aware of the procedures in relation to closing roads. The Lands Department in New South Wales requires the concurrence of all adjoining owners before a road is closed ancl more recently t has required ; I its own approval before a road can be closed to traffic. I merely indicated that, there being the a single owner, it would be easy lo have",122
108,Mr CORBETT,ADJOURNMENT,"As a representative of a large number of wool growers, I am very deeply concerned about is the claim that was made by the honourable we can member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Whan) that of 3 members of the Australian Wool Corporation had stooped to the level of completelydisregarding their responsibilities as members of the Corporation by conspiring with the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony) and the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Sinclair), and thereby placing in jeopardy the welfare of the people engaged in the wool industry, in order to promote an attitude within the Corporation regard to price levels for wool that was designed only to embarrass the Government. The honourable member said that he has evidence which will substantiate his claim. I think that this is something which should be clarified. It is a matter of great regret to me that matter was not cleared up when the opportunity to do so arose today. I also regret that the honourable member is not present in the chamber. Representations were made to me about this matter and I tried to send word to the honourable member that I was going to discuss it. I will admit that it was very late in the evening that the representations were made. I am concerned about the effect that the honourable member's claim will have on the wool industry and, indeed, on the wool market generally, because it is a very serious claim. It suggests that the Australian Wool Corporation is not using its commercial judgment in order to arrive at the price it should arrive at as a floor price for the wool that is being sold. As you know, Mr Speaker, the honourable member and other members of the Australian Labor Party had an opportunity to discuss this matter in Parliament today. I must say that it is to the very great discredit of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the Labor Party that they refused to accept the challenge to debate this matter and shirked the issue. This matter is so vitally important to so many of my constituents and to so many people throughout Australia that I was very disappointed that such a debate did not take, place. I had not intended to raise this matter at this time but representations were made to me on it and I felt that, since this is the last time that I will have an opportunity to debate it before the House meets again next Tuesday, I should raise the matter. It is a serious matter that cannot be swept under the carpet simply by the actions that were taken today. I believe that the light of day should be placed on it. I believe that it is very necessary to have the matter finalised. Indeed, if the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has evidence to substantiate his claims I think that he has a responsibility to put that evidence before this chamber. A matter as serious as this one deserves to be given the light of day. It is not a matter that should be allowed to be lightly brushed aside. A very grave reflection has been cast upon the Leader and Deputy Leader of my Party. As I see it, a very grave reflection also has been cast upon every member of the Australian Wool Corporation because, as far as I know, the honourable member has not named the 3 members to whom he was referring. 1 feel that I must ask why that was done. One can only assume that there is a reason this for it. While the reason remains unresolved and while nothing further is done, people will be asking questions about the matter. In fairness to himself, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro should have disclosed the evidence that he claimed he had. I know that until it is disclosed people are going to ask themselves whether he has any evidence at all or whether he has just made a trumped up charge with the object of gaining some cheap political capital out of the attitude that he has taken. Is it just a scheme to try to denigrate the Country Party? Only too often I have seen very savage attacks made in this House by members of the Australian Labor Party on members of the Australian Country Party. The Australian Country Party seems to have been specially selected by the Labor Party for attack. I do not mind having to take the normal criticisms that are made in the rough and tumble of politics. I am quite prepared to take them, and to give them. Mr Martin- I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I seek your guidance. I understand that the matter under discussion at present is to be the subject of a censure motion of which notice was given today. I am wondering whether such a discussion is therefore in order.",122
109,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"As the notice of motion that was presented before the dinner adjournment is not on the notice paper, the honourable member for Maranoa is quite in order in saying what he is saying.",123
110,Mr CORBETT,ADJOURNMENT,"Than k you, Mr Speaker. I repeat that it is with very great regret that I have raised this matter in this light. I have done so only because 1 believe that 1I have a responsibility to do so. I have asked the question. I am sure that all people will be asking it. Has the honourable member for Eden-Monaro any evidence. Is it a scheme to denigrate the Leaders of the Country Party? Has the honourable member made these allegations because of his bitter opposition to the Australian Wool Corporation and all that it means to the great Australian wool industry and to the people of this country who are engaged in the industry? If he has evidence, I say without equivocation that he has the clear duty and the responsibility to produce it to the House. The cowardly action which was taken today cannot be justified. I blame the Labor Party completely in this regard, and I blame the honourable member for Eden Monaro for sheltering under the protection of the Party when the opportunity was given to him today to discuss this matter in full. 1 believe that the position was made much more serious because the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Couniry Party, men whose standing in this country is as high as that of any politician in Australia, have completely denied the allegations. They did so before the opportunity was given to the Labor Party and to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to disclose their proof. But the honourable member sheltered under the protection of the Labor Party. I say that it is a disgrace to the ALP. Until the honourable member proves that what he said is right, the Leader and Deputy Leader of my Party and the Australian Wool Corporation remain under a cloud of criticism which should be dispersed as soon as it is possible for anyone to do so. I believe, that the responsibility rested squarely on the shoulders of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and on the shoulders of the Labor Government to do so when it had the opportunity to do so. The Australian Woo! Corporation today faces a very difficult situation. It is responsibly trying to maintain a satisfactory price for Australian wool. It has been charged with that responsibility. While these charges remain unresolved, the confidence that overseas wool buyers will have in the Australian Wool Corporation is undermined. If there is any truth in the charges it should be brought out, and the people responsible should he brought out, and the people responsible should be brought to book. But it remains a matter which has been thrown into the ring, without production of the proof which the honourable member claims that he has. This type of action should not be taken in this Parliament. I regret that the honourable member was not given earlier notice that I intended to raise the subject. I tried to give him notice in the last quarter of an hour. His name was on the list of members who wished to speak in the adjournment debate tonight. He was to follow me. So I would have expected him to be present. At the same time, I could not let this matter go, because I believe that the seriousness of rhe charge in such that it has to he ventilated. I appeal to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and to the ALP to face up to the responsibility that they surely have to clarify and resolve these matters so that the innocent people, as I believe they are, will be cleared of the charge which has been made against them. None of the antics of the second great comic actor in the Labor Party will lessen the seriousness of this charge, because it is a very serious charge. As I see the position, innocent people remain under a cloud until the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the Labor Party, which protected him, live up to and prove the charges that they have made.",123
111,Mr THORBURN,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to speak tonight following my question to the Minister for Manufacturing Industry (Mr Enderby) who represents in this chamber the Attorney-General (Senator Murphy) about possible corruption in the Australian Country Party. I wish to draw the attention of the House to the situation that has arisen. In the last week or so a great deal of publicity has been given to the proposed Menai town centre development in the Shire of Sutherland in Sydney. I am indebted to the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) for his remarks, which were answered recently by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) who showed that Sir Charles Cutler, the Minister for Local Government in the New South Wales Parliament, had revealed confidential correspondence from the Minister to other people. This is exactly what happened in the case of the dealings of Parkes Development Pty Ltd with the Minister in relation to land at the Menai town centre. The situation was that the Sutherland Shire Council, which had heen responsible for the total development of a new town area- I understand that this is the first time that a local government was responsible for the development of such an area-ha d embarked upon the planning of the Menai town centre, an area to accommodate some 80,000 people. The Council set up a separate department within its structure, at great cost to itself and to the ratepayers, to plan and develop the Menai town centre in an orderly fashion. 1 might say that it has been acclaimed by the State Planning Authority which did not alter the plans that were submitted to it by the Council but approved them in to to. The town centre development represented about 350 acres, some of which was owned by private developers, some by the Sutherland Shire Council, and some by various small owners. The Council made an application to acquire the whole of the town centre, the bulk of which is required for public utilities or government departments or roads in order to develop it in an orderly fashion. The Minister received a letter and gave the Council no reply. Mr Martin-.Who owned the land?",124
112,Mr THORBURN,ADJOURNMENT,"The land was owned by various people, including the Sutherland Shire Council and Parkes Development. The next thing that happened was that the Council was approached by Parkes Development which suggested to the Council that the Minister had asked it to come to a conference so that he could discuss with the company the acquisition and development of the land rather than have Sutherland Shire Council do it. The Minister denied this and said that Parkes Development had heard that the proposition was on and had come to him. Then Parkes Development produced a letter which showed that it had been invited by the Minister for Local Government, Sir Charles Cutler, to a conference with him in order to discuss the development of this land without any discussion whatsoever taking place with the Council. It is ironic that Mr Charody, a principal of Parkes Development, recently accompanied the Premier of New South Wales on a perk trip overseas 'before the Premier's retirementpaid for probably, by the people of New South Wales. Certainly the Premier's trip was paid for. He was taken all around Europe and to Hungary and undoubtedly he was there the guest of the Hungarian financiers who have financed a great number of the enterprises of Parkes Development. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) recently said of the New South Wales Government that it was a government for developers. I do not think it is a government for developers at all; I think it is a government for speculators. I do not regard many of these people as being developers; I regard them as pure speculators. Just look at the record of the New South Wales Government. The State Liberal Government decided that it would levy a development tax of $1,000 or thereabouts on each block of land that was sold in the new town centres, and this money was to provide a very low interest financing fund to enable the local areas to provide community amenities. Money borrowed from this fund would be paid back at an interest rate of approximately 2 per cent. Legislation was enacted to give effect to this proposal. It resulted in a great hue and cry from all the speculators that this would increase the price of land. So the Act was repealed. That same land is now being sold at top prices. There has been absolutely no reduction in the price of the land taken up by the Menai town centre. In fact, it is being sold at more than $18,000 per block. Nothing has been done about this. The New South Wales Government is there to support its friends in land speculation. It is no wonder that the Australian Government has to step in and purchase land, such as the Glebe area, so that there can be orderly development. We all know what would happen to the land if it were given to these friends of the New South Wales Government.",125
113,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,They would be knighted.,125
114,Mr THORBURN,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes , they have all got knighthoods, every one of them. It is very notable.",125
115,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,They have paid for them.,125
116,Mr THORBURN,ADJOURNMENT,"Whether they paid for them or not, they have certainly been amply rewarded. Mr Daly-Most of them should have been crowned.",125
117,Mr THORBURN,ADJOURNMENT,I agree that they all ought to have been crowned.,125
118,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member for Cook is making the speech.,125
119,Mr THORBURN,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I am getting a great deal of valuable assistance. It is a fact that the New South Wales State Government has assisted development companies in New South Wales in every way. This has meant that there has been land speculation and that the price of land in the Sydney region is at a premium-muc h higher than the price which people, particularly young people, can afford to pay. It is a deplorable situation when a Minister of the Crown goes to a private development company without consulting the local authority after the local authority has approached him concerning a proposition for the orderly development of an area. It is a deplorable thing when the State Government cannot be brought to account for what it has done to the people of New South Wales. It is a deplorable situation that tonight we should find that this same Minister who has divulged this informatiion should encourage this private development company to go ahead and develop this area for its own profit and benefit against the best interests of people who will have to acquire land in the Menai town area, and of this Government which will have to provide various facilities and utilities. It is a deplorable thing that we cannot bring the State Government to account for what it has done. It is deplorable that tonight an honourable member is able to produce in this House documents which were written by a Minister of this Parliament to a Minister of the New South Wales Parliament. It is also deplorable that those documents have been divulged to other persons.",125
120,Mr GARLAND,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I think that the most notable incident or lack of incident that has occurred in this adjournment debate tonight is the absence of any attempt by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Whan) to come into this House and explain himself. A notice of motion concerning a very serious matter has been given. Here was an opportunity for the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to speak, but his place in this House is vacant; he is not in the chamber. Obviously he cannot answer the charges which he himself raised in an attempt to damage others in this place.",126
121,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"A point of order, Mr Speaker. The honourable member for Eden Monaro is being attacked in his absence. I understand that he was down to speak on the adjournment",126
122,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,There is no point of order.,126
123,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to come to the point of order. As I understand it, in the adjournment debate an honourable member is not supposed to raise something that is on the notice paper.",126
124,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! I quoted this standing order in reply to a point of order which was raised a moment ago. It reads: A notice of motion becomes effective only when il appearson the Notice Paper. The honourable member for Maranoa was in order and the honourable member for Curtin is in order.,126
125,Mr GARLAND,ADJOURNMENT,"The fact of the matter is, as you would know, Mr Speaker, from looking at the piece of paper in front of you, that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro had his name on the list as a speaker and it has been scratched out, presumably by himself. I think that gives the full answer to the point that has just been raised. This evening I rose to speak on another matter, although if the honourable member for Eden-Monaro had been here and had been willing to speak I certainly would have yielded my place because that is the urgent matter of the moment. Tonight I rise to speak about the Joint Committee on Prices which has been set up by this House. Today when that Committee was reconstituted-it was first constituted in the last Parliament-the motion to set it up was brought in with a number of motions to set up other committees. As you would know, Mr Speaker, the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) and others wished that the business should proceed quickly, so I did not intervene in the debate at that time. But as a member of that Committee in the last Parliament and as one who is not continuing on the Committee, I want to make a few remarks about it before the opportunity to do so passes. Mr Keogh-Did you miss out in the ballot?",126
126,Mr GARLAND,ADJOURNMENT,"I did not stand, if the honourable member is interested. That Committee was set up by this Parliament after the Government announced that it would be set up in order, it was said, to help consumers, to see that price rises were examined-in other words to represent the position of consumers by trying to keep prices low. What has been the result of its activity over a year or so? There is no evidence whatsoever that any Minister has taken any notice of the findings or indeed of the evidence that has been produced at those committee meetings. In fact a number of reports were issued on a number of subjects. On 2 occasions meat prices-particularl y beef prices-were examined. Honourable members opposite expressed a great deal of concern about that subject at that time. The Labor members of the Committee brought forth a number of recommendations. All of them were ignored by the Government. The recommendation which the Government accepted was the recommendation contained in a minority report written by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) and myself. It was adopted by the Government although the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) said what his policy was before the Committee had actually decided what its recommendations would be. So much for his concern or even interest in the Committee's proceedings. Other Ministers, in respect of items which were examined by the Committee, have given no indication of their interest or indeed that they learned anything. When I put questions on the notice paper in the last Parliament asking whether they had learned anything from it, the questions remained unanswered at the end of that Parliament. The Committee has indulged in a good deal of advertising. Some thousands of dollars have been spent on advertising, on the employment of staff and so on. 1 take the opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the staff who, I think, did their best under impossible conditions. With some respect to the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), who I see is in the chamber, the result has really only been a platform for publicity by the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Adelaide. He has made Press releases, he has been interviewed on television and so on. But he cannot tell me one other notable thing that has come out of the Committee, yet the Government comes into this Parliament and reconstitutes it. The Government should be dinkum about this and Government members on the Committee should be dinkum about it. Either the Committee will be of some value or it will not. If it is going to be of some value then some notice should be taken of its proceedings. At least the Government should listen to the evidence because after all at some expense we call witnesses and examine them. At any rate the Government should have a policy formation. After all this is supposed to be conducted in the open air these days. Open government has become almost a laugh against the Government. At least it could take some interest in what the Committee or some of its members are saying and show that the Governvery ment regards it as important. What has become apparent-this was said by members of the Opposition when this Comhas mittee was being formed-is that it was purely a stunt to make the public believe that thing serious was being done. It was a stunt to make the public think that somehow or other members of Parliament would meet, examine items, look into the cost structure somehow bring pressure to bear on prices keep them down. Of course, the Government had another policy and that was to set up Prices Justification Tribunal or, as others called it, the Price Rises Justification bunal, which has now expanded establishment. It has an expert staff and people engaged full time. In other words, it has a capacity for far more work and analysis than this Committee could ever hope for. If there were a body that could do anything construcman tive Mr Armitage-You opposed the legislation.",126
127,Mr GARLAND,ADJOURNMENT,"I suggest that the honourable member read the record of the debate more carefully. His memory is failing him. If the Government intended to do anything constructive then that is the body-that so called tribunal-to carry it out. I think it is right to bring to the notice of members and to place on record the experience of this Committee. I think that some members, perhaps all members at times, have endeavoured to get something practical and useful out of the Committee. But I do not believe that they have been really successful. Advertisements were placed in all daily newspapers. They were widespread advertisements which were placed at considerable cost inviting members of the public to write in and make complaints. Naturally, hundreds, perhaps thousands of letters were received. Naturally, they would be in these conditions of rampant innation in this country. It was then the Committee's task to try to sort out from the many avenues put forward what avenues they would examine. As every member of the Committee knows, it would take literally 20 to 30 years at the rate of progress we were making to go through all the avenues which presented themselves. I come to my point that what was obvious at the beginning and throughout the hearings of the Committee was that there was a pretence to people that something would be done. The hearings were conducted at not inconsiderable cost. The new Committee does not contain many members who previously served on it. I think that is au indication of the Government's attitude as a result of the experience gained. I believe that the grandstanding that gone on has not been in the interests of the country. Now that the Committee has somebeen reformed I believe that some of its members will try to work for the benefit of the people. An effort must be made to examine matters on a narrower basis so that they can and be looked into in more detail in order that and something of real value and benefit may follow. I am glad to see that the honourable the member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), the Chairhave man of the Committee, is to follow me in the Tridebate. I shall be most interested to hear into a large what he has to say.",127
128,Mr DALY,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), the Chairof the Joint Committee on Prices to which the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Garland) has been referring, had no knowledge of the unexpected attack that was to be made on the Committee by the honourable member. Consequently he will not speak tonight but no doubt he will do so later in the session. Let me say that one of the failures on the Committee was the honourable member for Curtin and we can understand why he made his comments tonight. He was not a very effective member of the Committee. His statements tonight have been misleading, incorrect and inaccurate. He failed to say that the Government has taken action on and notice of the proceedings of the Committee in a most commendable way. Complaints were made by many people to the Committee and were attended to following the deliberations of the Committee. The comments made by the honourable member tonight do him little credit. They are a very gross commentary on many of his own political colleagues who rendered great service on the Committee. It is unfortunate that he was not prepared to notify those members who were associated with him of his attack tonight so that it could have been more ably and extensively answered than I have done. It is amazing that apparently there co-operation between members of the Liberal Party and members of the Australian Party. Tonight they criticised the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Whan) for not being here but notice has been given of motion tonight which takes about to read. I understand that the Country Party did not even want it debated until the next day of sitting and did not see fit to move that it be debated onight. If it is to be debated next week, why should the honourable member for Eden-Monaro raise the matter a week early when the Country Party did not even think it worth debating until next week? I ask honourable members opposite: Why do you not get together? Why do you not co-operate? Why do you not understand? The Leader of the Country Party (Mr Anthony) has given notice of a vote of censure of the Government in relation to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro but his supporters are going crook because we will not debate it a week earlier than he wants to debate it. How silly can you get? An honourable member who would talk under wet cement with weights on and who is one of those interjecting from the back bench on the Opposition side tonight wants us to debate this matter now when the Leader of the Country Party does not want it discussed for about another week. We do not mind. Why did he not move that we discuss it today? Why was not something done in that regard? Tonight a cowardly attack has been made on the honis no ourable member for Eden-Monaro a week earlier than honourable members opposite want Country the matter debated.",127
129,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order ! It being 11 o'clock a the House stands adjourned until Tuesday half an hour next at 2.15 p.m. House adjourned at 11 p.m. The following answers to questions Amnesty International Conference for the Abolitio n of Torture Mr Snedden asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: Will he make public the message he sent to the Amnesty International Conference for the Abolition of Torture.",128

The meeting stressed the impact of trade union actions on the Island economies and expressed the hope that trade unionists in Australia and New Zealand would increasingly take into account the implications of their activities. It noted with interest the possibility of involving trade unions in economic and budgetary planning. Indonesia: Devisa K r e d it Scheme (Question No. 15) (Question No. 13) Mr Snedden asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) Has the Government decided to discontinue Australian participation in the Devisa Kredit Scheme for Indonesia.

(5) Will the Government give an assurance that aiil to Indonesia will not decrease.",129
133,Mr WHITLAM,ANSWERS TOQUESTIONSUPONNOTIC E,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the right honourable member's question: (1) and (2) No. (3) Yes. Owing to Indonesia's increasing oil revenues little need is now seen for assistance of the foreign exchange support type provided by the Devisa Kredit Scheme. (4) In 1973-74 Devisa Kredit assistance from Australia amounted to about 8 per cent of the total (Question No. 10) Australian aid to Indonesia. (5) The Government intends to honour the present three-year aid pledge of $69 million to Indonesia. This does not end until mid-1976. Federation of Consumer Groups (Question No. 39) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Science, upon notice: What is the Federation of Consumer Groups.",129
134,Mr MORRISON,ANSWERS TOQUESTIONSUPONNOTIC E,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: The Interim Commission for Consumer Standards convened a meeting in Melbourne on 23 February 1974 which was attended by representatives of 27 consumer groups. They agreed to proceed with the establishment of a Federation and appointed a steering committee to draw up a constitution for further consideration. It is envisaged that the proposed Federation would be a focus for consumer opinion and would advise the Government on consumer matters.

135,Mr WHITLAM,ANSWERS TOQUESTIONSUPONNOTIC E,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The question of political prisoners is one that lies within the domestic jurisdiction of the governments concerned.

137,Mr WHITLAM,ANSWERS TOQUESTIONSUPONNOTIC E,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 1. The Director-General of the Australian Development Assistance Agency exercises his functions subject to the directions of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. This provision ensures coordination between foreign policy and aid administration, and enables the Minister to establish a requirement for consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs. 2. Formal machinery for consultation exists in the Interim Committee of the Development Assistance Advisory Board (pending the passing of the legislation necessary to establish the permanent Board) and the Inter-Departmental Committee on External Aid, on which the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs or his nominee is represented. 3. To supplement these formal links, liaison arrangements have been established between the Agency and the Department to ensure adequate consultation on a day-today basis. Submissions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicate that such consultation has taken place. The Secre. tary of the Department of Foreign Affairs has, with the Minister's approval, asked the Public Service Board to approve the establishment of an aid section in the Department to facilitate this co-ordination. 4. The execution of Australia's aid programs is of close concern to Australian diplomatic representatives in recipient countries. In accordance with established practice, staff of the Agency serving overseas (unless on assignment with international organisations) are under the direction of the Head of the Australian Mission. Aid officers have the normal responsibility to keep Heads of Mission informed of their activities and to consult appropriate mission staff on matters which have foreign-policy implications. The Head of Mission must be given an opportunity to study and comment on any recommendations being made to the Agency which concern proposals for new forms of aid or significant modifications fo existing aid activities.

138,Mr WHITLAM,ANSWERS TOQUESTIONSUPONNOTIC E,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 1 and 2. Generally the foreign-aid functions merly administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs have been transferred to the Australian Development Assistance Agency. The Department of Foreign Affairs maintains its close and continuing interest in aid policy and works in co-operation with the Agency and other relevant Government Departments and instrumentalities in this policy area. Exchange Control (Question No. 327) Mr Snedden asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Has an inter-departmental committee been established to investigate the transfer of Australian money to trustee companies operating outside Australia. (2) If so, what is the composition, charter, and time-table of the committee. (3) If not, is the Government undertaking some other study of this matter.",131
139,Mr WHITLAM,ANSWERS TOQUESTIONSUPONNOTIC E,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) See reply to (1). (3) No. In a statement on 25 October 1973, the Treasurer announced lhat one of the steps being taken by the Government to combat tax avoidance and evasion by Australian residents through the use of so-called tax havens was the screening by the Taxation Office of exchange control applications tween Australia and the New Hebrides. Exchange control approval is not given to transactions between companies and persons in Australia and the New Hebrides unless the Reserve Bank sights evidence that the Commissioner of Taxation does not object to the proposed transaction. Australian money being transferred to trustee companies in the New Hebrides would be embraced by this general screening process. Tibet: Visit of a Parliamentary Delegation (Question No. 508) Mr Wentworth asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to my remarks during the last Parliament suggesting a visit of a Parliamentary delegation to Tibet (Hansard, 23 October 1973, page 2570). (2) In view of the fraternal arrangements arrived at between the present Australian Government and the Communist Government of China, would he anticipate any difficulty in arranging a visit by Members of this Parliament to Tibet. (3) Wiil he make immediate approaches to his friend Chairman Mao to ascertain whether such a delegation could be arranged. (4) If so, will he make arrangements for the delegation so that the rumours of oppressive events in Tibet, which I mentioned in my remarks on 23 October 1973, might be appropriately refuted or exposed.",131
140,Mr WHITLAM,ANSWERS TOQUESTIONSUPONNOTIC E,"The answer to the honourable for- member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, by this question. (2) and (3) Formal diplomatic channels, not a direct approach from me to Chairman Mao (who is Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and not, as the honourable member erroneously stated on 23 October 1973, Chairman of the People's Republic of China), would be the appropriate way to arrange a visit by an Australian Parliamentary delegation to China. It is the practice for two delegations to be sent abroad every year. As a delegation visited China only some 12 months ago, another visit to China is unlikely to be arranged for some time. (4) See answer to (2) and (3). Government Price Control (Question No. 158) Mr Lynch asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice: (1) What goods and services are subject to Government price control in the Australian Capital Territory.
