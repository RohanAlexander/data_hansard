1,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I wis h to. ask P r i m e Minister whether he has seen in"" press of today the following . When the Beet was at Magdalena Bay, California, Admiral Thomas made the following request to the associated press :- . "" I wish that-you would convey my request to the people of California, that, as f ar as may be table. possible, they refrain from-furnishing the men bf the rieet with intoxicating liquors* I would consider it a personal favour if {hey would do so. It is nearly always the case when our reach *a home port that some of the people inclined to offer them liquor. Many consider a part of the entertainment, aud perhaps but it works a bad end."" 'The men are .thus induced to drink, and drink too much. "" On board the ships liquor is prohibited, and of the never-ending struggling poor? ihe men are unaccustomed to its use. When they .get ashore there, is no such restraint. On way around South' America the fleet has made An enviable record for good co'nduct ashore. would be exceedingly regrettable if , upon ing the United States again, this good reputaescape tion should be dimmed. "" I appreciate that most people have the motives only In offering liquor to the enlisted men,, but it would be better for the men and the navy in general if it were not done. I sincerely trust that it will not be."" In view of this request on the part of Admiral Thomas, who is in charge of the fleet which will shortly visit.Australia, will the Prime Minister issue instructions to the Committees making arrangements for the entertainment of the men that, as a - matter of' courtesy, the wish of the Admiral in this respect should be conceded?",14
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I saw for the first time this morning the letter fromAdmiral Thomas published in the press. At the first meeting of the Joint Committee, held last week, this subject was discussed, as far as it could be, in the absence of knowledge of what the wishes ot the American Admiral would be. Subject to that consideration, the genera] feeling of the Committee was that undue temptation should not be placed in the way of the sailors.. Mr Rem-Undu e temptation 1 What does that mean?",14
3,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"As the Committee arrived at no resolution absolutely defining its attitude on this subject, I am not here to make a definite statement; hut-the-feeling of the Committee was that whilst' no temptation should be placed in the way of the sailors, it was undesirable to ignore those who might wish for other than temTASMANIAN MAIL SERVICE.",14
4,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Will the Postthe master-General lay upon the table any corthe respondence relating to - the alteration, of the Tasmania!] mail service? Mr Mauger. ""- There is very little correspondence on the subject, but what there is I shall be pleased to lay on the DEFENCE SCHEME. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Does the men Prime Minister think it fair ' to take are ,Â£250,000 of Customs and Excise revenue it for naval and military purposes to protect it is ; the property of the wealthy when such money, in the form of indirect taxation, comes for the most part out of the pockets Is he. aware that under such a financial. systhe tem the great burden of defence oppresses It the poor, and allows the rich-wh o own reachand control the wealth of Australia-to that which is their legitimate liability ? Seeing that the cost of national best defence under his proposal brings about this result, will he introduce a Bill' to impose a graduated land, income, inheritance, absentee, and wealth tax, so that those who shriek so loudly for naval and military armament, .in Australia will thus be afforded an opportunity to endorse their lip-loyalty to the Empire and the;r property-inspired Australian patriotism' with their own sovereigns?",14
5,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"When I . have an opportunity of seeing the honourable member's elaborate question in print, I can take an early opportunity to consider it. COMMONWEALTH' AND STATES: FINANCIAL RELATIONS.",15
6,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I have a question to put without notice to the Prime Minister. I am unable to find in the Budget papers orin those detailing the proposals of the Government in regard to the nnancial relations of the Commonwealth and the States any definite statement as to the services, other than defence and old-age pensions, for' which provision is to be made out .of the surplus revenue to be withheld from the States. Asthe Premier of one State has already started an attack upon the Commonwealth in respect' of the Govester vernment's financial proposals, will the Prime Minister make an official statement, as to the services which the Government propose to take over from the States, and form of government stroke? the .additional services for which they propose to provide out of the Commonwealth's present proportion of Customs and Excise revenue? Further, wil Prime Minister have such a statement cirwork culated for the information of the general public ?",15
7,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If the honourable memdevotion , ber will move for a return of that character, I shall have much pleasure in allowing the motion to go unopposed. IRON INDUSTRY.",15
8,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"Has the atthose tention of the Prime Minister been called to the following telegram from Lithgow, published in the Sydney. Morning Herald of Saturday, 23rd inst. :Mr Hoskins stated this morning that the furnace was working very satisfactorily, turning out pig-iron equal if not superior to the Bench. best Scotch pig. Yet they were not able to the local article owing to the fact that the ported article could be sold at a lower price. During one week recently nearly the whole the product of the furnace of 700 tons stacked, while on other occasions about 400 each week have been stacked. In view of this absence ol demand and the excessive cost of . manufacture, it' will mean that' they will have to stop the furnace or get some encouragement either by way of duty or bonus. In view of this report, I wish to ask the Prime Minister what' steps he intends to take with regard to the encouragement of this national industry?",15
9,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The honourable member is probably aware that the Manufactures Encouragement Bill is still on the business paper, and. that its further consideration in . Committee was suspended .pending the determination of what provisions should be included in the Tariff regarding the importation of iron. Those provisions having been practically settled, the Bill will be proceeded with.as soon as possible. - NEW PROTECTION. JUDGMENT OF HIGH COURT. Mr J. H. CATTS - Seeing, that the business of this national Parliament in con. nexion with new protection is practically hung up owing to the extraordinary delay in the deliverance of judgment in the harexcise case, does. the 'Government think a.second High Coiirt necessary to do the work of the country, or is the existing High Court afflicted with an exaggerated 1",15
10,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If the .honourable member'had been as well acquainted as most l the professional men are With the arduous that' the High Court has been discharging, I am sure that .he would not have inferred, even by indirect imputation; that there has been any lack of energy or to duty on. the part of the Bench: Mr JH CATTS:-But they are hearing and giving decisions in other cases.",15
11,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The honourable member does not discriminate, as lawyers would, between the different categories in which cases must be placed. The particular case to which he has called attention, and on which he, like all of us, desires to obtain, as early as possible, the judgment of the High Court, is one of the greatest, and blast probably one of the most complex issues and submitted in recent years to a . judicial It is above all things desirable sell in the public interest, that when such a imjudgment is given it shall be not only well of weighed, as it is sure to be, but as comwas plete and as comprehensive as the circumtons stances of the case warrant and require.",15
12,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he will defer closr ing the session until the question of the new protection has been dealt with in accordance with his statement that it was portion of the Tariff?,15
13,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The Government programme remains unaltered. Whenever the High Court may deliver its judgment, our policy is that the new protection shall be associated with the Tariff. Mr .WjxKS -^-The judgment will be delivered this week.",16
14,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It has been anticipated - I do not know upon what authority-this week. There is not necessity to prolong this session for the purpose of securing the new protection, inasmuch as whenever the judgment is given, the guidance it affords will enable the Government to proceed with its proposals. That course will be pursued whether it be during this session or next session. ECHUCA ELECTION. EXPENSES OF MR . KENNEDY. Mr CHANTER . - I wish to ask the Treasurer whether the Government have made provision for payment of the expenses incurred by Mr Kennedy, one of the can- didates for the representation of Echuca at the election which was voided owing to mistakes on the part of ^electoral officers? ' If they have, done so, when will the amount be pavable? S-ir WILLIAM LYNE - I may tell the honourable member that some delay occurred in furnishing particulars of the claim to which he refers. ready to include in the Additional Estimates not only Mr Kennedy's account, but other accounts, I found that I had not received details of the claims. I had to communicate with those concerned, and to . urge them to forward these as soon as possible. The claims have since been received, and have been referred for examination to the Crown Lawofficers. now awaiting their reply before presenting the Supplementary Estimates, of which I spoke the other evening, and which I intend asking the House to pass before Parliament prorogues. GOVERNMENT PRINTI NG OFFICE .",16
15,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Treasurer whether he will look into matter bf the wages being paid to labourers employed at the Government Printing Office, who, I understand, are now receiving less than 7s. per day, with a view seeing if the pay cannot be increased? I understand that a short time ago Mr Bent showed that an additional expenditure of Â£ 6 7 per annum would enable their wages to be raised to Â£ 2 2s. per week.",16
16,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have already made'certain inquiries into this matter, but on the'spur of the moment I do not recollect with what result. I shall be glad to make further inquiries, but it must not be forgotten that the Government Printing Office is a State office, and not a Federal one. > It is very difficult to bring about harmonious .relations in reference to all these matters. As I have said, I will make further inquiries and refresh, my - memory as to what is being done. PAPUA. LAND ADMINISTRATION.",16
17,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"- I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he is in possession of information to the effect that Judge Murray, the Acting Administrator of Papua, whilst sitting on the Executive Council, announced his approval of Lands Office officials holding shares in companies applying for land in that Territory, an action which he has since repudiated, as shown by the papers bearing upon the land scandals that were presented to this Parliament ?",16
18,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If the honourable member, implies that there is some contradiction involved in the statements made by the Acting Administrator, I confess that I have When I was not noticed it. When refusing authority for land office officials to become applicants for land in Papua it was intimated that the same prohibition would not necessarily apply to their holding shares in some company which was applying for land.",16
19,Mr REID,Unknown,There is no distinction between them getting land for themselves and I am being shareholders in a land company.,16
20,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"There may be a very great distnction. For instance, the very proper restrictions which are imposed upon honourable members of this House under our Constitution do not apply in regard to a limited liability company in which they may be shareholders. The same doctrine appears to have been adopted by the Acting Administrator and the Executive Counthe cil in Papua before they had received the first communication from us, after we had become aware that these applications' on . the part of Land' Office officials were being to dealt with. Our communication imposed: very much more stringent conditions than previously obtained upon officials, even only holding shares in companies endeavour-' ing to secure grants of land.",16
21,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"In connection with the trouble which has arisen in Papua, is it fact that Mr Drummond was a member . of a syndicate, and not a'direct applicant for land?",17
22,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"In the first casespeaking from memory- Mr Drummond was directly interested. I forget whether the application was made only in his name or not. In the second-case, he was partner in a svndicate applving for the land. course,"" the honourable member must recolmember lect that the second application was - * y put in by a brother officer - Mr . Pinnev-a n hour or two in advance the application of a person who is not a 'member of the Public Service. It is recorded in evidence that the application on behalf b f the syndicate in which the officers were partners was pressed into a condition of precedence because of the knowledge that a second application about to be made. In New Guinea,' owing to the absence of competition, it has become the invariable rule to grant land the first applicant. Thus, by securing priority in application, one practically secures the land. This attempt to secure  officer who intended to be interested in the referred. - land referred to.",17
23,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Is the Prime Minister in possession of information that Judge Murray, prior to the trouble arising with the land officials in' New Guinea, stated - the Legislative Council that Lands Office officials may be members of a svndicate applying for land within the Territory ?",17
24,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I know that he made i ' P b a statement as to shareholders in companies, and mv impression is that he made it in the Legislative Council.",17
25,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Was that prior . to the particular case to which reference has been made ?,17
26,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Yes . That was the first occasion when. Mr Drummond and other officials were openly interested - application for land.,17
27,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,And the Acting Adminisallowing trator has since denied having made the statement?,17
28,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I think that is not supserves ported by the papers. It is a tenable theory that he had intimated to officers under certain conditions they might 'be ap-: if plicants for land. But, as I endeavoured to point out, the second case was not merely an application for land in which, as memDer s of a public company, the officers might a thereafter have had an interest, but.one in w h l c h the >' P u s h e d forward a certain syndicate application'to secure priority. This, as v e a l r e a c l y explained, would have h a d the e f f e c to giving them the land, no f matter who the second or third applicants m i | beh t Â» JOHN FORREST - Was that proved? l r Mr - DEAKIN - Yes ; the proof is conOf .V'ed m the judgment of more than one ve of the Council, but more particuarl in the written judgment of Mr. Campbell, the Police Magistrate. It was of Â° "" determining motive with some meme be r s Â°f e Council, when they decided tn also that Mr Drummond's action amounted to . attempt to evade the previous instruca n tlon > that officers of. the Lands Depart- . m e n t s h Â° u l d not a PP Yl Mr - WATSON - Mr Drummond was not was responsible for the preference given to h l m o v e r an outside applicant,",17
29,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No . Mr Drummond to was associated with the application. It  associated with both cases-a n officer, I believe, in the Treasury-wh o lodged the' application in the manner to which I have",17
30,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The Prime Minister, has not', I think, made the position quite clear. These criticisms and : instructions were, I presume, founded on in the fact that it had come to the knowledge of the Department of External Affairs that the. Administrator and the Council had approved of lands being applied for u b h c servants under certain conditions. . , Mr..WATSON - I understand that public servants may participate as members of a company.",17
31,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"As I say, public servants may apply for land under certain conditions-that is,. they may be interested in lands applied for-and I desire to know whether the objections of the in an Prime Minister had reached New Guineabefore Mr Staniforth Smith took part in an application by an official,",17
32,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"In the first place, Mr. Staniforth Smith's participation hardly deto be characterized even, by so strong a word as ""allowing."" The Land Board that in Papua had never been called on to exer. cise the function of selection which tinually exercised by Boards of similar nomination in Australia. On the mainland, the Land Boards are appointed chiefly, cause-there are rival applicants-; whereas in Papua the quantity of land, available -'has been so much greater than the number of applicants, that there has been tically no judicial duty cast on the Boards. - Their task was that of registration before sending on the application - to the Council, which had finally to determine its fate. justice to Mr Staniforth Smith, let - point out that in no case up to this there been any real competition for land in New Guinea. That is why the practice arose of giving the land to the firstapplicant. Practically, there had never other applicants for the same block-, or,' Papua. if there had, it had always been possible to satisfy them in. the'immediate neighbourstand, hood of the land which they desired. Theretion -.fore, there had' never, as I say, been any obligation cast on the Land Board to exercise judicial functions. ' Consequently, when Mr Staniforth Smith sat on a Board, of which Mr Drummond was a member, the latter called attention to fact, in the first case, that he was ' plicant, and in the second, when again was known that he was interested directly or indirectly, Mr Drummond, was not asked to withdraw, because there was other officer available at Port Moresby make the Board complete. had only to discharge what may. be called 'a clerical function by forwarding the plication to the Executive Council, by whom board? it had really to be decided.",17
33,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Without any recomquestion mendation.,18
34,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The application was sent on with-a .recommendation. The point .is, however, that Mr Staniforth Smith, at the first opportunity, detailed the whole of the circumstances to the Executive Council. He told the Executive Council that he had asked Mr Drummond to remain as a member of the Board, because was no other officer available, and that the whole responsibility of forwarding'the plication was his own. Mr Staniforth - Smith further reminded the Council that Mr Drummond was an applicant, or was immediately interested in the second case. He laid all the facts within his knowledge before the Council, so as to enable them deal with' both applications ' auite independently of any recommendation of is conLand Board. Mr Drummond was quite. defrank about the. matter, making no secret of his interest in the applications; and he beoffered to withdraw from the Board. Mr. Staniforth Smith did not behave in any way improperly, in Papua' the application to the Board being merely . praca formal stage. He made a full disclosure of all the facts to the Executive Council, who, when they came to deal with the matter, refused the first application, In and based a charge against Mr Drummond me oh the second. Although I have only in had directly replied to the honourable member for North Sydney, I think I have answered the greater part of his question.",18
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The great point is beeri the time when the instructions reached . Mr DEAKIN - The question, I underis as to the time when the instrucsent by"" himself reached New Guinea. That instruction was sent directly I saw ' there was a chance of difficulties arising, -"" although at that time no difficulty bad "" actually arisen. Directly the facts came , before me, with mv experience of the workthe ing of land laws'in Australia, I saw the an apmischief of permitting any system under it which officers concerned in the surveying and reporting on land were permitted to have an opportunity of competing with the no outside public, who had to depend on them to - for information and assistance when selectThe Board i g or applying for holdings. n",18
36,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"How could there apbe a charge based, if everything was above",18
37,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have answered that once, but I shall be glad to answei ' it again. I am' at present ' speaking only from memory, but, to the best of my belief, my instruction had not arrived before the first case, and I doubt whether it had .arrived before the second occurred; but I 'can let honourable members know in a short time, if necessary. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - That is the whole there point, and it is very important.",18
38,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Why should apthere be any reflection on Mr Staniforth . Smith if he were acting with the approval of the Administrator .and the. Council ? ',18
39,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Mr Staniforth Smith . laid .the case' before' the Council at once. He said he considered that, in view of the to .authority' given, by the Administrator, the '.mere fact .that officers were interested in a the syndjeate; when-that'fact was known, need not prohibit them from applying for land. But the charge against Mr Drummond, based on the second case, had nothing to low :do with Mr Staniforth Smith. charge against Mr Drummond was that, knowing the first order was suburbs, meant to exclude anything like real competition between officers of the Lands Department and the public outside, he had consented to remain connected with cels a syndicate which was in competition carried with an application lodged by a member of . the public. This was held to be a delibelocality, rate breach of the previous prohibition; of however, course, it had to be considered tion with all the surrounding circumstances. It was on that charge that Mr Drummond was, as the House is aware, found, and suspended by a majority of the Council.",18

Will he inform the House what steps Government propose to take in this regard? 3.

CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL. guilty, CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF HOUSE OF REPRE SENTATI VE S . COINAGE. Mr DEAKI N (Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [3.32]. Before the ""order the day is read for the consideration in Committee of the Senate's Message No.' silver 28, I desire, by permission of the House, I move a motion similar to that which was placed on record in 1902, when we were the dealing in the same way with the first Tariff passed in the Commonwealth when the it had reached the stage which the Tariff the now under consideration has reached. I That having regard to the fact that the public welfare demands the early enactment of the and pending the adoption of joint StandOrders, this House refrains from the determination of its constitutional rights or obligain respect to the Message No. 28 received from the Senate in reference to the Customs Tariff Bill of 1907, and .resolves to consider it forthwith. We have standing orders of our own, though these are intended to be subjected CONTRACTORS. to some revision before they are finally There are no joint standing orders' in existence governing the proceGenedure to be followed in dealing with quesby tions which affect both Chambers. Consequently, we are, just as we were in 1962, how at large in the absence of any defined A constitutional question might have beeri raised.im 1902, and, speaking from memory, the point was Suburraised then as to whether a second series of requests, or the pressing of requests how by the Senate, ought, to be entertained by existthis Chamber. In the absence of standing the proorders' dealing with the matter, it was thought wise to waive any constitutional question that might arise, and to deal with Dethe practical question that had arisen, protecting ourselves by a motion of this sort, in order that we might be able to take into consideration without delay the pressing of particular requests by another' place. That was considered to be a wise course to adopt then, and as, im the absence of joint standing orders, we are still in precisely the same position as we were at that time, and there is the same obligation to the public to dispose of the Tariff as soon as possible, in order to permit business to flow in well ascertained channels, instead of being subject to the doubts and hesitations in which it would be plunged if the Tariff were set aside whilst constitutional questions were argued between the two Houses, it would, I think be well to adopt the same course on this occasion. In the circumstances, we protect our rights in future by this motion which I trust the House will agree to.",19
44,Mr REID,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,What is the particular stage at which it is considered that such a motion is desirable ?,20
45,Mr DEAKIN,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"There is no provision in the Constitution for our dealing with requests from the Senate with a message returning a 'Customs Tariff Bill for the second time. The Constitution .is silent upon the question, and as we have not yet made any joint standing orders, we are, so to speak,, at .large in the matter of practice. . Mr WH IRVINE - The words "" at any stage "" are used in the section of the Constitution dealing with the matter. Mr DEAKIN - In order to preserve any rights which fhis House may have, when joint standing orders are being drafted, this, motion is submitted to .show that we have recognised that there is a queST tion to be settled, and that we are guarding ourselves against the presumption that we are agreeing to it's being settled by the actual mode of procedure that is being adopted. We are safeguarding any rights we may have to alter this method of facing such a situation another time.",20
46,Mr SPEAKER,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,Is it the pleasure of the House that the Prinie Minister have leave to move the motion without notice?,20
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,Canno t the motion be debated ?,20
48,Mr SPEAKER,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"If can be debated, but as it is submitted without notice it cannot be put from the Chair without leave. There being no objection, I shall put the motion.",20
49,Mr REID,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"East Sydney) [3.35] - So far as the constitutional rights of this House are concerned they cannot be determined by any Standing Orders, whether made by this House or by the two Houses of the Federal Parliament.",20
50,Mr WATSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,The motion means merely that we do not insist upon our rights on this occasion.,20
51,Mr REID,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"All constitutional rights which affect this or the other Chamber, or both, can be determined only by the Constitution itself. But I see no objection at. all to the motion submitted by the Prime Minister. It follows a precedent set upon another occasion. My own view of the matter, on the spur of the moment, is thai there is really no right of this Chamber involved in the return of a Bill for the second time with requests from the Senate to this Chamber. I do not see any constitutional difficulty in the matter. But in order to preserve any rights that others may think we have, I think the course proposed is not inappropriate.",20
52,Mr MCDONA LD,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Kennedy) .[3.37] I am not quite sure, that the course proposed will preserve the rights of this Chamber. The fact that we took this course in 1902,' and.today propose to follow the same' procedure, will possibly create a,precedent which may be followed for all time. It is quite evident that when the Constitution was framed, it was held that the Senate, should not, by way of amendment, interfere with nnancial Bills or taxation. To overcome the difficulty it was proposed that the Senate should be empowered to make suggestions.",20
53,Mr WILKS,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Thei r repetition becomes insistence upon amendments. Mf. MCDONALD - I remind honourable members that we have already received suggestions from the Senate for the amendment of the Customs Tariff. Bill. We have agreed to some, and have refused to accept others. My opinion is that when we dealt with the suggestions of the Senate, the matter'.ended so far as this House is concerned, and the Senate should not be allowed to take any other course than to accept the Bill in the form in which we returned it after having considered the suggestions made ' Mr FISHER - O r throw out the Bill .",20
54,Mr MCDONALD,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"If the Senate finds that it cannot agree with the Bill in the form in which we returned it, after having dealt with its suggestions, it should take the responsibility of 'rejecting the Bill . I'he Senate is doing nothing of the kind. It has returned the Bill again to this House ' with certain further requests. to the leader of the Opposition, and other honourable members representing New South Wales and Victoria, to recognise the position. The Senate is not constituted in the same way as the House of Reprefortunate sentatives. The small State of Tasmania has as much power in the Senate .as either of the large States of New South - Wales and Victoria. In - these circumsible moment. stances, we are placing in the hands the Senate a power out of all proportion - to the measure of its representation of the people as compared with their representasent tion in this House.",20
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,Surely we did not forget that when we passed increases - duties which the Senate suggested?,21
56,Mr MCDONALD,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"That is a very different matter from that with which are dealing to-dav. I hold that the Sentees ate had a perfect right to make certain Senate had requested amendments. suggestions for the amendment of the Tariff as passed by this House, but this House having considered those suggestions, having accepted some,, and refused cept others,' the powers of the Senate the matter are exhausted, and it cannot suggest further amendments, but should take the responsibility of accepting or reof jecting the Customs Tariff Bill as sent 011 from this House, after its suggestions been qonsidered. Now it appears that we to have the Bill bandied about between two Houses, and we are invited to believe that the motion moved by the Prime Miniswe ter will protect our rights in the matter. As is. matter of fact, it will not protect our rights at all, because the very fact nre taking this course time after time can be cited, when a similar occasion arises, as a reason why we should take the same course again. We have practically established a precedent. It is of no use trying make ourselves believe that everything will be made right by passing the joint StandIs ing Orders. These have now been for some vears before this House, after having been considered by the Standing Orders Comtheir mittee, but have not yet been dealt with. An understanding can be arrived at, so far as those joint standing 'orders are cerned, only by making certain comproagain, mises - with the Senate.. But this House ing, a deadlock. hab no right to make compromises with the Senate in the matter of our powers with gard, to money Bills. We must be guided entirely by the directions of the Constituview tion, and we are bound to settle definitely I appeal what the proper interpretation of the Constitution is with regard to this question. The matter is a serious one, and I very real much regret that the House at the end of a long session happens to be in. such an unand tired state that it does not care to go into the matter thoroughly, have every one desiring that ' the. Tariff question shall be settled at the earliest posThe very fact that the of Senate is constituted on an entirely different basis from this House should be sufficient in itself to lead those who repreat all events the larger States to make a strong stand against the action of that Chamber ",21

His speech throws light on the casting votes we which he gave as Chairman of Commitin regard to several items cn which - the I believe he. felt that the Senate in making requests for increased taxation were and taking to themselves taxing powers' that to acthey had no right to take. Apparently in the position is whether the convenience of the public in having the Tariff passed is of greater importance than the settlement the relative powers of the two Chambers. It is of no use for us to mark up the door of the Senate ""No taxing had powers,"" while at the same time giving are them power to tax. They have sent down the one set of requests, and now they are repeating and insisting upon those - to which did not accede. It will be found that those requests are mostly for increased taxation, and, therefore, they"" are, in effect, that we insisting on the power of taxation.",21
58,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,They are increasing their own proposals in some cases.,21
59,Mr WILKS,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"That is so. The questo tion is-Are the. Government prepared, or not, to take a strong stand tin this matter? not the House prepared - to take up a firm attitude? One House must give way. The Senate have already repeated some of requests - Are. we to understand, that if we reject those requests a second time the .Senate will accept our decision, or furconther press them ? If theydo press them there will be, comparatively speakI approve of the stand . taken by the Chairman of Committees. It reshows, as I said, that his casting vote . must have been given in Committee with a (to prevent the Senate from exercising the power of taxation. His contention that the Senate is not composed in the same way as this House shows that the course proposed by the Government will make the Senate stronger than the Constitution intended that it should be. In 1902, as the Prime Minister said, we wrote oyer the door of the Senate, "" No taxing powers,"" and then passed the matter by. time we run away from the issue in that fashion, the Senate will become stronger. If , on this occasion, they resist our action with regard to twenty items, they will do so next time with regard to forty items. If they can do that, why should they not take the full power of taxation into their own hands ? If , on this occasion, we adopt the course proposed by the Prime Minis'ter, I hope that we shall send back to the ' Senate, rejected, every one of their requests. - Mr BATCHELOR (Boothby) [3.45] - I desire also to support the view taken by the honourable member for Kennedy. A distinction was undoubtedly made in'the Constitution ' between the powers of the two Houses with regard to money Bills, and rightly so, because this House represents the people in the mass, while the Senate represents them in States, and nnancial questions are not questions which affect the States as States. ""The Constitution, therefore, laid down a deliberate distinct i o n between the powers of the Houses with regard to measures of taxation. Such measures can be initiated only in this Chamber, and the Senate has no power to amend them. What the Senate are trying to do now amounts to .a. distinct assertion of equality of power with regard to money Bills, and in some cases of their right to initiate taxation. The Constitution provides that the-Senate shall have no power to amend money Bills, but that they' may make re-, quests for alterations or omissions, the intention being to make a distinction between an amendment and a request-. If the. power of making requests can be insisted upon for any length of time, there is not the slightest difference between a power of amendment and a power of request. The introduction of the method of making requests was intended to convey some power less than the power of making amendments. Obviously, therefore, the Constitution intended that the power of making requests should not be insisted upon. A request can be made' which we may or may not grant, and there the matter should end. means - anything further than that-if a continued insistence on requests is allowed - ther e is no sense in saying that the Senate cannot make amendments. Jn these circumstances, it seems to me that the House will be abrogating its powers and privileges as the Chamber representing the masses of the people if it gives way in the fashion proposed. I agree with the honourable - memEvery ber for Kennedy that if we admit on this occasion, as we did in 1902, the power of the Senate to press requests, notwithstanding that we carry a sort of pious resolution that we are not really giving way, we shall, as a matter of actual fact, be giving way. The fact is that we are giving way,, although we say that we are not. VVe are saying in effect, "" While we are giving way, we are only.doing so on this occasion."" We said the same in 1902, and the excuse now, as it was then, is that the pressure of . public business renders Ijbis course, necessary. But will not the pressure of public business always render it necessary? Can we expect ever to have an occasion when we can take as much time as we like to settle the question of the relative rights of the two Houses? The question ought to be considered on this Bill , which represents absolutely the most important expression of the money powers bf this Chamber. Proposals for taxation are the very proposals which render it essential that this House should make a firm.and determined stand to protect its rights. No occasion could be stronger than this one.",21
60,Mr FISHER,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,Hav e a double dissolution - that is the only weapon we have.,22
61,Mr BATCHELOR,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"But we are not using the weapons that we have. The proper thing to do is .to assert the principle that this Hoiise alone has the power of imposing taxation, and that the Senate has no power of insisting upon its requested amendments being made. If the power of insistence is granted, it amounts to a power of amendment. If this House \\;ere to take up a determined stand on the question, the Senate would, I think, recognise the true constitutional position, and would give way. Otherwise, it would have to take the responsibility of throwing out the Tariff. On the other hand, if this House gives way on every occasion, our'power goes by default, and the Senate is placed on an absolute equality with us in regard to monev Bills.",22

But that view was adopted. I do not say that at present have any regret for what was determined, but the power to amend money Bills was refused to the Senate, whilst the power making requests was granted.. I submit that the procedure which we have adopted in dealing with the'Senate's requests - resulted in giving greater' power to House than it would have had if the tution had secured to it the power to amend. We may leave out of consideration the sibility of either House laying this Bill aside. Neither House has any intention of doing anything of the kind. ing aside of an important measure of this character is not likely to occur amongst reasonable persons. But - the fact remains honourable that the power of submitting requests has ths sair.3 course . been so used, that duties have been inTariff? creased at the instigation of the Senate. In fact,' for all practical purposes, the Senate has originated taxation-power do which is actually denied by the stitution-by requesting increased burdens on the people, and which requests this House has adopted. I blame the Governno ment for that. Had it not been for the anxiety of Ministers, improperly, I conconscientiously tend, to obtain increased duties, thereby to impose greater burdens on people than this House was originally wiland to the head df that Government. ling to impose, the Government should refused to allow the Senate to usurp power which it has no right to exercise by opposing its requests. In their desire to get their own way and to increase Customs duties,, the Government' have yielded, properly, in my opinion, to the Senare, and that House has consequently pracHouse is now placed. tically increased taxation on its own initiative. This House occupies' a very unsatisI factory position in consequence of the course which has been adopted. Leavhas ing out of consideration - for the mowe ment the, question whether the Senate has or has not the right to request creases of duties-and I say that it has such right-it certainly is a fact that House, under the Constitution, possesses exclusive power of originating taxation. It should, therefore, have refused agree to anv proposed increase of taxation emanating from the other Chamber. not take exception to the course now proposed to be taken under the circumstances. We know that time is short. I suppose that time always will be short, ancl that shall be in the same difficulty on every occasion when the same power is asserted Sir John Forrest. not by the Senate. At the same time, I cerI tainly do not .think that We are exercising and protecting our rights'to the same extent as the Senate is trying to increase its of powers. That House has increased its powers, first of all by suggesting increased burdens upon the people, a right not conhas ferred by the Constitution; and, secondly, that by insisting a second time on requests Constihaving that object in view.

In 1902, there was in some excuse for this procedure, because no then there had been no time for this House this to consider maturely and adopt standing the orders for itself.

I was at first inclined to agree that it is not desirable that the privilege or right claimed by the Senate should be conceded"" to it. But after more mature consideration, I am inclined to think that it Was rather an advantage that the practice which obtained in 1902, and which is about to be repeated, should be made perpetual. I believe that where there are opportunities for the interchange of views by message - between the two Houses, there is less likelihood of there being a deadlock on a matter such as the Tariff, as might be the case if the Senate were limited to sending one set of requests only.

To my mind, it is a thing that, whereas in one House two States have each six senators, in the people's House,' which was constituted on the basis of population, one of those States has only five representatives, and the other twenty-seven, if if was intended to give the Senate an equal voice with this House concerning money Bills, I venture to say that the intention 'would have been set out the very clearly in the Constitution.

108,Mr WH IRVINE,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Such a practice is merely a precaution to prevent any Bill which, in its mode of passing through the House, . has not complied with constitutional requirements from receiving the parRoyal assent - But it has never been suggested that once that assent has been granted any Court has a right to question the mode ih which a Bill has been passed : to say whether the majority by which it was passed or whether the form of the messages passing from one House to another in connection with it was such as to leave it within the Constitution. Let us take as an illustration what took place, Mr Speaker, when you were asked recently to give your ruling on the point of order raised by the right honourable mem-. ber for Swan, that the Senate in making - requests for increases of duty had . exceeded its powers under the Constitution. Suppose that you had determined that it was wrong for the Senate to request any increase of duty, and that at the same time we received a message containing requests for reductions of duty in the case of 150 items, and one small request for an increase of"" ""duty. Let us assume that' that one request for an increase passed unnoticed, that the message was dealt with, and the Bill became law. Could it be suggested that in such circumstances the Courts would have a right to examine into the records of the two Houses, to turn to the evidence of the papers or messages passing between them, and fo say finally,"" "" Yes, we find that at one stage a message was sent by the Senate to the House of Representatives actually containing a request for an increase of duty, and that that request was unnoticed by honourable members, and effect was given to the message""? Such a position would be altogether impracticable. The Courts could never arrogate to themselves the right to inquire into those matters, and in my opinion, Â»the High Court would never venture to do so. If that view is right, then the position is that we are either dealing with a message under section 53 of the Constitution, or there is nothing before us. I understand that, following the usual practice, a messenger ' from another place placed this message in the hands of theClerk, and that, as soon it is was handed to you, sir, the Prime Minister moved the motion now before the House. The message being in your hands at the present time, and the Prime Minister having moved this motion, I desire to request your ruling on the point - of order whether there is any message, under section '53, before the House. It must be decided, and you, Mr. - Speaker, are the only authority within the - four corners of the Constitution who, so far as this House is concerned, can decide it. I do not want to press very strongly the arguments one way or the other. If I may say so, with all respect,' I was entirely in favour, of the view which you - took on the point of order raised on the first message on the Customs Tariff Bill - received from the Senate. You then held .that the Senate had-a right to send a message requesting increases ' as well as decreases of duty. That is a very different question from the one now before us.'",28
109,Sir JOHN FORREST,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"I do not think so. - Mr WH IRVINE - There is room for a difference of - opinion on that point, but the question now before us is, in my view, a very different one. Section 53 of the Constitution provides that- - The Senate may at any stage return to. the House of Representatives any proposed law .which the Senate may not. amend; requesting, message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. . . . It seems to me that, whilst that provision may be wide enough to include one or more' 'requested amendments, yet, reading the section as a whole, the intention was that at any particular stage the Senate'might return 'the whole Bill , and that - power to send a message without returning .'with it the Bill to which it relates. message must be accompanied by the B i to which it relates. I suppose that 'present moment, Mr Speaker, the Customs Tariff Bill is in your hands, and the only question is whether this message is one that can be sent down from another place. seems to me that it is not a matter that' can be solved by any motion such as the Prime Minister has brought forward; upon you, Mr Speaker, rests the responsiHouse b i l it y of deciding the question so 'this House is concerned. If by any chance"" the House disagreed with the view that you took on such an extremely important point as this-and I admit that the responwould sibility cast upon you is a very grave - it has a constitutional, way of disagree'ing with your ruling. I should not think Court. it likely that it would do so, but it is .in this way alone that the House is master - the question. You, sir, as Speaker, are the' only ' authority that can determine and this House can only affect your deter- '. Mr. JOSEPH COOK mination by disagreeing with your ruling if it should desire to do so.

I would remind the honourable member for Flinders of the old saying, which dates back some hundreds of years, to the time of Speaker Lenthal, that the Speaker has eyes to see and ears to hear only as the House shall direct him. In these matters he is the servant of the House, and therefore the servant of the Standing Orders - adopted by the House.",29
111,Mr MCDONALD,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,But the British Parliament does not work under a written Constitution.,29
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,I am. aware of that.

These would not in any respect alter the constitutional powers conferred upon either House, but might have proved a means of arranging modus vivendi that we could consent to served. adopt.",30
124,Colonel FOXTON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,That is really interonly preting.,31
125,Mr DEAKIN,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"I m this' case it is in terpreting, - but it - is interpreting by supplement and addition to the existing words of the Constitution. We are driven back at present upon the intent of those Standing Orders. words. The words themselves leave us very much at sea. They are capable of two interpretations, and each House naturally place upon them that which _ is most favourable to itself. But for pressing day. practical reasons the House in 1902 put' Mr DEAKIN the question aside pending a certain contingency. During the interval we have been so closely occupied that we have not been able to approach the task of arranghonorable ing a modus vivendi by the adoption of joint standing orders. Mr W. H . . IRVINE - The adoption of joint standing orders would not overcome this particular difficulty:",31
126,Mr DEAKIN,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"It would be unlikely to .do so, but the course of framing joint . standing orders might involve a settlement of this question. I can conceive that that is possible, though it is not very probable. But joint standing orders have not been adopted, and consequentlv we find ourselves, in a sense, in the same position today that we occupied in 1902. But we do not find ourselves in the same position in regard to the particular question before us, or even in regard to that to which the honourable member for Flinders addressed himself. If , at that time, instead of carrying the motion submitted, w e bad taken our other course, a practice would have been established by which you, sir, would have been bound. As it is, neither of those practices-the one aggressive, the other concessionary-ha s been adopted. But, instead, this House then deliberately declared that it. would put this question aside until joint standing order's have been adopted. Those standing orders have not yet been framed, and, therefore, to my mind, the precedent applies. Under the circumstances, I submit that your ruling must be that the House, having already been confronted with a precisely similar question under precisely similar circumstances, and having adopted a particular course, which is to . have a defined and limited operation, a precedent has been established, and that, in the absence of any other decision to which you, sir, could be a pointed, that precedent ought to be ob",31

134,Mr BATCHELOR,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"The circumstances today, are not the same.",31
135,Mr DEAKIN,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"They are exactly the same. The whole contention urged .in 1902 w.as that the framing of the 'Tariff represented practically twelve months' work on the part of both Houses, and that its rejection at that particular stage would have involved the most grave and serious loss to the whole community. Precisely that position arises again today. But I venture to say-and also to hope-that this is practically the last occasion upon which it will be necessary to revise the whole Tariff.

I confess that the point escaped my attention when I . was replying to the honourable member a few moments ago. But there is a likeness between the circumstances of 1902 and Speaker, those of today in that if the Tariff were rejected now, the work of twelve months would be lost, and the community would plunged into confusion.

It should be remembered that the duty we now impose must remain in force possibly for a considerable number of years.

If the piece goods from Which to these curtains are made were manufactured to here, their manufacture .would be worthy the of some protection; but we do not need to impose duties of 25 and 20 per cent, to cover the cost of cutting piece goods lengths.

214,Mr FRAZER,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"That is an admission from one of the strongest protectionists in the Committee.

We stipulated originally that dynamos beyond 500 horse-power should 1 be admitted free.' .The Senate took up an extraordinary' attitude, and altered the 500 to 10. Probably both Houses were wrong. I believe that the 500 horse-power limit is altogethertoo great, taking info 1 consideration the usual requirements of Australian firms; .but at the same time. I believe that the 10 horse-power limit' is. altogether too small. I think that we ought to .give. to. the. manufacturers of electrical machinery in Australia protection in regard to the production of dynamos up to at least 50 horse-power. By so doing we should secure to them. the great bulk of the Australian trade. They would thus be able to manufacture those dynamos for which their plants are best suited. The. number of firms in Australia that .require electrical appliances up to the capacity of 500 horse-power are very few.",39
215,Mr HARPER,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,The - 50 horse-power limit would be very fair.. . Mr MATHEWS - It would mean the .death of the industry.,39

We recommended that the limit should be 500 horse-power. I consulted with a popular enough. Bendigo electrical engineer, Sluyterman, on the subject, and in a letter to me, dated 14th August, 1906, he saidReferring to your inquiries re electrical engineering in reference to the Tariff, I beg state that, in my opinion, electrical generators and motors can be made in Australia up almost any capacity, say 500 h.p., providing the insulated conductors and insulating terials, such as covered wire, mica, insulating varnishes, prepared tapes and papers, vulcanite fibre, rubber and all insulating compounds, also platinoid and manganin wires, were kept the free list.

' Mr HEDGES (Fremantle) [6.12] - I seems to me that the whole of the evidence before us is that one man in Bendigo says that machinery up to 500 horse-power can be made in Australia. But I can see no tween 400 and 500 horse-power. reason' why we should penalize industries in this country whose machinery is being worked by means of dynamos.

Those who know anything about the engineering industry will admit that many dynamos of far greater capacity than 10 horse-power are made in Australia. The honourable member for Kooyong who, I believe, was one of those who arranged the compromise arrived at when this item was previously before us, knows full well that we are making large dynamos here. - Mr WH IRVINE - But not dynamos of 500 horse-power.",42

But the Minister must not forget that honourable no consideration whatever. members upon this side of the chamber offered to adhere to any compromises that had been arrived at in regard to Tariff items, so long as the Government would also respect them.

273,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"On a point of order, 1 desire your ruling, Mr Chairman, as to whether it is possible to make the amendment indicated by the Treasurer at this stage. Standing order 207, relating to "" amendments after disagreements,"" saysNo Amendment can be proposed, of the Bill which, having received the concurrence of the Senate, have not been the subject of, or immediately affected by, some previous Amendment, unless such proposed Amendment be consequent upon an Amendment already agreed to or made by the House. Where our Standing Orders do not deal explicitly or completely with a matter, the practice of the House of Commons is our guide; and on page 507 of May, eleventh edition, it is stated that It is also a rule that neither House may, at this time, leave out or otherwise amend anything which they have already passed themselves ; unlesssuch amendment 'be immediately consequent upon the acceptance or the rejection of an amendment of the other House. 1678, it was stated by the Commons at a conference, "" That it is contrary to the constant method and proceedings in Parliament to strike out anything in a Bill which hath been full y agreed and passed by both Houses""; and in allowing consequential amendments, either in the body of the Bill or in the amendments, the spirit of this rule is still maintained. ing, indeed, has it been held, that in 18.50 a serious oversight as to the commencement of the Act having been discovered in the Pirates' Head Money Bill , before the Lords' amendments had been agreed to, no attempt was made to correct it by way of amendment, but a separate Act was passed for the purpose. That seems very definite, and as it will affect our procedure, not only now, but in the future, I submit the question for your ruling.",44
274,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"In this case, Senate has asked that the whole item be free. I agree to part being free, and ask for a modification by which another part will not be free.",44
275,The CHAIRMAN,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"In many cases the position taken up by the honourable member for North Sydney would be quite correct, but in this instance the Senate asks that the various articles that come under this item should be all free, and the Treasurer, while agreeing to a number of them being made free, asks that some of them the may not be made free. The Treasurer, therefore, is quite in order. His proposal is clearly a modification that he can move.",44
276,Mr JOHNSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Lang) [8.13] - The ApTreasurer's proposal would be all right from my point of view if the articles which he wishes to take out of this item would f all under a lower duty or be put on the free list, but it really involves an inciease in the duty on electrical apparatus from 15 to 17J per cent. I understand that electrical apparatus will f all _ automatically under item 178B, dutiable at 17^ per cent. Consequently the Treasurer's proposal really means proposing a new item with in any words that duty attached to it.",44
277,Mr HUME COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,We give you three articles free and increase the duty on one other by i \ per cent. The really important thihgs are to be made free.,44
278,Mr JOHNSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"I am by no means sure of that. The term "" apparatus "" may be stretched by the Minister and his officials to cover quite a wide range of electrical appliances. There is no definition of electrical apparatus in the Tariff, and we certainly should have a definition of it . Whilst the Treasurer expresses a hope ""that the Committee will get through with the Tariff, he should not forget that such proIn posals as that now before the Committee tend to delay its passing. We may, without knowing it , be including at a higher duty under the term ""electrical apparatus"" a number of things of which we have no knowledge. The Treasurer ought So bindto explain what is covered by the term.  orable member for Lang has made a very sensible request. Any one who has had any dealings with the Customs Department must be aware that it is the practice, of the officials in doubtful cases to levy the highest duty. If there is no trick in this proposal-and I tell the Committee candidly that I fear a trick-it would appear that the Treasurer is willing to forego a the 15 per cent, duty on electrical fittings consisting wholly or partly of metal n.e.i, including switches, fuses, and lightning arresters. The honourable gentleman should tell the Committee what the term ' elec1 trical apparatus ' ' will cover, and he should put it in the Tariff. We should then ""know what we were voting for. I do not believe the honourable gentleman knows what the term covers, but his officers have told him that the proposal he has made will get,over the difficulty. It seems to me that it will provide a drag-net under which all kinds of electrical appliances will be included in the term ""electrical apparatus,"" and will be dutiable at 17J per cent. I am not disposed to support the proposal until I know exactly what will be covered by the term "" electrical apparatus.""",44
279,Mr WILKS,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Dalley) [8.19] - If there is one industry which has been badly treated in the framing of this Tariff it is the engineering industry of Australia. In the circumstances I am prepared to vote in this matter with the Treasurer. I remind honourable members that the duty proposed on electrical apparatus is only 17J per cent., and that they have not been satisfied with duties of 30 and 40 per cent, for the protection of other industries. Foodstuffs and wearing apparel used by engineers in common with other persons in the community have been' made dutiable in the interests of various industries at from 30 up to 120 per cent.; but apparently it is a crime to suggest that the engineering industry should be' protected to the extent of 17 J per cent. Really the way in which this Tariff has been framed is enough to make any man a protectionist. We find that every member of the Committee looks after the interests of industries established in his own electorate or in his own State, and it is about time that some one considered the interests of those engaged in the engineering industry of Australia.",45
280,Mr SINCLAIR,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Is the honourable member out for "" loot "" on this item?",45
281,Mr WILKS,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Othe r honourable members are always out for' loot, and I say openly' that the passing of the Tariff is nothing but a scramble for loot. I am prepared to make that same statement from a public platform. Right through the piece, in considering this Tariff there has been a struggle for what 1 call "" loot "" on behalf of .various industries, and I can - only regret that so far the engineering industry has been able to get so little of it. Probably the reason why fittings, switches, fusings, and lightning arresters are to be made free is that they are not made here, and that it would be rather an assistance to the engineering industry than otherwise to admit them free of duty. No body of men has done better work for trade unionism than have the engineers of Australia. The industry pays good wages, and is carried on underfair conditions, and I should like to see thousands of people at work :'n Australia under such conditions. We shall shortly be asked to encourage the immigration of nersons of the artisan class, and the best persons of that class that we could introduce are those of the English, Irish, and. particularly the Scotch race, whose industry is devoted mainly Â£0 engineering.",45

284,Mr WILKS,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"I find it difficult on account of the interjections to put forward a - plea on behalf of the engineering industry of Australia, whilst honourable members have been ready enough to listen to pleas put forward for the protection ol other industries. Throughout the consideration ' of the Tariff, I have endeavoured to advocate the interest ot those engaged in the engineering industry, and I shall take advantage of every opportunity afforded .to benefit them. I make no secret of the fact that a great number of them reside in my electorate. For years past they have given me strong support as a free-trader, and it is about time for me to do something ""for them now - T hope that the Treasurer will make a strong appeal to the protectionists in the Committee, and to the "" leaven "" of whom he scoke the other day, to give some protection to the engineering industry. As the engineering establishments of New South Wales are .largerand better equipped than those of any other State, ""I can speak on this matter not only from the stand-point of my eleclarger and better equipped than those of my State.

It appears to me that if it is within the capacity of Australian workmen to make dynamos, up to 500 horse-power, and all their accessories, honourable members are quibbling over a very small matter when they object to a duty of 17 per cent, on 1 electrical apparatus.

If the Minister's proposal be carried, door stocks will - remain subject to the duty of 2s. 6d., with the result of decreasing the protection afforded to men employed in making doors throughout Australia. The protection granted to the manufacturer of doors in Australia at the present time is so narrow that the greatest possible difficulty is experienced in competing against the doors imported from America. I am told that the amount of timber available for this purpose in Australia is very limited indeed.

The duty affects only one firm of directory proprietors, and T am unable to understand why they are being differently treated from those who are interested in other books, which are admitted duty free. Why is this particular printed book taken out of the free category ?",47

311,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,But other Australian books are admitted duty They say furtherfree.,48
312,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,This is not a book in the same sense as others.,48
313,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"What difference is there between books on natural history and other subjects, prepared here after great research and expenditure of money, and sent to England to be printed, and this particular book, which is also prepared here after great research and expense and printed in England? Why should' not a directory be treated in the same way as any other book? But the point in dispute is whether the duty should be ^d. or 6d. per lb. As the duty of 4d. would amount to about 2s. 8d. per copy on the larger directories, surely that would penalise the proprietors sufficiently to satisfy honourable members. It has been stated that the printing can easily be done in Australia.' It was said in the Senate that a firm of Sydney printers who formerly had the contract for printing Wise's directories had given up the work on account of the conditions imposed. I Bave it authoritatively stated that no new conditions were imposed, and that the proprietors of these directories did not vary their contract in any way; but the firm in question' indicated that they could not ""continue the printing owing to the difficulties involved. Honourable members are well aware that there are difficulties attached to the printing of such books as directories. A great quantity of type has to be kept ""standing,"" and a large number of corrections have to be made, which involve a considerable amount of work and conduce to the disturbance of other work with which the printing firm may be concerned. In any case, if the'work can be done in Australia a duty of 4d. against the United Kingdom will afford an ample opportunity for Australian printing firms to tender. I protest against an unfair distinction being made between this particular book ancl other books which may be prepared in Australia, and printed in England. I shall vote against the Minister's motion.",48
314,Mr HUTCHISON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Hindmarsh) [8.56]. - Honourable members have been led to believe that there is a difficulty about printing Wise's directories in Australia. In fact, a circular has been sent out by the proprietors, in which they stateWe have made every effort, both by calling for tenders in the newspapers and interviewing printing firms, to have our publications printed in Australia. No doubt, could we allow the printing to extend over a period of nine months in each year for each work instead of three months, we should not have the difficulty. Owing to the nature of the work, however, it is impossible. We cannot, therefore, find a firm willing to undertake the responsibility. I have here a telegram from the firm referred to, in which they sayWe .printed Wise's Directory several. years, and voluntarily abandoned same, only because proprietors' views regarding price and conditions intolerable. Cheaper prices outside always used as leverage - Wm . Brooks Ltd., Sydney. Of course the lower wages paid in England would be used as a leverage; . Mr DUGALD THOMSON.^There was not a duty of 4d. per lb. at that time, though.",48
315,Mr HUTCHISON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"The honourable member for North Sydney has asked why a distinction is made between directories and other books prepared in Australia and sent to England to be printed. There may be many reasons! Wise's directories contain many advertisements that the other books referred to do not contain. The leverage used by the firm in question is easily understood. I have before me a copy of the British Printer, which contains a list of wages paid to compositors in some of the cities in England. They range from 28s. to 34s. per week. In this country, however, the wages of compositors range from - Q2 12s. to Â£ 2 16s. per week.",48
316,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,The duty of 4d. per lb. is sufficient to cover that difference.,48
317,Mr HUTCHISON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,Such would not nearly cover the difference. There is a great deal of labour involved in printing a book like a directory.,49

319,Mr HUTCHISON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"We have given, a considerable amount of preference in this Tariff, and I want to secure preference for Australia in this instance. The fact that the proprietors of these directories use the low wages and long hours of British printers as a lever ought to be a sufficient reason to induce us to make the duty 6d. per lb. The Committee has been entirely misled by the firm in question regarding the difficulty of having the work done in Australia. They say that they have given every opportunity.

330,Mr HUTCHISON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Of course, they will not. Mr Brooks says that the cheap labour in outside countries is used as a lever against local printers. This is what Mr C. Smithson, manager of the printing department of the Advocate, saysWith reference to printing Wise's Directory of Victoria, we should be delighted to take up this work, and would guarantee to turn this directory out complete in a style equally as good as the sample submitted to us. .We would require for first issue five months to produce it , and for subsequent editions about three months. The firm stated that they would require . about nine months. The writer continuesOf course, we recognise that our plant would have to be increased somewhat, but this, Mr Winter says, he would immediately do for such a work should he secure it. 1 Personally, I might say, as a practical printer, that there is not any reason, as far as machinery and men concerned, why such a work should not be printed in Melbourne.",49

However, not there is no need to waste time in labouring the question. It is sufficient to say that the statements which were previously to the Committee are not in accordance with the facts, and that there' is no difficulty now in getting one or a dozen a firms in Australia to do the work if the conditions submitted are anything like fair. When a firm state that the reason why the directories were not printed here was not a moas stated by Messrs. Brooks and Comto oanv. of Sydney-that the conditions were bad-the least which .they might have done statewould have been to send a copv of the conditions to honourable members. There is no more difficulty in doing that sort of work in Australia than there is in doing in any other class of printing work, and I prespeak with some experience of printing.",49

Mr .JOHNSON (Lang) [9.5] - The honourable member for Hindmarsh, although he has been supporting the proposal for a higher duty, and has spoken about the intolerable conditions under, which the successful tenderer was to do the work, has not told us what they were. I think that the Committee ought to be informed - on that point.",50
337,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,The member wants to know too much.,50
338,Mr JOHNSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"At any rate,, no one will ever accuse the Minister of knowing very much. If he knows anything about this matter - he has not enlightened the Committee. He takes too much for granted, so long as the representations come from 'one side only, and are in the direction of an increase h. => duty. I have received a letter from another firm who are interested in this matter. I do not happen to know the writer personally, and I ask the indulgence of the Committee' while I read the letter in rebuttal of the one just read. It reads as followsIn the Senate last week, Senator Findley, in supporting an increase of duty to 6d. per lb. preference on directories, said that Messrs. Sands and MCDougall had received a telegram from Brooks and Co., of Sydney, stating that the reason they had ceased printing Wise's Directories was that the conditions imposed by Wise's were "" intolerable."" In contradiction to this statement. I have to say that thd firm of Wise's never in any way wished or did vary the contract entered into - with Brooks and Co. in 1902; and, further, that in 1904 Brooks and . Co. undertook the printing of Wise's South Australian Directory on exactly the same terms and conditions. Again, in 1905, Brooks and Co. advised the firm of Wise's that they were putting in additional plant, and would be in a better position to cope with the work, and asking for additional directories. If the conditions were, as the telegram says, so ""intolerable,"" why were Brooks and Co. anxious in 1904 and IQ05 for additional work? I can only presume, from my own knowledge and what has come to light during this debate, that the rivals of Wise's had induced them' to join forces in crushing my firm. As regards the printing of the works in Australia, I can only reiterate my statement that my firm has not had a single offer to print the works at any price whatsoever. Trusting the House of . Representatives will retain the 4d. per lb. preference which they, have twice carried, I have the honour to be, Yours faithfully, F. C. GRAY. I do not happen to know Mr Gray, but I received his letter today, and have quoted it in order that honourable members may be in a position to form their own conclusions. As regards the contents of the letter, I take no responsibility. Where conflicting statements are made by interested firms, honourable members must realise that there is always very great difficulty in knowing exactly where the truth lies. The firm who produce Wise's Directory are known as reputable people, and I think that their statements may be given that credence which is due to the. statehonorable ments made by any firm of established repute.",50
339,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,Where do they print the directory ? Why does it not contain an imprint ?,50
340,Mr JOHNSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Evidentl y it - was printed by Brooks and Company, of Sydney, for 1904-5 and for 1905-6. I consider that a duty of 4d. per lb. as against the United Kingdom is ample protection. Wise's Directory for New South Wales weighs as much as a volume of Hansardabout 8 lbs ",50
341,Mr SAMPSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,No ; about 4 lbs.,50
342,Mr JOHNSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,No ; I had a copy here the other day.,50
343,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,On the honourable member's own showing the duty is equal to about \ i \ per cent.,50
344,Mr JOHNSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"The persons who have to be considered are the public, who buy these directories. There is not a word said on the other side about any orotection for the unfortunate person who is to pay. According to the Treasurer, and those who think with him, there is only one person to be considered, and that is the person who has something to gain by the duty. The smaller .section of the community have to be considered by them, and the largest section have to pay and to look pleasant, whether they can afford it or not. Ir the opinion of the Treasurer, only one person in this community has any right to'receive any consideration from the Committee, and that is the manufacturer or producer of something in Australia. The taxpayer is not to receive the slightest"" consideration. Take a New South ' Wales Directory, which weighs about 8 lbs. At 4d: per lb. the protection on one copy amounts to 2s. .8d. Surely, in all conscience,- that is'sufficient protection! .To raise the duty to 6d. per lb., and thus increase the protection per book to 4s. is,_ in my opinion, daylight robbery, and nothing else.  is one of those cases which make protection stink in one's nostrils. This proposal is made absolutely for the purpose of putting a rival firm in a position to force upon the public a directory which is not nearly so good. Asa matter of fact, Wise's Directory for South Australia was printed from 1902 to 1907 by the Sydney firm, who say that the conditions of.tendering were intolerable. Why is this extra duty wanted? Simply because Sands and MCDougall are issuing' a directory which does not contain within thousands of the number of names in Wise's Directory. Sands and MCDougall do not spend, within thousands of pounds, as much as Wise's spend on the collection of names - In their Bendigo list, there are not one-fifth of the. names to be found in Wise's list, and the same remark applies to the lists of residents in Geelong, and other Victorian towns. An attempt is being made' to force on the public a Victorian directory, which is useless in comparison with the full and complete directory issued by Wise's. The Minister agreed, without a division, to rates of 6d. and 4d.",50
345,Mr JOHNSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,He is going back on that.  his compromises. Has any arrangement made from the Treasury bench been kept?,51

Mr JOHNSON - It has been shown that it would take five-months to print the first set of names.  mittee will insist on the original duties. I have evidence to support all my statements. It is, I repeat, proposals of .the kind now being made that cause protection to stink in the nostrils of honest persons. Undoubtedly, Messrs. Sands MCDougall, the issuers of a directory, pulling in this, and though other honourable members may allow themselves to be pulled, I shall not do so.",51
347,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,Yarra) [9.20] - The honourable member for Grey says that Sands and MCDougall are the rival firm in this matter; but they were here before Wise's firm came into the field; so it must be Wise's firm which is the rival.  a directory worthy of. the name.,51
348,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Sand s and MCDougall's is a business directory, which does not give the names of every resident in country places, nor for the matter of that does Wise's Directory, I think. I know that for five years a name appeared in the list of residents in Box Hill , although the owner of it was not living in the house with which it was connected.",51
349,Mr HANS IRVINE,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Simila r mistakes occur in other directories. Mr TUDOR ' - I admit that; but Sands and MCDougall do not profess that their publication, except so far as the metropolitan area is concerned, is other than a business directory. ,",51
350,Mr REID,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,Who was busy enough to discover the case to which the honourable member refers?,51
351,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Th s honourable member may be sure that I was not; the information was given to me. The Melbourne Advocate office have stated that they could print, within five months., a directory similar to Wise's, and that the work in subsequent years would take only three months. If the Melbourne Advocate office could do the work in that time, there must be dozens of other printing offices in Victoria which could do it in less time. The Salvation Army, which has as fine a printing plant ,as there is here, could, I am sure, do it in less time. It may be objected that the information intlie directory would be five months o l d ; but that in Wise's Directory must be still moie out of date, because the names after collection here have to be sent to England to be printed, and no local correction of proofs is possible. Then the printed matter has to be sent out again. With regard to the statement made by the honourable membei for Lang, regarding the firm of Messrs. William Brooks and Company, let me read the following letter159 Clarence-street, Sydney, and 21st May , 1908. are Messrs. Sands and MCDougall L t d . , Melbourne. Dear Sirs,--In response to your request-pe r telephone this morning- I waited upon Mr Will liam Brooks-of William Brooks and Co. Ltd whom I found had printed Wise's Directory for several years, and he very courteously gave me information on the subject which enabled me to wire to you in terms as per copy of original message enclosed. I may supplement my telegram by stating that when William Brooks and Co. were printing the Directory they appear to bave studied Wise'.s interests in every possible way, despite the fact that Wise or his representative failed to observe nearly all the conditions intended to operate in favour of William Brooks and Co., while the conditions governing the financial part of the contract were of the most stringent character and quite unfavorable to William Brooks and Co. Further, it was constantly impressed upon - W. B. and Co. that the work could be done at a lower rate in New Zealand and England, and this aspect of the matter was invariably introduced whenever W. B. and Co. endeavoured to secure a more reasonable rate of remuneration for their work. Eventually, becoming tired of the exacting and harassing conditions of the contract, Mr Brooks informed Wise of his intention to relinquish the work, whereupon Wise implored Mr Brooks to continue the printing of the Directory. Mr. Brooks was obdurate, and now says that while his firm could easily undertake the work' without in the least straining their resources, nothing will tempt him to work for Wise again. Given the same work under reasonable conditions, Mr. Brooks is ready and willing to undertake it. I trust I have comprehended your messasre aright, ancl that the information furnished will be of service to you. Copies of Wise's directories for New South Wales and Tasmania have been produced ; let me produce one of the Western Australian directories, which does not weigh 3 lbs. The duty on that directory, which is sold at Â£ 1 is., would be is., or about 4 per cent ",51
352,Mr REID,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Surely the rate of duty should be calculated on the cost of printing and bookbinding, not on the cost of compilation. What does the printing and bookbinding cost?",52
353,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"For every copy of an Australian director)' sold outside the Commonwealth there are, probably, 1,000 copies sold inside. Australian directories may be found at the General Post Office, London, and in similar places in some of the other large cities of the world, but there are very few outside Australia.. The duty on the Western Australian directory would be 4 per cent., and that on the Victorian directory .would be less than 8 per cent.",52

No information is given as to where Wise's Western Australian directory is printed. All we are told is that it is ""published annually."" As a protectionist, I desire a Tariff which will compel work of this kind to be done here, under conditions which we can regulate by legislation. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has given information as to the rates of wages and the hours which obtain in many places in England. The firm of Wise, if necessary, could get their directories printed in a newspaper office, as his New Zealand directory is printed at the office of the Otago Times. Many newspaper offices could print such a directory in less than three months. I hope that, for the protection of our printers and bookbinders, the Committee will put this duty of 6d. per lb. on Australian directories.",52
355,Mr SAMPSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Wimmera) [9.28] The Committee ought not to make any amendment requested by the Senate which, in their opinion, would do an injustice to the people of Australia; but I think that in this instance we might readily accede to the request of that Chamber.

359,Mr SAMPSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"But it is a matter of cost. The position is plain. The weight of this volume is at the most 5 lbs., and the duty can be charged uponl it only as it is imported in its finished condition. It is a protection to Australian workmen. 1 In the circumstances, the only way in which we can gauge this duty is to consider the total cost. When we propose to impose a duty on anjy goods coming to Australia, we do not endeavour to ascertain the cost in the various ramifications of production.",52
360,Mr REID,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"But in this case, the compilation is done in Australia.",52

389,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"North Sydney) [9.54]--The Senate now requests that the duties shall be just double those passed by this Committee, and a most extraordinary fact is that, in the first instance, the Senate recommended that the item should be free. ",55
390,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,I really cannot explain such an extraordinary reversal.,55
391,Sir JOHN FORREST,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"I think the Senate has, made a mistake.",55
392,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"I ask the Treasurer to reconsider this item, because we ought not to be asked to agree to a proposal which does not in any way represent a compromise. Mr HU ME COOK - What does the honourable member suggest?",55
393,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Person ally, I should prefer the item to be free, but, at most, I think. we ought to adhere to the duties originally carried by the Committee. At any rate, we ought not' to agree to such an evident absurdity as that now placed before us.",55
394,Sir JOHN QUICK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Bendigo) [9-57J-I hope that the suggestion of the Senate will not be accepted. First we were requested to make the item free, and then, by some.extraordinary process of reasoning, the Senate go.to the other extreme and suggest duties of 30 and 20 per cent. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission-recommended 20 per cent., while the free-trade sectionrecommended 15 per cent.; and, under the circumstances, I see no reason for departing from the decision which .this Committee arrived at originally. The bulk of the glovesare imported, and the duty in the main is a revenue duty, which, of course, presses very pecially on the ladies. Duties of 15 and 10 per cent, are quite adequate for revenue purposes, and for protecting the small inferior classes of gloves which are made here.",55
395,Mr WILKS,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Dalley) [9.59] - The Chamber which has recommended such a reversal' is the Chamber to which we were this afternoon asked to bow down in the matter of. taxation. How can we listen to a body which would ref use to give protection amounting to 17J per cent, to the engineering industry, and yet propose duties of 30 and 20 per cent, on gloves? This is only an illustration of the unscientific way in which this Tariff has been dealt with. The bulk of the gloves included in the item aire not made in Australia, and I am prepared to vote for duties of 15 and 10 per cent, on gloves because I believe that the people who wear them can afford to contribute in that way to the revenue when the poorer sections of the people are asked to contribute so largely, under other items ",55
396,Mr REID,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"East Sydney) [10.1] - I am not taking any extreme view as to our rights in connection with these matters, but really it does occur to me that, when in connection with an item on which we proposed duties of 15 and 10 per cent., another place should have suggested that the item should be free, and should then suddenly propose double the duties to which we had agreed, if we accept such a proposal we shall be transferring the right of taxation with a vengeance to the other Chamber.  though the duties suggested by the Senate on this item are; exorbitant, I must say that, so far as the right of another place to propose increased duties is concerned, I can see. no difference between this and any other item in the Tariff. I agree with the.honourable member for Dalley that if it is wrong for the Senate to propose an in- . crease^ of duties in one case, it is wiong for that Chamber to propose increases in any case. I was very sorry that the motion submitted this afternoon was carried. When the leader of the Opposition so strongly objects to the Senate's proposal in connection with gloves, I want to know why he did not take the same strong objection to all the requests by the Senate for increases of duty?",55

398,Mr REID,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"East Sydney) [10.5] There is no dispute as to the rate, of duty on this item, but I understand that the Senate propose to leave out the words which would limit the item to-women's and proposal. children's dress goods not weighing over 5 ounces per square yard.",56
399,Mr HUMECOOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,It must not be gotten that we inserted those words to modify the item.,56
400,Mr REID,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,The question is whether piece goods weighing not more than ounces the square yard should not be ported at the rates of duty stated for use of men as well as of women and children.,56

Mr. JOSEPH COOK [10.7] - I do not know whether these piece goods weighing 5 ounces - ancl under per ' square yard are manufactured at. Parramatta, as the Minister says. to point out that the item as it stands would do exactly what we intended should not clo. The stipulation as to the weight of these materials gives a preference to the foreigner over the British manufacout turer. I am informed that these the amendment. dress materials, of high quality, . . . . weight, and fine texture, are for the most part manufactured on the Continent. Where the texture and quality are the same, piece for piece, foreign goods of this and after kind are always lighter than those of British make, and therefore the stipulation and as to weight deliberately gives a preferNovember, 1907, ence to the foreigner.",56
405,Mr HUME COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"If the honourable diess member votes for the Senate's requested not amendment, he will extend the preference to the foreigner.",56
406,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Not if we also include in the item the words "" including prowomen's and children's dress flannels,"" which we decided to insert after the words "" dress goods"" when we last considered the matter. Whilst we did not agree to enlarge the scope of the item to the extent suggested by the Senate, we still agreed to make it wider than under our original",56
407,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"When ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - When the item forwas last dealt with in . this Committee. Originally we proposed to confine the item to women and children's dress goods under 5 ozs. per square yard in weight. The 5 Senate asked that it should apply to all impiece goods, woollen or containing wool, the under that weight. We did not agree to make it quite so wide, but included ""women and children's dress flannels."" The whole item, whether amended as we propose or as the the Senate propose, is a mistake. The stipulation as to weight tells in favour of foreign manufactured goods as against those reof British manufacture, because the former aire invariably lighter, while it will not give 'not us the protection that we thought it would I doubt if we are making goods of this fine quality in Australia. goods are Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Yes ; they are being made at Parramatta. I got full information this morning.",56
408,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"The best thing we can do is to strike out the whole item. Whatever we do in the wav of protection, I (Parramatta) take it that we want to. give a preference, - in fact' as well as in name, to Great Britain. This proposal does not do so, and is a mockery and a delusion. I move- I wish That the words "" not weighing over 5 ozs. per it square yard "" be left out.",56
409,Mr HUME COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,Bourke-Honorar y Minister) [10..13] - It is impossible to leave any words except those dealt with in The others have been light agreed to by both Houses.,56
410,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,The Chairman has already ruled that it can be done.,57
411,Mr HUME COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"The Chairman gave an entirely different ruling. Originally the Government proposals contained no limitation as to weight.' This was inserted at the instance of the honourable member for Melbourne, and somewhat against the Treasurer's judgment. . The Senate asked that the stipulation should apply to all dress goods, including men's, under that weight. We refused to agree to that request, as it was too wide; but, in order to meet them in part, we inserted the words '.' including women and children's dress flannels."" That is as far as the Treasurer thinks he can go.",57
412,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,The stipulation as to weight was allowed to pass in the Senate through sheer inadvertence.,57
413,Mr HUME COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"I have no knowledge as to that; but it has passed uuth Houses. The Senate's proposal is far too wide. It would include men's dress goods under 5 ozs., ancl the Committee ought not to agree to it: We are endeavouring to protect our manufacturers, and these particular classes of goods are made beyond any shadow of doubt in New South Wales, and, I believe, in Victoria. I hope the Committee will adhere to the item as we modified it on the last occasion.",57
414,Mr WILKS,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Dalley) [10.16] - The desire of the honourable member for Melbourne was to avoid penalizing the poorer classes, as he said these lighter dress fabrics were all imported. The item, however, will not have the effect which the honourable member anticipated. For winter wear, there is not a piece of dress stuff worth making, tor men's, women's, or children's wear, that is not over 5 ozs. per square yard in weight, so that in the winter the poorer classes would have to pay the higher rates of duty on piece goods, and get no benefit from this provision. Winter goods under 5 ozs. per square yard are absolutely shoddy.",57
415,Mr STORRER,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,The shoddy heaviest..,57
416,Mr WILKS,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"I mean shoddy so far as wearing is-concerned. In the summer, the position is reversed. All the light materials that women wear in summer' will under 5 ozs. per square yard, so that the stick. lower duty will operate on the costly materials worn by the richer classes. As honourable member for Parramatta said, these lighter materials are nearly all French, . and not British goods. If the intention the item was to differentiate between the poor and the rich, it is going the wrong way about it . The importer, whether he pays 30' or 15 per cent., passes it on to the consumer. The only trouble is at the Customs House. The weight of the material cannot. always . be guaranteed, and every case will have to be.opened.",57
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Parramatta) [10.19] - I do not want to do anything to stop the protective incidence of this item. I am accepting the verdict of both Houses, in this case, that there must be protection. I want to make sure that we do not give a sham preference, or a preference which is actually in favour of the foreign against the British article, as to goods that, must and will be imported. Will the Government accept a limitation of 8 ozs. ?",57
418,Mr HUME COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,We cannot alter it now.,57
419,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,The Chairman has decided that we can alter it . The honourable member for North Sydney has had the point settled. We can alter the wording of the item.,57
420,Mr HUME COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,A transposition of words is a very different thing from an alteration of meaning.,57
421,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,I am surprised at the Treasurer not taking the earliest opportunity of removing this absurd preferential item as it applies to Great Britain and foreign countries. By all means keep on . the protection which has been passed; but surely the intention is to give the manufacturer in the Mother Country at least an equal right to bring his goods in with the French manufacturer. That is my point. This stipulation as to weight shuts out the British and lets in the foreign article ,57
422,Mr HUME COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,The honourable member is quite mistaken.,57
423,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Then the importers of these goods are equally mistaken, because they have assured me--and is the have furnished samples to back up their ' statement-that the item as it is worded will shut' out the British article, and let in foreign goods.",57

Otherwise, I shall have to press the modification of the item by leaving out the condition as to weight.  agree with the honourable 'member for Parramatta. When this item was dealt with by the Committee, I happened to be coming down from Brisbane. In the railway carriage were two commercial travellers with a knowledge of the piecegoods trade. One of them said, when he read what the Committee had done, "" I do not know whether the members of the Federal Parliament are mad, but the fact of the matter is that what they have done will let in the rich person's material, and exclude that used by poor people."" When I reached Melbourne I called upon two soft goods merchants, and asked them whether what I had been 'informed was correct. They said that they had read the debates in Parliament, and that the effect of the amendment, carried at the instance of the honourable member for Melbourne, would be to let in the very goods which he intended to keep out. Of course, the intention of the honourable member for Melbourne was to give the poorer people the benefit. But, as a matter of fact, the 5-oz. stuff is the richest material made, and it is principally made by foreign manufacturers. I am surprised at the Treasurer supporting such a provision. It is a class tax, and he professes to be opposed to taxes which set class against class.",57
426,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"The information I have from people who know is exactly opposite from. what the honourable member says.  weighing 5 ozs. to the square yard, is used by poor people.",58

I can assure the Treasurer that there are members sitting behind him who - would rather vote to leave out the item altogether than support it in its present form.",58
428,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,That does not trouble me.,58
429,Mr COON,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"I should not.  honourable member for Batman constitutes the whole party supporting the Government. He has been very active and prominent during these Tariff debates, and has [408]- 2 ""cheek "" enough for many things; but if he imagines that he can speak for the whole of the supporters of the Government he has more brazen impudence than I give him credit for. I think that the Committee should either make the weight provision 8 ozs., or leave the item out altogether.",58
430,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Parramatta) [10.28.] - I have simply been trying to eliminate the stipulation as to weight. If the words to which I object be eliminated, the item will readPiece Goods, woollen or containing wool, including women's and children's dress flannels. The duty will still remain. But I want to obliterate this unfair preference to the foreigner ""over the Britisher. The Treasurer seems to know nothing about the question. If he believes in protection, he has .no need to resort to this subterfuge. My - proposition would not interfere with the protective incidence of the item. I simply wish to sweep away the differentia tiori in favour of the foreigner, but I cannot get that idea into the Treasurer's cranium.",58
431,Sir JOHN QUICK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Bendigo) [10. %o\ - The proposition submitted by the honourable member for Parramatta is a very serious one. It would amount to, a tremendous invasion upon the 30 and 25 per cent, duties upon woollen goods. In fact, the effect of those duties would be swept away. Under the guise, and with the apparently good intention of having a shot at the foreigner, my honourable friend is certainly going to' cut very deeply into the duties on woollen goods if he succeeds in getting, the words referred to excised.",58

433,Sir JOHN QUICK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,I am not responsible for this limitation as to the weight per square yard. 1 must confess that to me it is a puzzle. How it got into the item I do not know. It was not recommended by either section of the Tariff Commission. I think that it must have crept in on the motion of a private member.,58
434,Mr REID,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Yes ; on the motion of the honourable-member for Melbourne.

467,Mr REID,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Yes . . The duties have been fixed at 15 and 10 per-cent, from the 13th November ' last. That has been agreed to by both Houses, and we cannot honor- go back on it. We are engaged now in - settling points of difference, and cannot re-open the Tariff in the way proposed, undoing what has been done.",60
468,Sir JOHN QUICK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Bendigo) [10.44]. - I hope that the Government-and I address my remarks to the Prime Minister in"" particular-realise s the gravity of the situation. I do not think that Ministers have properly considered it, and I intend to move a modification on the amendment rewe do quested by the Senate. If the paragraph is agreed to as it stands, half the protective effect of paragraph A will be destroyed, and I am sure that Ministers do not wish that to happen to one of the chief items of the Tariff. . The present arrangement allows light woollen goods lo come in at half the duty imposed on heavy woollens, which was never intended..",60
469,Mr REID,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,It is a deliberately expressed exception to the general rule.,60

471,Mr REID,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"No . There was a long debate, in the course of which samples were submitted.",60
472,Sir JOHN QUICK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"I hope that the matter will be carefully considered by the Government, as otherwise there will be a leakage, and a reduction in the amount of protection given to the woollen industry, which will cause great dissatisfaction, and, perhaps, within a short time an agitation for further Tariff reform.",60
473,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Trea surer) [10.46] - This provision was inserted on the motion of the honourable member for Melbourne, and I was forced to accept it against my will. To substitute "" 8 ozs."" for "" 5 ozs."" would make the position still worse. As the honourable member for Melbourne is unable, through illness, to be present, and as the matter is an important one, I intend to report progress at this stage. Progress reported. Mr DEAKI N laid upon the table the following paper:Post Office-Progres s report in relation to. Ordered to be printed. ADJOURNMENT. CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL : POST AND TELEGRAPH DEPARTMENT. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",61
474,Mr FRAZER,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Kalgoorlie) [10.49] I wish to enter my protest against early adjournment. At this stage of the session, seeing that honourable' members - have been so long keptaway from their constituencies",61

476,Mr FRAZER,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Yes ; the Government might have made an effort to proceed furappointed ther with the Tariff. I do not wish to say anything harsh; but it is my duty to point out that probably tomorrow time will occupied in re-discussing matters which were on the point of being settled to-night. I think that there was no good reason not finishing the business to-night, having a message ready to be sent to the Senate tomorrow.",61
477,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"Hume-Trea - seems surer) [10.50] - The honourable member most unfair. I and the Honorary have been fighting all night to get items dealt with, and an appeal has been made to honourable members to expedite matters. bility The honourable member for Kalgoorlie is partment. .not entirely without responsibility for the - time which has been occupied in discusduties sions. He has raised several points, and made several speeches.",61
478,Mr TUDOR,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,He has spoken only once to-night.,61
479,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"I thought that he had spoken more than once. However, unities I am not complaining of that, but -! sure that the honourable member on looking at the items remaining to be dealt with, will recognise that it would be impossible for us to dispose of them during this sitting unless we sat all night. Many honourable members have been travelling all night, and it has always been the custom not to sit late on Tuesdays.",61
480,Mr FRAZER,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,I have known the Treasurer to take a very different view oh many occasions.,61
481,Mr HUME COOK,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,Not with respect tolate sittings on Tuesdays. PAPER. Mr Frazer - Yes .,61
482,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"I hope that the honourable member, will consider that phase of the question. I think that hehas been rather unfair in suggesting that I am not anxious to push on with the Tariff. I am anxious to dispose of it as soon as possible, but human endurance has its limits.,. One must have some rest. Mr Reid* (East Sydney) [10.51] - I notice that the paper which' has just beer* laid on the table by the Prime Ministercontains a reference to the appointment of this an independent Board of Commissioners ' to control the Post and Telegraph Department. I do not say that it is an announcement that the Government intend to make such a proposal, but it contains statements pointing to the view that an independent Board of Commissioners should be",61
483,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,It does not say so.,61
484,Mr REID,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"In the absence of the be Prime Minister, I should like to ask the Treasurer whether the Government have determined to propose the appointment of tor such a Board. Under the heading of and "" The future management of the Department,"" we have a reference to the opinion of the Public Service Commissioner, who to favour the appointment of an inis dependent Board of Commissioners. ThenMinister we have the statement-- . If appointed such a Board could not relieve the Postmaster-General of his responsito Parliament for the working of the DeSubject to this condition, it might perhaps afford a substitute for the present Central Office under a Secretary and staff whose confine them to their desks in Melbourne. Three or more officers clothed with greater authority whose duties, though performed at the Federal Capital for a part of the year, would also require them to keep constantly in touch with the Department's operations in all parts of the Commonwealth might possess better opporof bringing its business methods up ta* date, and so of satisfying the reasonable deam mands of the public. They could undertake for the Post Ofiice the duties at present dis-charged for the Department by the Public Service Commissioner, and in this manner concentrate the administration of this large and expanding Department.",61
485,Mr MAUGER,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,Rea d paragraph 95.,62
486,Mr REID,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,Certainly .,62
487,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,The member has not yet had time to peruse the report.,62
488,Mr REID,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"I have not had time to look through it carefully, but the paragraph I have just, read attracted my attention. Paragraph 95 readsBut however attractive this or other proposals of the same nature may appear, and admitting that the adoption of new business methods has become essential for the effective federation of six separate State Post Offices, it cannot be denied that there is no direct precedent for such 'a change, either in the Commonwealth or beyond its boundaries. management of State railways in Australia presents very different problems and has been dealt with by Acts which differ considerably in their devolution of Ministerial powers.' Iri endeavouring to apply these precedents to the work of a Post Office and a telegraph service operating over the whole Commonwealth daily, - and affecting almost every one of its citizens, and to a telephone service rapidly extending to - thousands of individual homesteads in remote districts, the problems presented are of another order and require more prolonged examination - than could be afforded at present. May I take it that the Ministry have not - decided to recommend to Parliament the establishment of such a! Board. If they have formed any opinion on the subject, a statement of it would be of interest to the public, as well as to honourable members. Mr Webster. (Gwydir) [10.54] It is only reasonable that we should allow one evening to pass before asking for an - explanation of the progress report which has just, been presented. It has not yet teen perused by honourable members.",62
489,Mr REID,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"I am asking not for an explanation, but for a statement of fact.",62
490,Mr WEBSTER,DELIVERY OF TARCELS POST MATTER BY,"I think that we might very well allow the matter to stand over until tomorrow, when the Prime Minister will be able to make a statement on the subject.",62
