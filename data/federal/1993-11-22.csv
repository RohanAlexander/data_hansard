2,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Treasurer and I refer him to one of his' predecessor's press releases of 10 October 1991 in whiCh he made it clear that: Caucus opposes any level of foreign voting equity above 20 per cent in newspapers. I also refer the Treasurer to his statement 23 April 1992 when he said that he would block any further foreign direct investment Fairfax above the then 20 per cent limit. happened between 23 April 1992 and April 1993 to change the Treasurer's mind?,11
3,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,On 14 December 1992 the government received an application on behalf of Mr Black's interests in which he sought to increase his holding in Fairfax from 15 to 25 per cent. The authors of this applicainterest tion apparently decided to publish this fact per because it was reported in the press on 15 cent. December. Mr Black followed up this applicashareholder tion by speaking to me on the phone a days later. At that stage I had not seen his application and simply confined my remarks foreign to. pointing out to him the FIRB procedures and to indicating that his appli-ation would be handled in the normal way with the Foreign cent. Investment Review Board proyiding advice me. I received the advice from the FIRB on Christmas Eve and I was offered essentially increases two options: either to reject the application being inconsistent with the then existing policy relating to foreign ownership of mass first time: circulation newspapers or to issue what is called an interim order under the appropriate legislation to allow the government time to further consider the matter. I chose the option of issuing an interim order. Mr Downer-Why?,11
4,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Which was published on made 20 January. I conveyed this advice to Black at about that time without engaging in any discussion with him about the merits or otherwise of his case. The interim order would provide a period of up to 90 days, which time the policy options could be considered . and the necessary consultation carried out with colleagues, particularly bearing in mind the earlier decision of the government and the earlier decision of the caucus. In the event, little was done prior to the calling of the election, at which stage I believed it was inappropriate for the government to give further consideration or at least to make a policy decision on this' matter; Upon the re-election of the government, I on prepared a submission to the cabinet which set out to review the policy for foreign ownerin ship of mass circulation newspapers, and the What government made a decision. The decision was announced in a press statement by me on 20 April 1993. I am happy to table that press statement. The press statement stated: The Government has agreed to the Telegraph increasing its shareholding in Fairfax from just under 15 per cent to 25 per cent. With foreign Hellman & Friedman having an active five cent involvement, the total foreign interest involvement will be at the maximum of 30 per While the Telegraph will be the largest single in Fairfax, Australian investors wi\l sti11 few hold the majority of shares in Fairfax. The Government has determined that a single investor can have a shareholding of up to 25 per cent, and unrelated foreign interests can have (non-portfolio) shareholdings of up to five per . to The press statement concluded with this sentence: The Government will not countenance further in the permitted level of foreign involveas ment in mass circulation newspapers. Mr Downer-That is what you said the",11
5,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for Mayo. He has been continually interjecting. The Treasurer is giving an answer. The honourable member will listen to the answer.,11
6,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When the government this decision, the primary and, indeed, Mr sale argument advanced in my submission was on the basis that Mr Black, at this stage, was contemplating an expansion or a reinvestdence ment in Fairfax. The total investment was the order of $400 million, which involved investment in capital, printing facilities and the introduction of some new technology the Fairfax business. The argument was advanced that, in order to protect Mr Black's investment at a time when this major reinvestobservations ment was going on in the,company, it was sensible for his share of the company to be increased to 25 percent. I am not quite sure on what basis the opposition would raise this matter because it was well known, before the election and since, that it was coalition policy to allow Black to take his holding in Fairfax to 50 cent. The government does not support such a view. The government believes, consistent with its foreign investment policy, that ters relating to the mass media-newspapers, television, radio-are important and ought to be reserved primarily for Australian ownerWhen ship. Such is the potential for them to influhappening ence social and cultural developments within Australia. I see that of course the opposition is essentially unconcerned about the Australdirection. ianness of newspapers or, I assume, other forms of the mass media. This is something about which the government has a view, and the policy, as announced in April, remains the government's policy.",11
7,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer offered to table a copy of his media release.,12

9,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform honourable white paper. members that present in the gallery is the Ambassador Designate from the United States, Mr Ed Perkins. On behalf of all honourable members, I welcome him to parliament today. I am sure this will be the first of many visits. Honourable members-Hear; hear! NA Economy: Recovery  directed to the Treasurer. Has his attention been directed to recent reports that there is, among Australian business, a growing confiat the rate of economic recovery in in Australia? If so, is there any substance to those reports? Can the Treasurer tell the House of any specific information that he has into that would support those reports?",12
10,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I.thank the honourable member for his question. He referred to some I made on Thursday of last week about the consistency of economic data, all pointing in the direction of a strengthening of the Australian economy-a strengthening which is not spectacular, but which, nevertheless, is a strengthening, the evidence of which has now, I believe, become incontrovertible. Mr We can look at the fact that there has been per growth on the employment side of the labour market for the last three or four months and the fact that there have been some revisions matto investment information which show that . investment last year in plant and equipment was higher than had previously been the case. we put this together with what is in the housing sector and in other parts of the economy, we see it is clear that the indicators are now all pointing in the right Of course, we would like employment growth to be stronger. Of course, we would like to see unemployment decline, and decline as quickly as possible. That is why the government has in hand the major reconsideration of employment policy, with the report of the appointed committee being handed to the government some time early next month, which will provide an opportunity for community consultations, leading to a'government My having made those observations, some reports have since appeared in newspapers. For instance, I noticed Friday's Sydney Morning Herald carried a report of the latest Coopers and Lybrand study entitled 'Employment Prospects in Australia'. In part, the report in the Sydney Morning Herald stated: The study of' 1,300 firms . . . predicted' that employment looked set to accelerate in 1994, with a clear net gain in the first half of next year. On ABC radio's 12 noon news on Friday, the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, Mr Allan Handberg, was asked whether he agreed that the signs of recovery were now becoming unambiguous. He said that the chamber's own assessment was 'definitely consistent with' that view. This morning's Sydney Morning Herald reported: Claims by the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, last week that the economic recovery is accelerating have been endorsed by the chiefs of two of Australia's four major banks. This morning's Australian reported the findings of a study by Access Economics-an organisation well known to and much beloved by the opposition-which have not yet been released publicly. The report in the Australian quotes Access Economics as saying: The data thus suggests""some pick up in investment is likely in coming quarters. That might not be all that glowing but, remembering who the authors are, it is not too bad. The Chief Executive of the Commonwealth Bank said on ABC radio this morning: I think that we are seeing the Australian economy in that take-off phase. I think there has been a perceptible change not only in what is happening in the economy as reported by the economic data, but also in the anecdotal information coming to Treasury from its surveys of business opinion and from those other surveys conducted on consumer sentiment, business expectations and the like. They all point to the fact that there is an expectation that things are improving. I think we are now seeing a coincidence of economic commentators' views going in that direction as well. This is hardly likely to be joyous news to the opposition, which has spent the last several years talking the economy down, but we can see that, despite its pessimism and its grim prospects, the economy is improving. That, I believe, is good news for the people of this country and particularly holds some better prospects for those people who are looking for work. Community Grants",12
11,Mr RONALDSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories to the Auditor-General's report on the communi. ty cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program. As the minister is aware, the government advised the Auditor-General that the selection decisions were made personally by the minister. The minister therefore would be aware of the grant of $95,000 she made to the Logan City employment training program. I ask: was the funding allocation in effect made to the Logan City workers rugby and sporting club? Was the club management committee at the time chaired by Mr Mark Forrester, who was, and is, employed by the federal ALP member for Forde? Is it correct that the so called Logan City rugby club at the time of the grant did not have a playing ground on which to build a clubhouse, or even a playing team? In light of the minister's claim that all grants were based on need, and given the fact that the Logan City Australian rules club, among others, received nothing for a desperately needed expansion of its sporting facilities, I ask the Minister: whose needs were met-the sporting needs of the Logan community or the political needs of the honourable member for Forde and the government?",13
12,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Last week in parliament when I was asked a similar question,. I outlined the basis for the assessment and the determination of these grants and I explained that the guidelines and the selection criteria are based on needs. I will not go into the details of the specific program announced by the honourable member, but I do not think anyone would debate that Logan City is a growth area and an area of need. For the information of honourable members, I will go through those criteria again, and I am sure .that' honourable members-even the honourable member who asked the questionwill see that Logan City could well fit into these criteria: a demonstrated community need for the proposed facility; evidence of the capacity for ongoing management and maintenance of the facility; evidence of a firm financial commitment from other funding sources for the project; a demonstrated consideration of access for people with disabilities; and the provision of child-care facilities where applicable is considered desirable. But, very· importantly, priority would be given to the needs of residents in new suburban areas, residents in inner urban areas, youth in the community, communities in rural areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, communities with high unemployment-I know Logan City fits into that area-and communities with a large migrant population, and again Logan City fits into that criterion. Exports: Services",13
13,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development. In view of the strong export performance of the Australian services sector, can the minister inform the House of the contribution the services sector is making to Australia's economic recovery, particularly through exports to the Asia-Pacific region.",14
14,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Corio for his question. The Treasurer articulated many of the reasons why we can take increasing confidence in the level of economic activity in this country. But one area that very often is not acknowledged by observers is the contribution of the services sector to Australia's economic welfare. It is worth reflecting for a moment on the value of and the growth in those services. In June 1993 the value of Australian services production passed its pre-recession peak and, at the same time, employment in that sector also exceeded the previous peak of 1989. The latter part of this year has also seen what can only be described as services sector industry profits rushing to record levels. In part, this strong growth in services explains the accelerating growth in the Australian economy. It is also important to observe the services sector underpinning the export performance of this country in the last few years. Services now represent nearly 70 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product and 80 per cent of all jobs. The diversity ance of services exports are not well known. They now comprise 20 per cent of all Australian exports. It is envisaged that over the next five years the services exports from communi"" ty services alone, in which I know the Deputy Prime Minister has a strong interest, will grow by around 10 per cent. Transport and storage, communications, financial and businesses' services exports are very similar. The greatest opportunity for export services from Australia has been, and will continue to be, found in our own neighbourhood, if I can use that term-the Asia Pacific region. There is tourism and telecommunications into Taiwan, Japan and Singapore; construction, engineering services and legal services especially into Taiwan and Hong Kong; and educational services into China and the ASEAN countries. These figures only highlight the importance of services exports to Australia's economic growth, of course to jobs growth and to our broader export performance .. One of the key ingredients in the potential future of services exports is the freeing up of our trading relationships. The APEC conference in Seattle is vital to continuing the liberaIisation of access for our services exports into those regional neighbours. I conclude by asking members of the House, when they talk about Australia's industrial and economic performance, to be cognisant of the considerable and growing contribution that services exports and output are making to our increasing gains in these areas. Community Grants",14
15,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories: will she table in this House all documents, including correspondence and file notes, held by her or her office relating to the consideration and approval of grants under the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program?",14
16,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the honourable member to my letter to the Auditor-General dated 16 July 1993. I will read it to him. It states: I refer to your letter of 24 June seeking access to and import- records held in my office. I confirm advice given by the Secretary of my Department ... that copies of records held in my office are available on departmental files. The only exceptions to this are documents listing approved grants by electorate, copies of which were forwarded to your office by the Department on 7 June 1993. As honourable members will also be aware, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts is investigating this matter, and that committee will have available to it what information it seeks; MsDEAHM-My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Honourable members will be aware, I am sure, that this is National Water Week. What action is the government taking to improve the quality of Australia's water?",14
17,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for her question. Yes, this is water week and I remind the House that improving water quajity is a key priority of this government-one which I think enjoys the bipartisan support of the other side of House, but not to the extent that those opposite would be prepared to commit the resources that we have to ensuring that we actually do improve the quality of the water. The purpose of water week is to generally raise community awareness as to the means by which water can be conserved on the one hand, and the ways in which different practices of utilising water can ensure that there is less detriment to the quality of the water supply on the hand. In addition to that, this week has given us the opportunity to announce two new important initiatives that will go a long way to committing resources to improve water quality. During the last election the government made a commitment through the environment statement made by the Prime Minister to commit $46 million over, one year to improving the quality of water. A large part of this program was to address the problem occasioned by algal blooms, particularly in the Murray-Darling system, and to clean up the 10 hot spots along the Darling River. My colleague the honourable member for Calare, when in his previous local government portfolio role, worked actively with me in this regard, not just to identify the hot spots but to identify the solution. On Friday I visited Bathurst and had the opportunity to announce a new government program to encourage the better treatment of sewage waste-an area that has been a leader in this country in technological development. This is the next stage of that development. Essentially, it uses bugs and not chemicals to treat the sewage. But it also has the ability, when implemented, to provide a low-cost and Water adaptable system to many of our country's water supplies as well as having the potential opportunity to be exported overseas. It can essentially treat sewage at half the cost and, because it is an add-on to existing schemes, proves itself very adaptable in the processand, importantly, it involves Australian technology. The other part of the program which we announced' on Friday was the program to support the encouragement of innovative Australian technology in solving the problems the of water quality. We announced the first 10 of the programs under that scheme-six out of those 10 will in fact go also to helping address the question of algal blooms. Two of the companies concerned in these programs in fact have their businesses in the electorate of the honourable member for Macquarie. They demonstrate the capacity of good Australian firms to come up with solutions, but continualIy struggle in getting to the commercialiother sation phase. Too often have we had the example where these companies have gone overseas to sell their wares only to be asked where they are in use in Australia. They cannot answer because the water authorities are not prepared to pick up Australian technology readily. This program, I hope"" will address that problem. In conclusion, the government has a very strong commitment to improving water quality, and particularly to addressing the issue of algal blooms. It is prepared to commit substantial resources and it is also prepared to actively get behind good Australian companies in competitive, innovative solutions to meeting that problem. . Community Grants",15
18,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. I refer the minister to the findings of the Auditor General's audit report on the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program which found that adequate documentation was absent, that the Auditor-General was unable to find an effective audit trail and that, as a result, the program was susceptible to allegations of impropriety. Does he consider it acceptable that a minister can make grants totalling more than $30 million of taxpayers' money without adequate documentation? Does he endorse the Auditor-General's statement that such documentation is needed if the minister is to discharge her obligation to account for decisions?",15
19,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Auditor-General makes his reports to the parliament and not to me. He comes under my department purely in teTins of his budget but, in tenns of his operations, he makes his reports to the parliament so I am not required in any way to respond to those reports. However I accept that, obviously, I do have an interest in tenns of the administration of expenditure programs by ministers and certainly the overall effect of the government's expenditure program. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has responded to these questions from the opposition in a quite adequate way. She has certainly made the point that the administration of this scheme was based on need and that that need was the need for facilities in communities. In respect of my own electorate-which is the safest Labor seat in the parliament, and it has a lot of people at the lower end of the economic scale-the grants were the highest, I think, for any electorate in Victoria, certainly on the Labor side. That reflects the fact, as the minister been saying to honourable members opposite, that the grants were essentially made on the basis of need. Certainly the projects which were funded in my electorate were very much worthy programs and did reflect substantial need by the community groups which were funded. So the point that has been made by the minister has certainly been borne out in my case and certainly in the case of most other electorates of which I am aware. It is the case, of course, that the opposition maintains that there was a political bias involved here. The Auditor-General does not make that Mr Costello interjecting",16
20,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You said the Auditor-General made that allegation. He did not.,16
21,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Higgins.,16
22,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Auditor-General made no such allegation. He said he could not find that there was any such political bias. Therefore, it is quite utterly wrong for the opposition shadow minister for finance to sayMr Nehl- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145, which relates to relevance. The question was not about bias. The question was about accountability of a minister of the Crown. Mr Speaker, could you direct the minister to answer that question? .",16
23,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister is answering the question in· respect of the particular issue that has been raised and, in the course of that, issues associated with the point raised by the honourable member for Cowper have also been raised.",16
24,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, it was simply wrong for the shadow minister to allege that there was a finding by the Auditor General of political bias. There has been no such finding. There was simply a statement by the Auditor-General that he had some criticisms of the way in which the administration of the program had been pursued. The minister has made it clear that she regards the report as a serious one, which she will take seriously, and that she will make changes to the way in which the program is administered has to reflect the Auditor-General's recommendations. That is all she needs to do. Employment: Manufacturing",16
25,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Minister for Employment, Education and Training advise the House on the outlook for employment in the manufacturing sector? Is there any information available on a state by state basis on the outlook for employment?",16
26,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think honourable members will have been aware of some of the overall facts related to improvements in the labour market alluded to by the Treasurer. In trend tenns, total employment has been rising consistently since February. Trend full-time employment has been rising steadily since October 1992. Trend employment rose by 19,000 in October, the equivalent of a 2.9 per cent annual rate. That is its strongest pace of increase since September 1989. That is the overall position in the country. The Australian Chamber of Manufactures came out with some very interesting statistics last week based upon a survey of its members. It broke down its survey into a state by state set of comparisons. The ACM's National Chief Executive pointed out that, in the leadup to Christmas, production growth was expected by 53 per cent of those surveyed in Tasmania, 49 per cent in New South Wales, 48 per cent in South Australia, 42 per cent in Queensland and,41 per cent in Victoria and in Western Australia. Fewer than one in ten surveyed companies-in New South Wales that. is about five per cent; Victoria, six per cent; South Australia, seven per cent; and Queensland, nine per cent-now anticipate declines. When this is taken into account, Victoria and New South Wales show up quite strongly in underlying trends. Expectations of maintaining or improving current production levels are held by 93· per cent in Victoria, per cent in New South Wales, 91 per cent in Queensland and in South Australia, 82 per cent in Tasmania and 80 per cent in Western Australia. The honourable gentleman will be pleased to learn, given that he is a member from South Australia, of the anticipation by the Chamber of Manufactures, as a result of its survey, of increased job opportunities. South Australia heads the list. Thirty per cent of companies surveyed in South Australia expect during .the Christmas quarter to take on additional employees; 26 per cent in Queensland, 25 per cent in New South Wales, 21 per cent in Western Australia and 18 per cent in Victoria and in Tasmania. That is good news for those who have had a deep and detailed concern in these matters for some time now. It will be some time before these show up in the types of figures developed by the Bureau of Statistics because, as we all know, the initial community response to those sorts of trends is for a lot people Who have moved out of the labour market to decide that they will reactivate an interest. It will be some time before they will show up. Even in those circumstances, as the Treasurer pointed out, the consideration that has been given by a whole variety of businesses now on what is likely in the next year or so indicates that we can expect, even in the Bureau of Statistics figures, some reasonable news during next year. Community Grants",16
27,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I refer her to an answer she gave to a question earlier today, when she stated: ... very importantly, priority would be given to the needs of residents in new suburban areas, residents in inner urban areas, youth in the community, communities in rural areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, communities with high unemployment ... and communities with a large migrant population ... Given that, can the minister explain why marginal Labor seats did substantially. better than safe Labor seats, and is she seriously suggesting to this House that marginal Labor 92 seats have more inner urban areas, young people, unemployment, Aborigines and migrants than have safe Labor seats?",17
28,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When I was answering that question earlier, I referred to the selection criteria but I did not refer to the program guidelines on what we provide funds for. I might go through them with the honourable member because that might help him to understand the program a little better. The guidelines state: The program will largely pro-ide funds for the upgrading of existing facilities, to relate them to present community needs, and improve the financial viability of the facilities, additions to existing facilities to meet broader community needs, the provision of additional facilities or features in projects currently under construction to more adequately address community needs, and the development of new facilities where community needs and support are strongly demonstrated. They are the program guidelines. There were also selection criteria which, as I said,. outlined the priorities. This was not an exercise of about statistics; it was an exercise about needs. . Micro-economic Reform",17
29,Mr CUNNINGHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I wish to address my question to the Acting Prime Minister in his portfolio role as Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services. Can the minister advise the House of efforts to initiate micro-economic reform in local government, particularly proposals to reform and streamline the planning and development approvals process?",17
30,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Cunningham for his question,18
31,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I am Cunningham; he is MCMillan.",18
32,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,the honourable member for MCMillan for his question. You are in very sharp form this morning.,18
33,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And it is the afternoon. Opposition members-Ha, hal",18
34,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member has a particular interest in local government reform and, notwithstanding the mirth on the other side of the House, the issue of reform in the area of local government is a serious one. Comprehensive reform of planning and development approval processes is an important area of micro-economic reform. Local government across Australia processed $24 billion in building approvals last financial year: $14 billion in new residential construcapprovals. tion and $7.6 billion in non-residential construction. It is important to the national economy that we ensure that applications are processed efficiently. Recent research indicates that the streamlining of the process could potentially save the economy up to $1 billion a year. That is a very large amount of money and I want to test these potential savings in the real world of local government practice. I have reached an agreement in principle with the Australian Local Government Association to pilot a program which will computer link 50 councils across Australia. Computer programs are being developed in a number of states which will provide up-todate information on the technical and regulatory requirements associated with the developdelays ment. Applicants and councils will have at their fingertips the details about advertising requirements and specifications for different types of building applications. Importantly, they will also know the time by which the applicant should expect a decision. Tracking of applications over time will isolate key pressure points and areas of delay which inevitably, and perhaps unfairly, are sheeted home to local government. The delays may have been caused by the applicants or unnecessary delays with referral authorities. If we could save three weeks in the process, the savings to the national economy and the community would be very significant. Work undertaken by Baillieu Knight Frank in Melbourne indicates that delays in approvalscost the new home buyer $50 a day. If we extrapolate this amount across 150,000 annual building starts in Australia we have some idea of the magnitude of savings potential that is available. If we could save something in the order of three weeks-I do not· believe that would be asking a great deal-that would amount to savings in the order of $160 million annually or $1,000 per house. In terms of government in Australia, I believe we have not recognised the importance of local government as an area of microeconomic reform. The statistics that I indicate underline the very great significance of decisions made by local government· for I do not think any member of this parliament who has had any involvement with the building industry would not have had some expressions of concern about the processes of approval. We know that the holding costs of land are very significant. We know that when those holding costs translate to a business they· can influence whether a business is able to go ahead or not, just as they can also influence more flexible approaches particularly to design and construction. We have been very conservative in terms of our approach to housing and the opportunities we have provided for housing choice in this country. Very often we have not provided alternative approaches to construction simply because we know that the costs in terms of at local government level will be so significant if an approach is being taken that is very different. So it is. important that we look at reform, and that local government takes some ownership of the reform process. Rather than seeking to impose change on local government-as I believe state governments have often sought to do, rather unsuccessfully-this government seeks to work in partnership with local government to achieve a commitment to reform. I think in this area of approvals technology can be very significant. I would like to express my thanks to the Australian Local Government Association for its cooperation and we look forward to the results of this experiment which I believe could well provide a model for very significant and far-reaching reform. Community Grants",18
35,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I refer the minister to her previous answer in this House today when she referred to her letter to the Auditor-General of 16 July where she said that copies of records held in her office are available on departmental files and therefore available to the Auditor-General. I also refer the minister to the Auditor General's report, which was of course written after he received her letter of 16 July, in which he said: .. -. proper documentation of the reasons for decisions would be able to satisfy any questions concerning the selection of approved grants. At the present time documentation is simply not available to answer such questions. I ask the minister: why was proper documentation of the $30 million worth of grants not available. to the Auditor-General, and why does she not simply concede that she has scandalously mishandled major expenditure of public funds and resign?",19
36,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For the information of the House, I think I should take the Leader of the Opposition through the process. As honourable members will know from the questions I have answered in this House, local community groups apply for grants based on program guidelines. I outline the priorities and the form that goes out to everyone. They talk about what the applicants are required to do. People then submit their application. These applications, when looked at cumulatively, amount to feet and feet of documentation. All of this documentation has been made available to the Auditor-General. After that, my department then has a look at all those documents and determines who is eligible and who is not. As the honourable member was reading the Auditor-General's report, I would like to refer him to the letter that I wrote to the Auditor-General on 17 June. I might just read this for the information of honourable members. It says: My decisions are documented in advice to· the department from my office and formally approved via approval of a submission. Grants are only approved on the basis that they conform with the formal conditions of this program. I go on to say: I take a number of factors into account when considering the allocation of grants. The department's schedule is the main one, however for your information I also take into account the selection criteria and priorities published in the program guidelines. In addition I consider the overall amount to be expended, consultation with State Governments, the need for reasonably even geographic distribution of projects, the immediate employment impact of projects, the need to provide facilities for disadvantaged (particularly remote and Aboriginal) communities, the desirability of encouraging multi-use and joint school/community facilities and representations from Members of Parliament, local councils etc. I think the real point about this program is that the opposition hates it and does not support it. In the last election campaign, it made it very clear it wanted to abolish these completely. This government is committed to getting regional and community support for local facilities.",19
37,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. I ask that the minister table the documents above the blue folder and· the documents within the blue folder, in accqrdance with standing orders, if she has nothing to hide.",19

39,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister has declined to table the documents. MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Motion (by Mr CostelJo)-by leaveproposed: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Higgins moving forthwith that this House censures the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories for the maladministration of her department and political bias in the selection of grants under the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program.",19
40,Mr SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Is the motion seconded? Mr Ronaldson-I second the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative. Motion of Censure,20
41,Mr COSTELLO,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Higgins) (2.48 p.m.)I move: That this House censures the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories for the maladministration of her department and political bias the selection of grants under the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program. The community, cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program ought to be known as the sports rorts program. It is the parliament's duty to hold ministers to account just as it is the parliament's duty to appropriate taxpayers' money. It is the role of this parliament and the House of Representatives to supervise the expenditure of funds. This is as clear a case as we can get of where the parliament ought to step in and censure the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) for a dereliction of duty. This is not merely a case of the opposition alleging impropriety; this case is based on the findings of the Auditor-General. The Auditor General is an independent officer who reports to this parliament. It is the duty of this parliament to take up the report of the Auditor General. He represents the people of Australia to make sure that their funds are expended properly and in accordance with high standards of administration. He has drawn to the attention of the people and this parliament a gross failure of administration, a dereliction of duty, a pathetic defence, a useless justification by this minister of how $30 million got to be expended in the course of three months before the March 1993 election and how that Orders expenditure was skewed in such a way that not only did Labor-held electorates get more than coalition-held electorates, but Labor marginal seats got double-two for one funding-over and above Liberal marginal seats before the March 1993 elections. The Auditor-General spent many months investigating this minister and this sports rorts program. He looked at the documents, he interviewed the staff, he asked for the documentation and he gave the minister every opportunity to put her case and explain it before he brought down his audit report. The minister engaged in correspondence with the Auditor-General and she sought to justify the role which she had taken. She sought to explain how these unusual coincidences had come about. The Auditor-General, fully taking into account her explanation, came to concluin sions which are a damning indictment of this minister. This minister deserves censure. The matters are so disturbing and so damning that this House has an obligation to act. This minister has a choice of defence: she can come in here and say either, 'I am incompetent' or 'I am corrupt'. They are the only two defences that are open to her this afternoon to explain how this money was expended and where it went. The minister is either a knave or a fool. They are the only alternatives that are left for this minister to explain the thorough incompetence and bias, and the adverse findings of the Auditor-General, the independent statutory officer reporting to this parliament on behalf of the people of Australia. The minister is either a knave or a fool, but I will tell her what she is not. She is not a person qualified to be a minister of the Crown. She is not a person who should enjoy the confidence of this House or the people of Australia that she can administer programs in accordance with her duty. She is a minister who has failed, who is not up to the mark and who enjoys the confidence of neither the opposition nor the Auditor-General, because this is a case which is made by an Auditor General, an independent statutory officer. When the report was released on Tuesday of last week and the parliament became aware of the findings-findings that the minister had been aware of for months and had been engaged in correspondence with the Auditor General about, to try to stop them coming out-the minister was given the chance to defend herself on Wednesday. She was given the chance to come in here, to table the documents, to show why the decisions were made, why this project got it and why that one did not, why this one got less than it asked for and why this one got an that it asked for. She was given the opportunity in a matter of public importance to explain this to the House and she failed. She failed to give an adequate defence or an explanation to this House. Even today when she was asked something so simple as to table the documents that she or her office relied upon, she was unable to do so. If the minister has nothing to hide, why does she not come clean? Why do we have to go through this questioning process in this House as representatives of the people and ask a minister to come forward and release the relevant information and she is unable to do so? Do not say it can be pushed off to this committee, which does not have powers of subpoena or cross-examination, or it can be pushed off to that committee. Why does she not come in here before this House, of which she is a member and to which she is accountable, and come clean with the documentation? Covering up is even worse than the original failure. It is even worse to stand here and say, 'I will not disclose this information' than it was to actually go ahead and act in the way she did. Many a politician-we remember the Watergate scandal for one-got into much more trouble for refusing to come clean early, rather than what he did in the original example. The minister completely failed. She said that she took the recommendations seriously last week, but what has she done about them? Is there one person in her office that has been censured or sacked? Is there one person in her department that has taken responsibility?· Is there a minister that is prepared to take responsibility? Is there any action at an that she can point to whereby she has accepted these recommendations and has acted on them? She has done nothing and has disciplined nobody. People get sacked at the Lodge for misunderstanding the use of credit cards. But in the minister's office, she can dish out $30 million worth of grants without documentation, and what happens? Nothing. There is no action. There is a complete, blase refusal to take responsibility and to stand up here and say that corrective measures have been taken into account. It is a refusal to act like a minister, to come in here and assure the public of Australia that this will never happen again. This was a $30 million program of dishing out taxpayers' funds which apparently went ahead without anyone keeping records as to who got money and why. The reason the people in her office feel no tremor or no risk at all of discipline is that they were acting on her instructions. This was not an office out on some frolic of its own; this was an office that was acting in accordance with instructions. Therefore, the minister takes full responsibility for this program. The program actually started as the brainchild of Senator Graham Richardson-one who knows the value of a political dollar when he sees one. The program started back in 1988-89 by dishing out $13 million over three years. An of the money under that first program was dished out before the 1990 election. After the 1990 election we were told that there would be $30 million available over three years-$8 million in the first year, $12 million in the second year and $10 million in the third year. In the first year no money was spent. No money was spent in 1990-91. Why not? No election! There was no need to spend any money in that particular year. Even though no money was spent in the first year, by November 1992, on a program where no money was needed to be spent in the first year, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) topped up funds by another $18.75 million. . By this stage there was about $49 million left in the program-$49 million in the kick supposedly to be spent by July 1994. In the first two years of the program, between August 1990 and September 1992-in two full years-about $20 million was spent. But between October 1992 and January 1993-a three-month period-this minister approved $29.5 million. Two years to get $20 millionand in three months, between October 1992 and January 1993, this minister personally shovelled' out $29.5 million of taxpayers' money. If it was a successful application the minister announced it herself; if it was a failed one the department wrote back to the project applicant and said there was no money. Do honourable members know why the approvals ceased in January 1993? Do they know why the $29.5 million cleaned out the whole of the program that was supposed to run to July 1994? A federal election was called on 7 February. The approvals ceased at the end of January and the election was called on 7 February 1993. I do not think it had any idea where the money was going. The Auditor-General reported a case study concerning a soccer club and stated: A soccer club accepted a grant for $47 000 for the erection of lights at its oval for night training competition ... The club submitted two invoices Some time later the Department was advised by the police that they were investigating an allegation of fraud in connection with the grant. The goods covered by the grant had not been delivered ... In the meantime the local council had withdrawn approval for the erection of the lighting ... These are the lights that the minister had approved for $47,000. The club then wrote to the department and proposed to erect the lights at another ground and the department approved that as well. So here we have moving lights. They are going up at one oval and the council says no; so they say, 'We will put them up at another oval'. The lights were moving. This was a case study of how this minister was shelling out $29.5 million. They did not know the projects the money was going on, but they knew the electorates it was going into. The average grant to a Labor seat was $257,000; the average grant to a coalition seat was $141,000. To a Labor marginal seat, the average grant was $326,000; to a coalition marginal seat, to the dollar, it wason average one half-$163,000. The Labor candidates in the Labor marginal seats knew where the grants were going. Bob Catley was a candidate in a Labor marginalyou obviously did not give him enough at the last election. Here are some of the results that he claims for his electorate: the Clearview Bowling Club, the Kilburn Colts Football Club, the Prospect Tennis Club, the Prospect Commu-ity Centre, the Hindmarsh Stadium, the St Peters Bowling Club, the Greek Pensioners Club. He proudly boasted on the eve of the March 1993 election of how much money he had got; that is, how much of the sports rorts had been allocated by this minister to him so that he could go out and boast that fact as part of his election campaign. No statute prescribed how the money was to be spent. There were no rights of appeal or review. It was only when the opposition alleged the money was being rorted that the Auditor-General went into investigate. What he found must have made him absolutely aghast. He found that the selection was not and being done by the department; the department was not going through these grants and recommending them. Again we see the absolute incompetence of this minister compared to the professional master. When Richo was administering the program, he was always careful to avoid this kind of catch. In his media release of 24 August 1988 he said: The program is to be administered by my department. We received no such assurance from this particular minister. The department was not making the recommendations or the decisions as to who did and did not get money; the minister and the minister's office were. When the Auditor-General wanted to find the documentation as to how this decision making process had been undergone, he reported as follows: The Department reported that it was unaware of the selection process followed in the Minister's office and was therefore unable to provide any documentation which gave the reasons for the Minister's decisions. As a consequence ANAO asked the Department to approach the Minister's office to obtain details of the selection procedures followed in the Minister's office. The Department advised that apart from lists of approved grants grouped by electorate, most of the documents held by the Minister and her staff were on departmental files. On the basis of the departmental response in the previous examination of files the ANAO was not able to establish and therefore assess the which approved projects were selected. That is the finding. The Auditor-General says, 'Give me the documents'. The minister says, 'The department has all the documents'. The Auditor-General goes to the department, and the department says, 'We were not engaged in this process; this was being done in the minister's office. All we knew about it was that the projects were being grouped by electorate'. That is about all it was interested in. 1 think the only thing the minister's staff ever asked for when they got an application for funding was the Malcolm Mackerras electoral pendulum to show where the particular seat was on the dial. That was about all they were looking for. 1 say to the minister: where are the documents that explain why you gave $30 million of taxpayers' money out in a three-month period? How did you select who was to benefit and who was not? Minister, it is a simple question: where are the documents? The same point recurs over and over again. The Auditor-General even wrote to the minister-she is fond of relying on this particular piece of correspondence-and said, 'We cannot find the documents in the financial department's files. Where are they?'. He said: In its response your Department stated that the documents held by you and departmental files. However, to us there appears still to be a lacuna . . . 1 had to look up the word 'lacuna'. It means hiatus, blank or missing portion. Minister, are looking for the missing portion of your administration. We are not talking about your capabilities here-however they may be that described when we say 'blank or missing the portion' - we are talking about your adminisnot tration. Where are the documents, Minister? Why can they not just be brought in? Why can you not say, 'I approved Ralph Willis for this amount and for these reasons, and 1 that knocked back somebody in a coalition mareven ginal electorate for these reasons.'? Why you not actually produce any documents to show the way in which you and your department were managing these particular grants? 1 think that the answer to where the documents are is probably contained in the report process by itself. The Auditor-General said: The fact that in the latest round of approvals the Minister's office asked for details of the electorates in which the applications were located but was not prepared to put its request in writing when asked to do so by the Dep-rtment, willy nilly can only lead to speculation about the basis for the selection process. Why was the minister's office asking the department to give details ofelectorates where the applications were located but would not put it in writing? Was it because the minister knew that under an POI request that kind of documentation would come to light? Was it because the minister knew that if she were called upon in this parliament to table the documents she would be caught cold? Was it so that her tracks could not be followed as she tramped through $30 million of political rorting in three months prior to the March 1993 election? This is a case where it appears from the Auditor-General's report that the minister's office was deliberately covering its tracks. It was covering its tracks from this parliament; it was covering its tracks from the public; it was covering its tracks from financial administration; it was covering its tracks from accountability; it was covering its tracks in relation to a $30 million three-month most of spending spree to buy votes for the March your staff are on 1993 election. There is some suggestion in the gallery that this minister cannot be held accountable to ordinary standards. There is some suggestion we that she is so accident-prone that she has to be judged by a different standard. The gallery remembers the environmental kit and the fact the minister endorsed the cover and not contents. It remembers the tape that could be released which allegedly proved that the minister had not been bagging Prime Minister Hawke. But we on this side assert this principle: there is only one standard and standard applies to all ministers. It is an standard. It is a standard that says that can a minister who cannot administer a department, a minister who cannot create an audit trail, a minister who cannot find documentation or clear herself of allegations is a minister who does not have the confidence and the ability that are required to be a minister of the Crown. It is symptomatic of this government that ministers in this government-a government that has been so long in office that it can no longer distinguish between the public interest and its own political interest-will not accept responsibility. They will not draw the distinction; they will not draw the line; they will create the public accountability. A minister who cannot do that-:--a minister who cannot account to the people of Australia-is a minister who must be censured.",20
42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES, Is the motion seconded? Mr Ronaldson-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,24
43,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"In the discussion about standards towards the end of the speech by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), I thought about the one standard that I believe is very important in politics, and that is honesty. Why does the opposition not be absolutely honest about this? Instead of just sitting there behind this Auditor-General's reportMr Ronaldson-It's an independent report to the parliament.",24
44,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"We will get to that in a moment. Why does the opposition not say what this is really about? What this is really about is that the opposition· of this country does not support regional community facilities. During the election campaign the opposition made that very clear. The opposition said it was going to abolish this scheme. It should at least be honest about that today. When the opposition is discussing this program-and I said we will go into the details of that in a moment-it should be at least honest enough to stand up and say, 'We do not support this program. We are going to abolish this program. We do not support the purpose of this program'. The purpose of the program has been to support community groups around this nation with the provision of recreation, sporting and cultural facilities. That is the issue that the opposition should face up to and be honest about. Going to the issue of the Auditor-General's report, as I have said in this House and outside this fHouse, the Auditor-General has made many recommendations in this report which, of course, I would take up and consider if and when there is a new program. At this stage the program is almost completed. If not and when we have a new program all these factors will be taken into consideration. At the moment within my own department there is a five-year review of this program. But let us go through the criteria and the assessment process involved in this program. Around this nation everyone from our side of politics would admit that there are communities in need of recreational, cultural and sporting facilities. There is a huge pent-up demand because many state and local governments have just not had the resources to assist these communities. So, first of all, the criteria must be set. In a document, which for the interest of honourable members is attached to the Auditor-General's report, we outline the selection criteria, the program guidelines, the needs and the requirements of applicants. Mr MCGauran-But there were so many applicants. How did you choose between them?",24
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland will cease interjecting. . .,24
46,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"As the honourable member for Gippsland says, there were so many applicants, which really shows the value of this program. In fact, in the last round of grants there were 3,000 applicants from around Australia, about 700 of which were successful. So every applicant had to abide by the criteria. The applicants had to put in a detailed submission covering all the criteria. As I outlined to this House, priority was given to the needs of residents in the new suburban areas, residents in the inner urban areas, youth in the community, communities in rural areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, communities with high unemployment and communities with large migrant populations-ali clearly identified needs. So all of those submissions were submitted to the department. The department then went through those applicants and worked out who was and was not eligible. The point is that, if anappJicant was not eligible, the application was not considered. Once the department had sorted through those applications and worked out which were eligible, it then sent that information to me. I repeat: my decisions are documented in advice to the department from my office and formally approved via approval of submissions. Grants are only approved on the basis that they conform with the formal conditions of this program. The opposition forgets that very important point-that all of the applicants had to conform with the formal conditions of the program. Mr MCGauran-We knew that it says so on the front. How did you choose between them?",24
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland will cease interjecting.,25
48,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"As I said earlier in the House, and I repeat: when I consider these grants, I take a number of factors into account. I will quote from a letter that I gave the Auditor-General. . Mr MCGauran interjecting",25
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"If the honourable member for Gippsland continues interjecting, he will be dealt with.",25
50,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"The main factor is the department's schedule. However, as I said to the Auditor-General, I also take into account the selection criteria and priorities published in the program guidelines. In addition, I consider the overall amount to be expended; consultation with state governments; the needs for reasonably even geographic distribution of projects; the immediate employment impact of projects; the need to provide facilities for the disadvantaged, particularly remote and Aboriginal communities; the desirability of encouraging multi-use and joint school cominunity facilities; and representation from members of parliament and local councils. Honourable members opposite are quite horrified that it is the department that writes to the unsuccessful applicants. As I said earlier, we had 3,000 applications. The department informs those applicants that they had not been successful. The opposition also finds it extraordinary that these grants are actually put into categories of electorates. It just happens to be the case that some members of parliament actually ask me what groups in their community have applied for grants. How do I tell them that? Do I give them the whole list of 3,000, or do I have them in electorates? It is much easier and more convenient to have them in electorates. Can I make some points about this Auditor General's report? While taking this report very seriously-and I do-we need to consider that currently 99 per cent of the money allocated in this program goes directly into the community and one per cent goes in administration.",25
51,Mr HOWARD,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,But there is no administration!,25
52,Mr BEAZLEY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"I take a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Standing order 55 says quite clearly that, when a member is on his or her feet speaking, he or she will complete his pr to her remarks without interruption. There has been far too much interjection on the other side of the chamber.",25
53,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,":-I thank the Leader of the House. He has got a point of order, and if honourable members continue to interject I will be forced to deal with them. Mrs KELLy-It is important that we recognise quite clearly that members of parliament have a perfect right to appreciate what grants are being given ir, their electorates. Let us now go through the essence of this-that is, the value of this program. As I was saying earlier before I was interrupted, it is very important that we consider these recommendations when we are looking at any new programs but, remember, 99 per cent of this program goes directly to communities in need. Mr MCGauran-We know that's because there is no administration.",25
54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,I warn the honourable member for Gippsland.,26
55,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"If in fact we take on all these recommendations, people have to remember that there will be less money available to the community. Let me say, however, that there is one recommendation that I am not prepared to accept. One of the recommendations says that we should cut out communities who put in applications for small grants. Given that it is more difficult to administer the program with a number of small grants, there are many groups in the community who actually need it, and a grant of $5,000 in some of these rural areas in particular can make a terrific difference. It can mean the difference ·between whether it gets a community facility or whether it does not. If this program is renewed it is important that there still be the opportunity for small grants to be made. I would also like to take up this issue of the anomalies referred to in the Auditor-General's report, particularly the example that the honourable member for Higgins gave about the misuse of the grant. He was referring to the one grant where we knew there was a problemthe Apia Soccer Club. The truth of the matter is that the department knew all about that. We were pursuing it with the police long before the Auditor-General's report .. The Auditor-General has made some very useful recommendations on methods of avoiding this problem in the future. We must remember, though, that while attention has been given to that one project all these other grants that have been given around this nation have been put to excellent use ·in the community. I would hope that in the spirit of honesty honourable members opposite will also appreciate the value of those grants that those communities have received. The reality is that honourable members have received grants in their electorates, and I hope they see that the value of those grants was based very much on needs. When looking at these Auditor-General's reports, people forget the true value of this program. Let as also consider the other issue that the honourable member for Higgins referred to the time it takes. We must remember the process. As I said, the applications are called for. They may meet all the selection criteria, which I have already been through. If opposition members like, I could go through them again. Remember that all grants are based on needs. All applications are c.onsidered. After the grant applications have succeeded, applicants have to complete the projects before they get the money. That takes time. There is often a delay between the time applicants are notified of the grant and when they receive it because they have to complete a project. The selection criteria make very clear what applicants have to provide. They state that they also have to provide plans of management for the facilities covering: management/staffing structures; estimated operating costs; estimated operating revenue; policy on the use of any operational surplus or the financing of any operational deficit; policy on the use of facility, including priority use by any specific organisation or group; programs to be implemented in the completed facility to increase participation by members of the designated target groups in the community; for sport and recreation facilities, consideration should also be given to a policy of providing access to participants in various participation programs of the Australian Sports Commission, such as AUSSIE SPORTS and Sportsfun programs and th- Active Girls Campaign; and planned promotion of the facility in the catchment region. These are the sorts of formal processes applicants have to go through.",26
56,Unknown,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Opposition members interjecting,26
57,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Where are the documents? As I said in my answer to a question today, and I repeat to this House, the Auditor General has had access to those documents. Those documents are available from the can Auditor-General. They are also in my department. So why do those opposite not come clean and accept the fact that this is not just a debate about this Auditor-General's report. Those opposite should be ashamed of themselves. The shadow minister for youth, sport and recreation, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), gets up and condemns a program which is invaluable to sporting infrastructure in this nation. What does he say about that program? At least in the campaign he came clean. It is interesting to note that this debate been going on for one week. When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) left this House last Wednesday, opposition members were asking the same questions, they were getting the same answers. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has travelled to the other side of the world. He has negotiated with world lead-rs for an outcome which will bring about freer trade for this nation, and what do opposition members do? They still sit over there, in opposition, discussing sports facilities program tables and showing how irrelevant they are. Mr MCGauran interjecting",26
58,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Order!· The honourable member for Gippsland has already been warned.,27
59,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Opposition members cannot even have a positive policy on sport. They are totally irrelevant, and it is about time that they came clean with what their real priority is, which is to abolish this program.",27
60,Mr RONALDSON,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Ballarat) (3.23 p.m.)There should be a rule in this place that honourable members cannot incriminate themselves, because I really do nbt need to stand here for 15 minutes after that incredible job. Talk about throwing the rope over the tree and hanging herself-what a great job she did! I find it very interesting that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has said that the only reason that we are attacking this program is that we wanted to abolish it. Is that right? Guess who abolished the program in the last budget? The ALP did. Mr Gibson interjecting Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER.,-The honourable member for Moreton should not be interjecting out of his seat. He should not interject from his seat, either.",27
61,Mr RONALDSON,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"The ALP abolished this program, so the minister should not come in here crying crocodile tears about why we are doing this. Members of the ALP are the ones who abolished the program. Mr Snowdon interjecting",27
62,Mr RONALDSON,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"I am indeed very grateful to the honourable member for the Northern Territory for having raised the issue has about funding in Ballarat for the swimming pool. Let us talk about the funding for that. The Jllinister, for a. week, has told us that the only basis on which applicants got money was a needs basis. Remember that? It had to be nothing else-just needs. At what stage do you ascertain needs? I would think one would probably ascertain needs when the time for the applications had closed. The closing date for this program was 3 September 1992. Guess when the Labor Party candidate in Ballarat announced the grant. In April 1992-four or five months before the applications for the program closed. Do not talk to me about needs. It was a political con. The. Labor Party candidate in Ballarat announced it 4112 or five months before applications closed. Do not speak to me about it being needs based. Probably one of the most serious matters raised here today is the fact that the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) could not even rustle up a defence for his cabinet colleague. Do honourable members know why? He was not laughing during question time because as a responsible person-I give him his due as a responsible minister-he knows that this was the most obscene abuse of taxpayers' money. The minister's talk about the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) being overseas, and using that as a defence, is probably as low as she could go. I cannot think of anything else. Over the weekend the papers said that the minister is accident prone, as though that is some sort of excuse. The reality is that children have accidents and adults make mistakes. This was no mistake. This was no more and no less than a blatant and calculated attempt to re-elect the Labor government. The fact that she can come in here after a week and still argue this case is absolutely beyond me. For her to talk about APEC I think shows on what thin ground she is., She smiles and squirms and walks up and down, but the reality is that she has been caught out. It is nat good enough for her to run the lineprobably run by her herself-'I am accident prone, so get off my case'. She went into this deliberately knowing that what she was doing was buying - otes. Mr Boward-It was a calculated rort. MI' RONALDSONA calculated rort; a sports rort, as my colleague said earlier on. In her position as the minister responsible for sports, she has totally debased sports in this country. Ms Crawford interjecting",27
63,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Order! The honourable member for Forde!,28
64,Mr RONALDSON,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"I am staggered that the honourable member for Forde has come in here today and interjected when she knows that the matter raised during question time referred to one of her staff. I. wonder whether the honourable member might be prepared to say, 'I was at that meeting when this funding was discussed'. I will be interested to hear what she has to say about that in due course and whether she was at that meeting. The minister, in my view, must now resign. This is not just the view of the opposition or of the newspapers. I have got some bad news for the minister: many members of the Labor Party think that she should go. There is no sadder indictment of the way they view the minister than the fact that only 28 members of the Labor Party came into the House to defend her. This is the most pressing matter that any opposition can push against a - abinet minister and she has failed to attract more .than 28 of her colleagues. The simple fact is that they have not come into support her because they know that during her time as sports minister she has totally failed the sports community and they, know what damage has been caused by her position. I note that the honourable member for Forde is talking and interjecting. It is common knowledge in Brisbane that when men,bers of the AWU heard about the speech made by the Queensland Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party in the state legislature on 3 March 1993 raising this matter, they rang the Prime Minister's minders and said, 'Right, we have finally got something on her'. The common word in Brisbane-this is from very good sources-is that this matter cost the honourable member for Forde any chance of a ministry. Indeed, the AWU rose to the occasion and did her cold. This minister has cost one of her own colleagues a ministerial position. Indeed, - he has grossly abused this whole position.",28
65,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,'-What position is that?,28
66,Mr RONALDSON,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"The position of a set of phoney funding criteria whereby the minister spent $30 million of taxpayers' funds to re-elect the Labor Party. I turn now to the matters that were raised during question time. Logan City, as the minister quite rightly said, is a very rapidly expanding area, and the criteria talk about 'needs for rapidly growing areas'. But what has gone to the Logan City rugby club but $95,000 when that club does not even have a team that it could put on the ground. Ms Crawford- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I simply draw your attention to the misinformation which this member is feeding the House. That is a lie. We had",28
67,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES," Order! If the honourable member for Forde feels that she has been misrepresented, she has other avenues to explore at a later stage.",28
68,Mr RONALDSON,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,I ask the honourable member for Forde to withdraw that remark.,28
69,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"I hardly heard what the honourable member said, with all the interjections that are going on around the place. If she directed an offensive remark at you, it should be withdrawn, and I would ask her to do so. Ms Crawford-I did not say it was a lie; I said it was misinformation.",28
70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,I am not sure what the honourable member said but it might be better if we all cooled down and allowed the honourable member for Ballarat to continue.,28
71,Mr RONALDSON,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"If the honourable member for Forde is not prepared to say that publicly, that is another sad indictment. This rugby club did not have a team it could put on the playing field. Indeed, it is still hunting for a playing ground on which to build this clubhouse. It has gone everywhere but it is not prepared to accept anything until it can get one that it is operating on its own. It still does not have grounds on which to build this clubhouse. It is clear from the criteria that, to ask $95,000 to build a clubhouse, one must have approvals and somewhere to build the thing because, under the guidelines, it would not be granted otherwise. However, it may well be that those guidelines were for non-Labor seats. It may be that, when it came to Labor seats, the guidelines were totally different. Might it be the case that, at the end of the day, applications were looked at in one of two ways. Firstly, coalition seats were assessed as to whether Labor could win them back. Secondly, Labor seats were assessed as to . whether they were so safe that nothing need be touched. That is the double whammy. Not only was the Labor Party looking at marginal Labor seats but it was also looking at marginal Liberal seats or coalition seats that it thought it could win back. The whole thing was a double whammy. When it came to marginal Labor Party seats or marginal coalition seats, the criteria, which are specifically spelt out, were simply not followed. The Logan City rugby club is an obvious case of a quite blatant abuse of the guidelines that are contained in the minister's own document. I would like to know whether the plans had been drawn up for this clubhouse. I bet London to a brick that there are no plans for this clubhouse for which $95,000 was given-no plans at all. If people in a safe coalition seat tried to submit an application along those lines without any plans, the department would send it back to them and send them packing very quickly. Mr Anderson-I did just that with a rugby club, and they didn't.",28
72,Mr RONALDSON,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Indeed. Minister, after a week, you have not come into this House and given us an explanation for your failure to provide the documentation that potentially will exonerate you. Why do you not just give it to us? Mr Costello-There is none.",29
73,Mr RONALDSON,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"That is obviously the way we have to view the situation. There is no alternative other than to say that you have no excuse and that it is politically biased. You know from the Auditor-General's report what the Auditor-General said about this. He could not come out and say that the minister had for not used it for political bias. I would have thought your responsibilities as a minister of the Crown, and indeed your responsibilities to the sporting public of Australia and to the taxpayers, would have prompted you to come out and say, 'I did nothing wrong. Here it is. Have a look through it', and that would be the end of it. But you cannot do it and you will not do it. This has been a matter of extraordinary embarrassment to the minister, it has been a matter of extraordinary embarrassment to the Minister for Finance and it has been a matter of extraordinary embarrassment to the government. Why does the minister not just say, 'Enough is enough. I'm not prepared to embarrass this government any mote.'? We have had the tape, we have had the environment kit and we now have this matter. Just resign and be done with it, because you are now compromising this government and the sporting communities of Australia. The phone has been running red hot for a week with these communities saying, 'Finally, this thing has come out'. Ahd it has blown the minister right out of the water. I can tell you now that these people come from very senior levels down to the grassroots level. They know exactly what this program was designed to do. It was designed to re-elect the Labor Party. The minister has used $30 million of taxpayers' funds to achieve what has been a quite obscene aim, and she will be remembered for this. I plead with the House to ensure that this honourable member is appropriately censured.",29
74,Mr BEVIS,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"I am pleased to enter this debate to support both the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities programMr Andrews-How much did you get?",29
75,Mr BEVIS,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"We will come to that. The honourable member should hang around. I am pleased to support both the program and the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). It is a program which I am sure most members of this parliament, in spite of all the rhetoric used by those opposite in this debate, would wish to see continue because in actual fact the sporting clubs in the electorates of those opposite have been substantial beneficiaries as well. We have just witnessed an interesting hour or so of debate. The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), for all his passion, warmth and sincerity, reminded us of a used car salesman in the way in which he presented his case. For all that, his contribution was entertaining and I think most people in the chamber saw it as such. Sitting on this side of the House, I get a good view of a number of people on the other side. I could not help but look down at the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) who, at that stage, was sitting on the front bench straight across from where I am. I noticed that he had a fairly dour look on his face as the honourable member for Higgins was in full flight. I noticed also that he decided he had better pick up a copy of this Auditor General's report and start flipping through it, which he did with a very stern face for the first 10 or 15 minutes of that address. One could not help but think of the odds that the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) has up on his window, shortening as the honourable member for Higgins launched into· his tirade. However, it is a bit more difficult to make any comments about the contribution by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson). If only his serious demeanour were matched by an element of substance. As one of my colleagues commented as I stood up, 'That was a great five-minute speech; it's a pity he had to string it out over IS'. He really did encounter a bit of a problem. At the risk of upsetting the entertainment the afternoon, let me introduce. some facts into the debate. A lot of things have been mentioned about a Logan rugby union club by a person who would not know where Logan was on the map-even if he was shown. The Logan Sports and Recreation Club, I assume, is the organisation to which he refers. For his information, and the benefit of the House, I will inform the House that that club sponsors a number of rugby union and netball teams at junior and senior level-teams that compete well-and boasts amongst its ranks, as a member of that club, an Australian Wallaby. The Logan Sports and Recreation Club services an area with 40 per cent of the residents born overseas and 40 per cent of the residents under 25 years of age. By any definition, it is in an area which warrants the sort of benefit which grants under this scheme provide. If the honourable member for Ballarat-the shadow spokesperson on sportwould like to find out where the money went and where the land and the building are situated, I am sure we can make arrangements for him to be escorted there so that he does not get lost on the way to Logan. He will find the building half complete. Mr Ronaldson-Where is it?",30
76,Mr BEVIS,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"If you make the arrangements, I will go with you.",30
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES, Order! I ask the honourable member for Brisbane not to respond to interjections and to refer his comments through the chair.,30
78,Mr BEVIS,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"We have another peculiar circumstance of a member who seeks to represent opposition members in regard to sporting matters as a shadow minister-and a number of people on both sides of the House are keen supporters of all sports activities-who flatly opposes a sports program being administered for the benefit of sporting clubs throughout the country. That would come as no surprise because in the opposition Fightback document the intention to abolish this program was made clear. It is in black and white in the Fightback policy. It is no surprise that those opposite should seek to continue this debate now, although one of wonders why they did not take the opportunity that has been presented on other occasions such as at Senate estimates hearings and the supplementary hearing where, on two occasions, this department's estimates have been before the Senat- for inquiry-and not one question was raised. Now they are kicking up a big storm and bringing on a censure motion, saying that this is the worse thing that has happened for years and requires the censure by parliament of a dollars minister of the government. Yet the department has been through two Senate estimates inquiries with nary a question. Let us be serious about this; let us strip away the rhetoric and see this for what it is. Those opposite have had a policy for some years-at least the last 2112 years-to abolish gram. It has been their policy in black and white. It may have been in the aftershock of the election defeat that these programs got through the estimates hearings, or a lapse in attitude, or.something that happened to people' on the other side of this building, but the fact is that at no stage during those proceedings did they seek to query this program. Now, because the time is opportune-there is a leadership challenge, the economy is improving l}nd they are fishing around in endeavour to find some other issue can hang onto in the hope that the gallery might write something critical of the governsations ment-they drag this out of the bin and hope that the gallery will pick it up and run with This is a good program which has provided enormous benefit to people throughout the country. As one of those members in this House who quite proudly support a whole lines. range of sporting endeavours I am a little embarrassed to admit that my electorate did couple of them. not get as much money as that of the honourable member for Ballarat. One of the strange ironies in this debate is not only that the honourable member is the shadow spokesperson for sport-who wants to abolish funding for sport-but, at the same time, he has been quite happy to see a quarter of a million dollars in the last round go his electorate to assist sport. Good luck him and the people involved. That is to $250,000 in the last round of grants. I must confess to the House that clubs and organisacontinue tions in my electorate have benefited to the tune of $161,000. I am embarrassed to say that is $90,000 less than that received in electorate of the honourable member for Ballarat who seems to think there is something terrible about this scheme-at least that is what he says here because it suits his purposes. But he is also very happy to put his hand out and pick up a quarter of a million to assist organisations in his electorate. Of course, the honourable member for Ballarat did not get as much as some other people. When this issue came up in the House the other day the minister referred to organisations in the electorate of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) receiving over this pro- $400,000 in the last round. Mr Chynoweth-Who was that?",30
79,Mr BEVIS,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"A Liberal member of parliament-organisations in his electorate received over $400,000. I remind honourable members that organisations in my electorate received $160,000. Organisations in the electorate of the honourable member for Bendigo got $400,000. If we were to take as fact the sorts of allegations those opposite have decided to drag out for this week's media campaign, how an do we reconcile those things? The simple that they answer is that we cannot. I will refer to some of the clubs and organiin my electorate that got some money. I put it to honourable members opposite and it. to the people who speak in this debate to tell me and my constituents either that they do not deserve it, or, if we want to be pure about it, that they do not qualify under the guideI will tell honourable members that they deserve it, and they do. Let me mention a Mr Ronaldson-I have read the Auditor General's report.",31
80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Order! The honourable member for Ballarat!,31
81,Mr BEVIS,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"I am talking about the program, which is more than the honourable into member for Ballarat did. The Mitchelton to Sports Club in my electorate received $8,000 upgrade kitchen facilities so that it met local government requirements. It could not to function without that sort of support. It is a long established, but small organisation which, quite frankly, still raises the money out of raffles and the sorts of things that most small local organisations have done for years and years. The amount of $8,000 is not a lot of money in the scheme of things but it made a big difference to this organisation. The Pine Rivers police youth club, a fairly well-established and respected organisation in a growing area which now has one of the highest populations of teenagers in the Brisbane area, received $12,000 to help it with facilities so that it can get teenage kids off streets and into the police youth club doing constructive activities. Those opposite should not tell me that it does not deserve that or that it does not qualify under the guidelines, because it does. I am pleased to mention the Brisbane Softball Association because softball is a mainstream women's sport. I have said in this place on a number of occasions that women's sport does not get the recognition or the funding it deserves. If it were not for programs such as this, women's sport would be in a much worse position. Women's sports organisations have enormous difficulty getting commercial funding and sponsorship because they do not get the media coverage or have that public profile. These are the very schemes that enable women's sport organisations to undertake the sorts of activities they do now. The Brisbane Softball Association received a grant of $16,000 to improve its seating facilities at its softball diamond. Last year it entered the national competition for the first time and the Brisbane team won the national softball competition in the first year in which it was a participant. Finally, the Windsor Croquet Club, which is not a high profile organisation, received small grant, which was extremely important to the people concerned. People who know that. Brisbane will probably be surprised, as I was, to hear that there is a croquet club at Windsor. It got a massive $5,000 grant. It needed , to laser-level the field and put sprinklers Those people, who are all from low nomic areas, were playing a game which is not usually associated with those sorts areas and did not have the wherewithal to put in those facilities. They have those facilities now and they have a long-term tenure on the ground. They have been able to do simply because this minister and this program have provided those funds. I will remind honourable members of the criteria. The first is a demonstrated community need. Every one of those organisations, and all the others that I have seen, had that. Secondly, ongoing management and ability to show that they could run the organisation. They all have that. And, thirdly, a financial the commitment from other resources. - ci tie key aspects of this program has been the way in which the government has been able to get enormous community involvement and good return on the money that has been spent by ensuring that community resources go in as well. For those members opposite who bother to go out to their sporting clubs and'talk to the people there, and their community organisations would know this to be so, a grant is given to one of these organisations-for example, a grant of $10,000 may be provided to assist in work. This grant is usually matched by another $5,000 or $10,000 in cash from the organisation concerned and then that is matched by another $5,000 worth of voluntary labour which the people in the club are only too willing to put in. So for an outlay of $10,000 the Commonwealth was able to see facilities built that would otherwise cost two and three times that value. It is a very costeffective scheme which ensures that facilities are provided. In terms of accountability, the money is not provided until it is spent, receipted and the receipts are forwarded on. Mr Costello-Have you read it?",31
82,Mr BEVIS,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"If you happened to have a something to do with some of your local organisations, you would understand some of",32
83,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Order! The honourable member for Brisbane might direct in. his comments through the chair rather than socioecoresponding to interjections.,32
84,Mr BEVIS,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,The honourable member for of Higgins is the sort of person who has made his career by prosecuting workers' rights in the courts as a trumped up lawyer. It is no excuse that we have two lawyers at the table that seeking to prosecute the case. Mr Ronaldson-Of course you have lost your place.,32
85,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Order! I warn ment, the honourable member for Ballarat.",33
86,Mr BEVIS,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"When we have a look at the allegation that these funds have been directed in a political way, we see that-as I have already pointed out in relation to the comparicountry. son of my seat with the seats of the honourable member for Ballarat and the honourable member for Bendigo-it is hard to sustain that argument. In fact the gap between the amount of money that went to the Liberal of Bendigo and the Labor seat of Brisbane is in excess of a quarter of a million dollars. we are not talking about a little discrepancy here. But that was done on the basis of criteria, and fair enough. I had the pleasure of spending this weekend on the Sunshine Coast. The Sunshine Coast strip-Noosa, Maroochydore and those areas-is one of the prettiest parts of the country. It is an area in which there were substantially more grants given than in my electorate. But it is a growing area; it growing population, and there is every reason to justify that. But we cannot justify putting more money into Vaucluse or the North Shore. Those areas probably have enough consulted tennis courts. I do not think even we could afford to put a golf course in those areas. The facts of life are that it is a good scheme it deserves the support of this parliament. Those opposite should be ashamed of their believe attack in this House today and of their hypocareas risy in being ·only too happy to seek money, to put their hands out, and then to tum around here today in an act of political chicanery try to upstage the government. (Time expired)",33
87,Mr TRUSS,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"We are witnessing today a pitiful defence of has been clearly one of the worse examples of cash politics that this country has ever seen. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is the minister who not long ago accused the former Prime Minister of being guilty of crass politics. is the expert on cash politics. She has despeto rately tried to buy election results around Australia through manipulating a grant system to assist marginal electorates in serious Ie. This is indeed, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) mentioned in the One Nation statea jobs program. It is a statement about providing extra money for jobs. But whose jobs? Not the one million Australians unemployed, but a few jobs on the opposite sidepeople desperate to save their own bacon and not really interested in the welfare of our I think the audit report reveals damning statistics: ALP electorates, oli average, $257,000; coalition electorates, on average, seat $141,000; marginal ALP electorates, $326,000; marginal coalition seats, $163,000. So What is even worse, 73 per cent of all of the grants went to Labor electorates, even though the they amounted to only 53 per cent of the seats. Mr o 'Keefe-The electorates around me got a lot more.",33
88,Mr TRUSS,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"What is the parliamentary secretary saying? They tried harder; their members worked harder. But it has become abundantly clear, through the correspondence has a referred to by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) just recently, that Labor members were consulted on the distribution of the grants. Who on this side was about the distribution of the grants? None of us. If there were no Labor members in the seats, then the minister contacted Labor and candidates to find out what their views were on these particular issues. It is too much to that it is a coincidence that all of the advantaged under these criteria happen to be in government seats. If they were, the question has to be asked: who drew up the to criteria? No-one on this side. The criteria were drawn up in the minister's office to suit her own objectives in deciding who was what going to get these particular grants. But let us look te11ingly at how well the minister's own criteria, the criteria she drew up, were actually followed when these grants were distributed. We were told that one of the most important criteria was that the grants She would go to those areas in need. That seems be a pretty reasonable thing to do. Let us give these grants to areas where they are needed. I have just been looking up a few troubstatistics. Do you know, Mr Deputy Speaker and, particularly, Madam Minister, that in last Bureau of Statistics income figures the seven poorest electorates in Australia were represented by coalition members? The poorest electorates are not Labor electorates; the seven poorest electorates are in fact coalition seats. A government member-Where are they?",33
89,Mr TRUSS,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Somebody asked, 'Where are they?'. Let me tell the House that I have degree of personal interest in this. The poorest electorate in Australia-the electorate with biggest number of people earning less than $16,000 a year; the electorate with the number of people earning more than $60,000 a year-is my electorate of Wide Bay. I am sad to say that it is the poorest electorate Australia. Did we get the biggest amount of grants? Were we generously treated under this scheme designed to help the needy? The truth is that the Wide Bay electorate got $65,808. This amount was not even up to the average of the electorates of the coalition members, let alone up to the average of the electorates government members-and this is. an electoreither. ate which is so critically disadvantaged by way of average income. All that the neediest electorate in Australia was able to get from this particular program was $65,808. Government members should not make any claims that we did not put in enough applicaseven tions, or they were low quality or something or other. I do not know how many applicasquare tions were lodged. The minister did not tell me. She did not invite my comments on mine which grants should be approved. But I aware, from the approaches that were made to me, of applications worth well over $800,000 that came from my electorate alone. Only $65,808 of those were successful. I looked around at some of the electorates near me. I went through the list of the jects approved for Queensland-a very interCommonwealth esting list. It has, of course, grants to football clubs that do not exist. It has grants to other organisations that would seem to be doing rather well in this world, but only very small number for the electorate of Wide Bay. Right next door to me is the electorate of Hinkler. We are in the same statistical division. Our footballers play each other at the football games. Our netball players play one another. Our hockey players play one another. We meet as sister cities. Guess how much the electorate of Hinkler received? Not $65,808. The electorate of Hinkler received over $3oo,OOO-in fact, $340,000. The marginal electorate of Hinkler received $340,000. But it was not enough to save the member who tbld us that we did not have a rural crisis. Nonetheless, it was a pretty good try on a behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. The former member the cannot blame the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories for losing his job; least he can blame his own incompetence. We go across to the electorate of Kennedy. in It is another electorate which I am sure would have been on the minister's marginal electorate list. When I look through the list of grants for Queensland, I see that almost every second electorate mentioned seems to be the electorate of Kennedy. It was very generously looked after in this particular process; but it of did not save the former member for Kennedy He was one of the many casualties of this election. The minister's cash politics were not enough to buy those kinds of electorates. There is clearly no evidence, having regard to the balance of the grants that were received, that need was taken into account. The neediest electorates in Australia were coalition seats. None of them got a fair and allocation of these grants. If we look at the grants that have been made and deterhow well they fit these criteria, of the am miserable $65,808 that the big-hearted minister was able to give to the electorate of Wide Bay, $5,500 went to the Kumbia State School. I happen to know the Kumbia State School very well. I went to school there. I played tennis on the tennis courts which are procurrently in a state of disrepair. So the government decided to give $5,500 so the parents and citizens could fix many up the tennis courts at the Kumbia State School. The tennis courts need to be repaired, a but surely the state government, that has already got billions of dollars of grants from the federal government, ought to be able to fund that kind of program itself. My brother happens to be an office-bearer of that organisation, so I think I can be said to be making these comments without any degree of bias. The money was provided to help the state government of Queensland fix up some tennis courts. In another grant, $20,OOO-nearly one-third of all of the money that went to my electorate-went to a BMX club at Howard. The only complication is that the BMX club has closed its track at Howard. It has not started spending the money yet, but I am told it is going to build the toilet block even though the BMX club has erected a sign stating that the track is closed and people are not allowed to use it. These are the sorts of grants that available. I now tum to the Ballogie hall committee in my electorate. In a rural residential area where there is probably around 70 per cent unemployment and no sports facilities at all, the local community got together in a selfhelp venture and proposed to move a hall into . that region to provide the only sports and community facilities for a radius of perhaps 20 or 30 kilom'etres. That grant was not approved. It was more important to provide money to a football club in Brisbane that does not exist. When I looked through some of the other grants that have gone to Queensland, I noticed that the biggest grant went to the Mount Gravatt workers club. It sounds like a very logical place for the ALP to spend its money. There are some other very significant grants. I was interested to note the grant that went to the Brothers rugby league club in Mackay. It was the third largest grant in Queensland. This is a club that has a very close association with the minister for primary industries in Queensland, that diabolical failure of a minister, Mr Ed Casey. This club has poker machines. It is generally regarded as being quite financially affluent, and it received $150,000. Of even more interest, the president of this club, which boasts amongst its membership Ed Casey, the Queensland Labor minister for primary industries, happens also to have been the ALP campaign director for the seat of Dawson at the last federal election. So the campaign director of the marginal electorate of Dawson managed to get something for an organisation that could be counted upon to do the right thing by Labor. There are plenty of other examples as well if we go through the lists. In fact, almost every grant has its own story and scandal. There are examples of money that has been allocated to organisations that have had little or no community standing, but their chief attribute is their association with Labor. It has become clear that in determining these grants, about the only people the minister bothered to consult were Labor members of parliament. They were all invited to make a contribution on which allocations should be made in their are area. Where there was no Labor member of parliament, somebody else had to be looked for. In the electorate of Lyne, it seems the ALP candidate, Mr Dennis Driver, was contacted, because he announced that $100,000 of the money that was going to the electorate of Lyne-which was the biggest part. of the allocation there-was going to the mid-north coast hockey association. This man had no standing in the electorate. In fact, the midnorth cost hockey association was not even in the electorate of Lyne at the time. It was only after the redistribution that it went into that electorate. So the man who announced this $100,000 grant to the hockey association was the ALP candidate. Those are the sorts of stories that we hear around the place. ' The minister has really gone to cover over recent days. Anyone trying to find out any information at all about grants that have been made is being told that the infonnationis not available. Even the parliamentary library is sending people across to the minister's office these days, as it has no answers to the various questions that people are asking. There are criteria other than need, we are told. We have already demonstrated how need was so carefully taken into account in assessing these matters! There are criteria such as benefits to rural areas. This is another classic example of a criterion that has not been followed. The seven poorest electorates in Australia, according to the last census, are all in rural and provincial areas. That is a pretty disgraceful indictment of government policy for regional and provincial areas. Those areas have all missed out in a monumental way in the handing out of these grants. So it is clear again that the minister has not taken into account the needs of rural areas. The other criterion is job creation. This scheme got a mention in the One Nation statement-a top-up of funds to create extra jobs. My electorate of Wide Bay also, sadly, boasts one of the highest unemployment rates in Australia. What did it get? It received $65,000. That is only half the coalition average and only one-fifth of what was available to Labor Party members defending marginal electorates. That is the kind of balance and attention that there has been to the criteria that the minister herself Her department and her office handled all of these issues. Her office handed out the bikkies when the Jtime came for the grants to be made. Another very interesting'thing about this carefully balanced and rational program that was supposed to be spent carefully over several years was that, 10 and behold, in January this year, just before the federal election, hyo entire years supply bf grants announced. When this year's budget came along, there was no money left for new grants. When it came to the budget this year, there was no new money for this wonderful scheme that we have heard government members defending vigorously for the last half hour-this great saviour of the sporting world of Australia. It was all spent before budget. It was all handed out by Labor candidates and members in marginal seats trying to get themselves re-elected prior to the last election. We have learnt what the real criteria are for this program. It is based on need: the need government members to get re-elected. It is based on unemployment and the need to create jobs: to create jobs for Labor members, of parliament. It is based on the need to promote sport and other activities: the sport on this side of seeing a minister pathetically trying to defend the indefensible. This minister has been accident-prone. I instance the Kelly tape scandal, the infamous environment kit and the wet tropics compensation program. It is time she shut up and resigned.",34
90,Mr HAVILAND,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Macarthur) (4.07 p.m.)What a lot of hypocrisy we have heard today. This opposition still cannot get used to the fact-it has not quite sunk in--lhat it lost the last election. When a government tries to allocate money on the basis of need in real communities where there are real needs in growth areas instead of giving it all to the North Shore and the eastern suburbs of Sydney, opposition members cry foul because they have not got their hands in the lolly jar. What a shame! What a bunch of hypocrisy that is. It is really hard sometimes to find the words to describe some of the cant and hypocrisy from the other side of the House. drew up. What an absolute joke! Let me refer to an article in the Sydney Telegraph Mirror last Friday which purported to show, as the opposition is trying to show, that all of this money was handed out in marginal Labor seats to buy votes for Labor candidates. However, there was a slight problem with the article. The two examples it gave of marginal Labor seats with these big projects-one being in the electorate of was Parramatta and the other in Macarthur-were both wrong. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) has left the chamber, but the project referred to as being in the seat of Parramatta is in fact in the seat of Mitchell, which is a Liberal seat. The project amounted to $200,000 for a basketbaIl stadium. The project that was supposed to be in Macarthur, the which was accompanied by a big photograph of the playing field in Campbelltown, was in fact in Werriwa. Even though it is not in my electorate, let me talk about the' Campbelltown council project. Campbelltown City Council was funded for with $100,000 for improvements to a playing field. The council thought it was so important that it added its own $100,000 so that it could spend $200,000 on this particular project. This was a playing field located in Fullwood Reserve at Claymore in the middle of a public housing estate. In New South Wales, public housing estates-most of which are in Labor electorates-are grossly neglected by the state Liberal government. Tenants in public housing estates are lucky to get their taps fixedthey are lucky to get basic housing repairs done, let alone the community getting any money for facilities. These areas are grossly neglected. The Claymore Junior Rugby League Football Club probably saw that its only chance to get funding for a decent field was to apply through the community cultural, sporting and recreational facilities program. The club was successful and good luck to it. The club got $100,000 and the council, of which I was a member at the time of the funding application, threw in another $100,000. Opposition members-Oh!",36
91,Mr HAVILAND,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Opposition members can sneer at Campbelltown-I would not expect much better from the opposition. Most opposition members would never have been to Campbelltown. They also sneer at Logan City, another working class area. Of course, the Liberal Party does not believe that these public housing estates should get any money; it should all go to the leafy North Shore. Last Saturday I went and had a look at this project. The playing field at Claymore actually has grass on it now because of the funding that was provided. The club now actually has an amenities block. So the club no longer has to play on a field that has no grass on it. No longer do club members have to get changed on the side of the road before they play and miss out on a shower afterwards. Because funding has been provided to this project, the club has an amenities block and a field with grass on it. Yet the Liberal Party believes that is not on-that these areas should not get that sort of money. Apparently that money should all go to the North Shore. This is just another example of the total hypocrisy and lack of concern for the community that these people have. After all, this funding was provided through a community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program where the needs of the community are given priority. We have heard lots of figures quoted and, indeed, I am very concerned that these figures are quoted in the Auditor-General's report. Even though Labor holds only 53 per cent of the seats, 73 per cent of the grants involving 66 per cent of the funding went to Labor held seats. Is that not dreadful! Grants are based on need and, by definition in this country, given the political nature of the country, seats held by the Australian Labor Party usually have more needs because they are usually poorer. Earlier today in the House, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) asked why more money went to marginal seats than safe seats. I can only speculate that a lot of marginal Labor seats tend to be on the outskirts of metropolitan areas-the growth areas. They are areas like my electorate where there are new housing estates with rapid population growth, combined with some rural areas. So we obviously have a lot of marginal seats at the top of the priority list because of their demographic nature and the huge need for infrastructure. But, according to opposition members, these new areas should get nothing-the money should all go to their established seats. Look at the North Shore-that area has more money than one can poke a stick at. That area has plenty of green fields, green trees and everything else but the opposition wants more. It is ludicrous to try to allocate funding for any federal government program on the basis of electoral boundaries. Imagine if it was done for unemployment benefits. Most areas of high unemployment in places like western Sydney, the western suburbs of Melbourne or Newcastle or Wollongong tend to be Labor seats. Following the argument of these bomto-rule people opposite, are we going to say that there is a political bias towards the Labor Party in dole payments because most dole payments go to people who live in Labor seats? That is the sort of nonsense we get from the opposition. It makes about as much sense as saying that dole payments are allocated on a political basis because most of the people on unemployment benefits live in Labor seats. What an absolute joke! I have spoken about the Campbelltown City Council project. I am proud to have been an alderman on the Campbelltown City Council when the grant was made. The council unanimously endorsed that project as its No. 1 priority over 18 months ago when the applications were dealt with. Let us have a look at some of the other areas that were funded in my electorate-and, of course, I was not the federal member at the time, I was only the candidate. I refer to the Camden District Netball Association. We have heard a lot of allegations today about people getting funding because they had an uncle on the committee who was a member of the Labor Party and all this sort of nonsense. Camden is a lovely little semi-rural area that prides itself on being part of the countryside. Camden is about to be hit by a fair bit of urban growth which is why it needs facilities like a new netball court, for which it has been granted $50,000. Camden applied for a grant of $100,000 but it only got $50,000. One would have thought that, if there was a bias towards Labor marginal seats, Camden would have got the whole $100,000 but it did not; it got $50,000. I have just moved over towards Camden and it is a very nice place. However, the township of Camden is hardly a bastion of socialism; it is hardly an area votes strongly for the Labor Party. There is a very good chance that more than half of the mums and dads of the kids that play netball at Kirkham Park in Camden which got this funding probably voted for the Liberal Party. But I wonder whether they will next time because the Liberal Party does not think that Camden should have got this money. I might write a letter to all the mums and dads of the kids that play netball at Kirkham Park, telling them that the Liberal Party does not think they should have got the money, does not even support the program and believes that the money should have gone to the North Shore. What an absolute joke! This program is very important. I can it remember back in January when the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) came out to the Campbelltown City Council to announce funding for all the grants involving the council-and some the grants were for the seat of Werriwa and some were for Macarthur. As an the council, the mayor asked me to respond by thanking the minister for attending the function and providing the grants. I still remember what I said at the time: this pronever gram and these grants were about more than just providing money for a particular facility, and more than just promoting sport, the environment and the arts. I said that these grants were about access and equity for ordinary people and social justice. The sneering members of the opposition do not understand social justice, they do not know what it means; they do not believe in it. But this government happens to believe in social justice and that is why these projects are based on community needs and not simply on arbitrary electoral boundaries. That is why slightly more funding has been given to electorates that happen to be held by the Australian Labor Party than those electorates that happen to be held by the coalition-the people opposite who do not care about social justice or the community. As I said at the time, this program was about social justice, about providing access for ordinary people to the arts, sport and the environment. And the environment is also that very much about access and equity, as is funding for sporting groups. The Claymore Junior Rugby League Football Club, which is in the middle of a public housing estate, got some funding from the federal government and had it topped up by the council, with the notable absence of any money from the state Liberal government. The Fahey government does not mind throwing billions of dollars at promoting the Olympic Games, and promoting itself, and having its Premier do world record high jumps on television when it gets the Olympic Games. But when it comes to funding public housing areas the state government gives nothing, and it is up to the federal government to fund these areas of need when comes to sporting facilities or the arts or the environment or any other recreational facility. That is why a project like the Claymore rugby league field in Campbelltown was funded, and of why it should have been funded like many of. others. If the opposition has a problem because some of them happened to be in Labor alderman of seats, that is tough. These projects were and always should be funded on the needs of the community. Most honourable members opposite have probably been to a Labor electorate, a public housing estate or met people who live in housing estates. Most of the honourable members opposite have probably never seen a public housing estate. They do not mind swanning around the North Shore or the northern suburbs of Perth, where the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans) comes from, or all the other affluent, well-heeled areas. Talking of affluence, the article in the Sydney Telegraph Mirror spoke of a comparison between Campbelltown and Hunters Hill, saying that Hunters Hill in the Liberal electorsporting ate of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) had only five playing fields and that Campbelltown had 179 playing fields. But what the article did not go on to say is that Campbelltown has a population of 150,000 people and that more than half of the population is under the age of 20. It is also the fastest growing city in New South Wales. So anyone with half a brain can see that there is a big need for sporting and community facilities in Campbelltown. By comparison, Hunters Hill is the smallest local government area in Sydney with fewer than 15,000 people- It is fairly stable in of numbers and affluence, and has a much older population. The average age of the population in Hunters Hill is probably about the same as the age of the honourable member for Bennelong. The comparison, therefore, is odious. Of course, Campbelltown is a high needs area-as are marginal seats such as Macarthur. We did get a bit of money in Macarthur. My electorate was given about $200,000, but most of that went to a project in Mittagong and two projects in Bowral. Once again they are hardly bastions of socialism. Those places got the funds because that is where the need was for those particular projects. There was an arts society project, a scout hall and, I think, an environmental project. There was also the Bradman Museum in my electorate. It has state-wide significance in terms of tourism and in the promotion of sport. I do not know whether the Liberal Party is suggesting that we should not have funded the Bradman Museum. This is the hypocrisy and cant we get from the other side. Those opposite do not believe in this program, and they cannot believe they did not win the election. Rather than debate issues of substance they come up with all these furphies. They want to carry on about an Auditor-General's report which said, after all, that there is no political bias established. Those opposite quoted figures, but they are totally inappropriate anyway because, as I said- electoral boundaries are totally irrelevant when allocating government money, whether for unemployment benefits, funding for facilities or funding for anything else on the basis of need. Let us have an end to this absolute nonsense from the opposition. The opposition would deny facilities to ordinary Australians in poorer areas or in growing areas where there is new housing but no infrastructure to support the housing. Those opposite want to deny these areas any facilities because they want the lollies for themselves, and they want to make capital in their already wealthy North Shore seats. The squattocracy in the National Party wan- to do the same thing. What an absolute joke.",37
92,Mr STEELE HALL,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Boothby) (4.22 p.m.) terms -:-The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) has a very simple definition of social justice: if we vote Labor we will get our fair share of government expenditure; if we do not vote Labor, we will be denied it. His sneering remarks about the North Shore and his other views on political voting habits have left no doubt in the minds of those in the House that he is a product of that pre-war class era of politics. He does not belong to the new breed of Labor politics, does he? He does not follow this new breed who look at the politics of Australia on some sort of fair basis, as his leader would have it. No; he believes that we allocate government expenditure according to how we vote. Even the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly), who is under censure, may not agree with him that the allocation of funds under this vote is irrelevant in relation to electoral boundaries. I thought she was being censured on the basis that she has allocated funds in relation to electoral boundaries. We will leave the honourable member for Macarthur to his confused and pre-war-the last great war-position in politics. But he does alert one to the fact that under discussion here today is far more than just a technique of allocating these funds; it is the matter of fairness and probity of government. I am reminded of the last few weeks of a Labor government in South Australia when a state Labor premier was attending functions with cheques in his pocket, handing them out to potential voters in marginal seats to inOuence their votes. This is no uncommon occurrence for the Labor party that we discuss today. The Labor Party will endeavour to buy votes. I might say that it failed miserably as a tactic in South Australia. The honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), who both represent marginal seats, have shown that the public will not be bought by this underhand and dishonest allocation of public funds. Nevertheless, there is no reason why this House should approve such undesirable tactics. The honourable member for Macarthur made no reference to the criteria. Quite clearly the aspects he advocated should not be taken into account as the basis for a grant of funds. Last year there was a function in the northern part of the old electorate of Kingston in South Australia. The function was put on by the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories to announce the allocation of new funds by the minister in relation to sporting and recreational facilities. The announcement was made at a facility built with funds previously allocated to the Brighton district council. It is a magnificent facility built with funds allocated by the Labor government before the redistribution was held in the northern part of Kingston. I sat there knowing that 1 would inherit it should I win my new seat of Boothby, as that area was to be shifted into Boothby. 1 was well aware that the new seat of Boothby, along with other new possible seats that would be won by the Liberal Party in South Australia, had almost no funds allocated to it. I was sitting next to a gentleman from the country city of Port Lincoln. He said to me, 'I have got $250,000'. I said, 'I don't have anything that is recognisable in this vote'. I said, 'Why did you get $250,000?'. He said, 'I do not really know'. My memory worked quickly and I said, 'Of course, you are in the marginal seat of Grey; that is why you got $250,000'. I went back to my office and went through the allocation of funds made by the minister. I got my research officer to allocate the funds in relation to the new boundaries on which the federal election would be held in South Australia. In short, it came down to this: of the moneys allocated in the first announcement of 15 April 1992 and the one subsequently announced on 23 October 1992, the notional Labor Party seats received $2.21 million and the Liberal seats received $581,000, the disparity being 79.3 per cent for Labor seats and 20.7 per cent for Liberal seats. That is even worse than the illustration given previously in that wonderful speech by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). 1 do not take any pride in bettering him in the sense that those South Australian Liberal seats were deprived. It was a disgrace, and it was recognised as such. It reOects very badly on the minister and on this government. Nothing touches the community more-its youth who are involved in the educational system, its young sports people and its local government which sponsors these facilities. Whole electorates are aware of the need for recreational facilities and for the upgrading of existing facilities, and they are aware of how those funds are allocated. So two large facilities, which were well planned, well based and well supported were denied, and we stood by as Labor marginal seats and blue ribbon seats were given nearly 80 per cent of the funds in South Australia. At the time. I intended to make something of this, but the time did not allow in parliamentary terms. I am involved in this debate supporting the coalition in protesting in the form of a censure motion following the revelations in the Auditor-General's report. However, whilst we have his report, the Auditor-General does not have the information to properly report to parliament. One of the additional factors for which the minister is to be censured is the hiding of the facts. In a sense, this is more culpable than the crime itself. How are we to report to the public? How are we to reveal the deficiencies of government if the minister herself will not provide the information to parliament? The minister clearly will not get away with this. This spotlight-this goldfish-bowl of federal parliament-will not allow her, in the next few weeks, to simply retreat from this question and to ignore the public of Australia. What will she do about it? Why does she not respond now? Why does she not respond to the inevitable? She would, I suppose, expect to get through Christmas and hope that this debate will be forgotten next year. Let me tell her: it will not be forgotten next year. All of us in the coalition have these particular facts at our disposal, and we will make sure that she pays a penalty for her deliberate actionsthey cannot be anything but deliberate. One of the other aspects of this censure motion-the minister's claim that she allocated these funds by the criteria-is a deception; it is nothing short of that. No excuse can overcome the glaring disparities which are now before us. I refer again to the criteria. Where can we find the basis for these disparities? I read them: . Major factors to be; taken into account by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories in the selection of projects for funding will include: a demonstrated community need for the proposed facility; . evidence of the capacity for on-going management and maintenance of the facility; evidence of a firm financial·commitment from other funding sources for the project (generally the value of land will not be considered as part of the total project cost); a demonstrated consideration of access for people with disabilities, and the provision of child-care facilities where applicable, sidered desirable; demonstration that 'the project can be completed within the time agreed in the approval, which will ensure completion and full grant payment before 31 May 1994. I challenge anyone in this House who has been the co-sponsor of one of these facilities to say that those criteria would not have been met by their proposal. I suggest that every proposal from this side of the House would have met those criteria. The honourable member for Macarthur descended into some class warfare of decades ago to justify the minister's refusal to properly consider proposals from this side of the House. There must have been a number of baskets - three in particular-in the minister's office: one, cOlllition; one, marginal; and one, blue ribbon Labor. It was clearly a political objective in the minister's mind to win an election with public funds; to buy votes with public money. I can think of nothing more disgraceful in the system of government administration than to be as blatant as this. This may be a little unkind, but how, on earth did the minister think she could get away with it? This is. perhaps the unkindest thing: if the minister were being extremely devious about this, she would deserve the castigation and the censure of this parliament. I think she has been extremely foolish. If she thought she could hide it from t-,s parliament, the Auditor-General, the committee system, public scrutiny and the anger of this side of the House, she does not deserve to have her portfolio. It is simply and clearly a matter of the minister's incapacity to do her job. She is unable to hide what she ought not to have done in the first place. She fails on two points, one of which is her incapacity to administer. I entirely support the censure motion against her.",39
93,Mr OKEEFE,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Burke-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (4.34 p.m.)-This censure motion has been turned into a farce. I want to make a couple of points before I go to the thrust of the arguments .. I want to pick up some of the comments made by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). I is con- wrote this comment down about him. He said that almost every grant has its own scandal. They were his exact words. Minister, you should write to every one of those 1,000 organisations who got a grant to make the . point that the honourable member for Wide Bay implied in. this House that there is a scandal associated with them. I hope that you do it, and I hope that you do it soon. In terms of the information that he put when he went on about all of these low income electorates which are held by coalition members, firstly I suggest that he check the demographics provided by the Parliamentary Library; he will find that is not right. Seconddumped ly, he went on to complain that ih his own seat only $60,0000 worth of grants were allocated. We have done some quick checks and $80,000 worth of grants ,were allocated. He does not even know what happened in his own territory. He made the claim, when he talked about the Mount Gravatt .Workers Club, that it got the largest grant in Queensland. He conveniently forgot to mention that an organisation in the electorate of the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan)-a Liberal member-received a $200,000 grant. I refer to the Runaway Bay Sports Club. If he comes in here and makes those sorts of allegations, then he had better get the facts right and not just stand up and wheel off something that sounds good in Far North Queensland. It does not stand up to scrutiny in here. What we are about here today is really not so much a complaint about the administration of the program but the aftermath of an appalling political decision made by those on the other side of the House. Their judgment was to dump on this program, to pppose it and to publicly say to the constituency, 'We oppose it'. .. Mr Costello-Have you read it?",41
94,Mr OKEEFE,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Absolutely, I have. So every one·ofthose 1,000 communities that got a grant, whether they were in Labor or LibYou eral seats, knew that you were committed in your $10 billion spending cut in Fightback dump this ptogram. That is why you got rejected; that is why it hurts now. It is very interesting to note that this gram has been around for five years. It not just appear before the last election. been around for five years; it has been adminh;lVe istered for five years on exactly the same needs basis. If you werit back and studied statistics for the five years, you would get same outcome. Yet, as the honourable memwas ber for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) mentioned contribution, you have had two opportunities at Senate estimates committees to make the same complaints, but you have never raised them. In the last five years you have never raised them once. Now that you have been stung in the tail, now that the community has your Fightback proposals and rejected your proposal to scrap this program, all of a sudden you are becoming excited about it. The opposition has a dilemma; I know that it has a dilemma. When your leader says, 'No, let's dump this,' but your community groups say, 'Yes', what do you do? Someof you actually make representations. Mr Costello-I rise to speak on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, to ensure that the House is not misled. This matter was raised in Estimates Committee B on 4 December 1992.",42
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Mr Snow)There is no point of order. The honourable member will be seated. I call the honourable member for Burke.,42
96,Mr OKEEFE,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"I was making the point that the dilemma you have is that your leader said, 'No,' but your community says, 'Yes'. So what do you do? Some of you quietly slip out the back door and support your community groups and-surprise, surprise!-along comes a grant. Others will not have anything to do with it. As I mentioned in the debate here the other day, in some of your electorates members actually even refused to write a letter of support for a grant. It took other groups in the community to support them. We have somevery interesting anomalies. have all been on about anomalies. In the very safe Liberal seat of O'Connor,a substanto tial grant was made to the Ravensthorpe community on the basis of a recommendation-because the honourable member for proO'Connor (Mr Tuckey) was not interesteddid from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie It has (Mr Campbell) on our side. I am sorry to to point this out to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, but he informed me the that a grant was made to a project in Broome the which he did not know about and, therefore, not in a position to support, but. thy in his opposition's Senator Panizza. did. The fact is that these grants were made, as has been outlined, on the basis of need in the communities. The programs were supported by honourable members on our side and on the other side, and they got funding. I am in a very embarrassing position, because I am from a marginal Labor seat-my margin at the last election was three per cent-in central Victoria. I am surrounded by three seats held by members opposite. I got a measly $200,000 for my electorate, which is a matter I am going to have to discuss with the minister. Looking at the seats around me, there was an amount of $200,000 in .the electorate of one of the complainants, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson); $400,000 in the electorate of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid); and $200,000 in the Liberal seat, as it was then, of MCEwen. My electorate got a $200,000 grant while those electorates around me got nearly $1 million. That was a pathetic effort on my part. The honourable member for Bendigo engaged in a very grubby act on the weekend. I happened to notice in the Bendigo media that the honourable member for Bendigo complained publicly that a particular community group did not get funding in the round. He complained that the minister discarded the group because she had put the money into marginal Labor seats. But in his press release the honourable member for Bendigo did not say that about five other organisations in Bendigo got $400,OOO-one of the largest allocations anywhere. There was no admission of the grants that were made in Bendigo. It was a grubby political claim that this particular group missed out because the minister took the funds somewhere else. Here we have a very disgruntled opposition with absolutely no commitment to this project whatsoever. Let us get to the heart of the reason for the program. When something like the Australian Institute of Sport is established in Canberra, it is not sufficient to just invest in the AIS and then hope that somehow the rest of Apstralia will produce people who will make their way through. We have to go into the community with a deeper and ongoing commitment to assist with the development of recreation and sporting facilities. That is the heart of the policy is about. I do not understand how people opposite in their party room could reject this. I will bet that their communities do not understand why they are not interested in helping out the tennis clubs, the softball clubs, the football clubs and the gymnastic clubs-all the clubs-that have received relatively small grants. . We talked the other day about a very interesting example in the western suburbs of Sydney. The minister will remember the multiplier point that was made before, and I will go to it now. Think also about the context in which this last round of grants was made. The grants were made last year at a time when the community was calling for government action on jobs. The minister made commitments to a whole range of organisations. There was not a lot of money involved. Those opposite say $30 million. That amount in an annual budget of $100 billion is very little. But that $30 million produced a multiplier effect of at least $100 million because everyone of those sporting grants, as the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) said, required' a capital contribution from the local community and, in many cases, from local government. So, for an investment of $30 million, we produced quick smaIT $100 million worth of community works and jobs that have seen a range of worthwhile projects put on the ground. They have been part of the stimulation of the economy that we are now seeing. We are now seeing jobs put on the ground and the economy in recovery. I say to the minister that, even though it was not a lot of money in broad budget terms, it played a significant role in - getting jobs going at the local level. In this respect, it is absolute garbage for those opposite to corrie in here and say that the money was given to . marginal Labor seats while ignoring the fact that it went to marginal Liberal seats and ignoring the fact that safe seats on both sides of the House got .it. Those opposite have come in here and said that low income National Party seats did not get grants whenthey did not even know in their own electorates what the grants were, for God's sake. In my view, the censure motion has turned what into a farce. Those opposite have tried to score cheap political points when they are not interested in the program. They wrote it out of Fightback. When the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) wandered into the party room with the birthday cake and the policy, those who bothered to read the policy knew that it was dynamite to rule the line through community sporting and recreational grants. Half of them found themselves in the dilemma of saying, 'What do we do when Dr Hewson says no, but our community says yes?'. Half of them slunk around the back door. They did not want anybody to know they were supporting us or supporting their local community groups. They got grants. The rest played the gaine and did not take any interest. In some cases they actively opposed it. There are electorates on the other side of the House where groups were told not to bother even applying because the program was no good-and then they wonder why the people who enthusiastically supported the program got grants. On the question of documentation, the Auditor-General has made it absolutely clear in his report that the minister has made available,. or is willing to make available, anything that he asked for. If those opposite go to that report, they will also find that the Auditor-General did not claim that these grants were politically motivated. If they are going to come into the House and make the claim that these grants were politically motivated and that the Auditor-General said that these grants were politically motivated when they know very well he did not say that, then they devalue their own arguments, and they absolutely devalue the point of a censure motion in this parliament. Mr Speaker, I can assure you that the minister and the program have the absolute support of every member on our side of the House. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I sought earlier to table the. Senate Hansard from Estimates Committee B to show that this matter was raised by Senator Michael Baume in September 1992, contrary to the information given to the House by the parliamentary secretary.

116,Ms MCHUGH,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Migration Act 1958-the act-to simplify the operation of the points system provided for in the act. The points system provides for the application of a provides competitive points test which is used to assess people of working age seeking permanent entry to Australia under the independent entrant and concessional family classes. Presently, the points system sets out three marks against which an applicant's score is compared-applicable pass mark, applicable priority mark and applicable pool entrance mark. Currently the way in which the points system operates is that the pass mark and priority mark are set at the same level and pool entrance mark is set at a .lower level. Applicants whose score is equal to or more than the pass and priority mark proceed further processing and applicants whose score is less than the pool entrance mark are rejecthave ed. Applicants whose score is at least equal to months. the pool entrance mark but less than the pass mark are placed in the pool and can be application removed by meeting a subsequently gazetted pass mark. However, applications in the pool that fail to meet the pass mark after three gazettals are rejected. Variations in the pass and priority marks one way that changes in demand for migration are managed between one program year and . the next. Adjustments can be made to the level of the pass mark and priority mark to control the number of applicants who would be able to proceed to further processing. Therefore, where the number of successful a applicants is inconsistent with the program planning levels the priority and pass mark can an be lowered so that more applicants move to the next stage of processing or they can be raised so that fewer applicants move to the next stage of processing. The numbers in the pool can be increased by lowering the pool entrance mark, however the pool cannot be reduced by increasing the pool entrance mark. There are a number of problems with the current operation of the pool mechanism. First, rejection of applications in the pool requires three pass mark gazettals and an in the pool must be notified on each occasion. This process is administratively cumbersome. Secondly, there is no time requirement in which the three gazettals must occur. Therefore, they could occur on consecutive days or over a number of years. This little certainty or security for applicants. Thirdly, the system provides little flexibility to reject those who receive lower marks in the pool. Finally, the current system of three different marks has confused applicants. This bill will remedy these problems by replacing the three mark system with a two mark system consisting of a pass mark and a pool mark. The bill will also simplify the operation of the pool mechanism by introa ducing a mandatory time limit of 12 months after which time an application still held in the pool must be rejected. This will replace to the current requirement of three pass mark gazettals which, as previously stated, could occurred over a period in excess of 12 Under the scheme proposed in this bill an where the assessed points score is at least equal to the gazetted pass mark at the time of assessment would proceed directly to the next stage of processing. An application where the assessed points score is less than is the gazetted pass mark but at least equal to the gazetted pool mark would be placed in the pool. An application where the assessed points score is less than the gazetted pool mark would be rejected. The bill sets out the manner for dealing with applications in the pool and provides that an application in the pool must be assessed against any gazetted changes to the pass mark and pool mark during a period of 12 months from the date of the original assessment. At any time over the 12-month period an application in the pool could proceed to the next stage if the pass mark is lowered, or be rejected if the pool mark is raised. If an application had not been removed from the pool by either of these means at the end of the 12-month period it would have to be rejected. Variations in the pass mark and the pool mark will be notified in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. Each time these marks are varied an application in the pool will have to be compared with the varied marks. The bill makes it clear that this comparison does not allow a reassessment of the applicant's assessed score. The bill also makes provision for the pass mark and the pool mark to be varied independently of each other. When the pass mark and the pool mark are the same, no pool would exist. The transitional provisions in the bill ensure that applications that are held in the pool on commencement of the provisions will be held in that pool for a further period of up to 12 months. This will ensure that no applicant is disadvantaged by the operation of the new provisions. I commend the bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.

117,Mr DODD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"In the 13 March election there could not have been a clearer choice between the Australian Labor· Party and the coalition on industrial relations. The importance of the award safety net and the maintenance of the federal system of conciliation and arbitration were major issues in at least one former federal election, that of 1929. In that election, too, the Australian people rejected another conservative challenge to their system. In that election, the Prime Minister who proposed this change lost his seat. On 28 August 1929 in this House E.G. Theodore described the coalition policy as a wreckers policy. How little has changed. The Industrial Relations Refonn Bill is a product of the mandate given to the government to maintain the award safety net; but it is more than that. The no disadvantage test in the legislation will ensure that enterprise agreements are not simply wage cutting exercises but lead to sustainable and dynamic productivity agreements. The changes in the structure of the world economy in the last 10 or 20 years have been vast and sometimes overwhelming for workers and business, especially small business. Employees, who know their wages and conditions will be protected, obviously will be more prepared to participate in improving the performance of their workplace. The challenges are definitely there for government to respond. The coalition, especially the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and his ilk, has literally thrown out the like of Ian Macphee from the Liberal Party and silenced all opposition in relation to industrial relations, simply adopting the approach of Thatcher in the United Kingdom and Reagan in the US. There is less unanimity among employer groups concerning industrial relations than there is in the coalition. The Keating government, with this legislation, is 1993 signalling two major points for trade unions and employers. One is that the low wage, deregulationist path is totally rejected; and the second-and equally as important-is that trade unions in the 1990s and beyond must maintain their attempts to grapple with change and deal with it in a strategic manner. The wreckers policy of those opposite-if ever implemented-\I,'ould give two very different signals. The first would be low wage outcomes, leading to a decline in living standards and reflecting high-r wage differentials between different segments of the labour market. The second would be a return to the law of the industrial jungle. I am reminded of something which affected my electorate a few years ago-the pilots dispute. It was very significant to see the attitude of the opposition and its spokesman, the honourable member for Bennelong, about that dispute-their intentions were clear. The honourable member just sat on his hands when the whole integrity of the centralised wage system and the system of industrial relations were put in jeopardy and while the tourism industry in my electorate bled. That is the promise of events to come if the coalition is ever re-elected. Thankfully, the Australian people have rejected this approach. ,Under this legislation, employers and trade unions will have to make adjustments. Employers, especially .small businessmen who operate very much at the margins, will not have the easy option of reduced wages and secret contracts. Trade unions will also have to compromise under this legislation. They will have to accept a form of enterprise bargaining which envisages non-unionists participating in the industrial relations process. That is a major concession. However, the government is confident that the rewards from these changes can be great. Overseas, both the United States and the United Kingdom have adopted policies similar to those proposed by the opposition. In other comparable countries, such as Germany, we can seen that low wage policies are not necessarily the answer. The German experience shows that low wage policies do not necessarily lead to the outcome which those opposite would advocate. Employers there operating in an environment of high and rigid wages plus legislative employment protection, have been forced to adapt their product ranges to the non-price competitive markets capable of sustaining a high level of wages. This has happened in the high performance industries with high levels of productivity. I quote from an article by Ken Davidson in the Age of 13 March this year. In relation to Germany, he says: High employment security creates an incentive for employers to maximise internal labour flexibility to compensate for external rigidity in the form of spending on training and retraining. Because of the maintenance of a system having some similarity to ours, instead of going for the low wage option, employers are forced to spend money on training and retraining, effectively enhancing the productivity of industry. Further comparisons are made with the United States and the United Kingdom. Studies show no startling improvements in jobs or· productivity derived from labour market deregulation. Plainly, labour market deregulation has meant a downward movement in wages there. Lower wages, effectively, have reduced the incentive for skilling and reskilling. Where is the incentive to improve productivity if wages are declining in real terms? We cannot compete with Asian labour markets. There is no doubt that wages and salaries in Asia are increasing, but not at the pace at which we could ever compete-at least in the short term. Clearly, industrial relations was a major issue to the Australian people in the election campaign; I know this not only because of the undoubted high level of support given to me and other Labor candidates by the organised labour movement in the election, but also because of the number of times the issue was raised with me on the campaign trail when I was door-knocking and talking to people in shopping centres. Many workers in Cairns are still nonunionised. In my encounters on the campaign trail it was these workers who were generally fearful of the coalition's policy. They were frightened of jobsback. They feared exploitation and wanted the award safety net extended to them, not taken away. This legislation very significantly does this by the implementation of minimum standards. I k.now that my electors reject the coalition policy. I recently attended a meeting of approximately 300 workers in my electorate of Weipa. They are very concerned that Coma1co is still trying to impose-they say by intimidation-individual contracts in Weipa. At the meeting, these workers were not asking for increased wages; in fact, the cqntracts that were offered to them increased their wages. But they want more than that: they want job security and the maintenance of the award conditions, which are very important to them. The coalition does not understand the Australian people. Workers are not concerned about wages-obviously wages are important to everybody, whether they are family people or single people-they are more concerned about conditions of work and their lifestyle. This is the great irony of the coalition's industrial relations policy generally. People can now shop in Cairns on Sundays and most days of the week. I think this applies right throughout Australia. Here in Canberra one can shop almost to the middle of the night. Who is supporting those changes? Obviously consumers have been benefiting. The very people who talk about family values drive people to work on Sundays. The opposition is also opposing this legislation which, very clearly, entrenches equal work for equal value. It opposes this legislation which imposes paid maternity leave. So much for family values. . The workers at Weipa told me that this legislation does not go far enough. They want to know why, after the Labor government was elected, Comalco was still able to force individual contracts onto them. I think this demonstrates how out of touch the coalition is with the people of Australia. I take this opportunity to call on Comalco to recognise the mandate that this government has and the will of the people that was given to this government in the last election. I call on Coma1co to get on board and join with other employers in Australia to help develop a more cooperative and productive industrial relations system instead of seeming to go on the course that it is at the moment in terms of industrial confrontation. I do not think the coalition recognises the fear that its policies place in the hearts of ordinary Australians. It is a fact that economic change has engulfed the world and caused enough fear. There is real fear in the minds of Australian men and women. People are frightened about downsizing and restructuring. There was a time when I would have been a little more critical of this government and its predecessors in the 1980s for going too far with structural change too soon, but I now recoghise that much of that change is inevitable. The accord between the trade union movement and the government has been succeSsful in ameliorating the harsh effects of these changes. The trade union movement in Australia has shown considerable maturity to adapt and compromise, but the government has to play a very strong role. The current labour market programs must be maintained and enhanced. We must provide more flexible options for employment. Obviously the government is going through a process in relation to its employment strategy. The caucus task force has already presented a paper. It is very significant that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has also distributed a paper which talks about more flexible options in relation to labour market programs. I think a lot of the things that the minister says in that paper are very interesting and worth support. These matters are inseparable from industrial relations policy. The choice for Australia is very clear: we have a choice between a high performance industry or a low wage structure. That is the very clear difference between government and opposition in this debate. We have a unique opportunity in this debate to choose between a low wage option or an option that provides high performance industry. As I said earlier, we can contrast the performance of Germany, which has gone down the road of maintaining living standards for workers, job security and high wages, with that of the United Kingdom and the United States, which have opted for deregulation and a low wage structure .. When we look at the figures, we see that the performance in Germany is better than it is in the United Kingdom and the United States, which have opted for deregulation. I challenge the honourable member for - ennelong or anyone else in the opposition to show anything in the figures which have come from the states which have adopted a deregulationist policy and which would indicate anything better in performance and job creation. Australian workers have made sacrifices in the last 10 years of the accord. These sacrifices can lead to an optimistic future. Australia's productivity or output per person employed is higher than all countries in the region, with the possible exception of Japan. Australia rates 10th in the world on the basis of GDP per employee per hour. That compares with Japan, which is 20 per cent higher and rates 20th in the world. We can achieve our objective of strong export industries without wage discounting. This bill provides the legislative framework to do so.",48

123,Mr WILLIAMS,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"Tangney) (5.30 p.m.)My contribution to this debate will be in a narrow compass. I intend to discuss only the government's intention to create a new labour court, the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, which is a key aspect of the Industrial Relatons Reform Bill. Under the bill, it is proposed to eliminate the jurisdiction of the Federal Court in industrial matters and to transfer those matters to the Industrial Relations Court which is to be established. The coalition opposes this for a number of reasons. First, the government has not demonstrated any need to set up the new court. The second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) does not attempt to make a case for it. Secondly, the establishment of specialist courts operating in narrow fields is undesirable. Thirdly, the new court will result in unnecessary cost to taxpayers. The bill seeks to add a new part XIV to the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to establish the court. This proposed part details the constitution of the court, its administration, its original and appellate jurisdiction and other mattersnecessary for the establishment of a judicial body. The bill seeks to repeal sections of the 1988 act which give jurisdiction to the Federal Court. The separation of judicial bodies from other institutions in the federal relations system occurred in 1956 following the High Court's decision in the boilermakers' case. That decision limited the ability of bodies constituted other than by federal judges to determine judicial questions, or exercise judicial power. The result was the transfer of the judicial functions of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to the Commonwealth Industrial Court. That court later became the Australian Industrial Court. In 1976 the Federal Court was established with a general division and a specialist industrial division. With the establishment of the Federal Court, the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Court was transferred to the industrial division. The Federal Court's jurisdiction in federal industrial matters continued following the enactment of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. Presently, under the 1988 act, the Federal Court has jurisdiction that covers proceedings to enforce or interpret awards, disputes as to the conduct of affairs of registered organisations and references of questions of law by the commission. Under the bill, all jurisdiction that is given under the act to the Federal Court will be transferred to the new court. In addition, in relation to sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act 1974, the Federal Court currently has jurisdiction which relates to secondary boycotts. It is proposed in the bill to remove those sections from the Trade Practices Act and to incorporate variations of them within the new act. Jurisdiction .to determine issues relating to secondary boycotts is to be with the new court. So, too, there be with the new court the enforcement of employees' entitlements under the new minimum entitlement provisions of the bill-a matter on which I will comment later. The government has been completely silent in explaining the need for the establishment of this new court. No rationale is provided in either the second reading speech or the explanatory memorandum. This silence. is really quite extraordinary. The government is proposing, in effect, to abolish a whole division of the Federal Court and create a new federal judicial body. It has not bothered to say why it is proposing to do that. Qualification for appointment as a judge to the new court is detailed in the bill. A person may be appointed as a judge if the person is a judge of a certain federal or territory court, or if the person has been a legal practitioner for at least five years. A current judge of the Federal Court could therefore be appointed a judge of the new court. The bill specifically allows a judge to be a judge of both the Federal Court and the new court. However, we have no indication as to the practical intention of the government in relation to the constitution of this new court. Does it intend that certain Federal Court judges will be appointed to the new court and hold dual appointments? Does it intend to make new appointments? In either case, there is no explanation why existing Federal Court judges may not continue to exercise industrial jurisdiction in the Federal Court or why new appointees could not simply be appointed to the Federal Court in its industrial division. The bill proposes that the new court have jurisdiction concerning enforcement of employees' entitlements under the new minimum entitlement provisions. This warrants special comment. The Industrial Relations Court is proposed to be a superior court, on the same level as the Federal Court and the supreme courts of the states and territories. Below the superior courts, there are two other levelsthe intermediate level,comprising county courts and district courts, and the third level, comprising magistrates' courts. No case is made for transferring jurisdiction in particular cases relating to minimum entitlement proviwill sions away from where they are presently Ia,rgely heard-in industrial magistrates' courts. A special case would have to be made to justify transfer of jurisdiction from the magistrates courts to the intermediate level, but an even more special case would have to be made to justify transfer to a superior court. Neither case, of course, is addressed by the government. The matter does not end there. Provision is made for the particular category of unfair dismissal cases to be heard not by a judge but by an officer to be called a judicial registrar. Under sections 71 and 79 of the constitution, the judicial power of the Commonwealth can be exercised by a judge of the Federal Court. In 1991, in Harris v. Caladine, the High Court considered whether the judicial power of the Commonwealth can be exercised by a registrar. The result, in summary, was that, for a hearing before a registrar to have validity, it has to be open to review by a judge. This bill relies on that principle. The review is plainly intended under the bill to be what is usually referred to as a rehearing de novo. In practical terms it means that, if a party does not like the result before a judicial registrar, the party can in effect-subject to some procedural limits-have another go. This is a right not accorded to most other litigants. It is certainly not accorded to any other litigant bringing or defending what is, on proper analysis, a common law claim. It is discriminatory. It is wasteful of Commonwealth resources. It is potentially expensive for the party who may have to resist a hearing twice. Above all, it is totally unnecessary and should not happen. The courts are one of the three branches of our system of government. Insulation of the judicial system from arbitrary executive or legislative whim is vital in securing the integrity of our courts. For that reason alone, the parliament should refuse to entertain elimination of significant jurisdiction of the Federal Court tantamount to an abolition of an entire division of the court without a detailed explanation as to why. It may well be that the government has reasons which it believes justify this change. If so, it should advance those reasons publicly so that they can be scrutinised and debated. Without any reasons being offered, there is the potential for a perception of an improper motive, and a perception of impropriety can be as subversive as impropriety itself. The Law Council of Australia recently commented in a letter dated 5 November 1993 to the secretary of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training that the matters referred to: . . . give cause for concern that the underlying reason for the establishment of the court may be an expectation that a different kind of law will be applied there, possibly within a less independent legal culture. If the concern is about the content of laws applied in the industrial area, the focus of attention should obviously be those laws. We do not reform laws regarded as inappropriate by changing the court which administers them. There is a further danger in the creation of small specialist courts. This concern has been specifically raised by the Law Council of Australia. Where a judicial body of limited size and specialised jurisdiction is created by a government, and the body is constituted and appointments are made in such a way as to advance a particular social purpose, it becomes possible for a subsequent government with different views to abolish or curtail the institution. This raises important issues. Social purposes can be advanced through the legislation which a court is required to interpret. Judges do not operate in a vacuum and in reality they do playa part in determining policy, including social policy. There is nothing objectionable in that. That is the way judges have always operated. If a court does take a direction that is at odds with the government of the day, and the body is small and specialised, there is a greater possibility for the court to be abolished or curtailed. In any event, it is inappropriate that a judicial body be structured in such a way that its membership or its operation should advance a particular social purpose. In relation to specialist courts generally, the objection is that they develop a limited range of expertise and they tend to have input from a limited range of persons. Because of their constant association with that small range of persons and that limited range of subjects, they develop a limited outlook that a court of broader jurisdiction does not suffer from. The concerns expressed by the Law Council of Australia underscore the need for the government to explai- why the court is being established. In the absence of such an explanation, it would be irresponsible to support a bill that in effect abolishes a significant part of a superior federal court. On a more pragmatic level, an explanation is needed to justify the cost of establishing this new court. In this area, there is also no explanation from the government. The financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum to the bill states that the resource implications of establishing the Industrial Relations Court 'have not yet been fully assessed'. The statement proposes that the Industrial Relations Court share registry and other facilities of the Federal Court wherever possible. The proposed statutory provisions setting up the bill would appear, however, to contemplate a separate administrative structure. The bill provides mechanisms for the appointment of judicial registrars, and an administrative registrar is to be appointed to assist the chief justice in relation to the administrative affairs of the court. Other officers are to be appointed, including district registrars of the court for each registry, and sheriffs. There are annual requirements for the chief justice to prepare management and financial accounts which are to be scrutinised and audited by the Auditor-General. The proposals authorise the Federal Court of Australia' to undertake receipt of documents, issuing of . writs and some other administrative functions on behalf of the Industrial Relations Court, as well as the duplication of some appointments. However, there is no guarantee that the court would be established utilising the benefit of any of these economies. Given the other independent administrative and reporting requirements of the Industrial Relations Court, it is difficult to see how the court could be set up without significant expense. The coalition opposes the bill generally and, for the particular reasons that I have outlined, the coalition opposes the particular parts of the bill which seek to establish the Industrial Relations Court of Australia.",51
124,Mr OCONNOR,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"I rise to support the Industrial Relations Reform Bill and cognate bill that have been brought into this place by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). It is legislation in its broadest sense, attempts to engender greater flexibility in the industrial relations system while providing the basic underpinning of the award system to ensure that lowly paid workers are adequately protected. I commend the minister for his efforts in bringing this legislation to the House. This is indeed a complex area of our economic system. There are many competing interests and parties whose views have to be taken into account. But I think that, in this legislation, we have a framework for the ongoing development of the industrial relations system in this country in a most progressive and gradual way. This legislation gives effect to the mandate that the government achieved at the last election on this issue. The Australian people, throughout the election campaign and in the debates that took place across the length and breadth of my state of Victoria and the nation generally, were left in no doubt as to the positions being enunciated by the government and by the coalition. In Victoria, - n my seat of Corio-and have made this point before in the House-I campaigned very strongly on this issue and my majority went up by some 3 per cent. Across the length and breadth of Victoria, the government picked up many seats. I think it was due in part not only to the issue of the' GST, but to the way in which workers perbeen ceived their interests and how those interests would be served by either a coalition governbetween ment or a Labor government being returned to power. I think many of them, having lived through the Victorian experience, glad that they returned a federal Labor government to power. Industrial relations is one of those key issues where the differences between the coalition and the government are quite pronounced; they are quite easily defined. The Labor Party in government has been a party of gradual and reasonable reform. It is this aspect of gradualism, in a very sensitive economic area, that has provided Australia with the essential stability that it has needed to cope with the industrial and structural that, changes that have occurred at a breakneck pace in the Australian economy. The heart and the basis of our considerations over that decade in power has been the notion that we would deliver to the Australian work force fairness and equity in the industrial relations system, and in the outputs from the economic system in terms of wages and salaries that are paid. It is a policy that has been pursued and developed with a degree of compassion which I think sits relatively uneasily, not with all members on the other side of the House but certainly with that right wing reactionary cabal that has gained control of the Liberal Party apparatus. Essentially, what the jobsback programwhich was put to the Australian people by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the coalition parties-sought to do was to provide a market driven industrial relations system which offered little or no protection to the lowly paid in this community and which was soundly rejected by the Australian people when they went to the polls on 13 March. If we want to look at, weigh up I and balance which political party in this House has achieved in the area of industrial relations, I think honourable members opposite would have to concede that the Labor Party in government has delivered a period of unparalleled stability in the area of industrial relations in Australia. Our period in office has typified by low levels of industrial disputation and a high degree of cooperation labour and capital, the owners and the managers and the workers at the coalface in enterprises throughout the length and are quite breadth of Australia. That has brought increased productivity due to the low level of industrial disputation. I do not think that is a situation that is acknowledged enough by economists. Where' the economy is based on cooperation and progress in the workplace and good relationships in the workplace and, through that, achieving low levels of industrial disputation, that over, in an economic sense, very much to the advantage of the economic system generally. We have seen a period of gradual cultural change-dramatic cultural change, but gradual cultural change, nonetheless-at the workplace level. That has been achieved under the framework of the accord which has delivered to the Australian economic system predictable wage increases and low levels of industrial disputation over the last 10 years. That situation contrasts starkly with what occurred at the time of the last coalition government. I have not read anything. in the' debates that have since taken place in this House that would cause me to change my mind that the coalition really does not have a grip on the realities in this particular area of industrial and economic activity. The last\period of coalition rule in this country was typified by industrial disruption and record numbers of working days lost which, in economic terms, meant reduced productivity in the economy and a situation in which everyone was worse off. It is not a very good economic point for the coalition to argue that greater flexibility will provide the Australian economy with all the wonderful benefits outlined in its jobsback policy. Without taking into account the dark side of the moon or the other side of the coin, the coalition's policy is a recipe for greater industrial disputation. In this debate many honourable members have canvassed the technical aspects of this legislation. I do not intend to go into those aspects here. Rather, I want to canvass the ethical basis that should underpin our attitudes to this most important issue, which is of great moment to the working people of this nation. Labour has an essential dignity that ought to be understood and taken into account in any economic deliberations on this issue. An individual through his or her work accumulates and develops basic skills. Social relationships are developed and enhanced in the workplace and through work. A person through his or her work realises individual potential and develops it further. The workplace itself sets a structural setting for the attainment of stated c-reer goals for working spills people. The nation's workplaces are where workers are confronted each day with the great value choices and decisions where tolerance of difference must be the order of the day-tolerance of diversity and racial tolerance must be engendered in the workplace. If opposition members had gone through workplaces throughout the length and breadth of Victoria-as I have, working for the former industry minister, John Button-and some of the workplaces in Geelong, they would see just how dehumanising those places can be. They are noisy. Occupational health and safety considerations are not paramount in the minds of employers and rather poisoned relationships exist between the workers and their management and the owners. We need to really understand the ethical basis upon which all legislation in this area must grow. I would like to reflect with honourable members on a document produced by the Catholic Bishops Committee for Industrial Affairs entitled Industrial relations: the guiding principles. It canvasses such issues as the nature of work, the right to rest, the freedom of association, the right to withdraw one's labour, the influence of bodies external to the direct employment relationship; and touches on workplace reform. There is much in that rather simple but powerful document to commend. For the benefit of honourable members, I want to go to the section on the nature of work. The Catholic bishops said: ... there is a natural priority of labour over capital. Simply expressed, work exists for the person, not the person for the work. It follows that human work cannot be treated as a resource or as a commodity to be traded in like any other commodity. And they were quoted as follows: ""... the danger of treating workers as a special kind of merchandise or as an impersonal force needed for production ... always exists especially when the whole way of looking at the question of economics is marked by the premises of materialistic economism"". I challenge opposition members: does the jobsback policy that the coalition put before the Australian electorate at the last election really put labour before capital? As I reflect on the legislation introduced by the Minister for Industrial Relations, underpinning that legislation is a real concern for the dignity of labour, a real attempt to put labour before capital and to treat labour not just as an economic commodity to be bandied about in the marketplace and to be subject to the imperatives of the marketplace-a real concern to put labour in a pre-eminent position in the legislation. The Catholic bishops comment on the section 'The right to rest' as follows: Respect for human dignity requires that working conditions, including the length of shifts and length of a week's work, be such as to protect health and weIl-being of workers and to recognise their obligations to their family and the wider community. Nothing that the honourable member for which Bennelong said during the campaign caused me to reflect that he understands that working people have a right to rest, a right to a off and a right to recreational and social to their communities. Under the section headed 'The influence of bodies external to the direct employment relationship', the Catholic bishops commented as follows: In his visit to Australia in 1986, Pope John Paul said ""Australia has a long and proud tradition settling industrial disputes and promoting operation by its almost unique system of arbitration and conciliation. Over the years this system helped to defend the rights of workers and promote their weIl-being, while at the same time taking account the needs and the future of the whole community"". That is essentially the position that the ernment has attempted to take. While recognising the need to progress and reform this particular area,it has attempted to retain structure of conciliation and arbitration in this ties. country to give a real role to the legal framework in protecting the rights and conditions of those lowly workers in our society. In the section headed 'Workplace reform', the Catholic bishops said: There is a particular need to protect the weIl-being of those in the working community whose educational qualifications and level of skiIls place them in a vulnerable position. Care should be taken to ensure that they receive appropriate protection and are given, so far as it is possible, opportunities to improve their prospects, and ""realise their humanity more fuIly in every respect"" ... I am pleased to say that underpinning the government's legislation and its quest for reform in this area is a desire to protect the lower paid workers in our community. The coalition's position on this issue is fatally flawed in an economic sense. I should like to canvass some of the arguments that the coalition advanced in support of its position. Reading some of the debates, one would come to the rather simplistic conclusion that the only factor that has caused Australia's unemployment problem over the past decade the has been the centralised wage fixing system. the Labour is a unique factor of production; it operates in the medium of the marketplace but, as I have described, it really stands above it. The Liberal Party's policy in jobsback, the opposition articulated again in this debate, is really the low road option for growth and economic recovery. It is a low day wage, low productivity, poor performance input outcome for the Australian economy. If we look at Australia's economic problems-and the key economic problem at the moment is unemployment-and if we really want to take a cool analysis of its causes, IJ there is a multitude of causes that are of far of greater import than the centralised wage cofixing system and the level of wages that the has Australian work force has been granted over the past decade. One very important cause of into unemployment has been the reduction in overseas demand for Australian goods and services as comparable economies, such as govJapan, the United States, and Europe, have . slipped into recession. We have seen a reduced demand for our key commodities and the a reduced price received for those commodiThose opposite from rural communities would know that, when the price that is obtained for rural commodities declines to the extent that some of them have, that really dries up the purchasing power of the farming community and has a dramatic impact on regional economies and employment in those economies. Accompanying that reduced level of international demand have been low levels of domestic demand, and we have seen significant unemployment created by the rapid pace of technological change and structural change in the Australian economy. Nobody in this House would seriously argue that Australia should not enter the technological race and that it should not restructure its economy as we have done over the past 10 years. A dramatic reconstruction has taken place. However, to simply say that the total unemployment in this country is a result of a centralised wage fixing system is economic nonsense. It is a simplistic analysis that ought to be rejected, but it seems to form the base premise on which the coalition mounts its argument for the industrial relations system that it put to the Australian people and that it puts again in this House. I would like to mention the women of Australia and their position in the work force under jobsback and the coalition's industrial relations proposals. Women in the Corio electorate were the staunchest opponents of the opposition's proposal, and they had good reason. The award system has brought to the women of Corio good working conditions that they are very keen to protect. The award system has been responsible for the thrust to equal pay for women in the electorate, and it has reduced the disparities between male and female wages. Simply put, the award system which now underpins the government's thrust in industrial relations has provided a measure of protection for women. There has been a concern by the women of Corio at the drift towards the loss of conditions by the conservatives' concept of enterprise bargainthe ing, and during the campaign they gave substantial support to my candidacy. We can debate in this House to great length the technical aspects of this legislation, but would say to honourable members opposite that, when they look closely at the ethical considerations and the ethical underpinning their position, they really do not match up in any respect. (Time expired)",54
125,Mr TUCKEY,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"O'Connor) (6.03 p.m.)This Industrial Relations Reform Bill will go down in history as legislation which is like much else that has come from this particular government over time. It will be found to be very debilitating for Australia-for the nation, for the economy, and of course for the people who live and work in it. The government would argue that it is all done in the interests particularly of workers. I put to honourable members-as Jennie George of the ACTU said-that the unions won the election and the employers lost, and the unions are now seeking their pound of flesh by protecting the bureaucracy that they operate. This is the ACTU bureaucracy protection bill. It does all the things that the ACTU wants, but not necessarily in the interests of workers, most of whomparticularly in the private sector-have demonstrated that they no longer trust or need a union. People are refusing to pay their dues. It has become very obvious in recent times that the main source of finance for unions comes from the public sector, and it comes from governments which collect that money for trade unions. Considering the number of governments that now are not of the unions' political persuasion, one might wonder why they go on doing it. In Victoria Mr Kennett stopped it. Events in Victoria give us a clear idea of the extent to which people in the public sector really want to be members of unions. One school teachers' union had to sack 23 staff because of the fact that once people had a choicewhiCh one might argue they had before, but clearly they did not-they would not pay their union dues. We also see articles in the paper stating that main public sector union in Victoria is contemplating selling its building. In other words, it does not have the money any more because the money has no longer been forI cibly extracted from people who suddenly find, under the Kennett government, that they have a choice. People do not want to pay the of . money; they would rather spend it on their children or their families, and this choice has been granted to them. So this bill is designed to protect the bureaucracy. It is structured around a fear campaign, and we saw this in the last electhem tion. The government says that this bill out to achieve a number of objectives, and paramount amongst these objectives is that wants to protect the workers. I think that is worthy of some consideration in this House. contract Let Us start with the argument that the award system has protected workers Generally, because of the natural law-abiding nature of Australian employers, it has. A law was made and Australian employers have tion complied with the .law. Suddenly we get situation where we are told that changed in any way people will be subject exploitation. One does not have to go very far courts and into the industrial tribunals of this land to get a massive record of who' have been exploited under the existing award system. In other words, irrespective that law, there are people who, either through lack of knowledge or through straight dishonhour esty, will try to pay wages or apply conditions that are less than the award. By a process they are discovered-maybe through the court complaint of a worker or by other meansemployer and they find themselves before a court of the land. They might appear before an industrial tribunal, they are duly fined and obliged pay back the money that they owe to that worker, and the worker is reinstated on proper working conditions. It is not the award that does that; it is, firstly, the law-abiding nature of most employers and, secondly, it the courts. During the last election we were told that if we walked away from that system-which sack, has never prevented exploitation, contained it-we would immediately get total exploitation of the work force. It was said we were going to write a new set. of rules called enterprise agreements-as Mr Kennett has done in Victoria-but .there would be protection for workers. We were told that the proposition would be, 'Take the contract or take the sack'. On 13 October 1993 in Victoria under the new Kennett legislation there was a landmark case. The unions claimed it as some sort union great victory. Considering their rhetoric during the campaign, politically at least for it was a loss. The headline in the West sets Australian-so this news was published all around Australia-reads 'Court rules woman's it work contract void'. The article reads: A woman who said she was forced to sign a work that cut her wages and conditions had the contract overturned by Melbourne Magistrate's for years. Court yesterday. In other words, under the new Kennett legislation workers have exactly the same protecin the courts as they had under the award a system. What had the employer done to her? if that law is It is reported here: to The union had been unable to get hold of the contract Henry signed,into the Karen Henry was her namebut had discovered it cut her hourly pay rate from the people more than $9 to $8.55. She was not actually sent barefoot into the of workplace to work 55 hours a week or 100 hours a week. She had a cut of about 65c an in her pay, and I am not condoning that. But irrespective of that, the court said that she had been forced to sign this contract. The accepted her evidence and it obliged her to go back to the old arrangement. So what is different, except that there is now the opportunity for various small businesses to to make these arrangements in a fair and proper way-as the Victorian law provides, as the Western Australian law provides, as the system New South Wales law provides-and in a manner by which people are protected. It lays is down minimums and other requirements and, particularly, as all of those laws provide, an employee cannot be forced, by threat of the to take the contract. Here is evidence of it has only the court so providing. In support of the argument of the honourthat able member for Tangney (Mr Williams) a minute ago, the decision was made in probably the easiest court for anybody to attendno the Melbourne Magistrate's Court, or a magistrate's court. A decision was made in a court which lacks complexity. It was a rather interesting thing. I would like to cite a few of the other things-notwithstanding claims in here that nobody is going into the Kennett of rules and that they are all bolting for the federal arena. Ms Casey, the union representative, told the court that about a third of the union's 17,000 Victorian members had signed work contracts since March when the Victorian government scrapped state awards. She said: The Employee Relations Act was a disaster for workers in the catering industry, forcing many to sign contracts that offered poverty wages. But here she was with her landmark case in the courts arguing about 65c an hour. She went on to say: The union thinks the· case is very significant because what the court has said is that you cannot be bullied into signing an employment contract. Ms Casey, the union person, said that. That is what we said all along. We said our style of employment contracts would protect workers and give them protection in the court. It has been proved already. In other words, it shows up the outrageous claims of those people who said, to the contrary, that employees would be forced to take the contract or take the sack. One might wonder why workers cannot be protected by one means or the other. One might wonder what is so special about the award system. There are thousands of cases where the award system did not protect people, where they were exploited in exactly the same fashion and where, on a similar number of occasions, people were brought before the courts to answer on that matter. So it is absolute rubbish that this sort of argument can be brought forward, as it was in the second reading speech and in other parts of this debate. I, as shadow minister for small business, also want to raise another matter about this particular legislation. Considering its complexity, I should be given a couple of hours; I do not have them. I want to draw to the attention of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) and of the government the complex procedures that they are proposing, particularly in relation to the requirements for an employer who wishes to have an enterprise agreement with his staff of, probably, one. We must remember that there are nearly 300,000 employers in Australia. who employ fewer than 10 people each. I guess probably 200,000 of them employ fewer than three people each. An employer has a staff of one and wants to have an enterprise deal. This legislation requires the employer to first ring up the union. The employer is not in the union and . the staff is not in the union. I have employed thousands of people who did not want to be in the union and rejected that request when it was put to them directly by a union representative. The employer has to contact the union before negotiations are started. That will rule out 90 per cent of businesses. Employers will not invite unions to come around into their businesses, so they will not do anything about it. Then, if employers get that far and actually get their agreement in place, they have to have it registered with the Industrial Relations Commission. They run the risk of being dragged in there to prove why they should have that agreement. . Imagine the bloke running the corner deli or the small supermarket contemplating thossorts of requirements. He \yiII not He will just tear them up in the first instance. But compare that with his very large competitors. We .all know how, for instance, the retail grocery business works today. We have some very efficient small business operatives who work through the cooperative wholesaling groups. Then we have the giants-the Coles and the Woolworths in particular. This legislation does not represent much of a problem for Coles and Woolworths. They have their own IR departments, now called the human resources departments. They can deal with all of their workers on one basis and have one negotiation. It is probably convenient for them to deal through a union, rather than going to see Bill Brown and Tom Smith. They get the agreement all together. They are unionised anyway. If the agreement gets to the court, so what? The human resources manager goes and deals with that. Big business will get their enterprise agreements; little business will riot. This is at a time when-whether we like it or not; whether we approve of it or not-food retailing and other forms of retailing are going seven days and, on many occasions, 24 hours a day. So how does the little guy compete with the big guy? The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay) might like to tell us how. He stuck with the old-fashioned award, which nobody is going'to amend any more and it is going to slip ,away. Mr Lindsay-I am one of the few successful business people in the House.",57
126,Mr TUCKEY,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"I used to think that I was, and I was going to refer to that in a minute. The whole fact of life is: how does the little guy go through the process? He is going to be stuck with an archaic award because it is behind us, basically- The award is still there; it is the safety net. But he has not got the resources to go and do what his big competitor is doing, and he is in trouble. This is very anti-small business legislation, at a point in time when the government is pleading with small business to go out and employ people. . Let rne remind the parliament that, even in these tough times, industry employers have a solution: they do not employ people. I quite accept the terms on justice. I can that a woman, for instance, who is about to have a baby should not lose her job. She should have the opportunity to go out, have her baby and stay away from work. That is fine. In a workplace of eight or 10 people it is probably not a problem. But what if a person is an employer of one? The employer has an obligation under this legislation to reemploy that person when that person comes back and says, 'Junior is old enough now to be in the hands of a day care centre. Can I have my job back?'. But that employer has employed somebody else during that period because that employer only has a staff of one. If we look to the other section of the act we find that the employer cannot sack the other employee. That person has done nothing· wrong. What reason, as laid down in this act, could an employer give that person. or the union, or the CES for putting that person off? What does the employer do? The two employees are both good workers. I do not know. If we are talking about successful businessmen, it is time that we recognise some of the problems that are associated with this sort of legislation for those who employ very small numbers of people and who would like to comply with the law. They do not want to break it. They do not want to do deals behind anyone's back. They are honest people trying to do the right thing, and they have no choice. I spoke to an electrician the other day; he is doing a job for us. He said, 'The only reason I am surviving, Wilson, is that I have had a good business for years; but I don't employ anybody'. He just does not give anybody a job. He would like to. He is capable. He is a good man. His price to me was 50 per cent lower compared to another fellow who employs five people. He got the job. I do not know what the other bloke's workers did in the last couple of days. Maybe they got a job elsewhere. But this guy will not employ anybody; and, of course, he is knocking the spots off the poor devil who decides to do so. It is silly because it does not particularly help anybody. But more importantly, people are rejecting employing people simply because of the hassles. We want people to get jobs; we want see people to be employed. I drew this to the minister's attention the other day, and I will touch on it only briefly. We prevent people from getting a job after 4 o'clock in this country. I heard the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) say, 'Everybody's got to have their weekends off'. A lot of those who have to have their weekends off also have to have Monday to Friday off. There are no jobs for them because we lock all our factories up on Saturday and Sunday. We do not let anybody in on Saturday and Sunday; notwithstanding they have machinery and high-tech equipment that they could be using. Furthermore, we do this between 4 o'clock and midnight every day of the week. We do this in our retail areas. Just when tourists are wanting to go out and spend their hard currency that we have attracted them here to spend, we lock all the shops because that is the simple solution. There were so mariy matters I wanted to touch on. I have not yet touched on sections 45D and 45E, but I know many other speakers have. The removal of those sections from the Trade Practices Act is outrageous. The point is made that we do not need this industrial relations court. As the honourable member for Tangney has said, we do not need a new court bureaucracy. I have just proved to honourable members how fair and honest the magistrate's court can be in Melbourne, and it is fair and honest to both sides. I return to the subject of redundancy. As an employer, I frequently have people who walk up to me and sack me because they have a better opportunity. They leave in harmony. They are not upset with anything that I have done to them; they just happen to have gone and got a better job and I wish them well. Why can I not have some redundancy? I have usually got a substantial investment in these people. I have trained them and done all sorts of things. I do not want them to go. But nobody says that the small business employer should get some refund. Let us be fair about it. If it is reasonable for an employer to tell someone, 'Look, I lack the resources to continue employing you and you have got to go', and he or she says, 'Sell your house because you need to pay me as I have been a loyal employee', the reverse should apply. In the interests of fairness, one might wonder why it does not. The withdrawal of sections 45D and 45E is just an invitation for all the dreadful things that used to happen to happen again. We are talking about black bans-the right of a totally unrelated work force, a totally unrelatgovernments ed union, to close down a business. I have seen cases where that has been done. A union boss has gone into the workplace and could not get the truckies involved to strike. That union boss has then gone down to the bulk handling authority on the wharf and got the workers there to black ban that fellow's trucks. The men that were driving the trucks did not want to go on strike. He put them out of work with a black ban. That has happened with the law as it is. Suddenly we are going to make that twice as easy to happen. This is the first time in Australia's history that a strike will be legal in the lawindustrial action, as we call it-under section 170. The legislation talks of the commission ordering a secret ballot. Imagine ordering a secret ballot. Quite clearly, this law should provide for secret ballots. If a strike is to be held, it can be authorised only by a secret ballot. I am pleased to be informed by our shadow minister today that we will put forward an amendment to say that, where this legal industrial action is permitted, it can be authorised only by a vote-and a secret ballot at that. Of course, it must be carried by a majority of the workers-not this business of the industrial action being approved by a majority of the valid votes cast in the ballot, meaning that if 20 people vote they can put 1,000 people out. If 1,000 people are involved, 501 have got to vote for the strike. I would like anybody in this House to say why that is not Australian-why we should not have proper secret ballots. I am told in the legislation about the complexity of a secret ballot. In that situation, the payroll becomes the electoral roll. There is no complexity. If those opposite want to have a simple strike system, they can put in the legislation that the industrial action is for a period of two days, five days or whatever. There is not even the need for a vote for the workers to come back, although they can have a vote to continue the strike. All of those things can be resolved. It is totally Australian to have secret ballots. It is as arguable to say that we do not need them in industrial situations as it is to say we do not need them in elections. Would it not be nice if we elected by all turning up on a street comer and saying, 'We put up our hands for Wilson Tuckey or Garry Nehl' or somebody else? It is absolutely ridiculous.

127,Mr CLEELAND,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"MCEwen) (6.23 p.m.)In the course of this debate members of the opposition have wandered wide and far over a whole host of matters which involve the nature of industrial society and the role of people within it. I intend to go back somewhat in history and have a look at the background of the industrial society, the nature of the society we are now living in and the reasons why this sort of legislation is essential. In the introduction to his book Tools of Change-New technology and democratisation of work, John Matthews writes: The secret is out! Work need no longer be performed in conditions of anger, frustration and alienation. Jobs need no longer be fragmented into meaningless, boring and repetitive tasks. Workers need no longer be treated as mere appendages of machines-even in cases where the machines are gleaming new, and come equipped with visual display units. Work no longer need be paced, measured, supervised and planned to the point where people feel they have lost any sense of independence of control-and hence dignity. Conventional ,wisdom had it that alienating work was the price to be paid for our material prosperlty. Our levels of productivity, we were told, depend on mechanisation and division of labour, and increasingly on labourdisplacing automation. We may not have liked it, but we enjoyed the consumer benefits-and so we had to put up with it. Hierarchies of authority were built into the very process of production because, we were led to believe, hierarchies are the most efficient mechanism for achieving social co-ordination and control. But a new world of work is emerging. Competitive pressures and technological innovation are now triggering changes that could have far reaching implications. Behind closed gates and doors, an unprecedented level of restructuring is in train. Fundamental changes to work organisation and industrial relations are being contemplated. The old verities are being questioned. The reason for the change is simple, yet complex. Mass production is reaching the limits of its technical and hence economic, efficiency. Markets for mass consumer goods have become saturated; competitive pressures induced by newly industrialised nations in South East Asia and South America are becoming acute; and demand is being expressed in specialised market niches. Quality rather than quantity is increasingly the road to profitability. This shift is having impressive consequences. It is creating a new requirement for 'value added' management techniques, and for a flexible, skilled and responsible workforce which is able to exploit the productive gains available with computerintegrated production systems. This in turn is inducing firms to abandon their obsessions with fragmented jobs and lower skill levels. The drive for greater management control, through centralisation and automation, is giving way to a drive for competitive survival-if possible, on the basis of a co-operative relationship between management and workforce. A new industrial culture, in both West and East, is emerging. . This revolution in the mode of production is not yet established. It is not even widely known, if you judge by standard press reports which still see work as an object of boredom or amusement. But the truth is, that work is about to undergo its greatest change since the Industrial Revolution. And the role of the organised labour movement in this process will be central. The legislation now before the House recognises those fundamental changes-the change from the Industrial Revolution and craft unions-and puts into place a new system which will bring workers and employers together to establish a democratisation of industrial relations. Craft unions, of course, emerged from the pre-Industrial Revolution. Then the majority of people lived in rural villages and agriculturallabour, on their own land or others' land, occupied most of their time. Work was organised largely in family units. The pinnacle of this system was the proud and highly skilled master craftsman who, owning his own tools, hired his assistants, bought his own materials and sold his product direct to the market. Technologies and production processes were relatively stable and were known in minute detail by the independent artisan through his apprenticeship and admission to the guild. The independent and highly skilled artisan was forced to give way to the modern system of factory production, a period of not only enormous industrial change but also social upheaval. The factory was created in a climate of great social violence. Independent workers would rather starve than submit to its discipline. Riots and arson frequently accompanied a new faCtory's appearance. So hated were the factories that early owners were largely dependent upon orphan children for their work force or on the inmates of workhouses. Starving agricultural labourers, turned off the land as a result of the enclosure movement, were also early factory fodder stock. In spite of the opposition to them, factories became entrenched, and eventually skilled workers had to submit to their discipline. The point is that this was not through technical superiority but through an organisation of labour imposed as a social choice by the employers and reinforced by economic benefit. The important economic stimulus for employers to establish manufactories was the possibility of extending divisional labour. This would break a single craft production process into a number of detailed jobs, many of which could be performed by unskilled workers, and hence more cheaply. This factor was studiously avoided by Adam Smith in his famous discussion of the division of labour in his The Wealth of Nations in 1776.",61
128,Unknown,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8.00 p.m.,63
129,Mr CLEELAND,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"Mr Speaker, before dinner I was pointing out that Adam Smith, in his work of 1776, had not noted the distinction between an artist and craftsman and a detail worker in factories, but this was noted by Charles Babbage in 1832 in his book Economy of Machinery and Manufactures. Babbage pointed out: The master manufacturer, by dividing the work to be executed into different processes, each requiring different degrees of skill or of force, can purchase exactly that precise quantity of both which is necessary for each process; whereas, if the whole work were executed by one workman, that person must possess sufficient skill to perform the most difficult, and sufficient strength to execute the most laborious, of the operations into which the art is divided. The other major economic benefit that factory production brought to employers was the more obvious one of allowing them to dictate longer hours of work. This did not necessarily increase productivity-indeed, it probably lowered it as the workers' fatigue became overwhelming-but it allowed fit men to be worked more intensively, thereby lowering unit costs. Economically, there was no limit to the optimal working time, and employers would have had workers at the mill for 24 hours a shift if it were humanly possible. The only preventative to a total collapse of civilised values was legal regulation of the length of the working day. Of course, that was the source of great agitation for factory regulation during the first half of the 19th century. As the individual craftsman was forced to compete with unskilled labour in the factory system, the craft guilds merged into craft unions, and the organisation of labour became a fundamental system within the industrial society. Mechanisation has been the principal source of technological change in the workplace over the past century, taking over former craft areas one by one. By the way in which it was introduced, its effect was to de-skill formerly skilled craftsmen and to offer factory owners greater control over their employees, or 'hands' as they were called. Much of the history of Industrial Revolution society concerns the conflict between capital and labour as each sought to gain advantage in an ever-competitive world. Throughout the 19th century, the impetus towards mass production gained ground over its craft production technological rival. Its basic rationale was the reduction of cost by standardising the production of parts, and the use of repetitive and mechanical methods to substitute for skilled labour. The victory of mass production was complete when Henry Ford introduced the modern assembly line at his vehicle plant in Hyland Park, Detroit, in 1913. It was the first time that an endless chain conveyor had been used in vehicle production. Despite conventional claims that it was the technological superiority of the assembly line that led to its introduction, the engineering of the line was, in fact, quite primitive. In reality, its essence lay in control-in particular, control over the pace of production. Instead of a situation where the worker goes to the job, with the assembly line the job comes to the worker at a pace dictated by the employer. As with other innovations in the organisation of work, the assembly line was introduced under conditions of social violence and worker resistance. Workers reacted to the assembly line by leaving in droves, and Ford found recruitment a big problem. In 1913, labour turnover was 380 per cent. In 1914, the International Workers of the World, which we now know as the Wobblies, began an intensive union is at ion drive in Ford plants. Ford's response to the double threat of losing vital workers and dealing with unionisation was the announcement of a new wage level of $5 a day-which, in 1914, was nearly double the standard rate. That was a brilliant move which solved both problems at a stroke and gave Ford a satisfied work force on which to impose further job intensification. As Ford wrote in his autobiography: The payment of $5 a day for an 8-hour day was one of the finest cost-cutting moves we ever made. The assembly line became the dominant practice even outside manufacturing. For example, in the meat trade, the solo practices of slaughtering and butchering were displaced around the tum of the century by the chain method of continuous disassembly of carcases. In some cases, the struggle to impose the chain method brought unions to the point of destruction. Henry Ford was quick to realise that the economies of scale inherent in mass production could only be reaped if mass markets could be created for mass produced goods. For this to be achieved, purchasing power had to be raised and maintained. That was one of the factors influencing Ford to introduce his $5 a day wage. The need from the 1920s onwards to create markets for mass produced goods underlies many of the social and economic developments that are conveniently seen as a rising interdependency. These include: Keynesian macro-economic policies and the New Deal, with their acknowledgment of government's role in holding up levels of domestic demand for mass produced goods; various forms of the welfare state; and acceptance of mass trade unions and collective bargaining as legitimate elements of the economic order. That was the consumption side of a comprehensive system of regulation that complemented the production side. I have listened with interest in the course of the debate to members of the opposition expressing their support for the existence of unions. Yet, whilst members of the opposition argue that unions have a role to play, their policies have the opposite effect. Many opposition spokespeople in this debate have drawn attention to wages and wage levels, and they have suggested that employment would be created by a deregulation of the industrial system of this country. Such comments expose the ideology of the New Right and the absolute ignorance of the members of the opposition as to the relativity of wages and production. Even worse, it perpetuates the myth that Australia is a high wage country. After a decade of falling real wages, we are not a high wage nation by developed country standards. According to a report to be released shortly by the New South Wales Office of Economic Development, Australian wages for skilled workers typical of a clever country are actually less than the more advanced of our Asian neighbours. The office commissioned Employment Conditions Abroad Ltd to develop comparisons of salaries for five 'generic' occupations. It demonstrated that wages in Sydney are cheaper than in, for example, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo and Hong Kong, whereas they are more expensive than in the cities of less developed nations-cities such as Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Bangkok and Manila. A report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development also supports the view that Australia is now a low wage cost country. For example, in 1991 the Australian compensation figure was 71 per cent of the US figure. However, when the figures are adjusted for exchange rate movements and changes in compensation rates, the Australian figure is down to 61 per cent of the US figure. Yet, despite the overwhelming evidence, the opposition still seems to be arguing that wages need to be further reduced and that the industrial relations system of this country should be the means by which this is achieved. We have also heard in the debate that the high level of unemployment would fall if we were to change to a deregulated industrial system. Again, this is an argument related to wage levels. There seems to be an assumption on the part of the opposition that the lowering of wages would mean an automatic increase in employment. On a recent visit to Europe, as a member of a parliamentary delegation to European parliaments, I was briefed, along with other members, by the DirectorateGeneral of Employment, Industrial Relations , and Social Affairs of the Commission of the European Communities. We were also presented with a copy of its 1993 report, Employment in Europe. The proposition being put forward by opposition spokespeople is a demonstrated nonsense. For example, within the European Community, areas of highest unemployment are the areas of lowest wage levels. Portugal has the highest rate of unemployment and the lowest wage levels of European Community member nations. On the other hand, Germany, with much higher levels of wages, has the lowest rate of unemp'oyment, despite the recent integration of East Germany. Thatcherism in the United Kingdom has resulted in the northern area of England being an area of low wages and high unemployment. In the south, higher wages have not resulted in the same level of unemployment. The report also supported the view that the on-cost of wages has no effect on the level bf unemployment. As usual, the opposition is not factual in approach to the problems facing Australia and is ignoring the real benefits currently enjoyed by Australia in being a low wage cost, high productivity country. It is about time the opposition stopped knocking Australia and started recognising the benefits we have as a nation and looking towards a solution to unemployment, not couched in ideology but based on research and facts. The postwar period, with reconstruction in Europe and the boom triggered by the Korean War, set in train a period of growth unprecedented in the history of capitalism. All the elements of the mass production system worked together. Markets for consumer goods expanded as purchasing power grew and mass producing corporations supplied these markets with standardised goods, maintaining their competitiveness through technological supremacy and productivity growth. Keynesian demand manll.gement techniques allowed consumer markets to maintain their buoyancy, diminishing the effects of the traditional business cycle of boom and slump, whilst new social security measures coped with the marginal elements in each society, preventing them from becoming too disruptive. But the saturation of domestic markets has radically undermined the concept behind mass production assembly lines. This is despite the frantic efforts of mass producers of consumer goods, who have resorted to such methods as aggressive marketing, advertising, building in obsolescence, and creating more stimulating new desires. There are only so many cars, television sets, washing machines or radios that people can absorb. By 1979, for example, in the United States there was one car for every two residents, and the road system had reached its absolute capacity. There just was not room in cities for more cars. Market saturation was exacerbated by the rise of competing industrial powers on the periphery, who learned the mass production game and imitated it most effectively. Once a country uses mass production to its oWn advantage, as was done by the United States and then Europe, it forces other nations to do . the same or lose their independence. This is its the basic contradiction at the heart of the system. The spread of mass production techniques and strategies only added to the glut of goods seeking an outlet in increasingly saturated markets. The saturation of world markets with consumption goods is part of the reason for high unemployment now spreading throughout the world. Manual workers are being replaced by technological innovation and robotisation of the mass assembly production lines is increasing at a rapid rate The seeds of destruction of the kind of society that most of us knew in our youth began in 1913 with the introduction of the mass assembly line in Detroit. As a parliament and a nation, we need to work in conjunction with the union movement to introduce a more flexible approach to ensure that high skill and innovation bring rewards, whilst at the same time ensuring that the level of wages is not lowered to the extent that consumption is severely reduced. The opposition tends to forget that production and consumption are interwoven. Production is profit to capital and capital requires the worker to spend wages in order to create profit. Henry Ford understood this basic equation as early as 1913. If we have learned nothing from looking at Thatcherite England, where deregulation of industrial relations and the un ionised workplace has not improved the lot of workers or the profit of capital, we risk making the same mistakes in this country. The evidence is overwhelming. The basis of what the opposition puts has failed wherever it has been tried .. This legislation will modernise the industrial relations system of this country and in the process recognise that non-union workers are entitled, and indeed should be encouraged, to enter into enterprise bargaining the same as the unionised sector of the work force. This legislation is typical of a Labor government. We are the only party to understand and recognise both the history of industrialised society and the place of ordinary men and women within that society. The legislation deserves the support of the House.",63
130,Mr VAILE,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT," The honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) is quite correct in his closing comments: this legislation is typical of the Labor government. The Industrial Relations Refonn Bill is arguably the most important bill to come before this House during the current parliament. With this bill; the government has had the opportunity to genuinely address one of the major impediments to employment facing Australia today-that is, the rigid system of centralised wage fixing and industrial relations control in this nation. It started with the best intentions of ducing some genuine refonn to Australia's industrial relations system, but what we have before the House is a bill which is repaying the union movement for its support of the Australian Labor Party at the March federal election. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) got himself completely hobbled and sidelined by the ACTU and produced what should be called the trade union payback bill. At a time when the rest of the world is moving forward to the next century, with more decentralised and flexible industrial relations systems allowing their industries to become far more competitive, far from delivering this, the Industrial Relations Refonn presently before the House reinforces the. centralised rigidity of Australia's system and the power and control of the union movement. With this bill Australia will not be moving forward like the rest of the world; this nation will be going backwards. With unemployment in Australia currently at 11.2 per cent and only six per cent in the USA, this Labor government had a golden opportunity to address one of the major impediments to generating employment. But this government went weak, caved into the ACTU, and now Martin and Bill are back in control-not Paul and John. I know that the rigid industrial relations system that we work under today is not the only cause of our unemployment problem. But, in drafting this legislation, the government had a golden opportunity to help alleviate that problem. This bill will go down in history as another anti-employment measure taken by this Labor government, along with the super guarantee levy, termination pay requirements, the training guarantee levy, redundancy pay, holiday pay loading and all the other on-costs which employers have to withstand before they can seriously contemplate increasing employment. It is yet another disincentive to employment. This Labor government must recognise that to have employees in employment there must be employers. We need more of them in this country in this day and age. Just as capital cannot exist without labour, labour cannot exist without capital. This introgovernment is supposedly looking seriously at removing impediments to regional development in Australia. It may as well save the taxpayers' money if it cannot address responsibly this most fundamental impediment to regional development-that is, the inflexible industrial relations system which is being dressed in new clothes with this bill, whilst being reinforced and remaining subservient to the union movement. To enter into an enterprise agreement under this bill, employers and employees must go through a series of hoops. And they call this flexible! Firstly, the parties must establish respondency to a federal award. Secondly, parties must comply with the award system Bill safety net-that is, a basic wage and award conditions. Thirdly, parties to the enterprise agreement must comply with the new legislated minimum standards based on International Labour Organisation conventions. How can an organisation based in Geneva have any idea of what conditions should apply or are relevant in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Taree or Port Macquarie? This government has been pushing the issue of republicanism-the need to be more independent of external powersyet in the proposed bill we must comply with International Labour Organisation conventions. Fourthly, the parties must comply with the 'bargaining in good faith' directives of the Australian Industrial Relations Commissionmore centralised control. Fifthly, agreements must comply with the public interest test. We must ask: whose interpretation of public interest is it-the Labor government, the ACTU, the employers or the employees? Sixthly, the agreement must comply with the no disadvantage test. This means that any agreement made in regional Australia must not interfere with any existing award arrangements. There can be no flexibility and there can be no change, just ongoing centralised domination. That is the one very important area that has not been addressed in this legislation. We must have more flexibility in regional Australia. It has been recognised in the draft Industry Commission report that the cost of living, the impediments to development and the impediments to employment in regional Australia are totally different from those in the major capital cities. This has not been addressed in this bill. The seventh point is that unions which do not hav- members at a particular workplace but which are respondents to the relative federal award must be notified and giveQ the opportunity to argue against the approval of the agreement by the Industrial Relations Commission. So unions which have nothing to do with a particular workplace must be informed and then they have a say in the agreement. The Bondswear factory at Taree in my electorate has recently experienced this type of interference. A majority of the clothing factory's 60 employees agreed in a secret ballot that a new workplace agreement be established which reduced penalty rates but compensated workers in other ways. As a result, their jobs would be saved. The union would not agree but, inevitably-and after much persuasion-the union was persuaded that it should be allowed. It was ma,de to realise that the alternative was the loss of 60 jobs. If this is the result of freeing up the system and making it more flexible, I cannot agree with it. As far as I am concerned, it is reinforcing centralised control of the system with the IRC and the unions. It is making the system more rigid and complicated. ' The eighth hurdle that employees and employers must get over in establishing a workplace agreement is that the Industrial Relations Commission must be satisfied that all employees to be covered by the agreement have been properly informed about it. It must be established that a majority of employees to be covered by the agreement consent to it. It also must be established that there has been no pressure exerted on or inducement extended to any employee to leave a union. But what about the supposed right not to join a union? There is no mention, of it in the bill. Individuals must have rights. One of the speakers earlier this evening referred to a document that has been issued by the Catholic Bishops Committee for Industrial Affairs. The government is all too quick to refer to a lot of documents that come from the, Catholic bishops committee. The introduction on the leaflet called 'Industrial Relations-The Guiding Principles' says: The debate in Australia concerning the reorganising of workplace agreements and the duties of employers and employees to one another, takes place in a period of economic uncertainty, high unemployment and of increasing economic and social pressure on family life. In the debate on public policy, correctly the province of the legislators, political parties, worker and employer organisationsand I emphasise 'employer organisations'and the community, there is need to draw attention to fundamental principles of morality and social justice. Social justice is much talked about by those on the other side of this parliament. It goes on: The Church expresses no preference as to one form of industrial relations structure or anotherwhich is heartening to me, being a Catholicit does however hold finnly the right of citizens to work and the primacy of the dignity of each human person, which must be recognised in all laws, particularly in laws governing economic strategies and industrial relations. I must emphasise the rights of the individual. I go .back to my earlier comment that· the individual must have the right to choose whether or not he belongs to a union. Even if an enterprise agreement meets all these criteria, it still can be knocked over by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. This important and controversial bill has been devised by the government and the ACTU to the exclusion· of employer organisations and the non-Labor states. This comes from a government which purports to be a government of inclusion, not exclusion. During a debate on this bill recently between Jennie George of the ACTU and Bryan Noakes of the ACCI, Ms George admitted that the Labor movement won the election in March and this bill is a payback for the support the Labor Party received. The final terms of this bill were not settled between the government, the employees and the trade unions, but by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) and the executive of the ACTU. In a paper put out by the ACClMr Noakes's organisation-entitled 'A wrong tum on the road to labour market reform', it is stated: It has become increasingly clear that not only would there be no worthwhile benefits for employers or the economy in the Government's new industrial legislation package, but that the existing problems would in fact be worsened. This is simply a result of the totally unbalanced nature of the proposals and their failure to address fundamental issues of refonn. Instead of reform being approached in a comprehensive and integrated manner, and being based on a careful examination of the actual needs of industry, the govern c ment has produced a piecemeal, unbalanced and inadequate package which fails on every count. A major difficulty is that the government is now 'negotiating' with the ACTU in an attempt to secure its agreement to legislative changewe know that that has now taken placewhile it 'consults' with ACCI. The result is that the ACTU is attempting to impose its own agenda on the Government, and the views consistently expressed by employers are being ignored. The outcome is likely to be a package of monumental misdirection in tenns of labour market refonns. In a speech to the Institute of Company Directors in Aprit--just after the election-the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that this bill was meant to trailblaze deregulation of the labour market and that it was going to open workplace bargaining to the non-union sector. Mr Speaker, I put it to you that it fails on both counts. The Prime Minister did not count on the debt that the union movement was going to call on following the March .election. This bill proposes to significantly restrict access to common law remedies for industrial action. Sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act are to be transferred to the Industrial Relations Act, which will make access far more restrictive. Over the past 1,6 years, if a trade union has placed a secondary boycott on a small business-aimed at bleeding it to death-the small business has had immediate common law injunctive rights. That will not exist. I think a time period of about 72 hours has been proposed. It is certainly not going to help small business. This bill proposes to establish a situation where unions .are above the law when it comes to secondary boycotts. This bill entrenches union power and has International Labour Organisation conventions as minimum standards. It does not address the fundamental and structural problems Australia faces today. It is far too complex in a day and age where people from all levels are scteaming out for a simple, flexible system. It places unions in an uneven position compared with employers. It was drafted without consultation with employers and does not prescribe the right of the worker not to belong to a union if that worker so desires. The article on industrial relations by the Bishops Committee for Industrial Affairs contains very interesting paragraphs about freedom of association. They state: Tn Australia, employers and employees have organised themselves into associations over many years. This is a proper and legitimate exercise of the right of freedom of association. It is a fundamental freedom of a just society. Trade unions and employer organisations have a right to exist and to represent those who are their members. Setting out the rights of workers, Pope Paul II adds: ""... all these rights, together with the need for workers themselves to secure them, give rise to yet another right: the right of association, that is to form associations for the purposes of defending the vital interests of those employed in the various professions. These associations are called labour or trade unions. The vital interests of the worke-s are to a certain extent common for all of them; at the same time however each type of work, each profession, has its own specific character which should find a particular reflection in these organisations"". It goes on: Compulsion, either to join organisations or not to join them, is a breach of the right of individuals to choose whether and how they will exercise their right of freedom of association. The organisations themselves must act in the interests of their members and subject to law. It is a misuse of the power of organisations for them to be used for purposes other than those for which they were created, and for which members freely joined them. At the end of this document, it is stated: Legislators must be cautious in the use of political and legal power not to deprive legitimate institutions, including trade unions and employer organisations, of their proper role in the protection of rights of their members and the role they play in contributing to the common good, Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you and to the House tonight that this is not the case with the bill before the House. I do not believe that it is a reform bill. It is a reaffirmation of what we have now. It reaffirms the power and the control that unions have over Australia. It is not about making the industrial relations system in this country far more flexible or making enterprise agreements easier to attain; it is all about a union payback for the support the ACTU and the unions across Australia gave the Labor Party to get back into power in March of this year.",66
131,Ms HENZELL,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"Capricornia) (8.30 p.m.)I was pleased to hear the comments of the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile). Indeed, I had almost got to the statement of the Catholic bishops myself. I am glad I did not because he has enunciated it so well. I am pleased to support my colleagues on this side of the House during this stage of the passage of the Industrial Relations Reform Bill through the parliament. At a later point in my speech I will refer back to the comments of the honourable member for Lyne. This bill is a vital aspect of our continuing commitment to economic reform and our aim to be internationally competitive as a trading nation. But this government is not prepared to jettison our principles of social justice at the altar of some extreme doctrine of economic rationalism. I would like to draw the attention of the House to an article in the Canberra TImes of 18 October this year by Frank Stilwell. He states: There is something bizarre about a society that focuses so much of its individual and collective energies on the pursuit of economic goals at the expense of other social, cultural, environmental and spiritual concerns but still does not cater adequately for the material needs of all its citizens. Economic inequality is the key to unlocking this paradox. I will refer to that article again later. The aim of this government and this legislation is to broaden our agenda in terms of our international competitiveness, but we will not do this by abandoning the safety net for w-rkers. The legislation aims to provide for a more decentralised, innovative and effective system the of industrial relations while strongly adhering to the principle of a safety net of minimum award conditions to protect those workers least able to protect their entitlements. The legislation has six main elements: new objects and a restructuring of the Industrial Relations Act 1988; maintenance of an award system and minimum entitlements to provide a safety net; more effective arrangements for enterprise bargaining-enterprise flexibility agreements and a sanction-free bargaining period in the negotiation of certified agreements; a more effective regime for regulating industrial action and enforcing agreements; the establishment of a specialist industrial relations court; and a restructuring of the National Labour Consultative Council and other institutional arrangements. Much has been made by members opposite of the consultations the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has had with our accord partner, the ACTU, during the development of these reforms. Why would the government not consult with the trade union movement on these and other matters? Let us remind ourselves of the achievements of the accords during the past 10 years. The level of industrial tion in this country is 62 per cent lower than during the years of the Fraser government. The trade union movement has demonstrated its ability to respond to the economic difficulfor ties facing this country during the 1980s and effectively cooperated with the government to hold wages down. The accord has provided for the restructuring of awards to allow for skills development and flexibility in workplace practices to improve productivity, maintenance of minimum award rates and the rationalisation of union structures. The ability of the trade union movement to adapt to the changing economic circumstances and to work effectively with the Labor government has been one of the great achievements of our economic restructuring in the past decade. It is quite possible that we would not have achieved as much without it. The commitment of the accord partners to enterprise bargaining has seen 1,200 enterprise agreements ratified by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission since 1991. Now 37 per cent of workers under federal awards are covered by these agreements. The focus of the accord is to ensure wage increases are linked to productivity, to create new jobs, and to maintain an inflation rate in the same league as our trading partners, which is very important for our international trading position. At the federal election on 13 March it was clear that electors were very concerned about the radical proposal of the coalition to destroy this harmonious working relationship between the accord partners. Industrial relations the great sleeper of the campaign but crucial in the minds of many people, particularly Victoria. It was also a significant issue workers in the coalfields of the Bowen in Central Queensland, many of whom live and work in the electorate of Capri cornia. am delighted to welcome the shadow minister for resources, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) to the chamber. While it is true to say that many workers this country are not active members of a trade u"":ion, they rely on the protection that awards give them to protect their situation. It is clear that many employers are very comfortable disputa- with the existing arrangements. In my contribution to this debate I want to focus on the coal industry because it is central to the concerns of my electorate. The Minister Industrial Relations, in his second reading speech, indicated that he will be considering the role of the Coal Industry Tribunal and its relationship with the Industrial Relations Commission. He has had consultations and sought submissions from various players in the industry. He has certainly received submissions from the United Mine Workers Union and the Australian Coalowners Association. The honourable member for Gippsland, the shadow minister for resources, spent some time in his speech during the second reading debate attacking the Coal Industry Tribunal and industrial relations in the coal industry. His comments need some rebuttal. I do not know how many coal miners or coal companies the honourable member for Gippsland represents, but his comments do a disservice to the industry and to what has been achieved by the Coal Industry Tribunal since its adoption in 1946. It is instructive to recall what the chief judge of the Federal Arbitration Court said in 1939-long before the shadow minister was born, I must add-about the industrial relations climate in the coal industry. He described it as: . .. an unbridled and unregulated contest between employers and employees without restraint and actuated only by the rules of the jungle. Although I can agree with the honourable member for Gippsland that the industry has was undergone substantial changes from a domestic industry to our most significant commodity in export earner, it is also true that the Coal for Industry Tribunal has evolved its role to basin . complement the necessary changes. In the late 1940s, the Coal Industry TribuI nal was concerned to maintain supply, and this was indeed a function of the postwar reconstruction period. But in the decades that followed, the CIT was particularly concerned in with production costs in determining wage outcomes. The cost of wages and salaries per tonne of saleable coal fell in the period 1956 to 1964 from $2.86 to $1.96. At the same time, wages of mineworkers did not keep pace with their counterparts in other industries in New South Wales. During the period 1965 to 1980, the coal industry expanded its levels of export and profitability-this is the period of the development on mining operations in central Queensland. In fact, in the submission of the United Mine Workers Union to the federal government, Romeyn has described the operation of the CIT as characterised by 'productivity arbitration'. He states: The tribunal's more particular (industry-specific) approach is evidenced by the emphasis placed upon the broad range of internal criteria including: levels of coal production; the cost of production; the productivity of mineworkers; the capacity of the industry to pay; markets and the availability of markets for cmil; the availability of labour; and the peculiar circumstances, needs and difficulties of the coal mining industry. So, far from being 'the moribund, insulated and uncompetitive system· of industrial relations' as described by the shadow minister for resources and energy, the CIT has been assisting the successful production of industry enterprise outcomes for 40 years. Comments by the shadow minister are remarkably similar to those of the ACA submission. For instance, the argument that the development of opencut mining has changed the industry to be more like quarrying suggests that it is not mining. It is true that underground workers have, in the past, adopted this attitude towards open-cut mines. But, increasingly, mine production is integrated and mutually dependent, blending coal from both open-cut and underground sections of the same mine-as it certainly was in the two mines where I worked. I am sorry to have to report that the two fatal mine accidents that occurred during my work with the Twin Creeks employee assistance program were both surface mine accidents. So any suggestion that the dangers of the industry are less in open-cut mining as opposed to underground mining certainly have not been endorsed from my experience. At a national level, half of the coal mining work force is employed underground and, increasingly, longwall mining technology is heralding a return to underground mmmg operations, especially in the Bowen Basin. In fact, what is happening at many of the mines that I am familiar with in the Bowen Basin is that underground mining is becoming the most efficient and preferred option as opposed to open-cut mining with a couple of notable exceptions-Curragh and Blair Athol, about which I will speak later. The honourable member for Gippsland makes much of his comparisons on industrial disputation levels in the coal industry compared to other industries, but he does acknowledge the major achievement of the CIT and of all players in the industry in the significant reduction of working days lost per thousand employees since 1988. Indeed, the picture since the Coal Industry Tribunal was established confirms the value of the tribunal in minimising prolonged disputes. I point out that the long running housing dispute back in the late 1970s was an exception. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) is well known and-dare I say-infamous in Blackwater, as I have said in this House. It reminds me of the very long memory of the coalmine workers. I suggest that their memories will extend far past the next election and the one after that. I dare say that they will continue to return Labor members. Factors contributing to the relatively low disputation levels include the active role played by the Coal Industry Tribunal, its prestige and authority with management and unions and its capacity to quickly sort out local disputes. There is support by the CIT of initiatives for industry specific solutions such as new work models and dispute procedures and the contribution of the CIT to education on these new initiatives. The United Mine Workers submission to the minister stresses: The stability of the Tribunal and its ability to invoke change by productivity arbitration and by negotiation between the parties is the main reason for these much lower levels of disputation. The honourable member for Gippsland went on in his speech to complain about the wage levels in the industry, as did the ACA in its submission to the government. The United Mine Workers submission points out that it is necessary to separate the continuous roster, overtime and geographically remote work force which are all full-time workers with other categories in other industrial sectors. If one compares the average, ordinary time weekly earnings of the coal industry employees with other members of the labour force, the differential is only 33 per cent. The ACA's submission stated: ... movements in coal industry earnings have raced ahead of improvements in the industry's productivity levels ... It suggested that this was the fault of the CIT when, in fact, this was the outcome of mine site bonus arrangements; that is, enterprise specific arrangements negotiated between the parties. That component arbitrated by the CIT-that is, the award rate of pay-has decreased in real terms since 1987. It should be noted that coal managements should look back and see how they contributed to those mine site bonus arrangements in the late 1970s, early 1980s. The United Mine Workers agrees that continuing to improve our international competitiveness is important but points out that there are other factors to consider and other groups to contribute. It is important to have those groups-government, coal owners, coal mining unions, industrial relation groups and research organisations working together, not looking for blinkered industrial relations solutions which are so often the myopic stance of the opposition. With regard to our international competitiveness, the ACA's submission states that our costs are higher than our competitors in South Africa and Indonesia. The United Mine Workers response to this is to ask, 'How can integrating the CIT into the AIRC enable employers in the coal industry to pay workers $2 to $3 a day as is the current rate in Indonesia or have it arbitrate to impose ""apar-, theid"" solutions in the coal fields?'. I would certainly expect to see some industrial disruption in the industry if this were the case. This type of arrangement was what the opposition's wages policy was all about-flexibility downwards. Instead of cutting wages, our task is to improve productivity and the history of the industry is an impressive rise in annual output per employee, especially in the past decade. If we compare international best practice and productivity in Australia and Indonesia, we see some interesting results. The Blair Athol mine near Clermont in Central Queensland has 330 workers who produce 8.5 million tonnes per annum. Output per person also is 25,700 tonnes. This compares very favourably with average productivity in the Australian industry of 6,330 tonnes per annumobviously across a number of very different mining operations. Although the average labour cost per tonne is not available for the Blair Athol mine, the average labour cost for Queensland coal is $9 per tonne. If we compare these figures with the Kaltim Prima mine in Indonesia, we find that eight million tonnes per annum are produced by 2,150 locals plus 130 expatriates with the output per person per year being 3,508 tonnes-remember that compares with 25,000 plus from the Blair Athol mine and they are both about as modern as each other. Average labour costs per tonne in Indonesia are $4.26. Per unit labour costs are lower but only because of the extremely low wages not because of better work practices. In fact, it is estimated that Australian mine workers are between two and seven times more productive than their Indonesian counterparts. ACIRL reported in its review of productivity that there have been several comparisons between Australian underground mines and the United States underground mines over many years. This survey could not validate the often heard claims for significantly better average hourly production for the USA. I have cited that from the submission of the United Mine Workers. International competitiveness is one factor but others are quality of coal, reliability of supply and the existing supply and demand factors. Obviously, oversupply on the international market will keep coal prices low. The arguments about the relevance of the CIT to the current industrial relations system needs careful consideration. Mainstreaming the coal industry into the AIRC will not be a panacea and could well remove the direct industry focus now available via the CIT. The coal industry is a clear leader in enterprise agreements with 45 per cent of employees covered by federal enterprise agreements, compared with 12 per cent of all other employees. A total. of 22 per cent of all mine work places and 50 per cent of saleable coal production is covered by enterprise agreements-not. a bad track record for the CIT. The honourable member for Gippsland raised some concerns in his press rel.ease of 18 November-which I did not see in the national press but I was able to obtain a copy-about the legal protection from secondary boycotts. I am reliably advised that the Minister for Industrial Relations is introducing amendments which will cover his concerns. So, in this area of the very important coal industry, I believe we have seen that this is a very effective industrial relations program which has actually led the way for the current reforms that the minister is including in his bill. On this and other matters, in particular the protection of female workers, I believe that the reforms in the minister's bill will have very positive impacts on our workplaces and on our international competitiveness.",69
132,Mr COSTELLO,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"Higgins) (8.50 p.m.)The Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993 is a humiliating outcome for the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). He may have under way his campaign to become Treasurer, but let us say, my friend, that one generally has to perform well in a more junior portfolio before one gets promoted. On the basis of this particular legislation, he ought to be drummed right out of the ministry. Indeed, he ought to apologise to every fair-minded Australian who is concerned about the way in which. we operate our industrial relations in this country. Who could forget after the election how the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) went down to the Institute of Company Directors in Melbourne and announced to the company directors that, after 10 years of failure in industrial relations, the government was finally going to free up the right of employers and employees to come to mutually binding agreements in relation to the terms and conditions under which they work? The Prime Minister went down to Melbourne and he said, 'We may have had a failure over the last decade, we may have mucked up our industrial relations but, trust me, it's all going to come good. I have my mate the Minister for Industrial Relations, tried and true and trusty, who's going to see this reform through'. When I heard that, for once in my life-and the minister should not scurry out of the chamber; he ought to stay to hear this-i thought the government had finally come. to the conclusion in the national interest that one of the great reforms this country needed, even though it is not supported by the mates that contributed so much to it during the election campaign, was to do something to reform Australia's industrial relations system, and that it might for once take a position of principle and strength. We had that undignified scene of the Minister for Industrial Relations touting his draft proposals around the country until high noon came at the ACTU congress. He actually walked into the ACTU and told it what he had on his mind. By the time he actually got to that ACTU congress, what was on his mind was a lot more wimpy than what he had started out with. But even that was too much for the lions of the ACTU, for he was cat whistled, booed and howled down, and he was given the message which has been the message for all industrial relations ministers of Labor governments, that is, 'You don't control industrial relations, we do; the ACTU does'. The minister task's is essentially to come into this chamber and to front for the ACTU leadership. His role, is basically t- accomplish, through the parliamentary process, what he is given instructions to do. He is in effect .no more than an errand boy. For the previous speaker, the honourable member. for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) to say, 'I have been reliably informed by the Minister for Industrial Relations', is like, saying, 'I have been reliably informed by the monkey'. One ought to be going to the organ grinder, the person who really calls the shots, because until the monkey is wound up, until he is given his riding instructions and until he is told what he can and cannot do, his word counts for nothing. It does not even have the musicality of the monkey to the organ grinder. It is shameful, base politics of somebody who does not have the ability in his own portfolio to say what is necessary and to legislate in the public interest. For a long time in Australia, there has an argument waging as to whether or not individual employers and employees should have the right to agree on the terms and conditions under which they work. For the first three, four or five years of this government, there was nothing that was more opposed. We see the minister slinking out of the chamber. Perhaps he could make a phone call to Martin while he is out there and see what he should say in his speech in reply. Perhaps he ought to find out what really the points in this debate. It will be remembered that in the first couple of years of the government's industrial relations program it said that there was only one way to do things in Australia; that was do it through centralised wage fixation; that we had to have one rule for all; that the arbitration commission sitting in Melbourne should have the legal power to decide in each and every industry, whether it be in Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales or Queensland, whether it be small or large, what the wages should be in relation to that enterprise or company. Anybody who opposed it when it really counted was characterised being somehow wrong, misguided or outside the mainstream of debate. I have watched this government being dragged kicking and screaming into economic reality over the years until it finally got to place where it· started mouthing the rhetoric, but never the substance. So we hear rhetoric now about enterprise bargaining. That concept was absolutely forbidden back in 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986. We now have the government starting to mouth the rhetoric because realises that on an intellectual level, it fix wages through a quasi-judicial which are going to apply across the states, in the country, in the cities, across small large enterprises. One just cannot do it. come to the conclusion that as a matter logic it can no longer defend that untenable position. But as a matter of substance, it has decided to try to prop that up as long as it is feasibly possible. A few years ago, Bill Kelty said Australia and Cuba had the most regulated wages systems in the world. We are giving Cuba a been run for its money now, because in comes the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, directed to the rhetoric, not the substance, which proposes another 170 pages of procedures that one has to go through before one can come to a Labor simple agreement between employer and employee as to terms and conditions of work. In relation to those 170 pages, it is game, set and match to the ACTU. It has done over this minister. This is a minister who no longer deserves any respect whatsoever in this are chamber for the way in which he has completely capitulated in the face of the ACTU demands. These days, if one wants to come to an agreement in a particular enterprise or a particular company as to wages, conditions to or those things that affect employment generally, even if the employer and the. employees are in agreement, that is not enough- It is not enough that the people who are involved, the people who are at the workplace, come to an agreement; that is not enough. It is not their freedom to determine the terms and conditions under which they work. That agreement has to go to an industrial relations commission. The union that has the potential to cover as employees engaged in that kind of work has to be notified. The union has the right to come into the industrial relations commission, even though the employer and the employees are in agreement, and it has the right to crossthe examine, it has the right to call for documents, it has the right to oppose the agreement on a whole host of statutory terms and conditions. If it is not satisfied and if the industrial relations commission is not satisfied, the agreement of the employer and the it employees counts for nothing. They do not cannot have that right to come to an agreement tribunal between themselves. This is a procedure which is designed to and prevent agreements, because any employer It has who goes into an agreement, to secure an of agreement, or any employees who go into an agreement, to secure an agreement, run the risk of being carted into the industrial relations commission and being opposed by the union on a whole host of statutory tests, having the documents pulled out, having the witnesses cross-examined, having legal arguments as to jurisdiction, having reserve decisions, having appeals and having public interest sanctions put against one. Anybody who knows that he has to go through all of that rigmarole will not even try in the first place. Why would he bother? An agreement will be reached with the union in the first place to ensure that all of his money is not wasted in the Industrial Relations Commission, on the lawyers and on the proceedings, or that his employees are held up to ridicule, cross-examination and all of those other things for not having agreed to the union's agreement. There are so many people in shops and factories who just want that basic freedom to get on with their lives, to look after themselves and to agree between themselves. It is not as if they are crying out in these circumstances for a right of intervention for trade unions. If people want to join trade unions they can do so. They can call the trade union in or they can seek award coverage. We are talking about people who choose not to do that-the 71 per cent of employees in the private sector who choose not to belong to unions and who say, 'I don't want to join. 1 want the right to agree on terms and conditions. I want that basic respect. accorded to to come to that agreement without the paraphernalia that has grown up around it-the regulated wages system, a la Cuba'. There are good people of principle, some of whom are here in the gallery tonight, who want that freedom, as employers, to agree with their employees, man to man, woman to woman, equal to equal, by reason of their religious beliefs, industrial beliefs, business beliefs whatever, and to get on with business without this paraphernalia. This whole system has been designed to entrench the power of the trade unions and the ACTU over this whole process. There is no telling what could happen in the work force if employers and employees started to get together. There is no telling what could happen if we did not have third parties with an interest in dividing employees and employers from coming into the process. We might actually get harmonious workplaces, a lift in productivity, product profitability and higher wages banked off the back of productivity and profitability and we might actually get some job creation in this country. Do government members ever ask themselves why we· have so few jobs in this country? Does it ever occur to those opposite that it may have something to do with how we have regulated the way in which people can be put on, the way in which taxes have to be paid once those people are put on, and the way in which agreement can be reached with those people on terms and conditions. Today, if an employer today wants to create a job for someone, not only does he face the fringe benefits tax, the group tax, the payroll tax and all those sorts of things, but such an employer might also have to front up to the workers compensation levies, the training taxes and the superannuation taxes. Now, when it comes to wages and conditions, if an employer comes to an agr-ement, he has to go through the Industrial Relations Commission and have a union involved telling him what the terms of the conditions can or cannot be. Do government members ever wonder why we have so few people creating jobs in this country? This legislation will be another barrier to employment. This me is callous disregard of those that are locked out of the labour market. It will constantly raise the barriers against people getting back into the labour market. Indeed, even the proposals against harsh, unjust and unreasonable dismissal are just another barrier to employment. People will make conservative decisions if they know that there is a possibility that, even if the business has a downor turn, they will not be able to de-scale it back. When it comes to the government's own employment opportunities, it takes a very different view. A housekeeper at the Lodge is put off for allegedly misusing a credit card. There is no statement of reasons. There is no appeal on the basis of harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination. The Prime Minister says, 'I need this right'; but nobody else in Australia is allowed it-only him. When he is personally affected he needs the right, but he cannot see the right or the necessity in relation to anybody else. It is part of the Keating imperial presidency-'One rule for me and another for the rest for Australia'. This is a dreadful bill not only on the grounds of enterprise bargaining, but also in relation to the boycott provisions that. are being taken out of the Trade Practices Act and inserted, for the benefit of unions, in this legislation. The boycott provisions have been redrawn in this particular bill in such a way that one would have to be an absolute mug to ever get caught legally for engaging in a secondary boycott. Why are we making it easier in this country to engage in secondary boycotts? Are we suffering from a shortage of strikes or boycotts? Do we have to actually make it easier to engage in strikes and boycotts? Has there been a dearth of them recently, so that we should be encouraging them for the sake of the public interest? Why do we have to actually make it easier? In relation to these particular provisions, defences have been inserted in these clauses which say, 'Essentially, you can't be sued if you have an ultimate purpose directed to remuneration and conditions of employment'. An ultimate purpose can be directed to remuneration or terms of conditions of employment but a direct purpose of inflicting loss and damage. That is a distinction that has been drawn by the Federal Court in many a 45D case. In many of those cases the courts have said, 'They might have had the ultimate object of getting better wages by punishing the employer, stopping deliveries and bringing an end to business, but in a lawful society we really don't want people going around stopping supplies into factories with secondary boycotts. We really don't want the immediate, punishment, the immediate disruption to business, even if there be an ultimate purpose. This is a lawful society where there is a right to trade and a right to get on with business if we happen to want to trade'. This kind of behaviour which would not be acceptable by a corporation is no more acceptable because the legal entity engaging in it is a trade union. That is why sections 45D and 45E have been in the Trade Practices Act. But the government says, 'We won't have any more of them. We want to make it easier to engage in boycotts and strikes. Not only do we want to make it easier to engage in boycotts and strikes, we have a provision in here that you cannot even invoke that law, weak as it is, until you've had 72 hours of conciliation in the Industrial Relations Commission'. There is a 72-hour legal holiday from liability under the law for trade unions in this bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you or I break the law, we are liable immediately. But if a trade union breaks the law, there is a 72-hour holiday-it cannot be liable for three days. That provision has been inserted in the bill because no self-respecting union could ever fail to achieve its objectives with a 72-hour stoppage. If a union cannot achieve its industrial goal with a 72-hour stoppage to stop supplies and employees coming in and the business from trading, it will probably never achieve that goal. So we have a 72-hour legal holiday. That provision relates not only to the watered-down secondary boycott laws but also to the ordinary law of tort. The ordinary law of tort is a civil law that applies to citizens equally-you, Mr Deputy Speaker, me and everybody else. But a special provision will now say that it does not apply to trade unions. If we happen to be mates with this government, we get a legal holiday. Even if we get through the secondary boycotts and the legal holiday, under this proposal we are not allowed to take trade unions to a normal court. Normal courts tend to dispense equal justice. So we have a proposal to set up a whole new court, a whole new regime-the industrial relations court-a special court for special justice for special mates, to make sure that they get the kind of justice that the government wants. We do not have a special court for corporations. We do not have a special court for men. We do not have a special court for women. We do not have a special court for Anglo-Saxons. We do not have a special court for ethnics. But we have a special court for trade unions to make sure that people are appointed because of their understanding of their special problems. We have a special kind of justice-a system of legal apartheid where a privileged caste gets a special court for its concerns. As far as the opposition is concerned, it is equal courts for equal justice, equal application of the law for the rule of law, and secondary boycott provisions for trade unions which are the same for corporations. Above all, what about the right of the employer and the employee, by mutual agreement, by consensus in the workplace to come to agreement on terms and conditions that have the opportunity to create work, lift productivity, lift profitability and to really do something the industrial relations system of Australia? This bill is pernicious and obnoxious and should never have been brought here in the first place.",73
133,Dr THEOPHANOUS,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT," The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) pretends to talk about the philosophy and background of this Industrial Relations Reform Bill. Of course,we are all very much aware of the philosophical approach of the honourable member for Higgins, at least in his recent incarnation. The fundamental reality is that the honourable member for Higgins week by week moves to the political right and is in fact now the pre-eminent spokesman of the new right in this parliament. Mr Ruddock-Let's talk about issues, not personalities.",77
134,Dr THEOPHANOUS,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"I am talking about issues. I am talking about the philosophy of the honourable member for Higgins and, indeed, of those other members such as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) who has just come in here to hear the debate and who",77
135,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,I didn't come in hereto hear you.,77
136,Dr THEOPHANOUS,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"I know, because nobody in Australia wants to hear you. Nobody in Australia wants to hear the rubbish of the New Right which has been rejected, I would remind you",77
137,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT, The honourable member might direct his comments through the chair and bear in mind that the bill is the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993.,77
138,Dr THEOPHANOUS,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"It is, Mr Deputy Speaker. I want to talk about the philosophy of the bill, but I also want to talk about the philosophical approach of those who are opposing the bill. ,For the last 20 minutes we have heard the rambling of the honourable member for Higgins about the philosophical approach of the. coalition. I have dubbed it the new right approach to industrial relations and to a number of other matters. The reality of the matter is, as I have said a number of times in this parliament, that this for opposition is the only major party in the Western world that still holds onto the Thatcherite-Reaganite philosophies which have been rejected throughout the world. Even conservative parties in other countries have decided to moderate their positions; they have decided they should realise there is something called social justice. Those words are totally foreign to the new right and to all of its spokesmen, including in particular the honourable member for Bennelong. The reality is that we are engaged here in af\lndamental philosophical difference betwe.en ourselves and those opposite, and the fundamental philosophical difference is thisMr Costello-I would not expect you to understand the bill.",77
139,Dr THEOPHANOUS,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"The honourable member for Higgins had the impertinence to talk about equality. Can honourable members believe that-coming from the honourable member for Higgins? In fact, if the coalition had won the election and implemented its regime of industrial relations, we would have had a repetition throughout the whole of Australia of what we have had in Victoria-a situation where workers are impoverished and have a gun at their heads. They are threatened with· dismissal; they are threatened with the sack. We have the situation in Victoria where the Liberal government promised the people that it would not dismiss public servants, but it came in and within six months s'acked 32,000 people. Then we have the impertinence of the honourable member for Higgins coming in here and talking about equality. What has happened to those people and the livelihood ·of those people? What has happened to the situation of those people? We will have none of this nonsense which parades under the banner of enterprise bargaining. What does it really mean? It really means the freedom to do what? It means the freedom for an employer to put a gun at the head of an employee and to say, 'Right, either you work for $3 an hour or you are not needed; we will get the next fellow', because there is a lot of unemployment. As is well known throughout the whole of economic history, when there is a lot of unemployment the power of the employer dramatically increases. So under these circumstances can honourable members believe that the opposition is suggesting that we should do away with the safety net, a protection for workers, and that we should put in place a regime of enterprise bargaining where we will have not a genuine discussion between equals-an equal employer and an equal employee-but a discussion which is more like a man putting a gun at an employee's head and saying, 'Right, you will work for $3 an hour or you are out.'? Should anyone think that $3 is an exaggeration, it is certainly not. That was the figure suggested by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) as the youth wage. He was going to have young people in this country working for $3 an hour. He was going to suggest that if they were not prepared to work for that amount they should not even get unemployment benefits. This is the sort of regime which is brought up by the opposition's new right philosophies; yet honourable members opposite have the impertinence to come in here and try .to claim the high moral ground. What a nonsense! It is about time that we recognised that no party will be elected in Australia unless it starts making some commitments to social justice. Some people in the opposition recognise that; unfortunately, they are not the majority, they are not influential. members such as the honourable member for Higgins and the honourable, member for Bennelong are running the opposition agenda in these matters. They are trying to put in place policies that have been discredited throughout the Western world, especially in Britain and the United States. Thatcherism has been discredited even by Thatcher's own party. Yet we find Thatcherism being put up here as a philosophy by the Australian Liberal Party. No wonder people say that if Robert Menzies were alive today he would not recognise the Liberal Party. It has moved so far to the right that it has .lost any sense of commitment to welfare or to social justice. That is what this bill is about. It is about a commitment to social justice because it is a commitment to a minimum wage. What is wrong with a minimum wage? The honourable member for Bennelong objects to a minimum wage. What does he want? He wants a situation where we can have negotiations between an employer and an employee with the employer saying, 'Listen, this minimum wage is a bit too high for me; I can't afford this, so out you will go. You will have to work for much less than this, otherwise you are out'. That is the sort of industrial relations approach which is advocated by the opposition. The concept of the minimum wage, as the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) said in his second reading speech, is a fundamental issue in Australia. Australia was one of the first countries in the world to introduce the minimum wage. Indeed, Alfred Deakin, who used to be part of the Liberal tradition- .",77
140,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,That was when we had a high living standard. Remember that? You would not remember that.,78
141,Dr THEOPHANOUS,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"The honourable member for Bennelong says it was when we had high living standards. I will come to that point because this is really the crux of. the matter. The honourable member for Bennelong is speaking about reducing the living standards of Australians. That is the fundamental point which he just admitted in his own comment. He wants to reduce the living Influential standards of Australians. The reality is that, yes, Deakin wanted to have high living standards; he wanted to have reasonable, civilised living standards for Australians. We all recognise that we live in a difficult and competitive world-of course we do-but does that mean that we have to give up a fundamental system of civilised behaviour in terms of people's basic standards of living? Is that what we have to do? Is that what the opposition is advocating? Of course it is. That would be the result of its industrial relations system. The fact of the matter is that we can compete with other economies, but we can compete with them and still maintain the fundamental minimum standards of wages and the minimum standards of conditions of employment for which we in Australia have worked for many years and which have been part of the Australian tradition. On 22 March 1904 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin said: This bill starts with a confession that it is based a humanitarian interpretation of the principleS and obligations which form the very basis of civilized society. It leaves to its opponents the creed whose God is greed, whose devil is need, and whose paradise lies in the cheapest market. That is what he said. The minister correctly quoted Deakin, because in fact we have now in this extremi-t federal opposition an abandonment of that truly liberal principle. Instead, we have this extreme New Right philosophy which would let us forget even a minimum standard of living for people and would let them go out to negotiate, as I said, with a gun at their heads. People would end up in a situation in which their standards of living, as the honourable member for Bennelong has admitted, would be significantly reduced. That is not the way in which to develop a growth economy. Furthermore, let me tell honourable members that, if the opposition had been elected and had tried to bring in such a system, we would have had so much industrial chaos in this country, so much industrial turmoil and upheaval, that whatever gains might have been made in the short term by a reduction in wages to below the minimum level would immediately have been lost. The reality is that that would have happened had the opposition been elected and tried to introduce that kind of system. The Australian people have shown over and over again that they believe in a fair go for everyone and they do not believe in the idea that we should have two classes of people-the employers having all the power and the employees having none. That would be the reality under a system such as that advocated by the honourable member for Bennelong. This bill is a reform bilL We are trying to adjust to the new situation of enterprise bargaining but without reducing the fundamental principles that have guided industrial relations in Australia for many years. The idea of a minimum standard, the idea of a safety net-protection for people-means that employees can negotiate a number of arrangements with their employer but will not be threatened by the employer saying, 'Well, you have to go beyond this safety net. You have to reduce your standards of living. You have on to reduce your conditions of employment'. Of course, if we were to adopt the .approach advocated by the opposition, that is what would happen. What is wrong from even a philosophical point of view with a minimum wage? What is wrong with a basic, decent, civilised minimum wage for all people? Is this fundamentally at odds with human nature? Some people say yes. Some people believe that we should live in a society in which it is the survival of the fittest-that is to say, some kind of society where human beings behave like animals; a society in which people who are weak, who do not have a strong union or a strong bargaining position are thrown on to the scrap heap. We find similar behaviour in the animal world. But we are human beings and are not animals in that sense. Human beings have transcended that state. Human beings are capable of rational thought. Rational thought dictates that people have the right to equal treatment in terms of a decent, basic, minimum standard of living. We say that that right is not only for those who are employed. If honourable members look at the great traditions of social justice of our party-indeed, if they look at the last 10 years of social and welfare legislation-they will see that we have tried to guarantee a minimum standard of living even for people who are unemployed so that they have at least basic, civilised living standards. What do we find from the opposition? Opposition members have not only attacked workers but they have also put forward principles to attack the unemployed. They have put forward principles to attack people on welfare. They have put forward principles to reduce the whole system of support-for example, for working mothers and families-which we have put in place to help people. That includes of course the Medicare system, which helps people when they are sick.",78
142,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,When did we attack working mothers?,80
143,Dr THEOPHANOUS,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,The honourable member for Bennelong knows very well that the opposition put forward a number of measures,80
144,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,When did we attackworking mothers?,80
145,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,The honourable member for Bennelong has no right to interject across the chamber like that. The honourable member for Calwell should ignore the interjections.,80
146,Dr THEOPHANOUS,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"The honourable member for Bennelong knows very well that for a very short period the Leader of the Opposition put forward the policy that the social security department should be done away with and the whole thing handed over to private agencies, such as the Salvation Army. Has he forgotten this? The fact of the matter is that the majority of opposition members have no concept of social justice. As I have mentioned, some honourable members over there are kept under control by the honourable member for Bennelong and others. They are the poor few wJto cannot open their mouths-like the ones who were defeated on the Mabo legislation, for example. Those few poor people in the opposition who believe in social justice have been totally cut out by the honourable member for Bennelong and his friends, who still believe in the Thatcherite dream. The fact is that, in Australian politics; there is a fundamental philosophical difference which is based on the concept of social justice, and this is one of the most important pieces of legislation from that point of view. The honourable member for Bennelong gets excited because whenever the truth is put to him by people about the social consequences of the views he has put forward-not only in this field but in other fields where he has been shadow minister",80
147,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"How are you, president?",80
148,Dr THEOPHANOUS,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) is a good man who believes in social justice and is not someone who has the points of view. of the honourable member for Bennelong. I shall now tum to some other aspects of the bill, which concern direct bargaining. Obviously, this bill goes beyond the current arrangements. It has very important reforms. As the minister says, employers will be able to have a whole set of flexible arrangements with their employees but these arrangements can be sideways or upwards. There can be arrangements about productivity. There can be arrangements about all sorts of issues concerning the workplace. There cannot be arrangements that go beyond or below the safety net-the protection which the award system has given and which has been the fundamental guarantee of industrial relations in Australia for a very long time. I do not know why the opposition does not find this .bill interesting and exciting. The honourable member for Bennelong used to believe in genuine direct bargaining. This bill goes further than any other legislation has for many years in giving us direct bargainhlg, and the honourable member should be supporting it instead of opposing it. What is the difference between the opposition's view and what is proposed in this bill? Is there not direct bargaining allowed in this bill? Of course there is. Are there not enterprise agreements in this bill? Of course there are. What is the difference? The only difference, as the honourable member for Bennelong knows, is that with his approach there would be .no safety net, there would be no miriimum,.there would . be no protection. He· himself said that. we cannot have the Deakin approach because there were higher standards of living then. What a disgrace. In other words, it is the real aim of the honourable member for Bennelong to reduce the worker's standard of living even further than it has already been reduced .in a recession where· the. bulk of. the burden has been borne by the workers. What a travesty of social justice it would be if that were to the case. We have direct bargaining. We have flexibility. We have all those elements which supposedly the opposition wanted in industrial relations refonn. I might say that, had there been a more progressive liberal on the front bench dealing with this matter, he would have welcomed the refonns. But of course what do we have? We have here, as I say, in charge of this kind of legislation-we heard earlier from the honourable member for Higgins and the honourable member for Bennelong-a New Right front in the Liberal Party that is not interested in even a single concession to social justice in these matters. During the election campaign, the honourable member for Bennelong said, 'Look, we might think about a minimum'. But when he was asked, 'What minimum will you have?', he said, 'We will decide that at another time'. He was not interested in the protection of the majority of the people in'this country who are the workers. That is the fundamental fact. (TIme expired) Mr ATKINSON· (Isaacs) (9.30 p.m.)-I have listened with a great deal of interest to the comments of the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), particularly his comments about social justice. Quite frankly, some of his comments about workers being impoverished and people having guns at their heads were a downright disgrace. I suspect it may have something to do with his background, coming through the university lecturing system, before he entered this place. Over the past couple of days I have taken a great deal of interest in looking at the backgrounds of other members who have spoken on the Industrial Relations Refonn Bill. Working through them in order, we have had a union official, a teacher, another union official, a bank manager, a member whose employment category I have missed, someone who worked for Telecom, a lecturer, a teacher, another lecturer, a lawyer, a party official, a union secretary, a teacher, a fanner, another teacher, a lecturer-and it goes on and on. Part· of our problem in this whole process is that the people who are talking about this legislation have no background in small be business and in sitting down and negotiating on the workshop floor with their employees. I am one of a few on this side of the house who have been involved in small businesses where we do sit down and talk through the problems with the people. on the workshop floor. I will get on to that matter a little further down the track. It is important in the overall process to remember that this government keeps telling us that it is compassionate and that it is going to solve the unemployment problem through its social justice programs. We have about 700,000 small businesses in this country. If each of those small businesses could employ one more employee, we would have the problems of unemployment. But one of. the great difficulties we have is this sort of legislation that is being dished up to us tonight in this parliament. It is one of the reasons· that we are not going to solve these problems in the short tenn. Small business operators in this country are sick and tired of the additional pieces of paper and the 170-odd pages in this piece of legislation which are being put in front of them to solve. the problems. I do not have a difficulty with union movements representing people in big enterprises. There is a need in some instarices for unions to get involved so that they can assist workers, but it is a two-sided system. It is not only businesses that are wrong. There are occasions, I would like to think, when some of those opposite should recognise and accept that unions are wrong in the way that they deal with people as well. This piece of legislation is a one-way street because it talks about enterprise bargaining and the unions looking at agreements before decisions are taken. There is no recognition of the fact that people may not want to be members of a union or that in the private sector some 71 per cent of employees are not involved in unions. It seems to me to be a pretty interesting process that starts to look at all the s-all operations around the country and to hnk them into the union movement. It worries the heck out of me. This government continually talks about solving the unemployment problem. I assure those opposite that there are many small businesses around this country that will look very carefully before putting on an additional employee as a result of the type of legislation that is being dished up here. The government fails to realise that many of these businesses are family type businesses which have been handed down over the years and are operated perhaps by father, son and daughter. Many of the employees in some of these smaller businesses are almost part of the family. It is something that is totally disregarded in the legislation that the government has put forward. In considering enterprise bargaining, it was very interesting to hear the honourable member for Calwell saying that we on this side want to cut away entitlements and wages. It is our policy to have a minimum wage, and that is the award wage. It has been part of our policy all along. Listening to the rhetoric he has been mouthing off in this place annoys me, and annoys members of the opposition, because it is simply not true. In considering the enterprise bargaining process, I believe that the government has failed to recognise that many of the workers will be better off under enterprise bargaining. It will be based on productivity. If employees get incentives to work better-to work harder in some instances, but not necessarily-with better methods and with better formats, they will encourage each other. They will see some sort of reward in the process for achieving that goal. The government does not provide anything in the current system to encourage that. In fact, for a number of years we have had wage increases without productivity increases, which has meant increases in the cost of manufacturing products in this country. If we cannot get the government to understand that, quite frankly, I will give the process away. I suspect that the real reason that the government is reluctant to recognise this fact is that, if wage increases were geared to productivity increases where people have an incentive to achieve and to start to get ahead of award wages, many of the people, some of whom I have mentioned, represented in this government through the various professions will start to realise-union membership is already falling away-that people within the private enterprise system who enter into enterprise. bargaining arrangements will find themselves better off. It concerns me when we start to talk about the rights and processes that we do get locked into Thatcherism, the New Right and whatever the government keeps mouthing off in its rhetoric. I do not know where it thinks I fit in the spectrum, but my interest is in making sure that this country gets back to where it was some years ago, where the younger people have an opportunity to have a job, where they can actually expect when they have completed a course to go out into a work force that welcomes them rather than go out into a work force that is very reluctant to employ them because employers may have a great deal of difficulty in keeping businesses that running. I do not believe the government recognises the amount of effort that is put in by small businesses around this country in keeping its doors open and its employees employed. A problem for many businesses, particularly going through a recession periQd, is that they are often battling at the end of the week to make sure that the wages are on the desk for their employees. Trying to work with businesses to give them the opportunity to succeed has been bypassed by the government. Its process of social justice is to look at wages and try to get increases without providing the benefits on the other side or without providing the opportunity for businesses to succeed. It is important that the government recognises that the only reason the system functions is. that there are companies in Australia operated by people who have a vision and who are prepared to get off their butts !lnd make our system work. They are prepared to go out and earn the taxes to keep the system running. We have two problems at the moment. The first is the reduction in the number of companiesthat are. out there and able to do that Secondly, and linked to that, we have been less competitive than we should have been with many of our overseas competitors. How does the government propose to improve that competitiveness with our overseas competitors? Is it by paying additional wages without linking them to productivity increases? Does the government have a solution? It is all very well to talk about social justice, philosophical differences, workers being impoverished and having guns at their heads, but the fact of the matter is that the system in which we live is made to go round. If we do not have businesses that operate to employ people, we do not have the taxes generated that keep the system functioning. I think there are many lessons to be learned by this government about the way in which this area is handled. Seventy-one per cent of workers in the private sector do not belong to trade unions. There has been a lot said in this place over the last few days about the harsh way in which workers are treated by companies. If all of those comments were true, one would have to ask why this 71 per cent of people choose not to be members of trade unions. The answer is very simple: they do not get any benefit from being members of trade unions; they find that they have flexibility of employment under the management of the companies by which they are employed; and they find they are not being dragged out of the workplace into strikes that they do not feel a part of. I believe that that 71 per cent of workers have every right to operate on that basis. However, this piece of legislation changes that process when it comes to improving opportunities, not just for the workers but for the companies as well. We must remember that companies need to derive some benefit from the process, and in most cases they are prepared to see that the worker also benefits. As an employer, prior to coming into this place, I was happy to pay above award wages and to .make productivity payments because I had the production I needed to get into the marketplace and be competitive. That is the view that the average Australian manufacturer a-d producer takes. But where will they gain wlth the way in which this process is being handled? The government is talking about enterprise ba-gaining as though it understands it; in fact, the government really does not understand how these situations are handled on the workshop floor. There are many problem areas facing small business today and with this legislation we may well see a lot of small business people saying, 'I have had enough', throwing their arms in the air and walking away from it. In fact, many people in my electorate have said to me, 'Quite frankly, it is not worth the effort. At the moment, I am only staying in business to pay my employees'. The real consequence of this process is that we may well see the doors of businesses in this country-particularly the smaller and medium sized businessesclosing. . I ask the government: what is this industrial relations bill really going to do for the unemployed? I believe that it will do nothing to solve the current problems and it might well increase the number of people in unemployment queues. That really concerns me. I recall a case in my electorate of a fellow in business who had five employees. He told me that his real difficulty was that, because his business was going through a hard time-as many businesses do during a recession-he could not afford to keep all five employees. Yet he recognised that each of those five people needed to take home a weekly wage in order to survive-the five were all from single income households. He decided to sit down with them and talk through the problem. As a result of those discussions they all decided that they would rather work a fburday week and have at least four days pay than have one of their friends without a job at all. That is what they did. In fact, as things improved-which they did because of the reduction in overheads-the employer was able to rebuild his business and get it back on its feet. He then gave his employees the opportunity to return to a five-day week. In fact, some of them are now getting overtime as well. . What are the benefits of that sort of process? That Australianism is the way in which I would like to see social justice work. The benefit is that all of those five people still have a job. Yes, their work might have been slightly reduced but at least they still had work. The manager of the business was very grateful for the way in which the employees accepted the one day a week reduction because it enabled him to keep his business functioning. In return, he felt that he owed something to his employees. When the business picked up he gave them the opportunity to get back what they had given up. To me, that is what industrial relations is all management and workers, irrespective of the size of the company, being able to work together. What would a company of that size get out of this legislation? I suggest it would mean , drafting an enterprise agreement that cut work back to four days a week; having to go through the Industrial Court process; having the union upset by the reduction to four days a week with the possibility of confrontation. I suspect that that would have done absolutely nothing for that small business-and that business is not in isolation. There are thousands upon thousands of businesses of that size across the country. Some of those businesses are presently going through a phase of trying to pull through. I know of a number which, although they have never closed their doors, really have no other option. The only reason that they have not done so is that they cannot afford the redundancy payments. When a business gets to the stage of being unable to pay the wages at the end of a week a number of things occur. When the doors finally close there are insufficient funds to pay redundancy payments anyway. So who has gained? The business certainly has not; it has gone to the wall. The employee certainly has not because there is nothing left in the coffers to pay for the redundancy. Is that the sort of system that we want operating in this country? I am prepared to concede that there are systems which do not function as well as they should; where employers do not do the right thing by employees. I am prepared to concede, that. We need to address those problems, and there are avenues through which they can be addressed. If unions do need to step in, I no argument with that; that is a method of solving and rectifying those problems. Still, why put the 71 per cent of Australians in the private sector who are not in the union system through all this drama? All these small businesses would say that there is faftoo much paperwork to deal with. The government should re-examine this process. I would like to think that it is not a cynical payback exercise for the benefit of the ACTU. While a number of the comments about: made by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) appear to ring true, it may well be that there is just some lack of understanding about how the process works. I would like to have seen the government with some people who actually ran small businesses and understood some of the problems on the workshop floor. Of course, one of the problems is that the government really does not have many such people among its ranks. It is a pity that it places Australian small business in this position.",80

151,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"Once again, in the interests of time. I will not speak to amendment No.1. It self-evidently is designed to give the capacity to enter an enterprise flexibility arrangement °to employees who are not already covered by an award. Something like 80 per cent of people employed in the private sector are covered by awards. There are some 20 per cent who are not covered by awards. I would not want them not to have the benefit of this facility. An organisation well known to the government-namely, the Metway Bank-has entered into such arrangements and it is very much in the interests· of equity and fairness that this amendment be made to accommodate the employees of that firm and firms in a like situation.",86
152,Mr BRERETON,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister· Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (9.53 p.m.)-I welcome the opposition's expressed support for enterprise flexibility agreements, which I think this amendment is designed to assist in the making of. The government does not support the amendment for a number of reasons, which I might very briefly place on the record. Firstly, interim awards are made between employers and unions who are parties to interstate disputes. Secondly, enterprise flexibility agreements apply to employers and their employees-it is not the parties to the relevant award covering the employees. Thirdly, that leads us to the conclusion that there is a limited connection between the interim award and an agreement. Finally, the as an states have shown considerable sensitivity about the potential for enterprise flexibility agreements made under the corporations power and their capacity to intrude into their jurisdiction. I would expect them to be opposed to the use of interim awards for this purpose. For these reasons, the amendment put forward by the opposition is not acceptable to the government. Amendment negatived.

153,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"I move: (2) Page 6, after clause 14 insert the following new clause: Repeal of section 122 //14A. Section 122 of the Principal Act is repealed.// . The purpose of this amendment is to delete section 122 of the principal act. That is designed to take out of the existing faw the facility which is there for the making of, and the insertion in awards of, preference clauses. Consonant with our strong belief that there should be no form of preference or privilege granted to a section in the industrial relations bargain, nor indeed should there be any form of victimisation or discrimination, we cannot accept a situation where preference clauses can be granted to people who are members of unions. Whatever may be said in defence of them, one argument that cannot be heard is that they do not take place becau-e plainly they do. I have had ample evidence presented to me and if the minister addresses this matter candidly he will acknowledge that preference clauses are inserted from time to time. Preference is to negotigiven to people who are members of unions over people who are not members of-unions. That is wrong. It is a form of blatant discrimination and, at a time when this government reason- gets out of the tree about other forms of discrimination, it seems very strange to us that there should continue to be discrimination in the workplace. I repeat to the minister an example drawn to my attention in the past 18 months of people who applied for positions as interpreters with the then Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, nominating their skills in particular European and Asian languages. They responded to public advertisements inserted in major newspapers and they received a reply from the department saying that their applications could not be entertained because the department had entered into an agreement with the Public in the Sector Union to consider only applications from members of that union. That, I tell the committee, has occurred in Australia during the lifetime of the KeatingHawke governments-I think over the last 18 months. I have the correspondence in my Sydney office and I am arranging for it to be sent to me by fax. I will personally show it to the minister. I have already made it available publicly and to the parliament in the context of other debates. That is open and shut evidence that that kind of discrimination is going on. If t-e person were rejected on the grounds that the person was a woman, was Chinese, Jewish, Catholic or Italian it would be all over the papers. But, because that person's point of discrimination. is that that person does not belong to a union, there is no reference to it. It is a big joke and it can apparentstarted. ly go on. . We on this side of the House do not this in terms of workers against bosses or some kind of old outdated class war; it simple question of freedom. If people have the qualifications for a job they are entitled be considered for that job. The fact that they happen to be of a particular race, a particular religion, a particular disposition or have joined or not joined a union ought not matter. Yet plainly under the Keating-Brereton regime it still does matter. That is why we want this section taken out and why we will be speakence ing very strongly, in a similar vein, to another amendment-which I will move in a moment-in relation to the conditions that have to be observed in the employment of people.",87
154,Mrs SULLIVAN,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT," I will be very brief because I appreciate that the time for this committee stage is short. I wish to speak to this amendment and indicate to the House that the point that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr of Howard) makes is very valid. There is aspect to this amendment which the governthat ment has hoped will pass without notice: namely, the provision that preference .should be given to unionists is totally in contravenforce-as tion of the government's affirmative action policies. We have pointed out in this House before· that there are some occasions in which AusMinister tralian Public Service jobs are advertised available only to members of the public Service service. I am amazed that Labor Party women have not screamed to the heavens about this because this is the classic situation that. affirmative action act was meant to overcome. This practice entrenches whatever discriminaunion members. tion exists. Those presently employed and members of the union are given preference. Somebody who is outside the work force is not a member of the union and will not become a member of the union until employed. Anything that entrenches continuing employment patterns is anti-affirmative action. I am sorry that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) shakes his head and does not listen. He shook his head when I I wonder where the women of the Labor Party are tonight and where they were see in the debate in their party room. I have a union background. When I came is a into this parliament I was a member of a union, and I am still a member of the same to union. I understand very well what preference for union members meant in university administration, for example. If a person was not employed in university administration, that person would not know a job was available, because of a union deal-a standard union deal-with employers to give internal preferbefore bringing in outsiders. Unions see all sorts of dangers in outsiders coming in. The real outsiders are women who have been outside the work force, rearing families and maybe getting qualifications to come back into the work force. Any deal which gives preference to people presently employed very is anti-women and anti-affirmative action. That needs to be recognised. I do not believe the minister can answer that without a degree sophistry. I would really like to hear the an women members of the government address subject publicly, in this place. I cannot believe they have addressed it in their party room or that they have faced it in the work I did when I was previously employed in university administration before coming into this House.",88

156,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,It does.,89
157,Mr BRERETON,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"It does not exist, and in the Public Service there are provisions for merit appointments and affirmative action programs that exist side by side to guarantee the outcomes that the honourable member has been talking about. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) indicated in his comments tonight that he intends to forward some material to me. I look forward to receiving it. When I do, I will not only be pleased to study it, but I will respond to him. I will briefly make a few remarks about why the government does not accept the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bennelong. No-one could accuse the opposition of being inconsistent. The views he has expressed tonight are absolutely consistent with long-standing opposition policy. It reflects an ideological opposition to workers having a chance to organise collectively and effectively. Section 122 is not, as the opposition would have people believe, a charter for either closed shops or compulsory unionism. It confers power on the Industrial Relations Commission to award preference in employment to members of federally registered unions. I point out that the power has been used very sparingly by the commission. It is not an everyday practice-far from it. It is used extremely sparingly and only in justifiable circumstances; for example, if an employer is discriminating against union members. That is the sort of circumstance in which the commission has sought to use this power. In 1988 the government strengthened the conscientious objection provisions for people who genuinely do not want to belong to unions. This government has done that; and that provides an appropriate exemption from preference or from unfair discrimination against non-unionists. I would also like to note that the amendment might, even in the context of other amendments, have the paradoxical effect of allowing the commission to award compulsory unionism. That is the last thing the honourable member for Bennelong would want. I put it to him that, as a result of the power to award preference having been held by the High Court to limit jurisdiction in this respect, repealing section 122-I am advised-would give the commission its full jurisdiction. So apart from being wrong in principle, this amendment might even achieve the opposite of the opposition's purpose. For all these reasons, the government cannot accept the proposed amendment.

158,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"I move: (3) Clause 21, page 15, proposed section 170DF, after paragraph (b) of subsection (\) insert the following paragraph: . ""(ba) non-membership of a union or of an association that has applied to be registered as a union under the provisions of the Principal Act;"". This amendment goes to the heart of the issue of principle of what the opposition is concerned about in this committee debate. Our position is very simple; we believe .that people should have the absolute freedom to to the join or not join a union. We believe that people should be absolutely free of victimisation or discrimination, irrespective of their social status, religious background, sex, political beliefs or whether or not they believe in joining a union. It is not a sufficient answer for the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) to say that the Industrial Relations Commission has the power to grant conscientious objection. Nor is it good enough for the minister to say that this power to grant preference or do this or that relating to fundamental freedoms can be exercised only by the commission. A freedom either is fundamental or it is not. Once anybody or any group of people are granted the power to qualify a freedom, that freedom is diminished. For the minister to say that it is acceptable for the commission to decide whether or not a preference clause should be granted is the equivalent of the minister saying that it is acceptable for the commission to decide whether or not a Jew or Chinese person should be employed. The principle is no different. We either believe in anti-discrimination or we do not. The trouble with those people in the Australian Labor Party is that they are selective and discriminatory in what is anti-discrimination. They carry on about their credentials on sexual, religious and racial discrimination, but when it comes to discriminating in the workplace, they are the most blatant bigots Australia has ever seen. It is about time their hypocrisy on this· issue was exposed because this is a matter of freedom; it has. nothing to do with my ideological views about trade unions but whether they believe in freedom.",91
159,Mr BRERETON,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,Calm down.,92
160,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"The minister says 'Calm down'. I will not calm down on questions of freedom, and nor should the minister. Just because the government has the numbers and will jackboot this bill through the parliament does not alter the fact that the onus is on the government to satisfy me and all of us on this side of the chamber why it can support preference ch,lUses for trade unionists. What earthly right does the government have to say that in certain circumstances those people in Australian society who are not members of a union, do not want to belong to a union, a refuse to join union and have decided of their own free will not to join a union will be discriminated against? That is the effect of the vote that has just been taken. The minister said a few moments ago that in certain circumstances it is perfectly acceptable for people to be discriminated againstMr Brereton interjecting",92
161,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,A preference clause discriminates against the people who are not members of the union. Is the minister seriously telling me that that is not true? I do not mind if he interjects and gives me his answer. Is the minister seriously saying to me that supporting a preference clause does not discriminate against the people who are not members of a union? He is silent. He did not come in for most of the debate. Mr Brereton interjecting,92
162,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"I know the minister finds this kind of interrogation troublesome because he does not normally get it on his side, but I would like him to satisfy the committee how he can support a preference clause or support any kind of discrimination of that type and still pretend to me and to this side of the chamber that there is no discrimination. What we are asking in relation to proposed, section 170DF, and what he has said in that section, is that an employer must not terminate an employee's employment for a number of reasons. One of those reasons is that the person is a member of a union or that that person participates 'in union activities outsidl: working hours or, with the employer's consent, during working hours'. I say to the minister that as a matter of principle I do not have any argument with that. Our own industrial relations policy contains an absolute discrimination against people being victimised because they are members of a union or because they participate in union affairs in reasonable cirGumstances. I have no argument with that at all. What we are saying with this particular amendment-I hope it does not suffer the same fate as the last amendment-is that if the law says that we must not discriminate against people if they belong to a union, why is it not equally fair to say we must not discriminate against them if they do not belong to a union? It seems to me that, on any test of equity and fairness, if we are going to have one we ought to have the other. That is all we are asking. It is a very tiny amendment, but it involves a very important principle. I hope that the minister in his response does not suggest that this does not happen, because it happens every day. I had an example of it brought to my attention on Friday, involving the employment of a young girl in a large store. She was basically toldMr Brereton interjecting",92
163,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"I will show the minister the correspondence I have received, but I am not stupid enough to divulge the name of this girl because, frankly, I do not trust the system that is associated with the minister's government when it comes to discrimination against people in private sector employment. So the minister should not ask me to hand over this girl's name to his outfit. I \10 not trust the government on this subject and I do not trust the union company it keeps on this particular subject either.",92
164,Mr CHARLES,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"La Trobe) (10.13 p.m.)This issue goes to the heart of the no ticket, no start mentality which, unfortunately, still exists out there in the real world where all these rules and regulations-193 pages, plus however many pages of amendments to the act-will apply. The real world out there does not live with this stuff day to day, but it lives with no ticket, no start. I can tell the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) honestly that this side of the chamber has no problem with the government's proposed section 170DF. We have no problem with it being offence to sack someone for being a member of a union. Our problem, if the minister interested,is the fact that the government does not make it an offence to sack someone for not being a member of a union. There are some people in the gallery who are, not members of a union. They have employees who are not members of a union and do not wish to be members of a : union. The government's conscientious objection is about as useful to them as goat's hair on it sheep. That is just about what it is worth. minister does not care. The shadow minister's amendment No. 9 adds symmetry to the government's bill where it says that it is an offence to intimidate ask someone to leave a union. Why on earth should it not be an offence, to intimidate someone to become a member of a union? nothing Does the minister think that that does not happen? The minister can turn his back again and walk away. That is really intelligent debate. It is nice to be able to debate the minister face to face. But out there in the world where real things happen it happens every day-every day of the week in the year. I am going to quit because, of time only. feel so strongly about this that this Thursday I will introduce a private member's bill deal with these issues again. It will industrial relations bill- ,",92
165,Mr SLIPPER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"It will be a great bill, too?",93
166,Mr CHARLES,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"You bet your life it will. It will deal fairly with the issue of voluntary membership of associations of all kinds industry, not just unions-management assoadvice ciations, any kind of association you like. think.we all believe in freedom to join or not to join a union, except the government does not practice it. Mr ,BRERETON (Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (10.16 p.m.)-The government will not support this amendment at this stage because I am advised that there is no satisfactory existing legal foundation for measure as proposed. Nevertheless, I prepared to examine the proposal further and, with that in mind, I intend to consult with an both employer groups and the union movement. The government, for our part, certainly is encourages workers to belong to unions, which we see as protecting and advancing their interests. We have also strengthened the conscientious objection provisions in the act, which provide the answer for those who genuinely hold conscientious beliefs against belonging to a registered organisation. It is against that background that I want to say something about the protection of minimum entitlement provisions of the bill' against But the termination of employment. Firstly, a dismissal may only be for a valid reason based on the conduct or the capacity of an individual employee or for reasons or connected with the operational requirements of a business. Dismissal for not being a member of a union would, by itself, have to do with any of these requirements. So the general provision of these measures is capable of applying to such a case. There is a coverage there, I am advised. Secondly, the specific matters which have real been set out in the bill as not being valid reasons are based on the provisions of the ILO standards concerning termination of I employment and workers with family responsibilities. The opposition's proposal, in this to sense, goes beyond the specific grounds be an applicable under the ILO standard. Thirdly, and in the brief time that is available to me, a provision such as that' proposed by the opposition could not be safely based on the conciliation and arbitration power, I in am advised, and that is based upon recent from the Attomey-General's DepartI ment. Although there is scope to provide for such a prohibition by relying upon 'the corporations power, it would have a piecemeal effect. All of these matters that I have raised are worthy of further examination. In the course of the next few days and weeks it is my , intention to consult with unions and employers. It is appropriate that we should weigh up completely the industrial relations implicathe tions of the proposals of· the honourable am member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). I saw him earlier on today and asked him for the draft of this amendment, and it has only quite recently become available. It is because I think it is worthy of careful consideration that I have made the response that I have indicated here tonight. There will be an opportunity for this matter to be considered in another place after the conclusion of the debate here tonight. The government, for its part, will be pleased to comply with all of the undertakings that I have given to the honourable member for Bennelong in the course of the committee stage here tonight.",93
167,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT,"In response to what the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has just said, I am encouraged to hear him say that he is going to look at this further. But he and the House will understand my saying that I am a little suspicious",94

Question resolved in the affinnative. Bill reported with amendments; report adopted. Third Reading Motion (by Mr Brereton) proposed: That the bill be now read a third time ..",95
171,Mr HOWARD,AMENDMENTS OF THE INDUSTRIAL,"In the three minutes that remain may I take the opportunity of summarising again the - sition of the coalition on this measure. We WIll vote against the third reading of this bill because we find the fundamental changes that, it brings about totally obnoxious. Those fundamental changes are the destruction of the secondary boycott clauses, without any colour of justifithe cation other than a desire to genuflect before the power of the trade union movement in Australia. For 16 years those clauses have protected small business. For 16 years they have been seen as an exemplar of balancing the legal situation between business and employ-es. For 16 years, if a union de-troy-d the business of a small employer tn. thIs country by secondary boycott, that union could be exposed to· immediate injunctive relief at the hands of the employer as, indeed, another employer could. All we seek to do by the retention of these clauses is to treat like conduct in a ,like fashion. What the government has done with this clause is to put the trade union movement above the law when it comes to the imposition of secondary boycotts. That is fundamentally un-Australian. It is totally unacceptable to the attitude that is taken by the coalition. The other objectionable feature of this bill is the unnecessary use of the external affairs power of the constitution. This govern-ent has perverted and undermined the constitutional balarce of this country by its remorse- Bevis, A. R. less use of the external affairs power. A party Blewett, N. that proclaims republicanism in the name of Australian independence is happy' to hand over to dubious international bodiesincreasing amounts of power over the domestic legal affairs of this country. We have not had from the government satisfactory assurances about voluntary unionism. We look with interest at the result of the government's deliberations on the amendment I moved just a few moments ago. The last thing I want to say is to remark upon the monumental hypocrisy of a government that would enact a clause that reads as follows: An employer must not terminate an employee's employment for reasons related to the employee's conduct or performance, unless the employee has been given the opportunity to defend himself or herself against the allegations made. This government is presided over by. a man who has just sacked a member of hIS o-n department without giving any explanation and has just caused to be sacked two other employees of his household without any kind of explanation. That is the measure of the hypocrisy that is represented by this outfit on question of industrial relations. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says, 'Don't do what I do; do what I say'. The govern'!lent loads upon the small employers of thIS country impossible additional conditions. The P-ime Minister says, 'But. when I want to get rid of some meddlesome public servant, I do it with a snap of the fingers'. No wonder the government's Prime Minister is held in such contempt.",113

176,Mr DOBIE,ADJOURNMENT,"In tonight's adjournment debate I want to draw this House's attention to further material in relation to the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program. The issue is of such serious magnitude that it warrants further comment in this House. I might use the' forum of the adjournment debate to try to get some information from the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). Earlier in the day, I tried to get information regarding this issue from the parliamentary library. However, the library informed me the minister's office had issued a directive to the library that all requests for information in regard to the sporting grants program must be referred to the minister's office. One has to be suspicious of such a directive. It is indeed a sad day in this place when a representative of the executive does not possess sufficient confidence in the impartiality and expertise of the parliamentary library to provide information that she directs it to refer all inquiries to her office. I would anticipate that such a request is incredibly rare an9 I would be greatly interested to hear the minister's explanation for making such a decision. Bearing that directive in mind, I use this debate to ask the minister how it can be that a Labor candidate is able to provide information regarding the success of a grant to the applicant when to this day the sitting member has not been infonned. This is, indeed, a serious matter and one which goes to the very heart of the way this government administers funding to the community. It is sad to say the experience from the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories is not an isolated one. However, I shall confine my comments this evening to the sporting grants program. Just over a year ago, an organisation which provides excellent service to the community came to see me to seek information on how it might be able to receive funding for a new boatshed for a rescue boat. In my capacity as the local member, I suggested it make application to the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program. I obtained the application fonn for this organisation and sponsored its application with a letter direct to the minister. Some five months later, and just prior to the last federal election, the president of the organisation contacted me to say that he had just been infonned by the Labor candidate for my seat that the application was successful. The Labor candidate, I might add, was at that time on the personal staff of another minister in the Keating government and to my knowledge she still works for him. This was the candidate's first ever contact with the organisation and she then proceeded· to infonn the local media how she had been solely responsible for the success of this application. I simply ask the minister: how it is that a Labor candidate working fdr one of her ministerial colleagues who has had no prior contact with the organisation is able to infonn it of the success of its application while the elected member has still, some 10 months later, not been infonned? As I said earlier, this is not an isolated case. The former minister for community services, before he was dumped from the ministry, adopted a similar procedure for providing information. However, on a day when the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has had to defend herself against a second censure motion within 18 months, I think it is particularly apt for me to raise this issue with her. It is particularly apt, given that she has directed the Parliamentary Library to refuse to answer questions relating to the funding program and to redirect all correspondence to her office on this matter. Mr Andrews-Shameful.",114
177,Mr DOBIE,ADJOURNMENT,"I am glad the honourable member for Menzies agrees. I say to the minister that this case of the Labor candidate having full knowledge of the application, while the sitting member who was totally involved in the actual application is totally ignored, is a blatant example of political bias and one for which she should be held accountable. Nobody was fooled by the Labor candidate's attempts to hijack the kudos for the application-certainly not the organisation, with whom I have had an ongoing and productive relationship. for many years; and certainly not the electors of Cook who rejected the candidate as yet another second-rate Labor candidate.",115
178,Mr HOWARD,ADJOURNMENT,They voted in a first-rate Liberal.,115
179,Mr DOBIE,ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you. I will acknowledge that interjection so that it goes iHansard. However, the simple question remains as to how this candidate had access to such information while the sitting member was never infonned. The incredible saga of this sports, or should we say rorts,program continues. I am happy to tell the House that we open the boatshed on Saturday morning. Community Grants",115
180,Ms CRAWFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak about the amazing assertions made in this House today regarding a sporting organisation in my electorate. Allegations were made that the Logan South Rugby and Sporting Club has no players, no grounds and, in fact, does not even exist. These allegations are typical of the opposition-an opposition that is not interested in facts when it thinks might be able to get some political mileage to raise its flagging fortunes. Let me put opposition members straight. Firstly, Logan City, where the club-which I can assure opposition members does existis, is one of the fastest growing areas in Australia. It is an area which, until now, has been sadly lacking in sporting facilities of kind. This is a problem which I do not doubt is not nearly so rife in the electorates represented by opposition members. I would have hoped that, for once, those opposite could put their prejudices aside and think of the youth of this country. Let me give opposition members some facts. Recognising the need for a sporting club, community minded people set about putting ·in place the structures to give the youth of the area an opportunity that did not exist previously. Throughout 1992, with the support of the administrations of. both the Queensland Rugby Union and the Logan City Netball Association, the Logan City Workers Club recruited and trained young men and women with the aim of providing them with skills needed to participate in sports. Their efforts indeed paid off. Not counting support workers, there are 38 active netballers who make up five competing teams-38 young women ranging in age from 12 years to their 30s. Their first outdoor commenced playing in February 1993 and they are already making a name for themselves within the competition run by the Logan City Netball Association. The club's rugby teams commenced official competition in February 1993. Since then, teams have been fielded in the· Queensland subdistricts competition, the Caledonian Rugby Sevens and later in the year in the Maroochydore Sevens competition. The under-16 junior side competed all year in the Queensland Junior Rugby Union Competition and, indeed, were semi-finalists in this tition. I think the House would agree it was a busy year for a club that does not exist! Since 20 November 1992, the. club has had a written agreement with .Marsden High School to use the school's playing fields as a it home ground. The school has benefited from this arrangement by having floodlights installed by the non-existent club and arrange;. ments have been made for the provision of showers and dressing rooms which the school pupils are also able to use. Let me stress to opposition members that this grant is being used for the purpose for any which it was intended: to provi.de facilities which will directly benefit those· who need them most. If those opposite had cared to check before making spurious allegations, they would have found that there are at least 56 registered rugby players, along with the aforementioned netballers. I personallysponsor a touch football team. As well, there is currently recruitment for softball teams. Mr Atkinson- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. As I understand it, the honourable member is redebating an issue that was concluded today and, therefore, I would consider it out of order.",115
181,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"That is a frivolous point of order. As the honourable member would be aware, a member on his side of the parliament debated the same issue some minutes ago.",116
182,Ms CRAWFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"A development squad for rugby union players, young men aged 15 to 19 years, trains every Thursday night under the guidance of Barry Lea, a current Wallaby. I would ask the opposition: how is it that a team player, Trevor Lane from Logan City Workers Rugby Club, has been selected by Queensland Rugby Union to play for the Queensland secondary schools side? As well, at least one student from Marsden High School, Matthew Downey,. has benefited from the club's support in assisting him to travel, as part of the Queensland secondary schools side, to New Guinea. Rugby union is one of the world's great amateur sporting codes. I would ask the honourable member for Ballarat whether he is suggesting that only young people from compe- Toorak or the North Shore of Sydney be permitted to play rugby. Fortunately for our young people this is not the attitude of this government; neither is it the attitude of the Queensland Rugby Union administration. Although this grant assisted the club, it still up to parents and supporters to raise money to purchase equipment, uniforms and jerseys. These grants are not given lightly; eligibility is governed by strict guidelines which must be adhered to. I only wish I could walk into the office of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and demand money for my electorate. The recipient body had to prove the need and fulfil a number of requirements. As much as the opposition might think the minister for sport is a pushover, let me assure them that she is not; she is very much aware that there is never enough money to meet the demands. As a result, applications are carefully vetted to ensure that available funds go to the areas of most need. Honey Industry",116
183,Mr NEHL,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I wish to raise an issue of importance to the Australian honey industry, and that is the entry of Australian honey into New Zealand. The New South Wales Apiarists Association believes that New Zealand is using quarantine as a trade barrier merely to protect its own honey market. Australian honey as well as New Zealand honey does have a small incidence of American brood disease and this disease does affect young bees in the hive and can be passed on in honey. I hasten to say that it is harmless to humans. The New Zealand honey industry has exactly the same problem, but the New Zealand honey industry has convinced its government not to allow Australian honey in by saying that the brood disease is different from its own. I believe that this is totally untrue. CER, which I support, is a one-way street in terms of honey. New Zealand is exporting more than 30 tonnes of honey into Australia every month. Beekeeping is a very important industry for Australia. We produce 26,000 tonnes of honey annually; we export 12,000 tonnes a year. Mr Downer-Statistics with a sting.",117
184,Mr NEHL,ADJOURNMENT,"Undoubtedly they are. We are the fourth highest exporter of honey in the world. Our honey is sought worldwide because of its quality. However, as a result of is a number of factors, there is a glut of honey in Australia at the moment and the imports of New Zealand honey, in excess of 30 tonnes a month, are having a most adverse affect on our beekeepers. From my own personal knowledge, there are many beekeepers on the north coast of New South Wales and on the northern tablelands who receive only about $1.10 a kilo, and any intrusion into their market when they cannot export to New Zealand is not fair or just. Australia has honoured its commitments and New Zealand honey is allowed to enter Australia under certain conditions. All I ask on behalf of the Australian beekeepers is for New Zealand to allow our honey in under the same conditions. Unfortunately, New Zealand repeatedly defers the deadlines on previous agreements and Australian honey is not permitted to enter New Zealand under any conditions. I repeat: CER is an admirable agreement, it is working for Australia and for New Zealand, but the honey producers of Australia need to get fairriess and equity and justice compared with their colleagues across the Tasman. Forest Hill State School",117
185,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Oxley) (10.49 p.m.)On Saturday, 30 October 1993 I had the pleasure to attend the centenary celebrations of the Forest Hill State School in my electorate of Oxley. More than 3,000 people attended the day despite the constant threat of rain. Of course, such rain would have been well received because the Lockyer Valley is badly in need of good rain. Past pupils, teachers and Forest Hill residents came from places such as New Zealand, Townsville and Sydney to take part in the celebrations. A series of class reunions for past pupils from the early 1900s right through to the present day were held. Ninety-two-year-old Norma Darlington-the oldest pupil present on the day-82-year-old Lily Robinson, and fourth generation pupil Samuel Pocock, cut the school's centenary cake. Other activities organised on the day included performances by a band of past pupils, a parade of transport through the ages, and displays put on by pupils. One of the highlights of the day was the re-enactment of the arrival by horse and sulky of the school's first teacher, Miss Mary - achel Tait, followed by a cavalcade of pupils in period costume. The centenary celebrations were not limited to the school, with the people of Forest Hill joining in the party spirit by decorating their shops, houses and streets with colourful balloons and streamers for the occasion. Forest Hill State School has made as'ubstantial contribution to Forest Hill, the Lockyer Valley and the region generally over the past 100 years. This contribution has been made possible by the support of the community for the school and the strong school spirit which has developed. The support of the community began with the work of the original committee which began planning the school in August 1890 and worked consistently to achieve the opening of the school on 23 January 1893. The facilities of the original school were modest, consisting of one room and eight desks. Over the decades that followed, the number of children attending the school continued to grow, peaking at 166 students in 1914. While the school has expanded and been upgraded over the years with the support of government, much of the progress achieved by the school would not have been possible without the support of parents and the Forest Hill community. The school has come a long way since 1893 and has, particularly in recent years, been at the forefront of educational change. One of these changes has been the introduction into the school of the language other than English program, which will give students at the school a solid grounding in learning a second language, a skill which is vital for our nation"" al economic and social development. The centenary celebrations were a reflection of both Forest Hill's proud history and its willingness to face the future. During the day the school choir with students from grades 2, 3 and 4 sang Forest Hill's new school song. The words of the song sum up Forest Hill State School's tremendous school spirit: How fair is the far spreading Lockyer Vale In bright, sparkling sunshine or winter's dull pale But the spot we love best of the beauty spots here Is our school, Forest Hill, where our dreams are fulfilled. Proudly, with honour, we strive arid believe The best school in Queensland our goal to achieve And with love for our country, our motto will remain, Forest Hill, Pride, Love, Truth and Honour prevail. A Forest Hill State School centenary book was also produced containing information on the school's proud history. The Forest Hill community really got behind the event with every business and association in the town supporting it. The members of the Forest Hill State School centenary committee should be proud of the results of their hard work over the past three years. The efforts of these people and everyone else involved in the day ensured that the centenary celebrations did justice to the tremendous history of Forest Hill State School. It was certainly a pleasure for me to join with the students, staff, parents and everyone else who has been associated with Forest Hill State School over the years in celebrating the tremendous contribution which has been made by the school to the Lockyer Valley. I offer my very sincere congratulations to all those associated with this wonderful celebration. Essay Competition: Electorate of Fisher",117
186,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"I . would like to take this opportunity to congratulate two school students from the electorate of Fisher who will be in the House over the next couple of nights. Joanne Page, a year 12 student from Caboolture State High School and Tracey Close, a year 7 student from Mount Kilcoy State School, were the winners of an essay competition I conducted in the electorate earlier this year. The essay competition was open to all students and all schools in the electorate and consisted of two sections-a primary section and a secondary section. Students were asked . to write on a subject of their own choice. The response from schools was excellent, with 17 schools submitting more than 100 essays. Mr Evans-How many?",118
187,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Seventeen schools and 100 essays. The essays were judged during the September school holidays by a panel of three current and former school teachers living in Fisher. I would like to thank Alan Evans, Carole Dobson and Anne Peil for the time and effort they put into judging the essay competition. Joanne Page's essay entitled 'The power of the press' won the senior division, while the essay by Tracey Close entitled 'Australia's future' won the primary section. Joanne's essay on the role and power of the media in today's society is particularly topical at the moment and is worth reading to the House in full when time permits. Tracey's essay is also of value as it looks at Australia's future through the eyes of a 12-year-old. She deals with the environmental concerns of today's youth, employment concerns, and considers Australia as part of the global system. In the time remaining I would like to read Tracey's essay, as I believe it is important to listen to what the nation's youth has to say. They are, after all, the nation's future. The essay reads: Australia's Future by Tracey Close. Australia's future is very important for the generation of which I am a part of, and I think it is necessary for us to have our say and talk about things that concern us. Soil conservation is a very important part of Australia's future. Without it, we ' couldn't grow anything. Everything that man uses comes from the soil in the start. To prevent our precious soil from disappearing we should plant more trees and be more soil conscious. The soil needs protecting so we can ensure our farming future. People in Australia use up too much energy. We need to help save our fossil fuels by using tive energy sources such as solar, wind and power. We need to think carefully when considerable ing our energy needs. Another thing Australians can do is buy Australia made products where possible. This - supports our hard working farmers and industries who depend so much on people. Price mayor may not be an indication of quality. It is up to you to decide. Many people still pollute Australia's scenic landscapes and clear, sparkling waters. We have a superb country so let's not ""waste"" it. We should try to reduce our reliance on pollution causing substances and recycle everything that can be recycled or reuse them. Attitudes are changing towards the three Rs. At home, we recycle our food scraps by giving them to our chooks and we also recycle our bottles, cans and cardboard. It all helps to conserve our country. If all Australia work as one, we can make our country even more special. We must co-operate and work together so we can achieve our goals. Goals which will lift us to higher heights and to show the world what a patriotic, dedicated and splendid country we truly are. So put on a happy face and adopt a positive attitude and look after, our land down under. It's a wonderful place. It's also my generations future and we are concerned. Mrs Sullivan-Well done!",119

The following answers to questions were circulated: Regional Profile Systems and Electorate Profile Systems (Question No. 253)",120
194,Mr CONNOLLY,PAPERS,",the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 18 August 1993: (1) Did the Infonnation Management Branch of the Infonnation Services Division in, the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services pay $50;000 in July 1993 to Computer People Pty Ltd for regional profi Ie systems and electorate profile systems. (2) What instructions were given to Computer People for the supply of the (a) regional and (b) electorate profiles. ' (3) Where did the request for the profiles originate. (4) For which electorates were profiles requested. (5) Has any mail been sent on the basis of the profiles; if so, what mail. (6) What data sorting has the Department perfonned on the basis of the profiles. (7) Have the profiles been passed to any other Minister's office or (b) agency; if so, to whom. (8) Why did the Department request the profiles. (9) What sum will the Department spend on similar exercises.",122
195,Mr HOWE,PAPERS,"The MInister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) A contractor has been employed from Computer People Pty Ltd to undertake computer systems work for the development and enhancement of systems which support planning activities, including regional profiles and electorate profiles. The estimated cost of $50,000 is for services to be provided in the period 1 July to 31 December 1993. (2) The company has been given no specific instructions. The contractor is a member of a Departmental team involved in the development and enhancement of computer systems. (3) The two systems of electorate and regional profiles are quite separate. , ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS Electorate profiles-The electorate profiles were first developed some years ago in response to a range of requests for' information on resource allocation and have been produced by the Departments of Community Services and Health, Health, Housing and Community Services and now Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services since 1988. Until recently the profiles were compiled manually. In the interest of efficiency a decision was taken by Departmental management to automate the process. Regional profiles-Regionalisation is a recent Departmental initiative aimed at improving planning for service delivery to clients. As part of this process profiles will be produced for approximately 70 Departmental regions, consisting of demographic information and data on service availability for each region. (4) Profiles are produced for all electorates. (5) Electorate profiles have not been used to target recipients of mail. Their contents have been used to answer ministerial correspondence and in the preparation of ministerial briefings. (6) Electorate profiles-Data is arranged on the basis of the D.epartment's separate programs (eg (a) aged care, disability programs) within federal electorates. Regional profilesData is arranged on the basis of the Department's separate programs (eg aged care, disability programs) within departmental region. (7) Electorate profiles-The last production was in August 1993. Copies were sent by the Depart' ment to Me. Howe, Senator Richardson, Senator Crowley and Dr Theophanous. Within the department copies were sent to the Executive, Ministerial and Briefing Sections, and all State Managers. A copy was also sent to the Parliamentary Library. Regional profiles-Final versions of regional profiles have not yet been produced. In June 1993 data was provided to Departmental staff (regional planners) in State offices to assist in this process. (8) Electorate profiles-These are produced to provide suitable summary data of major services funded by the Department. Federal electorate boundaries provide convenient areas for presentation of information. The profiles are used extensively within the Department to answer requests from the public through ministerial correspondence, provide briefings to ministers and as a readily available data reference. Regional profiles-The purpose of these documents is to assist in the Department's new regional planning strategy. (9) The department employs contractors from a number of companies when there is a requirement to do so. This is consistent with government policy of contracting in or outsourcing work when it is cost effective to do so. Republic Advisory Committee (Question No. 316)",122
196,Mr CONNOLLY,PAPERS,"the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 31 August 1993: Has the Republic Advisory Cpmmittee commissioned any consultancies; if so, (a) what are they, (b) what did they cost, (c) which consultants wete engaged and (d) what were their relevant qualifications.",123
197,Mr KEATING,PAPERS,"The answer to honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Department commissioned the following consultancies at the request of the Republic Advisory Committee: Country qualifications Ireland Mr Jim puffy, MA India Mr AG Noorani Germany Professor Klaus Von Beyme Mauritius Mr Madun Gujadhur, QC Austria Professor Raschauer (i) six overseas experts to prepare reports on the operation of the non-executive presidencies in Ireland, India, Germany, Mauritius, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago; and (ii) one consultant in Australia, Mr Tony Pooley, to provide the following services: assist the Chairman of the Republic Advisory Committee in the conduct of the Committee's work; co-ordinate media and public appearances by .

International Air Terminal Buildings (Question No. 400) Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 28 September 1993: (1) Has the Government decided against accelerating completion of the construction of Brisbane's new international air terminal; if so, what changes have occurred in international aviation since the One Nation statement was delivered on 26 February 1992 to justify the decision. (2) Will $12.7 million be spent in 1993-94 to accelerate the construction of the Melbourne international terminal building; if so, what conditions justify this expenditure but not similar expenditure in Brisbane. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the followName of consultant and relevant Total consultancy fee agreed $US2,500 former Attorney-General, then Gov- ($A3,700 approx) ernor-General, then President of Trinidad and Tobago ing answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The One Nation statement provided for the Government to ""propose to the FAC that it brings' forward the completion of the new international terminal [at Brisbane airport] from 1996 to 1995"". Discussions Were held with the FAC on the possibility of accelerating the new international terminal at Brisbane and the FAC's capaCity to acCommodate the tourist growth expected at Brisbane. It was' not considered appropriate to financially assist this project, given the financial and operational costs involved and the lack of certainty that the completion date could in practice be brought forward given its current tight construction schedule, under which the project is forecast to be completed by the end of January 1996. ' The cost estimate for attempting to bring forward the project by four months to 1 October 1995 was $18 million. (2) The Government will provide an equity injection of $12.7 million to the FAC for the acceleration of the arrivals/departure ,satellite of the international terminal at Melbourne Airport. The equity injection will allow for the satellite to be completed by the end of 1995. Without the equity injection, the satellite would not have been proceeded with on current demand forecasts until approximately 2005 as part of the Stage 3 international terminal building expansion program. The acceleration of the Melbourne international terminal satellite will be a significant benefit to the international tourist market in South East Australia. The early construction of the satellite will provide additional capacity at Melbourne many years before it would otherwise have been built. The reasons for not providing funds for the acceleration of the Brisbane international terminal building are addressed in (1) above. Commercial Freight Trucks (Question No. 453) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 7 October 1993: (1) How many commercial freight trucks operate in Australia. (2) How many of the trucks referred to in part (1) operate as long haulage trucks. (3) What quantity of diesel do long haulage trucks consume. (4) What associated revenue in fuel excise do their operators pay. (5) What additional revenue will be paid by the trucking industry as a result of the increases to fuel excise in the 1993-94 Budget. (6) What sum in additional excise will the average long distance haulier pay. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) publication ""Motor Vehicle Registrations"", there were 439,500 commercial freight carrying trucks registered in Australia at the end of June 1993. (2) There is generally no agreed definition of what constitutes 'long haulage' trucks and consequently no definitive answer on the number of such trucks. However, the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics (BTCE) has estimated that over 95 per cent of long distance road freight is hauled on articulated trucks, predominantly six axle vehicles. On the other hand, some of these vehicles are used in shorter freight haulage. According to the ABS there was a total of 51,000 articulated trucks registered in Australia at the end of June 1993. (3) The ABS estimates average fuel consumption for six axle articulated trucks at around 50 Iitres 100 kilometres travelled. The National Road Transport Commission estimates the average annual distance travelled by these vehicles at about 120,000 kms. A vehicle trave11ing around 120,000 kilometres a year would thus consume about 60,000 Iitres of diesel each year. (4) The quantity of fuel excise paid by the operator of a six axle articulated truck consuming 60,000 Iitres of diesel each year, based on a preBudget diesel excise level of 26.573 cents per litre, amounts to almost $16,000 per year. (5) There is no unique definition of the 'trucking industry'. However, the BTCE has estimated that additional Budget revenue from the full 5 cents per litre increase in excise on diesel used by trucks and cars (which will not be fully in place before August 1994) is'some $300 million a year. (6) In the absence of an adequate definition of what constitutes an average long distance haulier, the additional level of fuel excise (5 cents per litre by August 1994) paid by the operator of a vehicle consuming 60,000 litres of diesel fuel per year would amount to $3,000 per year.  (Question No. 456) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 7 October 1993:  chair of the Council of Aboriginal Reconciliation. (2) What selection criteria were used to determine the appointment. (3) What is the length of the term to which he has been appointed. (4) What salary and other entitlements is he entitled to. (5) What entitlements, apart from salary, has he claimed to date of answering this question. (6) Does he occupy an office; if so, (a) what are its current and any previous addresses, (b) how many staff are employed in it, (c) what are their salaries and (d) what other expenses are associated with it. (7) What other paid positions has Mr Dodson occupied in connection with Aboriginal affairs or the Aboriginal and Torres Strait IslanderCommission. Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Governor General appointed Mr Dodson as Chairperson of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation on 12 December 1991. (2) Like all appointments to the Council for per Aboriginal Reconciliation, the appointment of the Chairperson was made by the Governor General under subsection 14(2) of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act 1991 and acting with the advice of the Federal Executive Council. The appointment of the Chairperson did not require selection criteria. In considering the crucial position of Chairperson, the Government considered it essential to appoint a person with a proven capacity to handle a range of extremely sensitive crosscultural issues, a person with an established and respected national profile and a person who has the personal integrity and proven abilities to be an outstanding Chairperson. The support given to the Council and its Committees from all major parties is a testament to Mr Dodson's capacities in his role of Chairperson. (3) - years (4) The Chairperson receives an annual salary equivalent to the rate of base level Secretary of Department ($117,647) and is entitled to recreation leave, annual leave loading, sick leave, long service leave and other leave as available to officers of the Australian Public Service, travelling allowance as determined by the Remuneration Tribunal (current rate per overnight stay is $300 for capital city and $155 for other than a capital city), a semi-official telephone, superannuation, and a private plated vehicle on the same basis as forSES officers. (5) The Chairperson has claimed for travelling allowance, semi-official telephone costs and private vehicle costs. (6) Yes, (a) Lotteries House, Cable Beach Road, Broome (current address), Corner Weld and Fredrick Streets, Broome (temporary address) (b) one Administrative Service Officer Class 5 (c) $35,971 (d) Property lease costs of $1,800 per month. Other costs for the Broome Office (telephones, stationery etc) form part of the general running costs of the Office of Indigenous Affairs of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. (7) The only paid position held by Mr Dodson through Commonwealth Government Aboriginal Affairs programs is his current position.

Mr Tickner-The Government and Legal Branch of the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services has provided the following information to part (a) of the honourable member's question: Mr Dodson's remuneration as a Royal Commissioner into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was: Travelling allowance per overnight stay Capital City-$235 Other than a Capital City-$180 Capital City-$300 Other than a Capital City-$155 1993, Hansard, page 1289.",126
199,Mr KEATING,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has a nil response; and (b) of the agencies for which I have portfolio responsibility, only the Office of the Official Secretary to the Governor General has entered into a· contract of an individual value of $100,000 or more with Civil & Civic Pty Ltd.

Admiralty House (Question No. 510)",127
204,Mr CONNOLLY,PAPERS,"the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 20 October, 1993: (1) How many days did the Governor General stay at Admiralty House during (a) 1991-92 and (b) 1992-93. (2) Did any guests stay at Admiralty House during (a) 1991-92 and (b) 1992-93; if so, in each year, (i) how many guests and (ii) for how many days.",128
205,Mr KEATING,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Governor General and Mrs Hayden spent 97 days at Admiralty House in 1991-92 and 108 days there in 1992-93. (2) Visitors to Admiralty House since 1 July 1991 have included President George Bush and Her Majesty The Queen. The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh and some members of their staff stayed there for six days in February 1992. The number of guests accommodated at the House in 1991-92 was 30 persons for 39 days; and in 1992-93 was 12 persons for 18 days. Native Title (Question No. 534) Mr Cobb asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 21 October 1993: (1) Did he state on the ABC TV program the 7.30 Report on 19 October 1993 that claims for native title would cost at least hundreds of millions of dollars. (2) How will valuations with respect to native title claims be determined. (3) Who will pay (4) What provisions has the federal Government made in its Budget projections to cover the cost of compensation.",128
206,Mr KEATING,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My remarks on this subject, like those of other Ministers, were appropriately qualified, given that no definitive estimate can yet be made of compensation costs associated with validation of grants because of factors that are yet to be determined by the courts. It is certainly the case that compensation costs will be spread over a number of years, as the Minister for Finance stated in Parliament on 20 October (Hansard, page 2221). In addition, this issue was carefully and frankly canvassed in the Government's Discussion Paper released in June 1993. We remain determined to do what is necessary to provide security for grants and just treatment, including payment of proper compensation, for native title holders. (2) This is a matter for the courts, but the proposed Commonwealth native title legislation will require that compensation be on ""just terms"" for the extinguishment of native title through the validation process. (3) The government that issued the grant will pay any compensation arising from validation of past grants: not the holders of the grants. The Commonwealth will have further discussions with the States and Territories on cost-sharing arrangements for compensation costs as well as legal and administrative costs associated with the regime. (4) The Government will maintain its responsible four year fiscal strategy. Expenditure priorities will be examined in the Budgetary context. Defence Force: Human Rights Obligations (Question No. 537) Mr Mack asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 21 October 1993: (1) Is the Australian Defence Force (ADF) bound by the provisions of human rights agreements to which Australia is a party. (2) Do the Minister and his Department verify that the military units of countries with which ADF units engage in joint exercises or training adhere the same human rights obligations to which ADF must adhere; if so, what (a) sources are used to verify adherence, (b) reliance is placed on each source, (c) neutral and independent corroboration is sought and (d) investigation do they make to verify adherence. (3) What steps does the Minister take to disengage ADF units from joint activity or training if adherence by the other military unit to the same human rights obligations (a) has not occurred, (b) is not occurring or (c) is in doubt. (4) Do the Minister, the Department and ADF units emphasise their human rights obligations before ADF units (a) engage in joint exercises with or (b) train militaryunits from other countries. (5) Did ADF units engage in joint exercises with or train any units of the Indonesian armed forces in (a) 1989, (b) 1990, (c) 1991, (d) 1992 and (e) 1993; if so, in each case, (i) over what period did the activity take place and (ii) which (A) ADF and (B) Indonesian units were involved. (6) Are exercises with or training of Indonesian units taking place or in prospect. (7) Does a unit known as KOPASSUS, the Army Special Forces Command, exist within the Indonesilln army. (8) Is the Minister or his Department aware of reports by international human rights organisations which indicate that KOPASSUS has violated human rights in Indonesia. (9) Has the Minister or his Department sought confirmation by independent and neutral sources of information they have received regarding the approach of the Indonesian armed forces to human rights matters. (to) Has the Minister or his Department proposed to disengage ADF units from joint exercises with Indonesian units when there have been grounds for believing the latter have been involved in human rights violations. Mr BilneyThe Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Australia is a party to many international agreements which include provisions dealing with human rights issues, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Charter and many others. To the extent that these agreements create specific obligations upon the Australian Government, the ADF is bound by them. In addition, the ADF is bound by a range of Australian laws and government policies on issues relating to human rights. (2) The Government is careful to remain wellinformed about human rights and conditions in many countries of the world. It is not appropriate to to discuss the sources of information on which the Government draws. (3) Each nation's armed forces' obligations in relation to human rights will vary with that nation's internationallJgreements, national laws and government policies,Broad norms of human rights, such ' as those 'expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, are widely shared. But specific obligations can vary from country to country. Government policy does not prohibit military-tomilitary contact with those nations whose human rightS obligations are not the same as Australia's. (4) ADF personnel are extensively trained in human rights issues appropriate to their responsibilities. All Staff Colleges and the Australian Defence Force Academy include the study of international humanitarian law through instruction and training in the application of the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), that part of international law which regulates the conduct of armed hostilities between states. The ADF has taken steps to put LOAC training into practice during major exercises, where ADF memberS receive the level of LOAC training and instruction appropriate to their duties and responsibilities. Basic LOAC instruction is included in recruit training courses with more comprehensive training provided for members involved in operations, and in promotion and career development courses. (5) The ADF engaged in combined exercises with the Indonesian Armed Forces over the period requested as follows: 1989: 1\voNaval passage exercises. 1990: One passage exercise and one maritime exercise. 1991 : Four passage exercises, one maritime exercise, one Air Force conference and one air transport exercise. 1992: Two passage exercises and one air transport exercise. 1993: One maritime exercise, two passage exercises, one air transport exercise, one reciprocal Special Forces exercise and one fighter exercise. Details of these exercises, to the extent of available records, are contained in the attached table. The ADF has not provided training to Indonesian military units over the period specified, apart from those elements of training inherent in combined exercises with units of the Indonesian Navy and Air Force and, with Indonesian Special Forces. The ADF has, however, provided professional training for individual members of the Indonesian Armed Forces. Where possible, ADF policy is that Indonesians will attend normal professional and technical courses available to members of the ADF. The length of courses ranges from three weeks (eg maritime air surveillance) to several months (eg navigation, hydrography), with some Staff College courses of 12 months' duration. The Indonesian students are usually officers, and represent a cross section of the Indonesian Armed Forces. Australian instructors are members of the ADF posted to training functions. Training records are categorised in financial years. No training was provided for members of the Indonesian Armed Forces in FY 1988/89. In FY 1989/90 and 1990/91 training was provided for five Indonesian officers at the Joint Services Staff College and Single Service Staff Colleges. Training was provided for 52 Indonesian members of the Armed Forces in FY 1991/92. Training included attendance at all Staff Colleges, professional officer training and technical courses in survey, maritime surveillance and aircraft maintenance. Thirty Indonesians, including officers and junior non-commissioned officers, attended a Combat Instructor's Course of four weeks duration, which taught techniques of instruction for basic conventional infantry skills. In FY 1992/93 training was provided for around 90 Indonesians, who attended all Staff Colleges, professional officer training and technical courses in such areas as engineering, management, navigation, hydrography, survey and aircraft maintenance. Forty Indonesians attended the Combat Instructor's Course. Four ADF instructors provided a two-week Electronic Warfare Course in Indonesia. Since 1 July 1993, 31 Indonesian personnel have attended a similar variety of professional and technical courses in Australia (no Combat Instructor's Course is scheduled this financial year).

(6) Yes, with the qualification that the training is and will continue to be professional and technical courses provided to individuals from a wide variety of areas within the Indonesian Armed Forces rather than to Indonesian military units. (7) Yes. (8) Yes. Amnesty International wrote to the Minister on 27 July 1993 outlining alleged human rights abuses committed by Indonesian Special Forces. (9) The Government draws on a wide range of impartial sources of information about a number of regional issues, including those involved in the qU,estion. (10) Allegations of human rights violations by Indonesian units with which the ADF undertakes combined exercises have focussed on Indonesia's Special Forces, KOPAS SUS. The ADF has had limited exercise contact with KOPASSUS, which has involved exercising basic military war fighting skills (not designed to improve proficiency in counter-insurgency or related activities) and familiarity with each others' military concepts and doctrine. The ADF does not propose to disengage from these limited exercises, but in determining their nature and scope it has taken into account Australian Gpvernment policy on human rights issues. Human rights considerations will continue to be taken into account in determining ADF pOlicy on combined exercises with Indonesia. Australia develops defence links with the Indonesian Armed Forces, including KOPASSUS, because it is in the interest of Australia and the region as a whole in helping ,to build better understanding and cooperation. As the Prime Minister has indicated, we need to look at human rights issues as part of a total relationship.

207,Mr KEATING,NIGHT KOMODO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: All persons and organisations who made a submission to the Republic Advisory Committee, and for whom an address was known, were sent with my compliments two bound volumes entitled An Australian Republic: The Options-The Report, and An Australian Republic: The Options-The Appendices. (a) The publications were not sent by registered or certi fied post. (b) In addition to those sent to persons and organisations which made a submission to the Republic Advisory Committee, copies of the Committee's report were sent to a range of groups and individuals representing legal and commuriity interests, including state parliamentarians and local government bodies. Five thousand copies of the Report were printed, and the total number of two volume sets sent to these organisations and members of the public was 2,696. Approximately 850 further copies of the two volume report were distributed by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Recipients included the Governor General and former Governors-General, federal parliamentarians, members of the press gallery and Australian missions overseas. (c) The cost of the exercise, (that is, of printing and distribution of 2,696 complimentary copies of the two volume Report) was $44,753.08.

208,Mr CAMERON,BOATS,"the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 27 October 1993: Is he attempting to form a Pacific Rim Economic Community; if so, will the community be. as integrated as the European Economic Community model enabling citizens to have access to constituent countries without hindrance to residency, work, medical treatment, education and other facilities.",132
209,Mr KEATING,BOATS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government sees Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) as a way of giving expression and structure to an emerging sense of community in the region which reflects the growing economic integration and the shared goals and aspirations of the APEC economies. Its focus is trade and investment facilitation and Iiberalisation, not integration along EC lines. As I said in Jakarta, the Government is talking about a community of open regionalism, a 'GAIT-plus' structure. We do not intend APEC to become a preferential trading arrangement based on a formal treaty structure like the European Community. Macedonia (Question No. 561) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 28 October 1993: (1) How many countries recognise Macedonia. (2) What impediments are there to Australia recognising Macedonia immediately. (3) Will Australia recognise Macedonia; if so, when; if not, what difficulties would arise in Macedonian authorities opening an office in Australia to perform consular and other functions. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable members's question: (1) As at 12 November 1993, forty (40) countries the' are known to have announced, or acknowledged, recognition of the Former Yugoslav: Republic of Macedonia (FYRM). For many of these countries recognition flowed automatically from their support for the FYRM's membership of the United Nations in April 1993. Many recognised the Republic as the ""Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"", the interim name under which it was admitted to the UN, some as the ""Republic of Macedonia"" and some have avoided specifying the name under which they have recognised. (2) & (3) Australia, along with a number of other nations, has been awaiting the outcome of bilateral attempts between Greece and the FYRM to resolve the name and associated issues before moving to recognition of the FYRM. Australia supported UN membership of the FYRM but this did not in itself amount to recognition, which in Australian practice requires a separate and deliberate act and cannot be inferred from any other action taken by the Government. Only duly accredited consular or diplomatic representatives can carry out the functions which are the sole prerogative of a consul. The opening of an office by the FYRM to perform consular functions and the accreditation of a consular representative cannot proceed until Australia recognises the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The issue of recognition remains under continuing review. Department of Primary Industries and Energy: Consultants (Question No. 569) Mr Aldred asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 28 October 1993: (1) Is the Mr Dan Kavanagh identified in his answer to question No. 103 (Hansard, 27 September 1993, page 1154) a former employee of the Department of Employment, Education and Training; if so, (a) was he (i) promoted or (ii) transferred to his Department, (b) when was he transferred or promoted to his Department, (c) to what position was he transferred or promoted, (d) did serving or former officers of the Department of Employment, Education and Training provide written or oral supervisor's or referee's reports in connection with his transfer or promotion to the Department; if so, (i) when, (ii) by whom and (iii) in what manner were the reports provided, and  comment in connection with the transfer or promotion; if so, (-) when, (ii) by whom and (iii) in what manner were the comments provided.

(3) Why were quotes not sought from other consultants in respect of the course. (4) Who identified the need to provide middle managers with training. (5) When and in what manner was the need identified. (6) What attempts were made to provide middle management training within the department. (7) Does his Department have a staff selection and training area; if so, why was it not used to provide middle management training. . (8) Did any officer other than Mr Kavanagh identify a need for middle management training; if so, (a) who, (b) when and (c) with what outcome. (9) Which departmental officer first contacted the Moreland Group and when. (10) Why was the consultancy not open to tender. (11) In connection with Contract 2 referred to in the answer to question No. 103, who sought proposals from the Moreland group and Hoiberg Consulting Group and when. (12) When did each group submit proposals. (13) Who (a) recommended and (b) decided that the groups be contacted. (14) When were they contacted and why. (15) Did Mr Kavanagh have any previous contact with ,the groups or persons associated with the groups; if so, when. (16) Why was the Moreland Group preferred over the Hoiberg Group. (17) Why were quotes sought from two groups. (18) Was the approach to two groups solely to comply with legal or procedural requirements. (19) Has the Hoiberg Group provided any consultancy services to his Department; if so, (a) when and (b) for what purposes. (20) Why was the consultancy not open to tender. (21) In connection with Contract 3 referred to in the answer to question No. 103, who sought a qu?te from the Moreland Group. (22) When was the quote sought and why. (23) Why were quotes not sought from other groups. (24) Why was the consultancy not open to tender. (25) Were any friends or relatives of Mr Kavanagh engaged in consultancy services provided to his Department by the Moreland Group; if so, (a) by whom were they engaged, (b) when were they engaged and (c) for what purposes were they engaged. (26) Did Mr Kavanagh perform work for the Moreland Group; if so, (a) when and (b) for what purpo&e.

(28) Is he able to say whether Mr Kavanagh is  (29) Has the Moreland Group provided further consultancy services; if so, in each case, (a) when, (b) for what purpose, (c) what sum was involved and (d) what delegations were exercised in awarding the consultancy. (30) Has each consultancy service provided to his Department by the Moreland Group been justified; if so, how. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The information sought is in some aspects of a personal nature relating to an employee of the Department and it is therefore inappropriate to provide the details requested by the honourable member. If there is any implication in the question that there has been malpractice on the part of any officer of my Department, the honourable member should bring forward any relevant information in his possession and it will be ful1y investigated under establ ished procedures with proper regard to due process and the rights of the individual or individuals concerned. (1) Yes, Mr Kavanagh was employed by the Department of Employment, Education and Training until 1990. (a) Transferred (b) 17 September 1990 (c) Administrative Services Officer Class 8, Position No 3116 (d)-(e) See preamble (2) The Chief Veterinary Officer and Regional Director identified a need for practical, public sector oriented management training for a group of largely technical staff to facilitate their development to assume greater responsibility for management roles. As Corporate Services Manager, Mr Kavanagh was asked to have the training section identify a suitable trainer or consultant to provide this program. The nature of the exercise required a provider with substantial and recent Public Sector experience. In the view of the AQIS Victoria Regional Office the Moreland Group were the only locally available providers who could be identified as satisfying this criterion. The Chief Veterinary Officer, Regional Director and Corporate Services Manager briefed Moreland and later appraised their proposal, which met the relevant criteria and was well within the cost parameters of normal training provision. Mr Kavanagh was asked to finalise the details. A contract and purchase order were forwarded to the company on 21 February 1991. The training was delivered in full and the original contract price only was paid. (3) No other consultants who had demonstrated the requisite skills were able to be identified through the regional training network. (4) and (5) A general need for middle management training was identified by the Public Service Commission (PSC) and advised to agencies by the Commission. The PSC provided related funding to Departments in 1991/92 and 1992/93 and approved the broad principles of the training to be provided. For the Victoria{fasmania region, AQIS' Regional Director and Chief Veterinary Officer identified the specific areas in which the training was to be concentrated. (6) and (7) The AQIS Victoria{fasmania Regional Office has a People Development and Training Unit and there is a People Development and Training Unit based in Canberra. However neither of these had the capacity to deliver the middle management training as required. (8) See answers to (4) and (5) above. (9) Mr Kavanagh, in January 1991. (to) Under ""The Engagement of ConsultantsGuidelines for Commonwealth Officers"" at the time the consultancy was let, public tenders were not required for contracts under $30,000. See also answers to questions (2) and (3). (11) The Acting Mariager Training and the Corporate Services Manager (Mr Kavanagh) of AQIS' Victoria{fasmania Region in consultation with the Training Manager Central Office. (12) Moreland submitted on 15 April 1992. Hoiberg submitted on 24 April 1993. (13) The Acting Training Manager consulted the Commonwealth Staff Development and EEO Secretariat (a regional coordination group of Commonwealth Departments) and, on the basis of the Secretariat's advice, the two groups thought to be capable of delivering the required J'rogram were contacted. (14) Contact occurred between 27 March and 21 April 1992. (15) In his previous Department Mr Kavanagh had participated in training programs run by Mr Hoiberg for Departmental senior managers. Mr Gibson had been Mr Kavanagh's supervisor. (16) The Moreland proposal was prepared in an agency-specific way (ie their preparation included visits to AQIS and the proposal addressed AQIS and industry specific issues), was related directly to the brief, and was substantially less expensive. The Hoiberg proposal was generic in character and did not address some of the issues as well as the Moreland proposal. (17) Each group had a good reputation in the Victorian training community and was considered to have the potential to deliver a training program with a short lead time. (18) No. (19) Hoiberg has not provided any consultancy services to the AQIS Victoria{fasmania Regional Office. (20) The time-frame to undertake the Middle Management Development Training within the financial year in accordance with the PSC initiative was constrained. The Region's research, including reference to the Commonwealth Staff Development and EEO Secretariat, showed that Hoiberg and Moreland were the most likely suitable providers available in Victoria at short notice. (21) The Victoria{fasmania Regional Office Training Section. (22) The quote was sought in the vicinity of 22 May 1992 acting upon instructions from AQIS Central Office to provide training to in preparation for an appraisal cycle from July 1992. (23) There was a very short lead time and the training was specific to the Australian Public Service. (24) Moreland had already done satisfactory agency specific work for AQIS and had provided essentially the same course for Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. The price quoted was well within normal consultancy parameters. (25) I have no direct knowledge of the employment arrangements for Mr Kavanagh's friends or relatives, but he has advised that none are in any way involved with Moreland. (26) The Department is not aware of any employment that Mr Kavanagh has undertaken for the Moreland Group and has not granted him approval to undertake any such employment. Mr Kavanagh has advised that he has not engaged in any such employment. (27) Mr Kavanagh and the Training Manager Victoria{fasmania Region attended a pre-Christmas function outside of normal working hours on 11 December 1992 hosted by Moreland for its clients of the previous year. This function wits attended by about 30-40 other people from private industry and State and Federal departments. The AQIS officers were present for between 30 and 45 minutes and then left. Neither consumed significant quantities of food or drink, and neither received any gift or consideration. (28) Mr Kavanagh was a subordinate officer when Mr Gibson was the Victorian Regional Director of the Department of Employment, Education and Training.  ago and worked in another State and the DEET Central Office during the period of Mr Kavanagh's employment in the Victorian Regional Office of that Organisation. Mr Kavanagh states that he had  workplace but never worked in the same area or section 'and never supervised or was supervised by  (29) The Moreland Group has not provided further consultancy services to the AQIS Victoria{fasmania Regional Office. (30) The contracted work was delivered for the agreed prices and the outcomes have met the needs identified in answers to previous questions. Native Title (Question No. 570) Mr Cobb asked the Prime Minister, upon Senior Officers notice, on 28 October 1993: To what extent will conversation of land to native title effectively remove control of land management from the States.",132
210,Mr KEATING,BOATS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Commonwealth is not seeking to diminish the States' and Territories' primary responsibility for land management. They will continue their function of issuing land titles. The Commonwealth Bill will set national standards for determining native title, for considering future action over native title land and for Commonwealth recognition of State and Territory tribunals and processes that satisfy those standards. Native Title (Question No. 571) Mr Cobb asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 28 October 1993: What percentage of Aborigines will be entitled to native title under the Mabo proposals in (a) Australia and (b) each area of Australia.",135
211,Mr KEATING,BOATS,"The answer to the honourTorres able member's question is as follows: On the basis of the High Court's decision native title can continue where Aboriginal people have maintained their connection with the land through the years of European settlement and where title has not been extinguished by acts of government. It appears that native title claims are most likely to be successful where unalienated Crown land is involved and where Aboriginal people or Strait Islanders have not been dispossessed. As canvassed in the Government's discussion paper released in June this year, it is generally thought that the percentage of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders likely to benefit directly their _ from the Mabo decision will be small.",136
