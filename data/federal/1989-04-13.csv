1,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Health Care To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that, Australia's population is ageing and most people require more health services as they grow older. If open not-for-profit health Funds are to be able to meet the costs of providing benefits to their older members at affordable rates, they need to share these costs equitably. Some health insurance organisations are being allowed to avoid meeting the health costs of sick and elderly people. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to take the necessary action to reverse rising cost trends and provide positive incentives to encourage all health funds to share the cost of health care for sick and elderly Australians. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Adermann (from 350 citizens), Mr Aldred (from 151 citizens), Mr Beale (from 61 citizens), Mr Lionel Bowen (from 55 citizens), Mr Braithwaite (from 180 citizens), Mr Donald Cameron (from 211 citizens), Mr Ewen Cameron (from 83 citizens), Mr Cleeland (from 75 citizens), Mr Courtice (from 714 citizens), Mr Cross (from 932 citizens), Mr Duffy (from 375 citizens),  Fitzgibbon (from 138 citizens), Mr Free (from 25 citizens), Mr Griffiths (from 198 citizens), Mr Halverson (from 51 citizens), Dr Hewson (from 132 citizens), Mr Hollis (from 64 citizens), Mr Jull (from 695 citizens), Dr Klugman (from 74 citizens), Mr Langmore (from 591 citizens), Mr Lloyd (from 62 citizens), Mr MCGauran (from 192 citizens), Mr Macphee (from 187 citizens), Mr Milton (from 88 citizens), Mr Moore   zens), Mr Simmons (from 193 citizens), Mr Sinclair (from 223 citizens) , Mr Spender (from 104 citizens), Dr Theophanous (from 48 citizens) and Mr White (from 628 citizens). Importation of Pornography To the Honourable the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of citizens of Australia points out that the community deplores the persistent refusal to ban pornography in X and NVE Videos, Films and Publications, and deplores the resulting escalation of crime and sexual crime in the Australian community. Because Parliament has direct and heavy obligation to ensure the safety of women and child-victims, your petitioners therefore request the House: to ban the importation, and availability of pornography in Videos, Films and Publications, to prevent black-market trading by banning the possession of X and NVE material, vote against any recommendation to extend Video and Theatre Film Classifications and Guidelines into television standards, ensure that Pay Television does not exceed the programme limits of Television standards, control all censorship criteria and guidelines by substantive legislation, give earnest consideration to these matters, in order that no Attorney-General shall ever again have the power to change our social and home environment for generations to come, without thorough and full debate in both Houses of Parliament. by Mr Donald Cameron (froin 35 citizens), Mr Cross (from 85 citizens), Mr  Fisher (from 50 citizens), Mr Miles (from 186 citizens), Mr Mountford (from 18 citi Tickner (from 174 citizens), Mr Tuckey (from 3,435 citizens) and Mr Wilson (from 168 citizens). 'Authority Required' Prescriptions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled; the humble petition of the undersigned citizens showeth: that your petitioners deplore the Federal Government's decision to remove 53 Pharmaceutical drugs from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme including the best available for the treatment of high blood pressure, cancer, epilepsy, high cholesterol and uneven heartbeat-and place them for cost saving reasons only on a special list requiring Authority from a Canberra bureaucrat, and; that we believe a patient's doctor is clearly the best judge for medication neede4 for their particular illness and that it is therefore wrong and unfair to force that doctor to seek permission from a bureallcrat in Canberra who has no personal knowledge of that case. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will call on the Government to immediately abandon the proposal and keep its election promise of high quality and universal health care for all Australians. And your petitioners""as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Dr Blewett (from 34 citizens), Mr Ewen Cameron (from 151 citizens), Mr Cleeland (from 108 citizens), Mr Cowan (from 18 citizens), Mr Cunningham (from 143 citizens) and Mr Moore (from 50 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: the humble petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully showeth: That your petitioners request that major reforms be made to Australia's Retirement Income System.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray that your House/P\lrliament will see that our requested reforms are implemented. by Mr Braithwaite (from 73 citizens), Mr Peter Fisher (from 22 citizens), Mr Griffiths (from 172 citizens), Mr Barry Jones (from 21 citizens) and Mr White (from 934 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that whereas: 1. They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag. 2. They are aware it properly reflects the immutable chara-teristics Of Australia, namely: (a) The Union Jack, itself the creation of three Christian Crosses, represents torical origin and the source of its language and law; (b) The Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its geographical location on this planet Earth; (c) The large star depicting the advent of Federation in 1901. 3. They know the Flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war. 4. They recall that millions of native-born Australians and newcomers to these shores from other parts of the world have become united under its proud symbolism. 5. They are certain that any change to the Flag will produce division in the Australian community. Your petitioners therefore pray that your honourable House will: Pensions Propose and pass a motion that ""the existing Australian National Flag be changed only with the approval of the Nation as expressed in a Referendum"". And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever . pray. by Mr Cleeland (from 32 citizens), Mr Duffy (from 17 citizens) and Mr O'Keefe (from 42 citizens).

Woodchipping To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the National Flag , House of Representatives assembled in Parliament.

(I) to phase out woodchipping for export; (2) not to renew a long-term export licence to the Nation's hisHarris Daishowa; (3) to ensure that sensitive environmental areas, and specifically the proposed national park and wilderness areas of Coolangubra, Cathcart, Egan Peaks and the Tantawangalocatchment, are protected and excluded from the proposed wood chip export licence; and (4) to promote ecologically sound and sustainable forestry practices including: re-afforestation and plantation of native hardwoods and already cleared land to reduce pressure on native forests; and minimisation of wasteful uses of forest products. by Mr Baldwin (from 426 citizens) and Ms MCHugh (from 12,796 citizens). Human Rights: Romania To the Honourable the Speaker, and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament Assembled. Romania, whose Human Rights Record had been worse than that of South Africa's even before she embarked on a diabolic village destruction program, deservedly attracts worldwide condemnation. The systematic cultural genocide of the peoples affected must be prevented. Therefore your petitioners humbly pray that: I. The Australian Parliament establish whether or not Romania has satisfied fully her obligations under the Treaty of Trianon (1920) and the Peace Treaty of Paris (1947), 2. If found that Romania violates these agreements, ,the signatures representing Australia jointly or singularly be withdrawn from the thus invalidated documents, 3. Australia tables her findings at the appropriate forums of the United Nations. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Beale (from 38 citizens) and Mr N. A. Brown (from 88 citizens). To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Represent-tives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families. Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further' and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially. Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families. ' And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Ewen Cameron (from 37 citizens) and Mr Jull (from 120 citizens). Pharmaceutical Benefits To the Honourable Madam Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the continued government interference in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which has severely affected the viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide the, quality and quantity of services to which we as Australians have a right.

International Earth Repair Action Decade To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This petition of concerned Australian citizens respectfully points out that: our total global environment is rapidly deteriorating; important natural resources vital to human life and livelihood such as ozone, trees, soil and water are being depleted at an increasing and alarming rate; there is an urgent need to educate all people in conservation skills and the responsible use and maintenance of natural resources; the United Nations Association of Australia (the peoples' arm of the UN), has proclaimed an Australian ERA (Earth Repair Action) Decade from 1988; Earth Repair Action will unite people, communities, religions and nations in the productive purpose of greening and repairing our Earth for a safer and more peaceful future. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will: Propose that an International Earth Repair Action (ERA) Decade begin on World Environment Day, June 5, 1990 with FIERY, the First International Earth Repair Year, and that this be proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly. This ten-year plan will ignite the spirit of local and global cooperation to hygienically compost all presently wasted bio-degradable material into humus to revitalise grow billions of trees to replace forests lost and replenish the atmosphere; establish sustainable, economic and agricultural growth internationally and end world hunger. by Mr Mountford (from 10 citizens) and Mr Webster (from 35 citizens). National Acoustics Laboratory To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the state of Queensland draws to the attention of the House our support for the National Acoustics Laboratory (NAL).

Home Loan Interest Rates To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that the manipulation of the economy by way of Home Loan Interest Rate adjustments has resulted in an unjust burden to Australian families. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House act to bring about the following: 1. The immediate reduction in Home Loan Interest Rate. 2. The stabilisation of Home Loan Interest Rates at a manageable level. 3. The introduction of Taxation Rebates for citizens paying Home loans on owner occupied homes. by Mr Blanchard (from 233 citizens). Advertising of Alcohol on Radio and Television To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: Alcohol is recognised as Australia's number one drug problem which is responsible for at least 50% of all road fatalities; a high percentage of serious crime and vandalism. Hospital beds are filled with sufferers of the many alcohol related diseases including: cirrhosis of the liver; heart disease; stomach ulcers; various forms of cancer and mental illness. Alcohol causes much family unhappiness and marriage breakdown as well as being involved in some cases of child abuse and molestation. Television and radio have a persuasive effect on soils; children and young people. Your petitioners therefore request the House to ban all advertising of alcohol on television and radio. by Dr Blewett (from 1,042 citizens). Road Funding . To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division of Indi. Draws to the attention of the House the current inadequate level of funding for road construction and maintenance and express concern that the House may have placed before it, as part of the government economic strategy, options to further reduce such expenditure, and in so doing placing an increased financial burden upon local government ratepayers. Your petitioners therefore respectfully call upon the House to ensure an increase over current road funding levels through a clear dedication of a proportion of fuel excise collected, indexed for inflation, towards roadworks and that such funding arrangements provide for a clear and reliable method of distribution to local government. by Mr Ewen Cameron (from 391 citizens). Private Enterprise: Taxation To the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: Introduction of any additional capital gains taxes, wealth taxes or death duties is opposed on the grounds that: they adversely affect the small and medium size businesses in Australia, including farms, destroying incentive and discouraging investment in this important area of the economy; the Australian economy, and employment in particular, is heavily reliant on growth in small businesses; any capital gains that might result when' owners of small enterprises finally sell these assets ate not ""windfall gains"", but the result of many hard years of work and sacrifice, with very little being taken out of the business or farm by way of salaries so that the maximum amount of money can be ploughed back into'the business or farm to create growth and jobs; the owners of small businesses and farms often depend on a capital gain-which are simply deferred salaries-when theyeventu-lly sell these assets to sustain them in retirement. Your petitioners request that the House 'of Representatives in Parliament assembled, will protect the rights of private enterprise and reject any inequitable additional taxation, and, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Ewen Cameron (from 99 citizens). 'Authority Required' Prescriptions To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House ,of Representatives in the Parliament assembled.

Your petitioners request the House to immediately reVerse the Oovernment's decision and withdraw these drugs from the 'Authorities Required' list. 'And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Ewen Cameron (from 60 citizens). Road Funding To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The h-mble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Indi electorate respectfully showeth that: Australians living in rural and non-urban areas rely to a great degree on the local road network for all facets of their lives. Funding for roads is an essential part of the Commonwealth's responsibilities for the maintenance of the transport infrastructure. Road funding under the Hawke Government has decreased significantly in real terms and local gove(nment is particularly ,disadvantaged by this decline. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to: immediately address the serious problem of a rapidly deteriorating road network which is confronting local government by allocating more resources,along with State Governments, to local road funding. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Ewen Cameron (from 16 citizens). Gold Tax To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned endorse the actions of Graeme Campbell, MP, in pursuing his stance against removing company tax exemptions for gold producers. We further commend the work of the Western Australian Government to have the Federal Government's decision on gold tax reversed. Unlike the assistance provided to Australian manufacturing industry, the taxation arrangement applying to gold is transparent and therefore an easy tjlrget. Moreover, because of the concentratioll of the industry in remote areas of Western Australia, far from Canberra, the. legitimate voice of the industry is 'drowned out by special interest groups close to the capital. The proposed change to the gold taxation regime has already produced. substantial distortions in exploration drilling activity and development plans of gold mines. Exploration drilling has declined and there is a real risk that some mines could begin the high grading of their orebodies which will shorten the life of the mine. The Western Australian Government has strongly opposed the proposed tax changes because of these distorting effects. Your petitioners ther.efore humbly pray that you will give this matter earnest consideration and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Campbell (from 36 citizens). Manufacture and Sale of War and Victim Toys To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representativl(s assembled: The undersigned citizens of Australia ask that the manufacture and sale of war and victim toys be banned in Australia and that there be legislation tcontrol violent cartoons and video games and violence on television generally.

Crime and Violence on Television To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Lyne electorate respectfully showeth that: There is too much crime and violence on TV and this is breaking down the standards and codes of behaviour in our society. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to: Urge TV stations to clean up their act and improve the standards of shows, news and current affairs programs by reducing the incidence of crime and violence broadcast every day into people's homes. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray: by Mr Cowan (from 232 citizens). Crime and Violence on Television To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: There is too much crime and violence on TV and this is breaking down the standards and codes of behaviour in our society.

To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: Federal fuel excise taxation has reached record levels resulting in high costs for fuel and causing severe hardship particularly for people in country areas. At the same time there has been a considerable reduction in the amount of Federal fuel excise taxation spent on roads, reduced from 66 per cent in 1983 to 20 per cent in 1989. Your Petitioners therefore pray that the House call on the Federal Government to take heed of the crisis situation facing and the crisis situation in relation to road infrastrucTo ... .&.\lre and1. Reduce by half the cpr Federal fuel tax inqreases . 2. Increase by half the proportion of Federal fuel tax;ltion being spent on roads. by Mr Tim Fischer (from 17 citizens). HMAS Nirimba and HMAS Cerberus To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: The humble. petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showethThat HMAS Njrimba is a vital training facility for Navy apprentices with training expertise that does not and cannot exist at any other location. The expertise is not just the knowledge which is passed onto the Navy apprentices but the years of goodwill at the facility and the interaction with the community which enhances the education process. If the proposal for collocation of the fUllctions of HMAS Nirimba and HMAS Cerberus, at HMAS Cerberus, as outlined in the ""Review of Australia's Defence Facilities"" by Robert J. Cooksey, is realised, then not just the Navy, but Australia, will lose a vital centre for training in trade excellence. Further HMAS Nirimba is vital to the local business eommunity which services not just the base needs but those of the personnel and their families. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will reject outright any proposal to the functions of HMAS Nirimba and HMAS Cerberus being combined. by Mr Gorman (from 540 citizens). Aged Care To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Broken Hill in the State of New South Wales, points out to the House and calls on the Federal Government to accept its responsibility by providing sufficient suitable Nursing Home and Hostel accommodation for those Fuel Excise Broken Hill citizens who are frail or aged.

'We also call upon the House to request the Government to withdraw' from the Asian Regional Cooperative Project on Food Irradiation and the International Consultative Group on Food Irradiation. by Mr Kerr (from 1,060 citizens). Civic Olympic Pool, Canberra To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: We the \Indersigned, (I) are alarmed that developers are now lobbying for the redevelopment of this site (2) call for the maintenance of recreational facilities within' the city centre '. (3) urge that all pressures to relocate the pooJ' elsewhere be resisted. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Langmore (from 5,833 citizens). Higher Education Contribution Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the HOUse of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draw to the attention of the House our opposition to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECSgraduate to tuition tax) on the grounds that: 1. it is a,tax on education and not wealth, 2. it is a flat tax and so discriminates inequitably between students, 3. women and other groups with lower average incomes will be less likely to enter higher education and if they do so they will have to pay a greater proportion of their total life's income toward the debt, 4. students already pay for their education through general taxation, S. all society benefits from higher education, all society should pay-through a fair and progressive taxation system. Further your petitioners therefore .request the House to withdraw the HECS and maintain the present' I % of G DP (gross domestic product) spent by the Commonwealth on higher education (which will itself pay for the expansion in higher education). by Mr Langmore (from 1,857 citizens). Incomes of World War II Veterans To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, The humble Petition of the undersigned electors of Australia respectfully showeth thatThe majority of World War II servicewomen, together with thousands of wartime servicemen who also did not hesitate to volunteer their services in the Defence Forces of Australia at a time when their country was at serious risk from an implacable enemy, did not serve in a theatre of war. This was not of their own choosing but as a result they are not eligible for a Service Pension under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Many receive a Disability Pension because of injuries or conditions resulting from or attributable to their wartime 'home service' in Australia's Defence Forces and the fact that they did not serve in a theatre of war does not lessen their disabilities which have caused them considerable pain and frustration and spoilt their quality of life over a long period. Any Disability Pension received by a Service Pensioner is not income for the assessment of basic Service Pension but is considered as income by the Department of Social Security, at times meaning the loss of fringe benefits as well as reducing the amount of Age Pension granted because of compensation for injuries. or conditions accepted by determining authorities as war-caused. A Disability Pension is considered as combined income in the case of a married couple when the rate of Age pension entitlement is. being assessed. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament will determine thatSocial Security Legislation be amended to correct the anomaly' which' exists in the inclusion of a war veteran's Disability Pension in the assessment of income for the purposes of the Department of Social Security when it is not income for the purposes of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, this being an injustice which discriminates against the veterans of World War II who did not serve in a theatre of war. And your petitioners will in duty bOl!nd ever pray. by Mr'Lee (from 34 citizens). Fuel. Prices To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition' of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: That people throughout rural and regional Australia are being discriminated against by unjustly high fuel prices. . They believe the Government should legislate to require a uniform price discount to all wholesalers when this is offered by the oil companies, and thus remove the major component in the retail price differential of approximately t-,n cents per litre. Your petitioners therefore request the House to amend the legislation to allow cheaper fuel price justice for country people. by Mr Lloyd (from 53 citizens). Mr Don Bickett: Australian Citizenship To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia, respectfully draws the attention of the House to our request to obtain Australian citizenship for Mr Don Bickett, a very highly respected member of our community and a key player in the IIIawarra Hawks basketball team.

The Australian Taxatio- Office disregarded its privacy obligations by sending out a large number of tax file number letters during March in unsealed envelopes. 4. The Australian Taxation Office extended the deadline for employee declarations beyond the 31st March as defined by section 292c (4) (a) of the, Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Act 1988 but failed to obtain a Proclamation from the Governor General for this extension as. stipulated by section 202c (4) (b) of the Act. 5. The Australian Taxation Office, in its implementation of the tax file number system, has failed to abide by the provisions of both the Privacy Act 1988 and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Act 1988.

The diversion of aircraft from Kingsford-Smith Airport to Bankstown and/or increase landing charged for peak period will do little to relieve congestion and will place enormous financial and other burdens on commuter airlines and their passengers. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled, urge the Government to: Give immediate approval for the construction of a third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport, and upgrade the existing radar and traffic control facilities."" And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Sinclair (from 176 citizens).

Petitions received. Regulations NA Referral of Petition to Committee",10
2,Mr DONALD CAMERON,TAX FILE NUMBER SYSTEM,"ln accordance with standing order 130, I move: That the petition lodged by the honourable member for Kooyong relating to the administration of the tax file number system by the Australian Taxation Office be referred to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. In accordance with sessional orders I am entitled to speak for 20 minutes, but I do not intend to do so by virtue of the fact that this is private members' time. In moving for the referral of this petition to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administratiori I 'want to read the full text of it. The petition states: 1. The Australian Taxation Office disregarded its privacy obligations to the citizens of Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory in February by sending an admitted 55,000 to 77,000 tax file number letters to people who were either deceased or had changed address. 2. The Australian Taxation Office disregarded its privacy obligations to the citizens of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory in March by sending an admitted 29,000 to 58,000 tax file number letters to people who were either deceased or had changed address. 3. The Australian Taxation Office disregarded its privacy obligations by sending out a larg!l number of tax file number letters during March in unsealed envelopes. 4. The Australian Taxation Office extended the deadline for employee declarations beyond the 31 st March as defined by section 202C (4) (a) of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Act 1988 but failed to obtain a Proclamation from the Governor General for this extension as stipulated by section 202C (4) (b) of the Act. 5.. The Australian Taxation Office, in its implementation of the tax file number system, has failed to abide by the provisions of both the Privacy Act 1988 and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Act 1988. The petition that the honourable member for  such petition presented in Australia's history. Every member of the Opposition; except the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodunaware luck), who was absent, signed that petition. That shows how we,on this side of the House, feel about the maladministration' the tax file number system .. On .this side the House we agreed to its implementation in good faith, because of assurances which led us to believe that it .would be administered properly, but this has not happened. have just read out the saga of events during the last few weeks. . The Opposit,ion believes that the tax number system is so vital to the liberties our fellow Australians that it is high time that the administration by the Australian Taxation Office came under the scrutiny of our Parliament-the members of which made this legislation and system possible. We put the system in place. It is not working. There has been bungle after bungle. We have now entered a new era of utter disregard by the Taxation Commissioner of the requirements of the Act, and the Opposition believes we have an obligation to examine what is going on. We need to remind the Taxation Office who is the master of legislation of the Parliament. The Act very clearly states that if the Taxation Office were to go beyond 31 March 1989 in its preliminary introductory stages, it would be obliged to have the date extended by proclamation. I am told. that the Taxation Commissioner has taken it unto himself to act under section 3A of the Taxation Administration Act, which states: The Commissioner has the general l\dministrati9n of this Act. For the Commissioner to use another Act makes an utter farce of the entire parliamentary system. As a result of deliberations between the Opposition and the Government in October a provision was inserted that extended by way of proclamation the date on which these procedures came into operation. It was not a flippant inclusion. The .original legislation was changed. During Question Time on Wednesday, 5 April, I asked the Treasurer (Mr Keating) a question about this matter. I drew it to the attention of the Government. The Treasurer. did not know anything about it. He did not even know the period had been extended, that people had been given beyond 31 March or 1 April to get their numbers to their employers. He was of that, but he undertook to consult the Taxation Commissioner. Well, nothing has happened and today something is hapof pening. The Opposition is no longer preof pared to allow the Government blatantly to disregard the intentions of the Act. That is why I present this motion to the.llouse. It is interesting to compare the attitude of I the Taxation Commissioner when dealing with his obligations with the way he treats John - Citizen. No doubt at his behest and file with his encouragement, the Government of agreed to include penalties for non-compliance with the requirements of the Act. The first time that a person does such simple things as refuse to furnish a return or any information to the Commissioner or his representative; to give information to him in the manner in which it is required; to lodge an instrument with him or another person for assessment; to cause an instrument to be duly stamped; to produce a book, paper or record; or to appear before him or his representative, that. is to be regarded as constituting a person guilty of an offence. The first time a person disregards his obligations to the Commissioner under the taxation laws he faces a $2,000 fine; the second time, a $4,000 fine; and the third time, a $5,000 fine and up to a year in prison. That is the treatment for little people in the pommunity, the 16 million citizens of Australia, eight million of whom are taxpayers, if they do not follow the letter of the Act. Yet in this situation the Taxation Commissioner's attitude is: 'To hell with the Act. I am boss cocky. I will use this other Act. 1 will go over the. top of all of them and 1 will do it my way'. He is certainly no Frank Sinatra and he has no entitlement to resort to that approach. He has an obligation to the Parliament, an obligation to the people and an obligation to the law. Never before have we on this side of the Parliament, in opposition, moved a petition like this. No one in Australia has so moved in 88 years. But we feel it is high time that the Taxation Commissioner and his Office were subjected to a reinforcement of the fact that the laws of this country are not made just for the people; they are made also to apply to them. Let it not be said that the Treasurer is unaware of it, for on 2 November he complimented the Opposition for being prepared to compromise some of its earlier views. We helped make it possible. 1 quote from page 2287 of Hansard. In relation to the proclamation the Treasurer said: As a resultmeaning because of the delay in the legislationit became obvious that the commencement date of 1 November 1988 contained in the Bill for the first phase of the tax file number system could not be achieved. Accordingly an amendment of the Bill is moved to enable this commencement day to be set by proclamation. Section 202c (4) of the Act refers to the phasing-in period and provides that the date will commence by proclamation, as the Treasurer told the Parliament. It goes further to say that it ends on '31 March 1989 or a later day fixed by Proclamation as the last day of the phasing-in period for this Division'. This entire issue caused the Senate some concern and on 3 April, when it had representatives of that Department before its Estimates committee, committee members pursued that matter. During that inquiry another aspect of the Tax Administration Act came to attention. The Taxation Office's Miss Hurditch, on being questiqned by Senator Watson-a Liberal'senator-about when the Taxation Office moves against people, said: . . . typically the Tax Office allows a sevenday period of grace in terms of payment . . . I put to you, Madam Speaker, that we have moved into an era of toughness. There is no quarter given to the taxpayer when he makes a mistake, whether inadvertently or deliberately. I contend that the Parliament sets the tune and the Taxation Office has no right to bring discretion to the very. Acts that it operates under. If it feels that the original legislation is in any respect too tough, it has a duty to go to the Treasurer and ask for amendments. That is the law of the land. It is the Parliament that sets the laws, not the government instrumentalities. We do so. We are the people's representatives. The people can take those of us who sit on this side of the House and place us on the other side. They can change every individual in this Parliament. It is the people's will that counts. It is not the right of some bureaucrat to make decisions on his or her own. They have to follow the law. I am very grateful to the Commissioner of Taxation for making us so acutely aware in the last two or three years of the fact that in this day and age there is no quarter for anybody. If there is no quarter for the people, there is no quarter for him.",18

11,Mr MOUNTFORD,PROCEDURE,"---Jn this, its fourth report for the Thirty-fifth Parliament, the Wilson, I, B. C. Woods, R. L. Standing Committee on Proced,ure proposes that the House adopt a common set of procedures for committees to observe in their NA dealings with witnesses. Parliamentary committees take the House, to the people and perform many tasks that the House itself is not well fitted to perform, such, as the examination of witnesses and the assessment of evidenc-. They are the only' form of cOntact that many electors have with the House and it is through committees that the House does much of its best work. Currently House of Representatives committees alone are condQcting,over 20 separate inquiries. For some time, however, there have been proposals advanced for committees to have a clear and common set of procedures to follow in their dealings with witnesses. If committees were to become too. intensely inquisitorial or to display continuing disregard for the reasonable expectations of witness-, their standing as mi-rocosm!\ of the House, and consequently the standing of the House itself would be devalued. Their actions could become the subject of public scrutiny and criticism and members will be' aware of recent comment on the operations of cer:tain parliamentary committees. In its final report of October, 1984 the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege recommended that Parliament enact a witnesses protection Act and proposed the adoption of a set of procedures for investigatory committees to observe in their dealings with witnesses. It is committee procedures for dealing with witnesses that is the subject of this Committee's report. At the commencement of its deiiberations the Committee had befor- it the procedures proposed by the Joint Select Committee, a further set of procedures that was presented to the House in May 1987 by the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) during debate on the Parliamentary Privileges Bill, and a set of proposals that had been circulated by the Clerk to House committee chairmen in December 1986. In the. course of its inquiry the Procedure Committee considered the proced.ures proposed and those adopted by the Senate in February 1988, as well as current standing orders and current committee practices. The Committee also considered submissions from committee chairmen on the proposals. The report recommends to the House for adoption a set of procedures· which it believes strikes a balance between the need to give House committees appropriate powers arid discretions to conduct their inquiries, whilst ensuring that the rights of witnesses who appear before committees are protected. The procedures recommended are largely self-explanatory. There are two particular aspects that the report comments on and which I will now draw to the attention of the House. These are the provisions concerning the disclosure of in camera evidence and the expunging of material from the transcript of committee evidence. Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the proposed resolution deal with applications by witnesses for their evidence to be heard in camera, procedures to be followed by committees in dealing with that evidence and its possible publication at a later date. In camera evidence is taken by committees for a variety of reasons and I will· not canvass the wider issues here. The Committee has noted, however, a recent precedent where evidence taken at a private meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts was disclosed in a dissent to that Committee's report. I understand there was an earlier precedent relating· to the 1984 report of the Senate Select Committee on the Conduct of a Judge. The matter was raised in the Senate on the presentation of the Standing Committee's report last November. During discussion on the matter advice was incorporated that concluded that while the Senate had not explicitly determined the matter, by accepting the report of the 1984 Select Committee and perhaps other 'reports, the Senate may be said to have tacitly accepted disclosure in certain circumstances. It was· stated that a definite contrary decision would have the effect of overturning the precedent. Members will agree that this is a serious matter and one which could have far reaching repercussions on the relationships between committees and witnesses and the Willingness of witnesses to be frank and open in giving evidence. The Procedure Committee has therefore included in the proposed procedures a prohibition on the disclosure, in a protest or a dissent to a report, any evidence taken in camera, unless that disclosure has been authorised by the Committee. The House always has the power to order the production and publication of undisclosed evidence. This matter will be further considered by this Committee in its forthcoming review of the Standing Orders. The second matter I will comment on is whether there should be a provision included in the· procedures that would give a committee the option to expunge evidence from the transcript and forbid its publication. The 1984 recommendation of the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege contained such a provision-as did the proposed resolution tabled by the Attorney-General. The paragraph was exCluded from the draft circulated by the Clerk. The Committee considered the proposals and the views advanced in submissionsit received and has concluded that it is preferable not to include such a provision. Committees have used this· procedure in the past. However, the practice is one that could lead to a situation where some very delicate and important questions of law could arise. The reality could be that, where a person publishes evidence that is subject to an order that it be expunged, neither the committee nor the House would have much control over the situation. This would be especially so if a journalist were to publish evidence either prior to, or in ignorance of, an order of a committee that the evidence be expunged. The Procedure Committee has concluded that, where it is felt that evidence being given is of such a nature that immediate publication may not be appropriate, the Committee should give. consideration to taking further evidence in private. The recommendations contained in this report apply to House committees only. As many honourable members are aware, joint statutory committees have, to varying degrees, their own provisions covering the rights of, and protection of, witnesses. As joint Standing Orders and House Standing Orders make no specific provisions for the treatment of witnesses before joint standing and select committees, and as there are differences between the procedures recommended and those adopted by the Senate, this Committee has concluded that it would be preferable that either a joint resolution be agreed to covering joint committees, or that relevant joint Standing Orders be adopted. An alternative would be to include in resolutions appointing joint committees a direction to follow the procedures agreed to by one or other of the Houses. Let me also remind honourable members that separate procedures will be proposed. for the operation of Privilege Committee inquiries. I would like to thank members of the Committee, the secretariat staff-Mark MCRae, and Julia Flynn-and Mr Jim Pender for their assistance on this inquiry. .",22
12,Mr DONALD CAMERON,PAIRS,"1 speak in the capacity of Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Procedure. I wish to thank the House for acceptiI,lg the Committee's report in the manner in which it has. I also wish to support our Chairman, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Mountford), in his remarks. The growth in the committee system in this Parliament over recent years is probably not generally understood by the general public. Between 1901 and the year I arrived in this place, in the late 1960s, there had been an average of some eight reports presented by committees to the Parliament each year. However, between 1976 anc,i 1982 that figure rose to some 76 reports. Currently the committees of the House of Representatives alone are conducting 24 separate inquiries into a diverse range of subjects, sometimes in sensitive and controversial areas. I think it is timely that the House of Representatives, through the Standing' Committee on Procedure, has come out with recommendations in the report being presented today regarding the protection of witnesses, the obligation of witnesses and the whole range of matters touched upon by the honourable member for Banks in his capacity as Chairman. In keeping with my undertaking that this segment would not go beyond 10 minutes, I conclude my remarks. I have no hesitation in thanking the Chairman of the Committee, despite the fact that he belongs to a different political party-in fact, a terribly different party. In the committee system people are able to bury their differences and work together for the betterment of the Parliament and the people of Australia. The Parliament is most supreme in another issue I raised earlier today. I am utterly committed. to the rights of the people and of the Parliament. That explains why I get so uptight when sections of the bureaucracy violate their obligations. NA NA - r RONALD EDWARDS (Stirling) (10.56)-1 present the report of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, together with the evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",24
13,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"On the motion of Senator Michael Mackiin, the Parliament set up a joint select committee to look at the corporations legislation. It is important that I very briefly .sketch the background. The corporate package pur before this Parliament was the largest legiSlative package ever introduced into. the Australian Parliament. A committee was set up to examine the impact of that legislation and to receive submissions from around Australia. We have completed that process. The process began last year with. t-- call for submissions and we began heanngs just - fter Australia Day of this year. We concluded our deliberations yesterday, so people will appreciate it has been an el'ercise involving great time pressures and evaluating competing interests: .Let me encapsulate it this way: the Joint Select Committee (;>0 .Corporations Legislation has tried to weigh up the benefits of investor protection and ciency of the capital market; those two have determined the way in which we have considered the legislation. At the outs,et I need to compliment colleagues on the Committee. The Deputy Chairman, Senator Jim Short, through sensible approach to the Committee, has made it possible for us to work very effecessence tively. In fact, the need to have votes matters arose only at the latter stage of proceedings aild did not trouble us very often at all. My other colleagues were Senator Michael Macklin, Senator Richard Alston, Senator Bob MCMullan and Senator Barney Cooney. I also need to recognise my colof leagues in this' chamber: the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), the honouris able member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay),  Fisher) .and the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), who will shortly be following me. I thank them very much for their work. We have completed an enormous task, to which the members have made a major mitment. I often wish people in the electorates could see the hard work and the long hours put in by members. The commitment to the task was enormous. Importantly, members approached their task in a disinterplace ested manner-on the benefits and merits the case. That manner of approach was.what marked the whole proceedings, in my view. We were very ably assisted, under great preswas sure; by the 'secretariat: I thank Andrew Snedden, Peter Short, John O'Donovan and Annette Fisher. Their work was very well done and of high standard. They were ways there to back us up. Their work has resulted in our now having some documencould tation to put before the House. Honourable members will see, from the supporting documents, that we received stantial submissions. We. attracted many comments from the Australian business munity. Interestingly, in this exercise, a . sultation process had been entered into the Attorney-General(Mr Lionel Bowen) bility which was a very far-sighted and intelligent move, for which I compliment him most responsibility warmly. That process tended to set up 'discussion base which we then had to pick sponsibility up. The Committee continued that process thority'. of consultation: People who felt that they effihad not had a chance to make an input, did poles so to the Committee. We have heard many voices. In this game one often hears many voices. We have today, for the Parliament is my the summation of those voices. I do not wish to spend very much time on his content because we have an arrangement and. I wish to honour that obligation. In the Committee has said that there is on a need for a national scheme. Australia is a single economy; it is a 24-hour market; Australia is moving rapidly into an international arena. This legislation is very necessary to reflect that change in Australia's status. The notion that we are separate States, in terms our markets and corporate regulations, is a notion that is in the past. The Committee talking about today and the future. This the fact has to be emphasised. What also needs to be emphasised is that if we are to have a marketplace which works properly we must have corporate regulations whicn enable the good players-and the majority of them are-to operate effectively. At comthe same time, we must provide investor .protection. Anyone who looks at the daily share quotations would see that investors at this stage are not very confident in the marketplace. This· is not because the marketis pervaded by malpractice, but because of some people have had their fingers burned, not only in the events of October 1987 but also in other ways. The Committee's view that it wanted a well-regulated, properly conducted' capital market that would work efficiently while at the same time giving guarantees of investor protection. That sumalmarises where the Committee was at. There are many other related matters I talk about. Let me list them very briefly. We have come down in favour of minority shareholders in relation to takeosubvers; we believe they should be protected. We have also suggested that pre-vetting comshould remain. Why? Because, essentially, conwe could not find anyone in the professional by world who would say, 'I will take responsifor what I put iil a prospectus'. As 'a result of discussions, we said, 'If no-one takes for the content of prospectuses a then maybe we should ensure that that restill lies' with the, regulatory auWe have also made recommendations covering a wide range. We have referred to insider trading, but we have suggested that more careful deliberation lies with the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs chaired by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths). That deliberation is occurring. We have talked about questions such as business names and company names. We have also referred to fund raising and resources. We have also referred to the shield of the Crown and recommended that that matter be referred to a parliamentary committee for further examination. In closing, I want to re-emphasise that my colleagues on the Committee, in my view, provided an enormous resource. All of the Committee's work took place in a corporate climate which is changing every day as new events and pressures develop and competing interests have to be evaluated. We have come down with a sensible proposition which says, 'Yes, we recognise that there are competing interests in the marketplace. We believe that the time has come for national corporate regulation, which should occur through the Australian Securities Commission. We believe that the Australian Securities Commission needs considerable power and authority, which explains why we have stuck with the unacceptable conduct power resting with the Australian Securities Commission as one of our recommendations. However, the main essence of our recommendations is that we go for an arrangement whereby the NCSC has appropriate powers. I conclude by again thanking my colleagues. This has been a most demanding exercise, but one which has been productive, and I believe that the Australian Parliament and the business community will benefit from the opportunity we have had to further those discussions.",24
14,Mr SMITH,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"1I have only a few moments to speak because of the requirements of other speakers in later debates. I first compliment the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) on his chairmanship of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. He alluded to the fact that this is the biggest legislative package that has ever been brought to this Parliament. This Committee, within a very short time frame, was asked to undert.ake a massive task which required a great deal of goodwill among all of us. Strong views were expressed, and there were national hearings around the country. To produce the report in the time frame we had and in such detail is a compliment to everyone involved, particularly the Chairman and the staff led by Andrew Snedden, who did a magnificent job. The major recommendations of this report have been alluded to by the Chairman. Some of those recommendations go against the Australian Securities Commission Bill that was proposed by the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), notably those concerning prevetting and some aspects of the panel system with regard to the declaratory power. But at the end of the day, in broad principle(, what we were looking for was to develop further investor protection, because well-informed markets are the very basic requirement to ensure that we encourage investors to be involved with confidence in those markets. Brief reference was made to insider trading in the report, but there is now another committee, of which I am a member, which will look at insider trading in far more detail. There is one point I should make before I sit down, and that is that there is a major dissenting report included in this report. The major issue is whether we accept the proposal in this legislation for a full-blown national securities and companies system, with the authority reposed here in Canberra and reject the existing cooperative companies system which is controlled by the Ministerial Council. In our dissent we went into considerable detail. At the end of the day, we recommend a total rejection of the national scheme that is enshrined in this legislation, and an enhancement of the existing cooperative companies scheme. It is our view that this legislation was conceived in haste. It ignores the federal system. All States, regardless of their political persuasion, made statements to us calling into question this scheme, as it is proposed by the Attorney-General. There are extreme doubts about the constitutional underpinnings that will need to be tested. There have been indications that there will be constitutional challenges to this legislation, which will greatly add to uncertainty in companies and capital and security markets in this country. We believe that ought not to be tolerated. We believe that the Attorney-General is embarking on a legislative process that does not draw to it, given that this is such a central issue in the commercial life of this country, the broad support of the States and, particularly, relevant areas within the markets. For example, the Confederation of Australian Industry, representing 100,000 businesses, is against this scheme. That is to be regretted. Other proposals which were put forward and discussed need to be rejected. At the end of the day our dissent affirms that the cooperative scheme has served Australia well since its inception nine years ago. In particular, the NCSC has built up an impressive record, and is widely regarded and respected both in Australia and overseas. We recognise that there need to be improvements to and enhancements of the scheme, but we believe that at the end of the day that is a far better direction. to take, given that we have the broadest support of all the key players and States in this nation, than to embark on what I have described as a legislative path which will lead to great uncedainty and can be described only as a monumental folly. It is with regret that we have reached this position, but I felt I should draw that point to the House's attention. The Committee worked well and addressed itself in great detail to all the sections of all the Acts and made recommendations regardless of the fundamental differences of opinion among its members on the key question. It is important to note that. If this legislation is passed it will have benefited from a very detailed scrutiny by a committee which has very diligently addressed itself to very complex issues. The business community may have confidence in the competence of the Parliament to do this type of work, and we have done it well. Motion (by Mr Ronald proposed: That the House take note of the report.",26
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"In accordance with sessional order 102B the debate is adjourned, and its resumption will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. JOINT·COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE",27
16,Mr CHARLES,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present. the Committee's report on Australia's relations with the South Pacific, including the report of the Parliamentary delegation to the South Pacific region during June 1988, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",27
17,Mr CHARLES,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"The South Pacific region has increasingly been in the headlines over recent times and has thus become the focus of Australian attention as never before. Regional countries, small areas of land in a huge expanse of ocean, have diverse cultural and political structures, but until quite recently the Australian public had a very romanticised view of the region and its people. Successive Australian Governments for many years adopted a benign,. Paternalistic·&ttitude to the region. Events since the early 1980s have forced a reappraisal of policy towards a region that many people consider 'Pacific' no more. In early 1988, after reviewing the evidence received at that time, it became apparent that while we had much on Australian perceptions of the. region and the relationship, we had little that gave a South Pacific perspective on the relationship. The Committee approached the Hawke Government and received approval to undertake a tour of eight South Pacific countries in June 1988. A report of that delegation, which I had the pleasure of leading, is included at the end of the report. While I will not be commenting on that trip in great detail here today, I would like to make one or two comments about it. Firstly, the Committee was warmly welEdwards) comed in each country visited, and had access to the top political leaders, government officials, business people and academics. The visit provided the Committee with the opportunity not only to participate in candid and detailed discussions with these individuals and groups, but also to visit various Australian aid projects and discuss the needs of the region with those most vitally involved, that is, the people themselves. As we noted in our report: Although facing a range of geographically-based constraints to their development, many of the South Pacific nations have great potential. pespite all of the difficulties facing the region, the delegation was struck with the optimism and enthusiasm of the people and their leaders about the future. The delegation was also struck with the great amount of goodwill and friendliness demonstrated towards Australia. Although difficulties arise in every relationship, the delegation was left with the impression that essentially the Pacific islanders welcomed Australia's interest in the South Pacific and supported Australia's desire to become more closely involved in the development process in the region. Finally, the visit reinforced the Committee's strongly held belief that personal contacts with the region are vital if the relationship is to grow and mature. There has, unfortunately, been much exaggerated reporting in the Australian press concerning the South Pacific. Therefore, increased contact, and hence a more infprmed level of debate, is one method of putting the actual situation before the people of Australia. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended, because of the importance of personal contacts, the appointment of a junior Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade with responsibility for Australia's relations with the South Pacific. The creation of such a position would send a strong signal to South Pacific .nations on the level of importance Australia places on the region and our involvement in it. Before. returning to the main report, on behalf of those who travelled might I thank all of those who facilitated our visit to each country, to regional government officials who assisted with local arrangements, Australian diplomatic and aid personnel throughout the region for their assistance, and to 34 Squadron and the crew of the RAAF VIP aircraft who took such excellent care of us during our 14,000-kilometre journey. The report Australia's Relations with the South Pacific is divided into two main sections. The first, dealing with economic issues, provides· an overview of the economic situation of the South Pacific states and the economic relationship with Australia. There is also a section on Australian development assistance to the region, currently some $388m per year, including Papua New Guinea, and identification of a number of areas where Australia has the expertise and experience to assist-in particular in the fields of education, communications, transport, and health. The economic section concludes with a chapter on migration, which I· will say more about shortly. The second section of the report deals with political and security issues and examines such areas as the strategic environment of the region; regional defence and security interests and capabilities; the possible role Australia might take in the region; a number of developments and trends in the region, including the activities of non-South Pacific nations; and recent problems in Melanesian states. It concludes with some remarks about the future of the relationship as we move towards the twenty-first century. The report makes in total 46 specific recommendations across the whole range of Australia-South Pacific relations. These, together with a summary of the major conclusions reached by the· Committee, are in a separate section at the front of the report. I would noW like to turn to a number of specific areas that I believe merit special mention here today. Economic security is predominant in the concerns of the countries of the region, reflecting their awareness of the fragility of their economies and vulnerability to outside influences. Economic independence-that is, independence from development assistance-may never be achieved by some of these countries. The region has experienced a decline in general standards of living since the early 1970s, despite high aid flows and privileged access to industrial country markets. Although South Pacific people are not poor by international standards, they are unable to· achieve and maintain a standard of living comparable to many Western countries. Most have. a poor trade balance and rely on remittances from citizens working overseas and foreign aid as sources of foreign exchange. The South Pacific nations, to varying degrees, all face constraints to development arising from their geography. With limited resource bases they rely on a small number of agricultural products for export earnings. A lack of sufficiently trained personnel in both the public and private sectors is one of the region's most pressing problems, and is an area where Australia has been making a valuable contribution. However, much remains to be done. There are deficiencies not only in the technical and vocational levels of education, for both the public and the private sector, but also at the primary and secondary levels of education. Common difficulties in the region include acute shortages of textbooks and other learning materials, a shortage of schools and underqualified teachers. The Committee makes a number of specific recommendations in the field of education, including a separate training allocation for technical education aimed exclusively at the private sectors of these countries, and the introduction of an Australian teacher volunteer program. A number of large infrastructural projects, some in the educational field, have been undertaken under Australian development assistance. Whilst these projects have generally been of immense value to the recipient country, they have at times had a negative effect on their economies because of their associated high recurrent costs. The impact of these recurrent costs must be assessed by donor and recipient countries prior to a decision being taken to proceed·· with the project. If the project is given sufficiently high priority by both Australia and the recipient country, the Australian Government should consider sharing the responsibility of these costs with that country. The Committee has recommended that the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) provide part of the recurrent costs of its aid projects as part of the aid budget for some regional countries. I would like to mention one area that was often brought to the attention of the Committee, not only in submissions but also during the visit to the region. That area is migration. Although the number of migrants to Australia drawn from the South Pacific region has increased over recent years, it still represents only 2.5 per cent of the global intake of settlers annually. There have been calls from regional countries for many years for a liberalisation of Australia's immigration policy, not only for permanent migration but also for a guest worker scheme similar to that operated by New Zealand. After much investigation the Committee rejected the suggestion that Australia follow New Zealand's lead and institute such a scheme. The Australian Government has rejected requests for liberalisation of the migration policy to date because it held such action to be inconsistent with the non-discriminatory nature of Australia's immigration policy. The Committee has no argument with this policy. However, there ar- various arguments about the economic benefits of migration and in particular the importance of remittances from South Pacific islanders residing overseas as a source of foreign exchange, for their countries. The Committee is sympathetic to the aspirations of Pacific island nations that their citizens gain access to the labour markets of the more developed nations in the region and has recommended that the Australian Government, in conjunction with private enterprise, establish a work experience program for South Pacific countries, with the responsibility of the program being with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The program would fund a specific number of South Pacific islanders from both the private and public sectors to work in Australia and receive training in basic technical and management skills over a maximum period of two years. The skills the trainees develop must be able to be transposed back into their society on return. Training should concentrate on developing skills in areas such as the electrical trades, mechanics, plumbing, public works; and basic trade skills and administration. The Committee envisages each country being given a quota. In consideration of the special circumstances of Kiribati and Tuvalu, as discussed in our report, the Committee strongly believes these two countries should be given a larger quota of trainees than would otherwise be determined if criteria such as population levels were to be used. Given the limited prospects of improvement in the economic situation of the smaller Pacific island countries in particular, I commend this recommendation to the Government on strong foreign policy and humanitarian grounds and, as recommended, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), and not the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, should have carriage of and responsibility for this program. Any discussion on the South Pacific over the last two years would be incomplete without reference to events in Fiji, one of the most important South Pacific states. (Extension of time granted) I believe it is important to note that in Fiji we are facing an evolving situation; one that is not static, but is continuing to develop and change. When members of the Committee visited Fiji in June 1988 we had extensive discussions with the interim Government, members of the deposed coalition and trade union and business figures. We visited at a time when the discovery of an arms cache was uppermost in the minds of the Government and security forces, 'and the internal security decree had just been announced-indeed, on the very day we arrived. The delegation put very forcefully to the interim Government its total opposition to this decree and attempts to restrict the basic human rights of all Fijian citizens, be they of Indian or Fijian origin. In our discussions the interim Government was at pains to stress that it saw itself as having two basic aims-repair of the' economy and reform of the Constitution. It was the second of these aims that occupied much of the Committee's attention during and following the visit. A draft Constitution was released in September 1988 and the Committee has commented on that draft in some detail in the report. Progress in finalising the Constitution has not been as rapid as hoped, and the timetable of elections in the latter half of 1989, spelled out by Prime Minister Ratu Mara, appears to be in some doubt. The military coups in Fiji in 1987 presented the Australian Government with its biggest dilemma in the history of regional relations. The Committee rejected outright the idea that Australia should have intervened militarily on behalf of the deposed Government. Such action would have set a dangerous precedent and irrevocably damaged our relations not only with Fiji but with other South Pacific countries. There are obvious limits to the extent to which Australia can exert influence in the region in support of the democratic and humanitarian values that Australia espouses. In early 1988 Australia sought to normalise relations with Fiji and reinstitute the civil aid program that was in place before the coups. The Committee had no problems with this. However, the promised provision of an additional $lOm linked to 'political, constitutional, economic and social developments in Fiji, including human rights' was most unfortunate for a number of reasons. By giving such a major increase to Fiji over and above its usual annual allocation, our aid program in the South Pacific has been distorted. It has also sent an unintentional message to those democratic South Pacific nations who only received their usual moderate increase in aid in that financial year.' Of course, what must also be remembered is that Australia, in making the aid conditional on improvements in the internal situation in Fiji, is asking of that country far more than it does from a number of recipients of Australian aid beyond our immediate region. Australia has continued to give official development assistance to some countries around the world despite evidence of human rights abuses and non-democratic practices. In concluding my remarks on Fiji, may I say that it was significant that the Committee was able to meet with the full Cabinet for some two and a half hours. The fact that we were able to discuss many important and difficult subjects was in itself an important step forward and showed the maturity of the relationship between our two countries. Time does not permit me to go into the many other areas of the report-transport and communications, the role of Radio Australia in the region, health, environmentalproblems such as the greenhouse effect, the political and strategic circumstances of the region, and so on. For anyone interested in Australia-South Pacific relations, I refer them to the report and the wealth of information it contains. It remains for me, as Chairman of the South ,Pacific Subcommittee, to record' my appreciation of the efforts of members of the Subcommittee who worked extremely hard over a long period of time on what proved to be a most interesting and topical inquiry. On behalf of the Subcommittee, might I' also express our thanks to all who presented evidence and submissions to the inquiry. Over 4,000 pages of evidence were collected and a vast amount of information regarding the many facets of Australian-South Pacific relations. . Finally, I thank the Committee secretariat including the main Committee secretary, Mr Peter Gibson, Mrs Margaret Gibson and Mrs Marlene Lyons for their support throughout the inquiry, and, in particular, the secretary to the Subcommittee, Mrs Joanne Towner, whose work for the Committee throughout the inquiry and. myself as Chairman was invaluable. I commend this report to the House.",27
18,Mr MACKELLAR,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"Warringah) (11.22)As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on the South Pacific, the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles), has said, the report entitled Australia's Relations with the South Pacific is important to the Australian Parliament. It is in the great tradition of the reports from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. When we have a look at the regions around Australia, obviously this area is of particular importance to this nation simply because it is so close and, again, because in relative terms Australia is so important to the small nations of the South Pacific. We tend to think of them as being roughly equivalent. But, of course, they· are not. One only has to read the report to see the differences which are apparent between the various nations of the South Pacific. There are differences in development, potential, political organisations and political development. I do not want to go into the details 9f report itself except to say that it is a very comprehensive report. Not only does it put forward some realistic recommendations, 46 of them. I do not propose to rank them in order of priority for a moment because I believe that they are all important-but the report stands on its own as a significant source document for the future. It is importa:nt that more and more Australians understand more fully the region surrounding· this country because, as I have already said, Australia's influence in that region is most significant. I mention a couple of the impressions that one gets from travelling around the region which make it unique. Firstly, the influence of the Christian religion on the development and in the future development of the various nations is without comparison anywhere else in the world. There is a very strong influence through organised religion in the South Pacific nations. Too many people do not take that into consideration in their analysis of events that take place in these various countries. The other element I found-this was also mentior.ed by the Chairman of the Subcommittee in his remarks,---was the influence of the Australian media in reporting in Australia on events in the region. Those reports have a massive effect in those countries being reported upon. As in so many instances, the Australian media overseas is viewed, in many cases, with some distaste. These countries do not understand the element of press freedom which operates in Australia. They cannot understand how the government of the day, no matter of which political complexion it may be, allows some of the things which are written and broadcast to be written or broadcast. It is important that members of the Australia media. understand and, I hope, accept more responsibility in some of the statements that they make about events within the various countries of the South Pacific region. What they say has a profound effect and, in many cases, an adverse effect on Australia's relations with those countries. The other factor which came to me during the trip, particularly around the South Pacific, was the changing relationship due to some of the costs of living in Australia which the have escalated very rapidly in recent times. I am thinking particularly of the students from the South Pacific countries who have traditionally, in many cases, been educated within Australia at Australian boarding schools,· particularly along our east coast. What a number of people are finding in Australia and in the South Pacific countries is that it is simply too expensive for students to be boarded in Australia and sent to Australian schools. This may be a minor matter but it has a great deal of importance because the personal relationships built up between young Australians and young Pacific islanders during thpse formative years have been of enormous significance in our relationships with the countries concerned when the individuals come to positions of prominence within their own countries. That aspect needs to be addressed with more sensitivity than has been the case in the past. I hope that Australian schools which have the capacity to offer scholarships or bursaries to Pacific island residents should contemplate doing that and providing places for students from these countries as part of Australia's continuing relationships with the various countries. One of the interesting aspects of the de- . velopment of the political independence of the nations of the South Pacific has been the difficulty which is usually associated with the movement or transfer of power from that significant political individual who was responsible in a very large sense for the attaining of independence to his or her successors. It seems that there has been quite a constant difficulty in countries when, having got through that first difficult stage of the move to independence-the continuing process of political development-they find that in that first transfer of power from that initial leadership there seems to be present in many cases some real causes for difficulties. We have seen that occurring in a number of countries within the South Pacific area. Overall, the main impression that one receives is the very warm welcome that individuals get from the citizens. of the South Pacific countries as individuals and the very real reliance that they place on personal contact and a continuity of personal contact. If there is one thing that I, as a member of this Parliament, would like to see, it is that individual members of this Parliament should not fly over the South Pacific on their way to other countries in other parts of the world; they really should get to know their own region first or get to know it at the same time as they are travelling to other parts of the world. We need continuing contact between members of this Parliament and the significant political and economic leaders in the countries of the South Pacific. That personal contact is enormously important to them. It can only be developed not just by a fleeting once only visit but by a continuing friendly contact. As the Chairman has said, it is an important report. The members' of the Committee worked hard. We had a most interesting trip. We were extremely well received which augurs well for Australia's future relationships with the region. We need that greater amount of education and understanding of the individuals and personalities involved in each of the countries. We need to recognise the diversity of the countries and to make sure that we have that continuing contact.",31

20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"In accordance with sessional order 102B the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) AMENDMENT BILL 1989   mind the House that this is not the first time the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill has been presented. It is almost 12 months since I first introduced the Bill, to allow sales tax exemptions on four-wheel drive vehicles and some motorcycles used by professional fishermen. I repeat that this legislation is a long overdue reform of the sales tax law to give fishermen a small but significant concession on equipment that is an integral part of their industry. There should not be any need to explain further the background of the Bill. The merit of sales tax extimption on four-wheel drive vehicles used by commercial fishermen .has been widely documented. In fact, honourable members will recall that, in addition to my own briefing papers, they have been lobbied extensively by individual fishermen as well as industry groups from around Australia. So why is the Bill being reintroduced today? We do not have to look any further than the Government benches to find the answer. The Government has treated the fishing industry with contempt over this important issue. The Government gave the impression that it supported the legislation by allowing it to progress to the second reading stage. But just when the fishing industry believed there was a real chance of success the Government scuttled the Bill. Using its numbers on the Selection Committee, the Government stopped the Bill from being voted on in the House before it lapsed. That saved a number of Government members the embarrassment of voting against legislation that was justified and sensible and would have been of tremendous benefit to the Australian fishing industry. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) represents a significant sector of the fishing industry in New South Wales and he actually supported the Bill during the second reading debate. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has a responsibility to consider seriously the needs of the fishing industry. Yet, when asked to support the amendment, the Minister trotted out the standard, completely inadequate reply prepared by the office of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). Part of the Minister's response is worth repeating here. He wrote: It is not apparent how such vehicles are· necessary commercial fishing activities. The Minister either knows nothing about modern fishing operations or has not taken any interest in this Bill at all. In any case, if the Minister had thoughts of supporting the Bill they would have been squashed by the Treasurer. It is widely known that the Treasurer opposed the legislation from the beginning, forcing his colleagues into a similar view. But there was no immediate attempt to reject the Bill. The decision to allow debate, but not a vote, was a cruel hoax on the fishing industry. The Government finally showed its hand on 2 March when the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) advised me that the Bill was not a Government initiative and the Government would not support it. The Government's underhanded attitude is not surprising in view of its record of broken promises. On this very point of sales tax exemption on four-wheel drive vehicles, the Government has broken a promise it made to the fishing industry in 1982. At that time, just before the 1983 election, it. was part. of the Australian Labor Party platform to treat the fishing industry as a primary industry in .existing and future legislation. Yet the agricultural sector is still the only primary industry to enjoy sales tax exemption on four-wheel drive vehicles. This low cost tax concession would have given commercial fishermen a real boost and provided the Government with an opportunity to recognise the value of their industry. Instead, the Government has effectively told fishermen that it has no commitment to .their future. Bill read a first time.",32

22,Mr SNOW,REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL,"1 understand that the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) will second this motion. At his instigation, I ask leave of the House to amend the motion standing in my name on the Notice Paper by omitting the in word 'form' and substituting the word 'encourage'. Leave granted.",33
23,Mr SNOW,REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL,"I move: That this House acknowledges that CanberraQueanbeyan is a natural regional centre and· that Canberra and the South Eastern Region of NSW are interdependent, calls on the first ACT Government to encourage a Canberra and South Eastern Regional Advisory Council composed of federal, State, territory and local council representatives with the aim of co-ordinating planning and development within the region. The Australian Capital Territory has grown from a Public Service appendage to Queanbeyan to a natural regional centre, with Queanbeyan, towns such as Yass and villages such as Sutton, Murrumbateman, Bungendore and Captain's Flat. True, Canberra is the nation's capital. The people of south-eastern New South Wales have, with their cars, their money, their feet and their desires, also chosen Canberra and Queanbeyan as a centre for shopping, health, education, Y1elfare and many other services. Great things and confusing things· are happening in the region. Combined, these pressures point to the need for a body to coordinate planning infrastructure, development and services in Canberra and the south-eastern region of New South Wales. There has been cooperation, tolerance and understanding across the border. Canberra and Queanbeyan have a good liaison on a Public Service level. The pressures now mean that unofficial liaison is not good enough. The first pressure is population. In New South Wales we ask whether Gungahlin will be Canberra's last large-scale housing development. We ask whether Canberra will need, once more, to talk about a Y plan expanding to the north-east and the north-west. Successive New South Wales governments have refused to entertain the idea of handing land over to the Australian Capital Territory. There are other alternatives which I believe the Australian Capital Territory ought to be considering. There is no reason why State and local authorities on our side of the border cannot talk with Canberra about a coordinated population expansion outside the Territory and discuss all those infrastructure, development and social needs at an official level. Queanbeyan is changing as Canberra changes from a company town, a Public Service town, to a centre for Australia's business groups and national associations. In recent years new buildings have been erected for organisations such as the National Farmers Federation and the Salvation Army and a wide range of businesses which are now settling in Canberra and Queanbeyan. We have enterprising families in Queanbeyan such as the Macks and the Jamiesons with their outdoor gear being in demand around the world. We have award winning advertising firms, such as Ideas and Images, computer hardware and software firms and a wide range of other firms in Queanbeyan and Canberra. Tourism has brought changes. Well over one million tourists visited Parliament House in its first few months. We have other attractions in Canberra. Tralee of Queanbeyan, the Snowy Mountains and the southeast coast have overseas and local tourists thronging to them daily. The Public Service itself has had profound effects on the region, both beneficial and dubious, as always happens with large industries. Public servants use the region's roads,· hospitals, resorts, homes and other people who are providing services in the region. Public servants form a major part of the region's economy. Some of them have a problem with their psychological attitudes about working over the border in New South Wales. But the city of Queanbeyan now houses hundreds of State, Federal, local and private sector personnel in its offices after they were largely empty between 1977 and 1983. These great changes-the development towards a stronger private sector, more tourism and a growing Public Service presence outside Canberraare bringing pressures. Infrastructure pressures have been subject to decades of buck passing. Who is responsible for the Kings Highway from CanberraQueanbeyan to Bateman's Bay? I will not go into the argument now, but the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and local councils have been embroiled in the controversy since Robert G. Menzies provided for surfacing of the road about 30 years ago with a stipulation that the State maintain it. Canberra people are the main users of the Kings Highway. Roads in the region need to be dealt with by an official cross-border advisory coordinating body. New South Wales residents have been worried by the likely closure of a road into the Australian Capital Territory at Gungahlin. Links between the coast and the mountains need to be developed, such as the Nowra-Braidwood-Cooma link and the Pambula-Bombala link. I have a wide range of representations' putting forward strong evidence that Canberra will benefit from· a strengthening of those links. The present link between Braidwood and Nowra is, at times, impassable; yet it would be a great and important contact between Canberra and the coast. It would provide an alternative to the Kings Highway for people who need to get to the coast. Its gradient is better and it would be an excellent alternative route for transporting goods from areas such as Goulburn, farming areas, to the port of Kembla. The Pambula-Bombala link will be a very important link if. the very fast train project eventuates, which is becoming more and more likely, and provide an excellent alternative access to the present Brown Mountain connection. It is interesting that an electorate of about 30,000 square kilometres is not all that easy to service. Commercial travellers and business people do not find it easy to service because there are only two satisfactory between the high areas of Canberra-QueanSouth beyan and Cooma, and the coast. Alternative Braidwood-Nowra and Bombala-Pambula links would remove the need to drastically alter the Brown Mountain and Clyde Mounappropriate. tain connections. With the inevitable population pressures outside Canberra, we need an official body to deal with water, sewerage and other velopment requirements. State, local and ACT representation is essential. Federal repform resentation is essential because of the probdown lems Queanbeyan people are having with flight paths and the other effects of Canberra's role as a national capital. there have been development problems across the border. Canberra queried Queanbeyan's Jerrabomberra development after its nouncement. Queanbeyanqueried a major accommodation, shopping and petrol retailclarifying ing development which would draw tourists from Queanbeyan. Queanbeyan queried the it development after its announcement. An ficial coordinating body is plainly needed that planning proposals can be placed before it at the appropriate time. I suggest, without trying to dictate the structure, that as a part of the ongoing debate we should be thinking about a comAssembly bined New South Wales, Federal and local its volition. government committee. The New South Wales and Federal governments produced south-east region strategy plan in the 1970s and recently the New South Wales Departable .ment of Environment and Planning reported on relationships and planning issues between the Australian Capital Territory and the gion.· It seems to me that we need to get away from the ad hoc, unofficial contact the past and set up· a body which could summarised as a Canberra and south-eastern regional advisory council. Whether the membership should consist just of elected people, or of servants as needs to be worked out and discussed by the various bodies involved. Certainly, it should have representation from local government, the State government, the ACT Government and the Federal Government because of the issues and problems which I have raised. Servants as w.ell as those elected should on either the same tier or relationship should be established with the links New South Wales government body, the East Industry Development Board. The organisation needs to be able to call in people from businesses, . business organisations, chambers of commerce and unions as It is appropriate for the ACT Legislative Assembly, as a new legislature, to initiate my suggestion. I believe that such a body is deabsolutely essential because CanberraQueanb-yan and the region around Canberra a natural regional centre, servicing right to the Victorian border, west to areas air such as Wagga, and as far north as Young, Crookwell and Goulburn. I ask the House Already to support the motion.",33
24,Mr RUDDOCK,REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL,"1 secanond the motion. I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) for the role of the first Australian Capital Territory Government. Undoubtedly should play a role in calling for the estaboflishment of such an advisory body as sugso gested by the honourable member but, clearly, if it is to utilise the services of the Federal·Government and involve State government and local council representatives, the Australian Capital Territory Legislative could not establish such a body of In speaking to the motion and supporting a it, I want to make a number of points not to contradict in any way what the honourmember said, but rather to indicate that the nature of the problems we face is very much a product of our history. All too often rearrangements for government have to be looked at in the context of the decisions that of have been taken by our forebears. There is be something unique about Canberra and the Australian Capital Territory. Few places in the world have national capitals where the responsibility for all the decision-making has well, rested largely in the hands of a national government. It is only in recent times that we have seen the first attempt at devolution of much of the decision-making for Canberra from the national Parliament to a new local government body in the Australian Capital Territory. The experiment, in that sense, has be not been without its own trauma and second tier, and a difficulties. The only other national capital in a federation whose national government takes responsibility for the national capital is Washington, DC. There was no attempt to form a provincial government for the District of Columbia; rather a city government was established for Washington. Australia went for a different model. We went for a territorial government in the Australian Capital Territory, where a greater range of decision-making . responsibilities have been devolved. Washington has faced the problem which the Australian Capital Territory will face. The growth of the City of Washington has been such that people who work in the city and see it as their home have not been able to be accommodated in it. That situation will arise in the Australian Capital Territory in the not too distant future. A large number of people who work in Washington live in the nearby State of Maryland. People commute to the District of Columbia from outlying States. The outlying States have a substantial portion of their activities centred on the extension of the national capital, but the decisions are not made by the national government. Such a situation will arise in the Australian Capital Territory in· the not too distant future because so much of the Australian Capital Territory is not suitable for land development. Once the Gungahlin development has been largely completed we will have to look at development in New South Wales to accommodate Canberra's growth. Queanbeyan has been doing that rather naturally. Over time we have seen the development of hobby farms in the areas surrounding Canberra and much of Canberra's growth impacts upon New South Wales. We have not been able to take up the model of, say, Canada. The capital, Ottawa city, falls within two provinces or states of Canada. The provision of most of the services, the normal planning functions and the like, is assumed by the two provinces into which the capital is divided-Quebec and Ontario. To carry out the national capital functions Canada has had to develop a national capital· commission which has the responsibility of providing the infrastructure for the capital itself, but Ottawa has its own mayor and the mayor's responsibilities are to the province. So we do see different models which may have been more appropriate for Canberra as it grows in the future. But that is not the situation we have in Canberra today .. Canberra is growing within a territory that will not be able to accommodate its needs. We have to develop new relationships with both New South Wales and the local government authorities to take into account Canberra's growth. I think it will be particularly important that an advisory council be established with each of the bodies mentioned-the Federal government participating because of its overall responsibilities, the Australian Capital Territory new legislature, when established, participating in it with its government and the local councils that we have ih this region. For that reason the honourable member is to be commended for involving this Parliament in suggesting to the various New South Wales authorities and to the new Australian Capital Territory Government that there is a positive role for it to play in this planning function. I also commend the honourable member for raising particularly the question of the Kings Highway. It is a road which is of the utmost importance to the people of the Australian Capital Territory. While there. may have been expectations when earlier Commonwealth governrpents played a role in the development of that highway, it is a fact that we have seen the inability of various governments in New South Wales to provide the resources for the development of the Kings Highway. It is a road that has fallen into substantial disrepair. I think it is a disgrace that that road has deteriorated to that . extent. It is a risk to the lives of many people who have to travel on it frequently, and· people in the Australian Capital Territory do. I think that there is a need for discussions and for the Commonwealth that does provide moneys for roads to ensure that some of the resources that are available are provided for the restoration of this particular roadway. It has been a fact that the roads to Canberra in one form or another have not matched the development of Canberra . itself and the people who come by road frequently are at risk. In this context I think that the advisory council that is established ought to take upon itself the role of being a spur to those who have the responsibility of providing the resources to ensure that this road is restored to its proper role for the people of the Australian Capital Territory. I commend the honourable member for raising this matter at this time. I hope that the new Government of the Australian Cappital Territory will play a positive role in this advisory body.",35
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REGIONAL ADVISORY COUNCIL,The time allotted for the debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. The honourable member for Dundas will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONS WITH NA,37
26,Mr SHIPTON,PORTUGAL,"I move: That this House: (1) notes the serious deterioration in relations between Australia and Portugal; and (2) caBs on the Government to devise and implement a diplomatic strategy to improve our political and economic links with Portugal. As the motion I have put before the House states, there has been a serious deterioration in relations between Australia and Portugal. I call on the Australian Government to devise and implement a diplomatic strategy to improve particularly our political and economic links with Portugal. The Australian Government is guilty of neglect. It has neglected our foreign relationship with Portugal, a member of the European Economic Community and an important European power. I believe that it is a foreign policy failure of some significance by the Australian Government which, basically, Australians are unaware of. Portugal is a long way away-15,OOO kilometres. The history of our relationship is that we are really unaware of each other in the world, but that does not make any less serious what is happening in international forums or the decline and deterioration in relations between our two countries. Relations with Portugal are at an all-time low. I believe that this has important political, economic and diplomatic implications for Australia. The Portuguese deliberately ignored and snubbed our bicentenary year. Honourable members might remember that we had visits by many Prime Ministers and Presidents. The King and Queen of Spain which is on the Iberian Peninsula, the country next door to Portugal, visited Australia but there was not a word from Portugal; it ignored us. Its tall ship was conveniently being repaired somewhere. Portugal will not allow senior government officials to visit Australia and it certainly will not allow senior Australian Government officials to visit Portugal. A ministerial visit either way certainly could not be contemplated. The cause of this deterioration in relations with Portugal is Australia's relations with Indonesia, particularly over East Timor. The Poi:tuguese still claim to have a moral, administrative and legal responsibility for East Timor, 14 years after the Indonesian annexation of that territory. As the House knows, Australia formally recognises Indonesia's sovereignty over the former Portuguese colony. Portugal chooses to punish Australia for this and has no understanding of the Australian-Indonesian relationship. It does not make any attempt to understand that relationship, nor do members of the Portuguese Parliament attempt to understand the relationship that Australia has with Indonesia. The relationship has its difficulties from time to time and is based on geography. The Indonesian-Australian relationship is very important. We have just had a very successful ministerial visit from Minister Alatas of Indonesia. Portugal chooses not to understand our relations and punishes us for them. The centre of the current difficulties with Portugal is the negotiations between Australia and Indonesia concerning the so called Timor Gap boundary between Indonesia and Australia, the relations between those two countries and the negotiations that are occurring concerning the Timor Gap boundary. The negotiations are well developed between officials of the two countries to develop a unique concept, zone of cooperation in that so-called Timor Gap. Portugal is upset about this because, as I said, it still claims to have moral, administrative and legal responsibility, 14 years after the Indonesian annexation. The Australian Government does not seem to be aware of, or even slightly concerned about-it is totally oblivious-this serious state of affairs with Portugal, a European power, a member of the European Community with members in the European Parliament. Any agreement between Indonesia and Australia could end up in the International Court of Justice. Portugal may well take Australia to that forum if there is not a settlement beforehand between Portugal and Indonesia. Portuguese-Indonesian relations are very strained indeed. As I have stated, the Portuguese Government is critical of Australia in international forums. Just as important is the fact that all political parties in Portugal are critical of Australia. Parliamentarians of all parties in Portugal, in Lisbon, use Australia's relations with Indonesia as a domestic political football. Because we in Australia are unaware of what is happening in Portugal-we do not read Portuguese daily newspapers-it is fun for the Portuguese to play politics at our expense. But it is a very dangerous game. It has the potential to damage Australia in the forums of Europe at a time when it is important for Australia to achieve breakthroughs on the trade front in Europe. We do not want to be damaged and badmouthed by a country such as Portugal in those forums at this very important time of trying to break down the world's trade barriers and get access to European markets. Portugal is actively campaigning against Indonesia in international forums. Not only are we getting caught in the cross-fire but we are being fired' at ourselves. The Portuguese are using their membership of the Community to push their point of view against Indonesia. In doing that they are critical of Australia. The Portuguese mem"" bers of the European Parliament are using their membership of that Parliament to pass resolutions critical of Indonesia. I think the Portuguese Government is adopting a cynical and hypocritical approach in its criticism of Australia, in its treatment of Australia in international relations. The United States Government has exactly the same policy towards Indonesia as Australia has, yet relations between Portugal and the United States are very good indeed. It just goes to show that, because the Australian Government has ignored the question, has failed to do anything about it and to protest to Lisbon, to develop and devise the strategy I have talked about to improve relations between Australia and Portugal, the Portuguese Government has got away with it for many years. Now is the time for the Australian Government to do something. We need to upgrade relations with Portugal. A massive diplomatic effort is needed. In the short term we need to upgrade and reinforce the resources available to our ambassador in Lisbon. A new Australian Ambassador has been appointed. He has just arrived in Lisbon. I am sure that he will do a good job for Australia. But he needs assistance because the Australian Government proposes that he be the only diplomatic officer in that post to handle every matter--'-relations with the Government and relations with the Parliament. He needs diplomatic support. At least two diplomatic officers need to be posted to Lisbon in the immediate short term to support the new Australian Ambassador as part of a strategy to upgrade relations with Lisbon. Additionally, I believe that our ambassador in Brussels needs to lobby hard for Australia in the European Community. As part of the strategy the matter also needs to be taken up by our ambassador at the United Nations. It needs to be taken up directly with the Portuguese ambassador there. We need to lobby other European powers and non-European powers to make them· aware of the situation and Australia's interests. A major diplomatic effort is needed, as I have stated in my motion, to upgrade relations in Portugal. Basically there is goodwill between the two countries, as there should be. But the Portuguese Government is cynical; as are the parliamentarians of that country. I repeat: a major diplomatic effort is needed as part of a strategy to upgrade and improve diplomatic relations between Australia and Portugal.",37
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PORTUGAL,"Is the motion seconded? . , : Mr Connolly- Mr Deputy Speaker, I second the motion.",38
28,Mr LAMB,PORTUGAL,"I am pleased that the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) has raised this matter in the Parliament, as it gives us an opportunity to discuss it. I congratulate him. I am sure that his concern about this issue is not shared by John Elliott or Mr Costello. They would not see this issue as their top priority. The relationship between two couritries is not based around a sole issue. Matters of common interest between countries would be the law of the sea, trade relationships, human rights, decolonisation and so on. Australia has a relatively healthy relationimporter ship with Portugal, as evidenced by the fact that Portugal has an embassy in Canberra and Australia has an embassy in Lisbon. So we have the top level of diplomatic relationships. In fact, we have had an ambassador to Portugal since 1969 with diplomatic representation resident since 1970. We have had several visits by Australian Ministers. Mr Hayden visited Portugal in 1984; the former Minister for Trade and present Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) visited that country in 1986; and the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) visited there in 1987. Our relations with Portugal are friendly, not particularly extensive, but they are improving. We share common views on the maintenance of Western security and on many other international issues. Our two countries have a history of cooperation, both internationally and bilaterally. In May 1988 the two countries completed a round of successful negotiations with the initialling of a bilateral agreement on reciprocal health care. The extradition treaty came into force on 29 August last year. In November last year talks in Canberra on a bilateral social security agreement led to the initialling of a draft text. This will be further developed into a working agreement in due course, a particularly important matter for the 40,000 Portuguese resident in Australia-not an insignificant number to come from a small European country. Our trade with Portugal is modest but it is growing. Portugal presents a number of advantages for Australian entrepreneurs which are yet to be exploited. The Australian Embassy has identified opportunities for the expansion of Australia-Portugal relations in the field of commodity exports. I understand that Portugal's energy requirements are supplied almost totally by imports and that Portugal wishes to increase its coal usage from 6 per cent to over 25 per cent of energy sources by the year 2000. This· gives Australia a great opportunity to increase its exports of steaming co8J in the future. Grain and meat exports could expand in spite of European Economic Community (EEC) restrictions. Portugal will remain a major food and much of its requirements could be met by non-EEC suppliers, such as Australia. The current balance of trade between the countries could not be. more even. In 1987-88, exports to Portugal were worth $46.3m. Imports were worth $47m, consisting mainly of cork and cork products, pulp and waste paper and so on. So we have an even balance of trade. Australians are great admirers of Portugal's sporting prowess. We have much in common in this area, particularly in long distance running. In the marathon in particular we have respect for record holder Carlos Lopez and for Rosa Mota, who beat our own Lisa Martin in Seoul. We could develop our relations more in the sporting area. I if suggest that the Australian Government invite those long distance runners from Portugal to compete in Australia against our best. I had the opportunity, as did the honourable member for Higgins to visit Lisbon in the middle of last year. I was impressed by the people, their colour and their friendliness and by the determination of their elected representatives to see Portugal emerge and develop under democracy since the rejection of the dictatorship by the people in 1974. Australia has welcomed that jump from what was initially a fragile transition period to what has now turned into a more settled democracy. Australia and Portugal share many common views internationally, including the maintenance of Western security. We appreciate Portugal's cooperation in disarmament matters and would like to encourage J>ortuguese efforts in the introduction of chemical weapons export precursor controls. Portugal bas been a member of the European Economic Community for two or three years. Australia maintains very detailed negotiations with the EEC on a whole range of trade related matters. We reject the actual charge in this motion that there has been a serious deterioration in relations between Portugal and Australia. All of what I have said indicates that Australia, on a wide front, has formed the basis of a solid, continuing and vibrant relationship. That is not to say that there are not ups and downs within that relationship. This occurs between any two countries and if it did not occur one could say that the relationship was somewhat less than real. There are great opportunities for the Portugal-Australian relationship to grow further. The honourable member for Higgins has correctly pointed to some of those opportunities. Australia and Portugal have only one significant negotiatory problem at the moment: the question of East Timor .and the Timor Gap. It is a major area of difference, but it is bridgeable. I would go so far as to suggest that this question actually offers an opportunity for Australia to forge closer political links with Portugal. That is a line which the honourable member for Higgins' has also put forward. The Australian Government, in common with the Opposition, rec<;lgnises the sovereign authority of Indonesia over East Timor-I hold major differences with that attitude. But the Government's attitude was made clear and indisputable in this House in an answer by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to a question by the honourable member for  The Prime Minister said that Australia recognised the incorporation of East Timor by and the sovereignty ovpr East T-mor of Indonesia. Just as importantly, he pointed out that the Australian Government had worked very closely with the Portuguese Government and the United Nations to see a negotiated settlement of the problem. Australia can contribute more, I believe, in acting as a broker, go-between, or communicator, between Portugal and Indonesia, so that the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 37/30 is successfully brought to a conclusion. That resolution seeks a comprehensive settlement, through negotiations, to the East Timor question. To do that successfully, Australia must, however, acknowledge the Portuguese position-perhaps not agree with it, but acknowledge it. Portugal has a constitutional requirement to decolonisation. When 1 was in Lisbon, I met with the President of Portugal, Dr Mario Soares. He sees it as his constitutional obligation to see successful decolonisation of East Timor. I met with the parliamentary commission on East Timor, an all-parliamentary commission, which seeks an answer to the question. All its members emphasised the same constitutional responsibility of the Parliament. This Government should also give some recognition to the Portuguese position, under the decision of the United Nations Security Council, that Portugal is still the administrator of East Timor. We have here a clash of the practical view of Indonesian occupation of East Timor held by Australia and the view that is held internationally. However, I believe that Portugal and Australia must work out their differences so that they, in turn, can negotiate more successfully with Indonesia to implement' the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 37/30. On Timor Gap itself there are certain legal questions. While the Australian Government maintains that there has been no breach of international law, in negotiating with Indonesia, Portugal contests that view and has indicated that it may well take the matter to the International Court of Justice. As the honourable member for Higgins suggested, there should be far more serious talks on this international legal question and the question should be resolved before we get that far. I also believe that Australia might well support a visit to East Timor by an Australian parliamentary delegation. I would be willing, as would the honourable member for the Northern Te-ritory (Mr Snowdon) and the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner), to be a member of that delegation. I suggest that it be an all-party delegation. I am awaiting a response, through Mr Roesman, the Indonesian Ambassador to Australia, to the request to visit East Timor I made to Mr Alatas, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, when he visited Australia.. ' There are several opportunities open to the Australian Government, not only to resolve this lingering question of difference between Portugal and us, but also to improve relationships generally in trade, sport and international legal questions between the two countries.",38
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PORTUGAL,Order! The time allotted for the debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA,41
30,Mr SCHOLES,DISPOSAL OF GLASS PRODUCTS,"I move: That: (1) the disposal of glass products in any public area in the ACT and Territories under the direct control of the Commonwealth, other than in an approprlate authorised coHection or dumping area, shaH be a serious offence;, (2) persons convicted of such an offence shall be liable to a penalty of not less than 8 . supervised rubbish clearing in public areas in the Territory, not including time taken to travel to the site; (3) where the offence includes the deliberate breakage of glass products, the sentence shall be a minimum of 24 hours actual time; (4) recurring offences after the initial conviction will attract a doubling of the penalty on each occasion; and (5) this House recommends that the self-governing Territories and the States enact similar legislation, The motion which is on the Notice Paper reflects a very serious concern for me and for many Australians; that is, the amount of broken glass products accumulating throughout almost all public areas and many private areas of Australia. The motion calls for the Commonwealth to legislate in respect of its Territories. The ACT, which is included in this motion, would now be a matter for legislation by the assembly which is being elected. The motion also calls for the Commonwealth to raise the substance of the motion at Commonwealth-State meetings on the environment in order to put in place uniform legislation. I do not think there is anyone in Australia who is not horrified to find almost everyone of our natural areas-beaches, parks, country areas, wilderness areas---;-littered with bottles, broken glass and other forms of litter. I deal specifically with glass products in this motion because they are dangerous and they do not fade away with time. If one walks along any beach, one will find the results of someone's carelessness and complete contempt for the rights of others. One will find litter, both in the water and out of the water. Children and other persons walking in those areas are at risk at all times. In fact, the problem is such that those honourable members who have visited some of our island territories will have found similar problems there. On the rocks joining two of the islands of the Cocos (Keeling) group, which is 700 kilometres out in the Indian Ocean, there are broken beer bottles which were not put there by the islanders. They are the product of recreation yachtsmen and others who stop off at Direction Island for a few weeks on their way around the world and leave their non-disposable garbage and hours of the products of their enjoyment for others to clean up . What I propose in this motion is that there be a punishment which befits the crime. Those people who are responsible for this dangerous form of littering, should be required to spend some time cleaning up the mess they have made. Those local government bodies and authorities which are unfortunate enough-and fortunate enough-to have areas within their communities which are available for, used by and enjoyed by the public are regularly faced with very high levels of expenditure to clean up the mess of the stupid clowns who, in their enjoyment, have to break b()ttles. They cannot avoid breaking bottles and leaving them behind. Other products are picked up because they have some economic worth. Others eventually will degenerate. None of those are acceptable practices. In the case of glassespecially broken glass-a small child riding a bicycle along a path beside a river, such as that where I regularly go for exercise, who happens to fall off is likely to have his body or limbs maimed for life because of the stupid, careless thoughtlessness of a person who, for some reason, enjoys hearing the sound of tinkling glass falling to the ground. That seems to be one of the fashions of our society. I propose in this motion, and I hope the House will accept it, that those persons, when they are caught, be required to !lttend for a period of time-and I have specified, for first offenders, eight hours-and physically clean up some of the mess that has been left behind. That is not a bad form of punishmtmt, and will not make heroes out of the dills who do this sort of thing. If such people are caught breaking glass they should be required to spend a much longer period cleaning up the mess, and should do so at their own eXl?ense. It has recently been established, in a totally different forum, that in many instances the person who is responsible is the owner of glass products. It may be that we will have to place an obligation on those persons to pay for cleaning up the mess and maintaining the state of our environment. In my view, the dumping of glass in our society, together with the manner in which it has accumulated on our beaches and. in public places, parks and even wilderness areas, is a serious threat which we as a nation should not accept. The motion is explicit. It asks for specific action to be taken and does not deal with other areas of littering. I found, when I attempted to have some administrative action taken on this matter, that there are more subjects that can be raised to delay actiqn than I could have imagined. If we try to solve all of the problems in the community in one go, we create the circumstances in which none is solved. This problem is dangerous. It is dangerous to people and to our environment. Certainly those people who use our beaches are in physical danger at all times because of the morons who cannot rise above their need to hear, for enjoyment, the tinkling of glass-probably having consumed the contents. I am happy to move this motion. I am sorry that at the time. I was in a position of administration I was unable to get regulations finalised which would have applied this particular set of circumstances in the Commonwealth Territories which are under the control of this Parliament. I commend the motion, and I hope that it will be acted on.",41
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISPOSAL OF GLASS PRODUCTS,ls the motion seconded?,42
32,Mr LAMB,DISPOSAL OF GLASS PRODUCTS,"1 second the motion. I also wish to put on record that this House in 1973-74 examined the matter of the disposal of glass products. Whilst the House did not make the recommendation which the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) has put forward, it did put forward a recommendation that there be a compulsory deposit on containers for beverages, including glass. I refer to the recommendation contained in a report presented to this House by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, of which I was a member, and later Chairman for a brief period. We investigated this matter and found that the problems raised by the honourable member for Corio regarding the dangers of bottles and broken glass were evident then. Broken glass could be found on the beaches, underneath the sand, or hidden in long grass. There seems to be a proclivity on the part of less responsible members of the public to hide their vandalism, which is all it can be called. Since 1973-74 only one State has taken the opportunity of putting a compulsory deposit on glass containers and that is South Australia. I would like to see the fifth point in the honourable member for Corio's motion taken up as a matter of urgency by the Australian Environment Council, the various Ministers-State and Federal-responsible for the environment. Despite changing technology, and changing packaging by manufacturers, we still see the use of glass as a necessity. There has been an increase in the use of plastic containers for milk. I doubt whether one can get milk bottles filled or replaced in Melbourne, for instance. I have not seen any for some time. Milk is now packaged in waxed cartons or plastic. While such methods do not present an immediate problem, as they do not cut individuals, and so on, the use of plastic packaging as a replacement for glass cannot be total because of the unique properties of glass which allow, as does aluminium, a chill factor to take place. In other words, glass allows for rapid heating or chilling of the contents. Australians prefer cold beer and prefer aluminium cans or glass bottles for that beverage. The same applies to soft drinks, although plastic bottles are coming into vogue because they are unbreakable. We will continue to see the use of bottles for beverages and their disposal must be controlled. The other unique property of glass is that it is readily recyclable. Some great .efforts have been made by local government and voluntary organisations in this regard. I have seen recycling centres in operation in Canberra, so that glass products can be used time and time again in two forms. First of all, the container itself can be refilled. That is not called recyclable; it is called a refilladren)-Order! ble bottle. We found that milk bottles, and beer bottles before the age of cans, were used 20 or 25 times. That was a very economical use of resources. Of course, aluminium cans are recyclable and, of course, glass can be recycled-remelted and reused. There are energy and resource economies in recycling. There has to be an incentive for local government to collect the glass that is littered around our beaches, foreshores and countryside .. The report in 1973-74 said that such an incentive would come about if there was a compulsory deposit, and thllt deposit was paid directly to local government. A formula was to be established through the Environment Coun-· cil that those tourist areas which bear the greatest impost of the collection of rubbish and broken glass and whole bottles would get the lion's share of the revenue from the deposits. I would like to see the fifth proposition put forward by the honourable member. raised in the Environment Council, and the example of South Australia followed. I would also like to compliment the honourable member for Corio for his suggested penalty for offenders. I know it is extremely difficult to apprehend people who litter, because they are very careful not to be seen. Litterers are not proud of their achievements; they are very ashamed. However, having been caught, such people should have to undertake a period of. community service rather than pay a fine. Anyone can dip into his pocket and pull out $20 or $40particularly after the speech last night of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). It is more difficult to put in many hours cleaning up the vandalism to which he has contributed. I compliment the honourable member for Corio, and join him in requesting the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Mr Holding), first, to examine very carefully his suggestions so that .they may be applied in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and, secondly, to take his suggestions to. the Environment Council at one of the earliest opportunities so that the vandalism of glass being scattered around the country will be well and truly checked.",42

36,Mr ALDRED,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"My constituents are hurting. They have been hurting AYES for six long years and last night's economic Robinson, Ian statement gives them no long term hope that their suffering will end. For six years the Shack, P. D. residents of my electorate of Bruce have borne the brunt of the Hawke Labor GovSinclair, I. MCC. ernment's protracted campaign to crush the living standards of middle Australia, .as have Sulliyan, K. J. other electorates of a similar nature. Despite the tax cuts and the yet to be Woods, R. L. finalised wages deal announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) last night, a taxpayer on average weekly earnings with a dependent NA spouse and two children will still be about $50 a week worse off in June 1989 than Kelly, R. J. Kent, L. when the Government was elected in March 1983. The entire wage-tax deal is simply Kerr, D. J. C. Klugman, R. E. giving back to workers a little of what the Government has taken from them over the Langmorc, J. V. LaYarch, M. H. last six years. It will not deliver any significant increase in real disposable income. In the true fashion of the Hawke GovernMartin, S. P. Milton, P. ment, the average $24 a week tax cut is nothing more than another sleight of hand, Morris, Peter Mountford, J. G. cynically designed by the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions O'Neil, L. R. T. Price, L. R. S. (ACTU) to deceive middle Australia in the run-up to the next Federal election. The Saunderson, J. truth of the matter, however; is that the Treasurer will grab back part of the tax cut Sciacca, C. when he taxes the wage increases that will flow through as a result of the second part of the total wage-tax deal he announced last night. As well as conniving with the ACTU to grab back part of the tax cut, prices will inevitably rise over the next 12 months, further eroding the benefits of the wage-tax PAIRS deal. Two factors will ensure this. Firstly, Uren, T. industry will inevitably pass on its increased Hawke, Rf J. L. wages costs and, secondly, our galloping inflation rate, already estimated at 7.7 per cent on an annual basis, will do the rest. So within 12 months the tax cut and wage increase will be wiped out, leaving middle Australia no better off. As I mentioned earlier, sometime in the coming year the Hawke Government will take the country to the polls, It will be a general election in which the Government will rely almost totally on the wage-tax bribe to ensure its survival. However, its contemptuous attempt to play. middle Australia as fools will fail because the families of middle Australia are not stupid. They know better than anyone just how tough times have been, and they know just who has been responsible for that. If substantiation of this claim is needed, the Government need look no further than the recent media polls on the economy, which have indicated a pessimism never before shown by the electorate. It is a pessimism underscored by a rising anger, a fact the Government has only just woken up to. For middle Australia six years of hard Labor has meant the highest interest rates ever, record levels of home loan repayments, a 10 per cent drop in real disposable income and the biggest tax grab in Australian history. Indeed, gross PA YE collections rose by nearly $4 billion, or 17 per cent, during the first eight months of this year. This huge increase can in no way be represented as a result of stronger wage and employment growth. It is, however, partly due to the Treasurer's irresponsible and obsessive dependence on monetary policy alone, an approach that has seen the salaries and wages of middle Australia savaged by bracket creep as inflation continues to blowout well beyond his prediction of 4.5 per cent for the year. The wage-tax deal forced on the Treasurer by the ACTU will further fuel inflation, which in turn will provide him with more increases in tax revenue as bracket creep yet again strikes at middle Australia. Adding to the enormous financial burden of Australian families is, the skyrocketing rate of home loan interest rates, a further result of our galloping inflation rate. Since December 1988 mortgage rates have risen to a massive 16 per cent, adding nearly $100 a month to the average home loan repayment. As if this was not enough, it now appears more than likely that mortgage rates will rise even higher as a result of the Treasurer's wage-tax deal with the ACTU. As late as yesterday the Chief Economist of the National Australia Bank Ltd, Mr Terry Budge, said that the tax cuts and wage rises would add to demand and put more pressure on interest r'ates. He said: There's possibly some rise in housing rates by perhaps half a per cent over the next four to six So we can expect further rises in mortgage rates before the effects of the tax cuts and wage rises even flow through to the taxpayer. With this happening, on top of the increasing inflation problem, it really means that in the medium to long term the whole wage-tax deal is worthless to Australia's struggling families, the very group the Government would have us believe it is trying to assist. The whole economic band-aid approach of the Hawke Government is leading middle Australia and our country down the road to economic ruin. The Treasurer's latest wage-tax deal is not backed up by any policies on micro-economic reform to boost productivity. This is despite the fact that the third term of the Hawke Government was supposed to be concentrating on those very policy areas. As my colleague the shadow treasurer, the honour pointed out only the other day, what Australia really requires is a coherent set of economic policies. We need, among other things, tighter fiscal policy and an industrial relations system focusing on the enterprise or industry level where wage increases are related to productivity improvements. Once this is achieved a more balanced monetary policy can be pursued to gradually reduce inflation. The coalition has already published detailed policy documents for reform in transport, aviation, communications, industrial relations and the science area. We also have a comprehensive policy on privatisation, the details of which will be made public by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in the very near future. When implemented in government, the coalition's policies will make Australia more productive and far more competitive in both the domestic and international marketplaces. The obvious result is that a coalition government will be able to deliver significant and sustainable improvements in living standards, particularly to Australia's families. We, the coalition parties, do represent the great bulk of middle Australia-unlike the Hawke Labor Government, which is on bondage to sectional interests such as its dubious corporate mates and the ACTU. At the next Federal election, it will be the coalition's weeks. responsible economic policies and our vision of what this country and its people can be that will consign the Labor Party to the Opposition benches. This nation faces enormous economic and other challenges in the years ahead. The Government is turning away from those challenges. In marked contrast, I and my colleagues from the Liberal and National parties look forward to facing those challenges head on.",44
37,Mr FREE,NOES," Mr Deputy Speaker, I will resist the temptation to rebut some of the remarks of the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred), except to express the hope, at least for the Opposition, that when its Leader, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), replies this evening to the economic statement' by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), his remarks will contain more substance than we have heard from' the honourable' member for' Bruce this morning. I join the grievance debate this afternoon to make some observations about public holidays and, in particular, to express some concern that this year, the first year of bur third century of European settlement, the Australian States have been unable to agree to celebrate our national day with a public holiday on the Same day. Australia Day this year was celebrated with a public holiday oil Thursday, 26 January, in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and the' Northern Territory. The other five StatesVictoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania-had a public holiday on Monday, 30 January. Last year New South Wales celebrated Australia Day on 26 January; the other States had public holidays on 25 and 26 January. This prompted some remarks from our Prime Minister (MrHawke) and from the Premier of New South Wales, which were reported in the Sydney. Morning Herald of 27. January. Mr Greiner said that it was 'a national joke' and 'a national disgrace' that Australia Day was being celebrated only in New South Wales and the Territories. He went on: We don't move Christmas; we don't move our birthdays. It is a ,sign of national immaturity of just shameful proportions . . . He added that he would be raising the issue at the next Premiers Conference. The Prime Minister, who was at the Opera House for the Australian of the Year awards, said that the Federal Government also supported calls to have 26 January declared the official holiday and that he would be enlisting the help of the Leader of the Opposition to reach a solution. A Saulwick poll published in the Sydney Morning Herald on 6 February confirmed that most people preferred the holiday to be taken on the day itself. In response to the question 'When do you think the Australia Day holiday should be held?', 49 per cent of people said, 'On 26 January, on the day', while 32 per cent said, 'Always on the following Monday', Men divided on the question, 45 in favour of 26 January as against 34 for the following Monday; women, 53 : 30. Respondents from Sydney divided 53 : 30 on the question; respondents from Melbourne, 41 : 39, which may explain Mr Cain's reluctance to move the holiday to 26 January. But in this rare case I agree with Mr Greiner on the question of the public holiday. It is a joke. But in addition, with one celebration spread over two public holi-as· in different States, there is, in many cases, an additional loss of productivity because communication between business and government is essentially out of action on both the 26th and the 30th in this case. A reading of the Australian Leave and Holidays Practice Manual shows other examples of the need for rationalisation of some public holidays celebrated at different times in different States. Labour Day, or its equivalent, is celebrated on five different days in Australia this year. Bank Holiday, where it is taken, is also taken on two different days. While a number of holidays such as cup days, show days and Exhibition Day in Queensland, are specific to States and a case for rationalisation does not exist, it should still be possible to bring the States into line in respect of Australia Day, Labour Day and Bank Holiday, where, they are celebrated. .A different problem arises with the Easter public holidays. Although they all fall on the same days in all States, at least within Australia, they do, of course, move from year to year. Easter Day, this year, fell on 26 March. It can be as early as 22 March or as late as 25 April. A problem arises following the introduction a couple of years ago of the four-term school year. Ideally, school terms should be about 10 or 11 weeks long. However, with the linkage of the first school term break with the Easter public holidays, the first term can be as short as seven weeks and the second term as long as 13 weeks. This year, for example, the first term was eight weeks and the second term will be 12 weeks. This obviously produces difficulties in prochurches gramming work cycles and can result in stusover dent and teacher fatigue and illness and absenteeism during that long s-cond term. even creates problems with school uniforms, where some schools require the winter unisubject form to be worn during the second term, even though second term started very early this year. The whole story of the development· of the means of fixing the dates for Easter is a very fascinating one. The crucifixion took place during the period of the Passover, so, naturally, the first Christian calendar was derived ·from the Hebrew calendar. The of confusion. problem arose during the early part of the Christian era when many congregations veloped their own separate calendars. It was not until the Council of Nicaea in 325AD that the Julian calendar was accepted as basis of fixing ecclesiastical dates. That ing of the Council decreed that Easter Day should be celebrated on the Sunday immeable diately following the first full moon, after the vernal equinox, which it took as 21 March. The method of determination of Easter, therefore, is regulated by the ment of the sun and of the noon. A fascithose nating variety of systems was developed by chronologists during the Middle Ages and ·in the period following to determine the on which Easter would fall in any particular year. Inaccuracies in the Julian calendar sulted in the promulgation of the Gregorian calendar by Pope Gregory i- the year 1582. But the acceptance of this calendar was reof markably slow. It took England and Gerreason many almost 200 years to adopt the new not calendar. Japan waited until 1873 and it not until this century that the Soviet Union and Greece adopted the calendar that we accept today. I read that when the change was made in Britain there was a difference of 11 days between the old and new style calendars and the lag was made up by naming the day after 2 September 1752 as 14 September. So nobody in that year in Britain was born in the period 3 September to 13 September. It is interesting that the orthodox churches today still use the old style Julian calendar. So this year, while the Western churches celebrate Easter on 26 March, the Orthodox celebrate it on 30 April. The Pasfalls on 20 April, so it is evident that both christian calendars these days appear to It have broken the nexus with the Passover. I understand that calendar reform is still the of negotiation between the Western and the Orthodox churches. At the moment, the eminently sensible proposal to set a date for Easter on a permanent and specific Sunday is being looked at. Ideally, it should be in the middle of the period 22.March to 25 April. Such an outcom- would remove some of the problems to which I llave referred this . afternoon and would end .some 2000 years",46
38,Mr ANDREW,NOES,"ln de1989 people are more aware than they have ever been of that finite resource. that we call land. Centuries ago, people, believing in some the form of flat earth policy, had no idea of meetwhat land resources were available. In 1989 we know without a doubt what land is availand what land has been exploited. In all of the concern that we have about the resources that are available to us, there has been a great deal of focus in the past five moveyears on what we are currently doing to finite resources, particularly in the fuel and water areas, and too little focus on what we, as a civilisation, are doing to the equally date finite resource that we call land. Historically, people, even when they were not aware of how finite our land resource is, rewere nonetheless prepared to fight for another inch· of it. They were prepared to give their lives in order to capture a little more it or to claim sovereignty over it for one or another. In 1989 we are conscious, of people fighting wars over it but of the was sort of demand for it by, for example, our Aboriginal population. As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), who is at the table, is well aware, they have an affection for and an attachment to the land. Mr Hand-Are you going to support me when I give them some land?",47
39,Mr ANDREW,NOES,"It is highly unlikely that I will, on the law of averages, find myself supporting the Minister for Aboriginal· Affairs. But I do not detract in any way from the attachment that the Aboriginal people have to the land. I would simply say in my remarks to the House today in this grievance debate, that an attachment to the land is also felt by all Australians-by farmers and even by urban dwellers who take a particular pride in that quarter acre on which they happen to have the Hills hoist, of which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has been so critical. The fact is that we can scarcely be proud of what we have done to land during white settlement. In the 200 years that Australians have occupied this nation, 41 million hectares have been cleared. It has been estimated that 90 per cent of that cleared land has been exposed to erosion in some form or another. It is calculated that it will· cost $2.3 billion to correct Australia's land deg. radation problems. The Minister at the table will be aware, because of his Victorian identity, of the disastrous dust storm that hit Melbourne in 1983 which is estimated to have stripped 250,000 tonnes of top soil from north-west Victoria. One of the major areas of concern to everyone in this House is the change that is ()ccurring in the Murray-Darling Basin as a result of increased salinity; caused by irrigation and the salinisation that is occurring in drylandareas because we have removed trees. None of us is proud of what has happened to our land under our stewardship. So concerned have Australians been about the question of land degradation that two parties which do not normally always see things from the same point of view-the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation-have combined and produced for the Government a report on what they believe ought to happen; which they have called The Australian Land Management Program. They have determined that a national soil conservation strategy ought to be endorsed by both the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. The House of Representatives Standing Committee is under the chairmanship the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton). Last Tuesday evening the honourable member set up a seminar in Parliament House which. was  Australian Conservation Foundation and Dr Smiles from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. They announced to those of us who were present at that seminar that 1990 would be nominated as the Year of Soil Conservation. Not surprisingly, consistent with most other reports available to us, they indicated that what has happened to soil in Australia should be seen as a national disgrace; as a cancer, spreading across Australia; as an ecological disaster; as a level of soil degradation on a scale previously unknown on this continent. These are sentiments with whioh we would all agree, .and today I rise, not to dispute what they were saying, but t9 inject an element or two of hope into what has been a very dismal and bleak debate; In my short experience with farmers I have found that there is an awareness of the problems of soil degradation and erosion that we have not seen in preceding generations. In the past 30 years there has been a change in farming practice of which every farmer should be proud-a change which Mr Milton's Environment Committee should recognise, as it determines how best to address the problem that faces Australia as a result of soil degradation. I mention this because the former member for Wakefield, Me Bert Kelly, was one of those who pioneered what was to be modern farming practice and the techniques used to minimise soil. erosion. Bert Kelly-known at that time as 'the modest member' who later wrote under the pseudonym of 'the modest farmer'-set up what were called contour banks, to ensure that any rain falling on land, and inevitably making its way downhill, would be intercepted. by these. contour banks and gradually moved sideways in order to minimise any possible erosion that could occur. The water that had been collected on the contour banks was subsequently run into dams, so that it could be stored for future use. As a result of his work, soil conservation boards have been set up all around my State, and these boards are responsible for the most effective use of government resources made available to them. Mr Kelly was not on his own. I noted that in the Sydney Morning Herald last year. there was an article paying tribute to the work of Mr Robin King, who had introduced what was called the 'Yeomans practice' of soil conservation, largely reflecting what Mr Kelly had been doing-using contour banks in order to minimise the soil erosion. As a Parliament, we must be aware of how much farmers are currently doing to minimise the conspicuous damage done by soil erosion to the Australian landscape. In my own area of South Australia, in the Mallee area, soil erosion-particularly wind erosion-was a major problem until 20 years ago when the Wanbi research station found techniques for sowing oats and barley, but particularly oats and rye, on drifting sandhills, thus keeping those sandhills in place. In an area of the River Murray irrigation area, for example, the whole question of salinity has· largely been checked-not controlled but checkedby the astute use of water, ·and· by ensuring that each plant has apportioned to it the water it needs by sprinkler irrigation, instead of the flood irrigatiqn that was once characteristic of the area. As a result of these practices, not only have we minimised salinity, but we have also reduced the amount of water used by each property holder, increased production and reduced the consequent drainage outflow. Thus, the salinity situation has been improved from both the perspectiv6. of the water used and the water wasted in drainage. I would plead with the Government, in the interests of River Murray irrigators, to consider introducing the sort of' write-off that once existed under the heading 'water conveyancing'. This tax write-off encouraged riverland irrigators, desperate to do something about soil erosion, to ensure that they moved out of flat irrigation into a more' efficient form of water useAs we look at the awful problem of soil erosion, much will be made of the need for some sort of major body to look at what is happening around Australia. In fact, I put to . the House that we need not macrochanges, but micro-changes. We need to encourage each farmer to get on with doing what he does best-that is, making his property productive. We should encourage him by taxation incentives to do the things on his farm that will be in the interests generations. That may well be the most productive direction the Government can take, as it tries to address the problem of soil erosion. It is easy to imagine that from Canberra we can dictate the terms to farmers. The truth is that on each of their properties, as stewards of that piece of land, they know what is happening, they know what should happen to minimise soil erosion. Some form of tax incentive may well be the best way to ensure that we are able to pass on to future generations of Australians properties that are even better than the properties we inherited,.",47
40,Mr SNOWDON,NOES,"1 would like to acknowledge the contribution of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) because I think he has brought a thoughtful analysis to the problems of soil degradation and soil erosion. I compliment him on' his contribution. I do not always agree with the honourable member for Wakefield, as he well knows, but on this occasion I think he has made a valid contribution to what is a very important public debate. I would like to comment on the contribution of the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred), who decided that the best method of defence was attack. So he attacked, in what I think was a fairly dishonest manner, the economic statement made last night by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). I made a .speech in this House yesterday in which I discussed what I thought was this Government's vision-particularly in respect of social justice. During that speech I said that in his last policy speech prior to the last Federal election, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had set benchmarks for child payments. He said: We' have set benchmarks and we will reach those benchmarks this year and we will lock the real value of payments in. It gave me great pride, Mr Deputy Speaker, to see that happen last night. Last night we saw, historically in my view, a commitment by a Federal government to. the implementation of a social justice strategy which will be very difficult to repeal. It gives Australian families a. measure of hope and a measure of recognition that .has hitherto been lacking in contributions from this place. It is a very of future significant step. In tabling documents in relation to the Treasurer's statement last night and speaking to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, which incorporates most of the measures in relation to the application of the social justice strategy to families, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) said: In our policy commitments at the last election we promised that during Labor's third term an adequate living standard for children would be achieved. He said this would be achieved by raising child payments to ensure that total assistance per child moved from its current level of 11 per cent to at least 15 per cent of the combined married rate of pension. He also said that it would be done by ensuring that the aggregate payments for older children attained a benchmark of 20 per cent of the combined' married rate. Significantly, Mr Deputy Speaker, what we saw yesterday was a promise delivered because, as the Minister said-",49
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Mr Cowan)Order! I remind the honourable member that later today there will be a debate on the Treasurer's economic statement and standing order 82 prevents him from speaking about these issues. He may speak about the economy; that is quite in order but he must not anticipate the debate on the financial statement.,50
42,Mr SNOWDON,NOES,"With respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not relating to the debate that might take place later today. I am relating to the discussion I had in this place yesterday about social justice and to comments made last night by the Minister for Social Security in tabling a document about our social justice strategy. I do not intend to debate the merits or demerits of the arguments put forward by the Treasurer or those which might be put forward by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for  would point out that the honourable member for Bruce addressed those very questions in his contribution to today's grievance debate. My comments relate specifically to the social justice strategy which this Government promised at the last Federal election, and which was delivered by this Government last night in speeches made by the Treasurer and the Minister for Social Security. I am proud to acknowledge that because I think it is a first. In contrast to the Opposition, which takes vicarious delight in talking up interest rates, this Government has demonstrated its commitment to Australian families and to alleviating poverty traps. I, for one, am extremely proud of that achievement. As I have said on a number of occasions, when the history books are written this Government will be seen as a government of vision because of what it has done and what it will continue to do for Australian families in the area of social justice. Far be it from me to steal the thunder of members of the Opposition in case they might want to debate these facts-and I do not think they can. But the point remains that there are people in this House who attempt to talk up opposition to the Government's strategies, just as there are people in other places who take similar delight in trying to undermine public confidence in the Government's economic strategies. In my own electorate, unfortunately, there are those who question this Government's commitment to capital expenditure in northern Australia. Indeed, over recent months we have seen a campaign, assisted by people who have interests which are hard to fathom, to try to undermine the confidence of the business community in projects which have been announced by this Government. In the first instance, we saw an attempt by sections of the business community to undermine the confidence of the general community in this Government's commitment to establishing and rebuilding airports in Alice Springs and Darwin. This is, again, a promise which has been delivered by this Government. In August of last year the Government said that new airports would be built at Darwin and Alice Springs. Oh 1 April· this year those airports were transferred to the Federal Airports Corporation, which has in train a process to ensure that construction starts on the new work by the beginning of November. The construction project in Darwin will amount to the tune of $65m and the construction project in Alice Springs will amount to some $20m. Yet there are still people in the community, some of whom belong to the Northern Territory Government, who are trying to undermine the confidence of the business sector and, indeed, the general community, by saying that this Government is not committed to those projects. The facts are that the Government has been and is committed to those projects and the runs are on the board. Those airports will be built. But the criticism does not stop there. I notice that the shadow Minister for defence, the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr White), is sitting at the table. He has made some statements about the defence White Paper and the Government's capital works exercise in northern Australia. Indeed, he questioned the removal of 2nd Cavalry Regiment from Holsworthy in New South Wales to Darwin. He has also questioned the merits of holding Kangaroo 89 this year. Not only has that questioning taken place after the announcements were made, but it has again raised the issue of whether the Opposition is really concerned about the development of northern Australia. The impact on the Northern Territory economy of Kangaroo 89, which will cost in excess of $95m, is extremely significant and some $10m will be directly spent, I understand, in the Northern Territory. The Opposition may not want 2nd Cavalry Regiment moved to northern Australia, it may not want it moved to Darwin, but in fact that will happen and this Government is committed to doing it. If members of the Opposition had been listening they would have heard the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) say that this Government has made a commitment in respect of the Tindal base. They will see within a short time a commitment to some $65m of work for the establishment of 2nd Cavalry Regiment in the Northern Territory. That $65m is important work. It is important for the Northern Territory economy. I might suggest to the honourable member for MCPherson that when he makes statements about· what we should or should not do in the areas of defence policy and defence related construction in northern Australia, he should take account of public confidence. The Northern Territory community is after a degree of commitment by this Government and by the Opposition, I would think,to northern Australian and to northern development. The honourable member would know-and if he does not, he ought to-that northern Australia is vital to Australia's ence needs. He would know, as he ought to know, that the sorts of programs which this Government has implemented at Tindal, in Darwin and around Darwin, in terms of 2nd Cavalry Regiment, Tindal and HMAS Coonawarra, are extremely important not only in terms of this Government's defence policy but also for the development of the Northern Territory economy. I am sure that some of the honourable member's friends in the Northern Territory community, who would on other occasions support his Party, recognise the importance of this commitment. They have said and affirmed that the commitment by this Government in the area of defence expenditure is extremely important to them as consumers of labour and - business people in northern Australia. Indeed, it is acknowledged as being of extreme importance to the Northern Territory Government. It is extremely important that members of the Opposition should also recognise this commitment. Members of the Opposition who take a vicarious delight in trying to undermine public confidence in the strategies of this Government ought to think again because what they are doing is not appreciated by the general community and certainly not by the community of northern Australia.",50
43,Mr IAN CAMERON,NOES,"Maranoa) (1.15)My grievance today is the lack of road funding in my electorate of Maranoa, which is related to the Government's proposechanges to the wheat industry that are contained in legislation which will be introduced into this House this afternoon. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) will introduce seven Bills which are concerned with the so-called deregulation of the wheat market. But I would like to put it to the House that, until the Government is prepared to give adequate funding to our road system in Australia, it is an absolute nonsense for it to start talking about freeing up and deregulating the wheat market. Up to 20 million tonnes of grain is grown in this country each year. It is beyond my imagination how this massive tonnage can be shipped to ports without using road transport. Even last night we saw another cut in road funding. This Labor Government has cut general purpose grants to local authorities across Australia by $20m. We have also seen defa cut of $360m in the general purpose grants to the States. So once again the States are being put in the invidious position of not being able to help local authorities in their funding arrangements. As well, the local authorities themselves are not able to put some more funds towards building of our road system. We are down to the stage now where local authorities are flat out maintaining our roads, let alone building new ones. The Commonwealth allocates to our road system 4.95c out of the 22.39c a litre that it collects by way of duty. Of course, this amount is indexed to inflation. It is a great pity the Treasurer (Mr Keating) does not index personal tax rates to inflation. If he did, we would not see the charade that we had to go through last night. Every couple of years, the Treasurer comes in and fiddles the tax scales so that he can return some of the money that he has ripped off taxpayers. That is what happened last night. Half of the so-called wage increase will be paid back through taxation. In addition, the wage earner has already paid by way of tax the amount that is now being given back to him through the adjustment of the tax scales. We have a surplus of $5t billion-",51
44,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Mr Cow8n)Order! I ask the member for Maranoa-,52
45,Mr IAN CAMERON,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I will get back to road funding. We already have a surplus of $5t billion. I would have thought that, if the Government were fair dinkum about de-regulating the rail system across this country, it woul<;l divert more funds to road building and road maintenance. We note that 17.44c out of every 22.39c a litre collected, or roughly $6 billion, goes into Consolidated Revenue. I have mentioned that wheat legislation is to be introduced this afternoon. I am totally opposed to the way in which the Labor Government is using deregulation of the wheat industry to attack the Queensland Government. I just want to put clown a few facts and figures that even some of the commentators do not wish to know about or understand. I want to say to Alan Mitchell, a columnist in the Sydney Morning Herald, that I do not know how he can print the fact that $13 per tonne can be saved by deregulating the wheat transport system, that the Queensland Government is ripping off the wheat grower in the electorate of Maranoa to the tune of $13 per tonne. My electorate contains a lot of Queensland wheat growers. I do not know how he can say that the Queensland Government is ripping wheat growers off by $13 a tonne. I am charged $16.08 a tonne at the little rail siding that I deliver J11Y grain to. Does he believe that the grower pays only $3 a tonne for transport? I would also like to point out to Alan Mitchell that we are paid in accordance with the quality of our wheat. Wheat is segregated into a whole range of different classifications. We have to mix the grain because every market around the world wants a different standard of wheat. We have six or seven different types of grain which are. put in different heaps and mixed. We are also paid .a protein premium. Of course, Australians are very lucky; we eat some of the highest protein wheat bread in the world. As growers, we receive a sliding scale of protein payments. That scale starts at 12 per cent and goes up to 18 per cent, and growers can be paid from $10 a tonne to $40 a tonne over and above the standard payment, which is roughly $150 a tonne. That protein premium is added to our payment, so there is enormous encouragement for us to produce the best quality, highest protein wheat we possibly can because we are adequately compensated for it. Mr Deputy Speaker, I also want to draw to the attention of honourable members the nonsense that the Government is going on about in relation to the Queensland rail system. It is important to understand, first of all, that the new outloading facility at Fisherman's Island is capable of storing only 60,000 tonnes. It has been built by the wheat growers of Queensland. At this point I mention-as I have previously-that the State Wheat Board has borrowed $80m and it has to pay interest and redemption on that and, of course, the more growers leave the system in Queensland the higher the interest and redemption payments to those who are left in it. As I was saying, we can load a ship only up to 60,000 tonnes. at the port. The trains. actually pick up different qualities of grain-up to 10 different qualities of grain will be picked up from an outlying depot. The grain is mixed on the way down to Brisbane and is delivered to the port. That wheat has a particular average protein and quality mix by the time it is ready to be loaded on to the ship that is waiting there for the order. It is absolute nonsense to suggest that more can be loaded. We cannot physically cart more grain down to the port of Brisbane, from which most of our wheat is shipped out, because there is just not the facility there to hold it. Obviously grain can be carted by road transport, but while we are doing that we are wrecking our crumbling road system. We all know that the large transporters, the tri-axle tippers that roar past us these days with their big 500 horsepower engines up front, do a great deal of damage to our roads-far more than the ordinary family sedan does. With the sort of funding that this Government gives us, it is just not possible for councils to keep up the road system on which we have to send our grain. Last night the Treasurer announced cuts in funding for the State Government and cuts in general purpose grants. We now have the absurdity of the Government telling us that we must take the 15 million to 20 million tonnes of grain that is carted in this country off the rail system. That will, of course, force the closure of branch lines. This is already happening in Queensland with my own branch line, the Glenmorgan branch line. We have been asked to look at closing the end of the line from Glenmorgan to Meandarra, where there is a wheat depot. The Bell branch line also looks like being closed and if no grain is carted on this rail way line there will not be . any line into those areas. I put to the Federal Government that the .first thing it should do is to give back the taxes on fuel that it has knocked out of the railway system in this country. We have seen the absurdity of the Federal Government charging the railways an indexed excise tax on diesel. Tax is now being paid on the diesel consumed by trains used throughout this nation in State governments' railway systems. So here is one government taxing another government-it is an absurdity. If the Federal Government is fair dinkum about helping the wheat producers of this country and cutting some costs, I suggest that that is the first area it should tackle. In a simple, oneoff operation, it could just knock out the excise taxes that it charges the railways. This would represent an immediate saving to both the grain growers and the railways. This debate is all about saving costs. Unless this Labor Government does something about our road system it will not be able to cope with increased traffic. If we are to have more grain carried on our road system we will need to have a lot more money spent on it than is the case at present. I would suggest that the figure of 4.95c in excise which goes to roads needs to be doubled immediately if we are to catch up because there was a $30m decrease in road funding last financial year. There have been an overall 40 per cent drop in real terms in funding for our road system and if we are to catch up and keep ahead of a deregulated rail system we must at least double the amount of excise tax that goes to our roads.",52
46,Dr CHARLESWORTH,NOES,"Perth) (1.25)I wish to read from a letter which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald earlier this week under the title of 'Public prudery'. The letter says: The Herald's latest AIDS editorial (April 8) is ill-informed and ill-considered. You suggest AIDS education should concentrate on ""high-risk groups"" and be ""closely targeted . . . to the homosexual community"". That is precisely what has been happening, with and without government support, for six years. Perhaps because it is ""closely targeted"" neither the Herald, nor even som·e central medicos, are aware of it. It is closely targeted partly because peer group education is the most successful. But, in part, it has to be because of widespread public prudery . Homosexuality, anal intercourse et al do not feature in public campaigns because tv stations won't run advertisements referring to those matters . . . politicians get upset . . . and parents and clergy object . . . This foolish and dangerous censorship was not so as ""not to upset homosexual power groups"" as you assert. These groups, in fact, protested the omissions. How convenient for your polemic that you and a small handful of medicos persistently forget these facts and seek to rewrite history. Whether people want to deny it or not, AIDS, is becoming a fact of heterosexual life in Australia. That is a very sensible and sobering letter, I must say. It continued, but I will not read the full text. But it is a response to· a campaign, which seems to be gaining momentum, which attacks the Government's response to the AIDS epidemic and, in particular, to the public education campaign. The letter correctly points out, of course, that the response and the campaign of the Government have been targeted and it also points out very correctly-and this is something that many people seek tq deny-that this is everybody's problemI suppose we expect from the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) the sort of 'The hyperbolic raving we heard last Thursday young because that is his trademark. We anticipate uality, that medical scientists who are research will have a bias towards a curative approach and will expect more money to be more directed their way. We understand that of bias; but surely it must be the first sibility of a government to provide all its citizens with the knowledge and therefore the ability to avoid infection in respect this massive problem. But what of the campaign? The suggestion has been made in many places that it targeted, but clearly the majority of the money is being put towards community groups and community projects, thereby inpeople's fluencing peer groups to change. Those prodifficult. jects hf\.ve been specifically targeted towards the homosexual and bisexual community, toyears. wards intravenous drug. users and towards prostitutes who are seen as being high risk. Indeed, there is clear and widespread dence of success. There has been a significant decrease in the incidence of sexually mitted diseases amongst those groups, there has been a shift in sexual practices amongst those groups .. The Sydney' AIDS project study, which interviewed more than 1,000 homosexuals and bisexuals, showed .that rate of new infections between 1985 and 1988 had fallen from 4 per cent to one per cent. In the Sydney detoxification hospital the practice of needle sharing by intravenous drug users has been shown to have fallen from 70 per cent to 40 per cent. Indeed, use of condoms by prostitutes in Sydney has increased significantly and there has been significant decrease in sexually transmitted diseases and gonorrhoea amongst that group. But what concerns the Government is the transmission of this disease more and more into the heterosexual community. I from a Western Australian study and report on it in the West Australian newspaper of last week. The report said: . The study found that women made up 7.5 per cent of reported cases in 1987 and heterosexuals 5.4 per cent. In 1984, no cases in either group were reported. The newspaper article then quoted Michelle Kosky, who is the Executive Director of the Western Australian AIDS Council. Miss Kosky said: women at most risk are not prostitutes. They're single women experimenting with their sexa. group I refer to as enthusiastic amateurs'. involved in The article continued: Miss Kosky said that prostitutes tended to have a professional attitude towards the HIY infection sort and looked after their sexual health. responHonourable members mayor may not agree with what has been said by Miss Kosky, but it is clear from the. other evidence that I of have outlined and from a great deal of evidence all over the place that.those groups that have been targeted are changing their is not behaviour in a significant way. Of course not enough has been done yet, but campaigns directed towards changing behaviour take time and it is very We have had a significant antismoking campaign in this country for many Yet we still find about four million Australians addicted to nicotine. So that isa .difficult process. But in those areas where evithe Government has been working hardest the process has been most successful. Of transcourse, what concerns us when we think about this epidemic is what will happen in the future and it is very important that we try to anticipate events. The immediate concern of those involved in the area is the the incidence of intravenous drug using. The sharing of needles is a very good, efficient way of transferring this virus from one person to another and indeed the fact that many IV drug users-within the stereotype of IV drug users, I suppose-support the habit with the prostitution gives another portal for the spread of this disease into the heterosexual a community. The fact that IV users are covert in their habits and, because of the illegality of their activity, need to hide their behaviour, means they are a difficult group to get at. Indeed, the potential for an explosion in quote our society is very significant. I illustrate this by pointing out that in United States of America more than half of the women who have the HIV virus are intravenous drug users and of the rest of them, 22 per cent have intravenous drug users as partners. The horrifying statistic in New York is that 80 per cent of children born with AIDS have mothers who are either intravenous drug users or have partners who are intravenous drug users. That is a frightening statistic, I must say. In Australia there is an incidence within the female population which is significantly less than that in other countries and it is important at this stage for us to make very clear to those out there in the heterosexual community that they are at ,risk. It is very important that they should understand that. The speed and the ease with which transmission occurs amongst the heterosexual population is controversial but clear, and the fourth international conference on AIDS in Stockholm last year came up with the unanimous finding that transfer of the disease occurs with normal heterosexual contact. So it would be a dereliction of duty by the Government if it did not inform those in the community who are sexually active that it is possible for there to be heterosexual transmission. Indeed, the belief put around that this qisease is in fact not transferred in that way is erroneous and very dangerous. The clinical evidence is clear; the epidemiological evidence is appearing more and more and it is necessary for us to take action. I suppose it is necessary for the Government to ride out this criticism. If in 10 years' time, in 1999, there are a few cases around and we have had to wear the criticism, that is a preferable situation to there being thousands of cases around in 1999. Then the charge would be that we were negligent in not informing the public of the nature of this disease and its means of transmission. HIV virus has taken hundreds of lives and indeed it has damaged thousands of others. It has touched the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians and I would suggest it is in the consciousness of almost every Australian. The social, moral and economic issues are very significant. For instance, it is suggested that in 1990-AIDS will cost taxpayers about $150m in direct costs. The disease challenges our prejudices and it the challenges the comfortable, cosy belief that We have had in the past. But for the Government not to arm all Australians with the knowledge and thereby the power to avoid the' infection would be indefensible. The present campaign uses expert medical, scientific and social science ,data and I believe the priorities are appropriate in the wide range of responses. But we must understand that this is not just a problem for certain sections of the community-it is one for the whole community.",53
47,Dr WOODS,NOES,"I wish to address the House on two issues which have been raised previously but about which I believe there can never be enough said whilst the world community continues to ignore them. I speak firstly about a matter which has to join the ranks of Hitler's massacre of the Jews in Nazi Germany and Europe as one of the greatest instances of man's inhumanity to man that has been perpetrated in this century-the invasion, occupation and violation of the peaceful, neutral, independent country of Tibet by the People's Republic of China. While I am aware of our relationship with the People's Republic of China, I believe we would be breaching our responsibility to our fellow members of mankind if we do not' make known our indignation at the' breach of human and civil rights which occur regularly in Tibet. The holocaust: of Tibet's peoples, the degradation of its religion, traditions and culture, all result from China's seemingly insatiable and remorseless lust for dominance, which is well documented. While many nations around the world appear unanimous in theircondemnation, flagrant violation of the Tibetan's rights continues. Tibet is a country with a very long and rich past. Throughout its history it has been intermittently occupied by the Chinese, who apparently saw an advantage in the occupation of Tibet as a means of access to the Indian subcontinent. ,In 1949, with the argument that it was an inalienable part of its territory, the People's Republic of China again invaded Tibet and in 1959, in protest at the economic and social reforms introduced by the Chinese, there was an uprising. The spiritual leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama, and several thousand of his supporters, fearing arrest, were forced to flee and seek exile in neighbouring India, whilst back in Tibet, within a fortnight of the revolt occurring it had been crushed and an estimat-d 65,000 Tibetans were reported killed. Prior to this event Tibet had essentially been a peaceabiding, non-violent, gentle Buddhist society with a unique culture, history, .spiritual following and language. Its people, perhaps by nature of their isolation and their spiritual associations, were dedicated to a nqn-confrontationist, peaceful coexistence with others. The fact that they were driven to take part in an uprising is an indication of the terrible oppressions which they did, and do suffer, under a communist regime. After the 1959 uprising, which the People's Republic of China calls a rebellion, land reform was introduced and peasant associations were set up for collectives and the establishment of communes. There was a deliberate policy to destroy the four 'olds'that is, old ideas, old culture, old customs and old habits. This was done by the ethnic Chinese Red Guards who savaged-and I think that is not too strong a word to useTibetan culture and religion. More than 6,000 monasteries, many of which were built prior to the birth of Christ, were callously ransacked and destroyed and the number of monks and nuns was reduced by more than two-thirds. Centuries of priceless treasures and artefacts were ravaged and have disappeared, perhaps forever. The important point of this is that Tibet's religion and culture are a fundamental part of its national identity and in the light of this the devastation and suffering, and the rampant unwarranted destruction of the monasteries and the religious culture must have caused all the more damage to Tibet than it would to some other countries in the same situation. Again, in the past few years there have been more demonstrations which resulted in the imposition of martial law in March this year. The most serious abuses perpetrated by the People's Republic of China against the nation of Tibet, have been the continued physical abuse of the people of Tibet themselves. Gross atrocities have been committed-mass genocide, beatings, torture, often with electric batons and other. items of torture. Some allegations have been made that more than one million Tibetans have died under the People's Republic regime. Estimates of political prisoners range from 3,000 to 4,000, many of whom have been adopted by Amnesty International as. prisoners of conscience. In the long run, one of the most demoralising policies adopted for the Tibetans by the People's Republic has been the Chinese transfer policy. This basically results in more Chinese in Tibet than Tibetans in many areas and it gives preference in schooling, medical care and housing facilities to these ChineSe. Such Tibetans as have survived are reduced to second class citizens in their own country. The International Commission of Jurists has acknowledged the genocide practised by the Chinese on the Tibetans. The United Nations General Assembly .has passed three motions condemning the Chinese for their abuse of human rights. But despite these and a similar motion passed by the American Congress and Senate, Chinese dominance in Tibet continues. The confidence of the People's Republic that countries such as Australia will not meddle in international affairs extended so far recently that the Chinese Embassy here in Canberra even sought intervention by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to stop the Special Broadcasting,Service from airing a report that documented these abu&es of human rights. Whilst Australia and other countries continue to hide behind the skirts of international trade agreements, or other equally unconvincing excuses, we are, in effect, condoning the abuse of civil rights in Tibet. The Chinese Republic's indignation that other countries of the world should comment on and be outraged by these abuses would be comical if it were not so tragic. We just cannot be indifferent to the oppression and suffering that has resulted from the desire of the People's Republic of China to colonise Tibet. The Dalai Lama has' recently announced a five-point peace plan which is addressed to the People's Republic. He proposes a .transformation of the whole of Tibet into a peace zone; an end to the Chinese people transfer policy; respect of the civil human rIghts. and freedom of the Tibetans; the res.toration ,and protection of Tibet's natural environment; an end to the use of Tibet by China for ,the production of nuclear weapons and dumping of nuclear waste; and the start of serious discussions on the future of Tibet and of relations between the Tibetans and the Chinese. I believe our country and our Government must support these requests. There is another instance of gross human rights abuse that I wish to raise, which continues unchallenged and which is, in many ways, equally astounding. It is' the bizarre redevelopment and modernisation scheme that Romanian President, Nicolae Ceausescu, is promoting under which millions of residents are being evacuated and relocated whilst some 7,000 villages are literally being razed by bulldozers to be replaced with modern agro-industrial complexes. The alleged objective of the bulldozing is to bridge the gap between the town and country life of Romanians and to establish nearly 800,000 acres of arable land. But the result has been that hundreds of years of social and religious history has been eradicated. Homes, schools and churches have been bulldozed, an<;l millions of Romanian people herded into urban ghettos. Hungarians believe that there is a systematic discrimination, particularly against ethnic Hungarians living in the north-western Transylvanian region, and that this is an attempt to destroy centuries of rich and ancient Hungarian culture and national identity. There appears to be a definite policy to absorb all cultures into the one and to remove all vestiges of the individual nationalities. It seems, however, that it is not just the ethnic Hungarians but, indeed, the Romanians as a whole who are bearing the brunt of Ceausescu's obsession with the development of his own particular form of communism. In an attempt to repay a $10 billion debt he has adopted a policy of such austerity that basic requirements such as food - nd heating are rationed as if it were war-time and thousands are starving and suffering from severe malnutrition. During winter, heating in homes is limited to times when the temperature is below 14 degrees centigrade; there are shortages of basic medical requirements; there are even food rations of half a quart of cooking oil and between one and two pounds of meat per month. Even though these commodities are rationed, they are often not available. Aside from these inhumanities, Romania is' guilty of even more horrific human rights violations. Amnesty International, as in Tibet, has taken up the cause of a number of political prisoners arrested often for exercising nothing more than' internationally accepted human rights, such as the right to freedom of speech. There are many cases of psychiatric imprisonment for no other reason than punishment for criticism of the President's regime. Cases of torture, disappearance, house arrest, harassment and forced migration are innumerable. The repressions of religious and cultural freedoms' of the 1980s, against the Hungarians in particular, seem to be just as serious as those against the Jews by Hitler in the 1930s. As I 'speak, the picturesque towns, castles and villages and beautifully embroidered costumes so often used in the travel brochures to advertise Romania are,being annihilated. As with Tibet, I believe that Australia's failure to condemn the cultural genocide which is taking place in Romania makes us a conspirator to the crimes. This Government must, for once, do the right thing and not the pragmatic thing, and take a stand in the international community on behalf of these two countries and their inhabitants.",55

It was a lifelong dream of Wayne Gardner to create, compete and win his own country's grand prix. Wayne Gardner has brought a new dimension to motor cycling and to the petrol heads, I guess, whether they have cycles like my 75cc farm Yamaha or the big 1,000cc BMW roadies. I would also like to pay tribute to two Adelaide-based South Australians who played a major role in this event. I refer to an engineering genius by the name of Mr Bob Barnard. He and his Barnard Corporation were behind the logistics and the manufacture and creation of the infrastructure that allowed several hundred thousand people to view live this significant sporting event, along with the hundreds of millions in Australia and overseas who saw it on the Nine Network. Bob Barnard was also responsible for the track and support logistics at the world famous Adelaide Grand Prix, as well as creating the Carrara complex for the Brisbane Bears, which is a football team, not a public zoo. The merchandising and apparel clothing supporting Philip Island and the Adelaide Grand Prix were predominantly picked up by an enterprising company from Adelaide called Good Sports Manufacturing and its principal, Mr David Eckert, is to be congratulated on his entrepreneurial skills. On behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who normally grants a free holiday for these efforts, I salute Wayne Gardner, Bob Barnard and David Eckert-three great Australians.",57
49,Mr MILTON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to express my concern about a report which appeared in the Age today, 13 April. The report refers to workers who were evacuated from a Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation centre at Fishermens Bend when tests there found radioactive contamination up to 50 times the acceptable level. The Australian Radiation Laboratory has made a report on this matter to the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones), and it indicated that the levels of radiation at the five contaminated sites were significant and in one area the level was 50 times the amount considered acceptable for the public. Apparently this resulted from research projects in the 1950s that involved the separation and concentration of radioactive ores. The presence of radioactive nuclides in the soil was consistent with uranium ore processing. I wonder, Mr Deputy Speaker, how many other research projects have been conducted all around the country. I believe the Government should investigate all these sites to find out whether there are any more radioactive problems which could affect the public to such a significant extent.",58
50,Mr ROCHER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Curtin)...,-Yesterday the Clerk of the House circulated advice to honourable members that only one copy of the economic statement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the accompanying information paper would be made available to each member of this place. That limit was imposed as a result of a decision by someone in the Treasury Department and was not in accordance with the requirements of the parliamentary departments. On an earlier occasion the Australian Electoral Commissioner laid down that I-and presumably this applied to all members-was entitled to only one bound copy of the electoral roll which we use for reference when carrying out our responsibilities to our respective electorates. In this context, I register the strongest possible objection to being deprived of my minimum needs-apparently at the whim of some bureaucrat. Like most honourable members, I work out of four offices located at my home, my electorate office, the party divisional office and in the Parliament itself. Therefore, four copies of basic reference works, such as those instanced, are needed in the normal course of my duties. It is high time that the reasonable needs of elected representatives were not determined by some nameless, unaccountable public servant. Until this trend is reversed and until all members' requirements for printed material are given top priority, criticism of those responsible will be increased. I would like you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to draw my comments to the attention of Madam Speaker.",58
51,Mr LEE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"This afternoon I wish to draw to the House's attention the fact that last month the Minister for Veteran's Affairs (Mr Humphreys) visited my electorate of Dobell on the New South Wales central coast. The Minister was able to address a meeting of more than 300 local veterans and war widows at the Toukley Returned Services League sub-branch. One of the issues raised by many of the veterans present was the fact that the Repatriation Commission is using very strict guidelines when considering applications for the exthing; treme disability adjustment allowance. der this allowance, the Government pays $130 per week to those veterans over the age of 65 who may not be eligible for the totally and permanently incapacitated pension. The difficulty is that under the guidelines veterans have to obtain a rating of six of seven in relation to their particular cumstances. It is very difficult for veterans to reach that target. In fact, one veteran the public meeting said that only have to be dead to get a six out of seven rating; one would have to be four days! I would certainly encourage the Minister to review as soon as possible this requirement that veterans have to rate least six out of seven to obtain the extreme disability allowance. This is something the Minister has agreed to examine and I can assure him that my constituents will very grateful if he is able to lower the necthis essary rating. I would like to suggest that perhaps a rating of five out of seven would be more reasonable.",58

Where he got his quotes from reached his conclusions I will never know. He even quoted Father Julian Punch.

Independents in Tasmania care about only one they do not care about the poor, elUnderly people around the town, they do not care about the homeless and all the others with problems. Dr Bates is quoted as saying that we want cottage industries in Tasmania in order to survive. Are we supposed to sit and weep and knit and spin all day? How would I be?

55,Mr ANDREW,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last night's all statement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) was grim news for the people of the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, which has been ravaged by drought for eight years. In that the people have unsuccessfully sought drought declaration from the State Government and the consequent Commonwealth . intervention. As of last night, Common-. wealth intervention is no longer an option. Instead, the Minister for Primary Industries Mr and Energy (Mr Kerin) has set up a drought deaid task force. The question might well be asked: Why has Commonwealth drought aid gone before the task force has met or reported? If the task force recommends-as well we can imagine it will-widespread changes to the way we administer drought aid, the people of Eyre Peninsula will have every reason to be indignant. Most indignant of all will be those who have been forced off their farms. Why? Because the task force will be recommending changes to drought aid, changes that the Eyre Peninsual people will have been denied, and in the meantime these same people will have had no access to drought aid at all simply because the Government is determined, if you will pardon the pun, to dry up Commonwealth intervention in drought aid. Every Eyre Peninsula farmer forced off a farm, every Eyre Peninsula farmer forced to change the priorities he would have given to his family, has every reason to be indignant at the statement made by the Treasurer last night.",59
56,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Stirling)Last night I had the pleasure of attending a meeting of the parliamentary rugby league group-a group organised by the President of the Senate to meet the office bearers of the Australian Rugby League. I would like to commend the Australian and New South Wales Rugby League on the quality of their office bearers and the conduct of the competition. I do .so because recently in my home State of Western Australia the New South Wales Rugby League conducted a game between Balmain and Parramatta which was very well received. It is a credit to the New South Wales Rugby League that it should put on such a fixture. But I want to make another point: the reason 24,600 people turned out at the Western Australian Cricket Association ground is that the traditional game in Western Australia, Australian Rules, unfortunately has been taken over and pillaged by millionaires. The effect of that is that there has been a complete loss of faith by ordinary Western Australians in that game. The New South Wales and Australian Rugby League very astutely understand that now that that game has been 'Edelstenised', if I can use that term, Australian Rules has lost a lot of the rapport that it had with the rank and file followers. The people who sip champagne and have a lot of money do not have anything in common with those who lean over the fence at the outer. Fortunately, many people in this place happen to represent those who lean over the fence in the outer. I am very pleased that South Australia is staying out of the Victorian-dominated Australian Rules competition. We have to make sure that there is a healthy, viable Australian Rules competition; the way it is going at the moment it will not be either healthy or viable.

58,Mr COWAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Recent rains that have occurred throughout the Commonwealth, and certainly in the eastern part of Australia, have seriously affected the condition of the roads in New South Wales, particularly. Once again, I wish to bring to the attention of the Government the urgent need for more finance for roads. All the categories of roads, from the national highways down to the rural and local urban roads, are vitally affected. These are the roads that are serving Australia and its people; Local government generally is now being stretched to the limit on the funds that it has available to maintain and build the necessary roads. At the weekend I attended a meeting at Coomba Park, in the Great Lakes shire, where 120 people brought to my notice the urgent need for funding for rural local roads. If one lives in a local community it is so important that one should be able to get one's product to market. School buses must be able to take children to school. Overall, the roads in this country are in very bad condition. The people look to the Commonwealth, because the Federal Government collects the taxes. More of the money that rightfully belongs to these country people must be allocated to the roads that are severely in need of maintenance.",60

It will spell doom for the Liberals and in the next fortnight I wiU come back here with a great smile on my face to explain quite happily to this House why the Australian Labor Party won the State seat of Greensborough, and why the conservatives of this country have, yet again, proved themselves incompetent in campaigning and in putting forward candidates who have the support of the local community. Sherryl Garbutt, a fine person, a Labor candidate, wiU win the election; she will win it with a margin of between 51 and 52 per cent in two-party preferred terms.

60,Mr MCGAURAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Madam Speaker, the long awaited Smith report has been delivered to the Government, that being, of course, the committee of inquiry, headed by Professor Bob Smith, into the funding needs of higher education and other research institutions. It has concluded that unless $180m is urgently invested in science and research effort in this country, Australia's economic performance will continue to suffer as it has under the past neglect of science by this Government. The tragedy in all of this is that the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) has not yet responded, and he is becoming increasingly more irrelevant to this whole science debate. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is now reporting almost exclusively to the senior Minister, Senator John Button, who is the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, whilst the Minister for Science is relegated to the office boy role of running the day-today operations at CSIRO. At best, he has no influence in policy formulation. We await some declaration of leadership, some decisive decisions on his part, so that CSIRO's disintegration is halted and reversed, and it once again becomes the flagship of Australian science.",61

68,Mr HOWE,BENEFITS TO FAMILIES,"I am aware of such claims having been made last night, as I understand it, by the Leader of the Opposition. In fact, I saw him on television saying something very much like that. I guess that the problem was that he had learnt his lines earlier in the day and did not have the opportunity last night to study the actual document or to think through a position. After all, members of the Opposition are notable for their very slow thinking in the area of families. They are very slow thinkers. They are fine when it comes to making vague statements of attitude but we know their record in terms of action. I have referred to that record. The Leader of the Opposition has been extraordinarily uncomfortable when I have made the point that, in six out of seven Budgets, he, as Treasurer for a number of those Budgets, could not find a dollar for low income families.

96,Mr HOWE,BENEFITS TO FAMILIES,"The Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission made some comment on whether the tax cuts and the family assistance package restored people's situations. I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition, who was very keen several weeks ago to quote the Australian Institute of Family Studies, should have a close look at what the Institute of Family Studies said. It said that it welcomed the attention given to families with children, particularly those on low and middle incomes. On the Institute's analysis of the Government's package, 70 per cent of families will gain more than $1,000 per annum. One-income families on average weekly earnings will receive an average gain of $24 a week, not including wage increases. The Institute, with its authority, says that the package appears to redress the erosion of income since 1976. The indexation of family benefits is an historically significant ture which will ensure that these payments will not be eroded in the future. NA  today's prediction by Mr Nobby Clark, the Managing Director of the National Australia Bank Ltd. Has the Treasurer received advice from his Department that accords with his al;ivice that mortgage interest rates will move higher?",63
97,Mr KEATING,HOUSING INTEREST RATES,"I have made the point about Mr Clark and the National Bank that his book is vulnerable to higher cost deposits and he is out talking his book all the time. I do not blame him for that, but let us understand what he is doing. The Commonwealth Bank has a different book: it has a greater level of savings bank accounts; it has a greater bank. and storehouse of mortgages with repayment income each week to the bank, just as Westpac has.· That is not true of the National Australia Bank. In 1986 it went out on a wing and a prayer lending for housing, got embarrassed and we had to bring in the bank subsidy to get it out of trouble. It is doing the same again. It has been taking deposits off the market and in those conditions it feels the stress. That is why Mr Clark talks about this every day. However, the same Mr Clark argues that there should be no tax cuts .. He believes that there should be a larger Budget surplus and no tax cuts. I ask Mr Clark to make available details of his income and to put his wage restraint against the income of the work force. I ask Mr Clark whether his executive staff would wear wage restraint through a period in which they· could exploit the market. . The bank's profitability went up this year because we reduced the statutory reserve deposits. The chief deposits which came back to the banking system after October 1987 were all part and parcel of the high profits which the banks have enjoyed. As soon as they see some of that profit growth being threatened, they are out there on television squealing like stuck pigs every time they get feaa chance to do so. The public should understand that the interests of bankers are not their interests. FAMILIES: BUDGET STRATEGIES",63
98,Mr JOHNS,HOUSING INTEREST RATES,Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the Budget strategies which have been adopted by the Government in relation to families?,64
99,Mr HAWKE,HOUSING INTEREST RATES,"Following the Social Security Review on income support for families with children, my Government introduced the family allowance supplement in 1987 to direct substantial additional assistance to low income families. That major reform was an integral part of Labor's commitment that by 1990 no child need live in poverty. Opposition members-Will! Will! Will!",64
100,Mr HAWKE,HOUSING INTEREST RATES,"I will disregard the noise from the other side and go to the facts. The facts concern the Australian people and they are substantial. The first is that, for the first time in Australia's history, relevant standards of adequacy were set for family payments. Madam Speaker, you will recall, as no doubt the House will recall, what those targets and standards were. They were 15 per cent of the combined married rate of pension for children under 13 years and 20 per cent for children between the age of 13 and 15 years. Those targets were set in 1987. The payments that should be made for each child in that age range were 15 or 20 per cent, respectively, of the combined married pension rate. It was agreed that as a result of that study, if those financial payments could be made by meeting those percentages of the married pension rate, it would deliver on the promise· and the commitment that there be no financial need for children to live in poverty. Against that background it is interesting to understand what happened last night. Last night's increase in family payments meets those benchmarks. We promised to meet them by 1990. In fact, we have met them by 1989. The increase recognises the additional costs incurred by Australian families with children, the costs of larger families and the costs of older children. As a result of what was done last night a two-child family will receive from the family allowance payments alone an additional nontaxable $5.25 a week in assistance or, in other words, a 41 per cent increase. I give the aggregate impact of that on this country. In total it means that two million families3.8 million Australian children-will benefit from last night's family allowance increases. The comprehensive package of measures announced last night, while benefiting all Aus.:. tralians, was targeted primarily towards low and middle income earners in this country. Let us look at the statistics. Seventy-five per cent of Australian households earn less than $35,000 a year. It follows that those households are, and deserve to be, the major beneficiaries of last night's package, as indeed they are. This contrasts with the preoccupation in 'Futile Diversions' with single income families. That category makes up only 18 per cent of Australian households. The difference between what is said and done by us and those opposite in their parade of' prejudice and platitudes is that we deal with the realities. I am proud to say that I lead a government which has not waited until 1990 to deliver on its promises. In 1989 we have delivered on that promise to the benefit of 3.8 million Australian children. NA  to the Treasurer. In view of the Treasurer's dislike of the National Australia Bank, I refer him to yesterday's prediction by the Chief Economist for the Australia and New Zealand Bank that ANZ's reference interest rate would rise from 18t per cent to 20 per cent by the end of the year. Will the Treasurer spell out the effects of a rise in the reference rate on mortgage interest rates?",64
101,Mr KEATING,INTEREST RATES,"That is an entirely different rate to the housing rate: the shadow Treasurer is speaking of the prime indicator rate. Most banks have a formula which shifts the rate up when there are movements in cash rates in the system and a general tightening of policy. I have said that I see no particular reason why, in a discretionary sense, we would tighten policy further. Therefore, if there is to be a change in that rate it will be at the discretion of the banks. The rate. goes up regularly and, as we have seen in more moderate monetary conditions, it abates regularly. In other words, it moves more regularly. The stock of deposits which govern the housing rate is an entirely different proposition. What prompts the question is the notion that the Opposition would have a different policy mix. I remind the Opposition that under its Leader in 1981 the rate for bills was 22 per cent; it is now 17.8 per cent. The Opposition should bear that in mind. It had fixed housing interest rates but no loansthat is, it had a rate of 13t per cent but there were no loans to be had. In other words, it was phoney. Before deregulation there were quantitative restrictions on loans and there was no money. When someone asked a bank whose housing rate was 13.5 per cent for a loan he was told, 'Oh, there's no money'. The system was totally fictitious. That is how the monetary system used to operate in the days of regulation. The fact that the banks can borrow on the market and lend profitably at variable rates for housing has changed all that. The shadow Treasurer made it clear in this House two days ago during a discussion on a matter of public importance that he would have a tight monetary policy. That is because he has no wages policy. That means that in current conditions, with the labour market as it is and demand as strong as it is, a coalition government, if it were in office now, would have much higher interest rates than the Government would have. Need I say, members of the Opposition shed crocodile tears about interest rates, when for most of the years up to 1983 they denied the work force a wage increase which is now worth 34 per cent of average weekly earnings. But they now say that they would pay wages in relation to the increase in productivity, which the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong, says is less than one per cent. So, in the face of a 7 per cent inflation rate, they would increase wages by less than one per cent. The honourable member knows that that would immediately lead to a wage break-out on which he would employ, if he were Treasurer, a much tighter monetary policy and much higher interest rates than currently prevail. NA",64
102,Mr OKEEFE,WAGE AND TAXATION POLICIES,"What information is the Minister for Industrial Relations ,able to vide on how the Government's wage-tax package and award restructuring will benefit the economy and provide greater flexibility in the labour market?  tax package is an historic achievement in the accord process. Honourable members opposite moan and groan and just cannot contemplate the consultation and consensus that are the background to the accord process. The commitment of the trade union movement to the elements of last night's package means that in the coming year we will be able to contain the increase in average weekly earnings to 6t per cent. We can compare that with the proposals that come from the Opposition. The Opposition wants the old catch and kill your own arrangement, each enterprise making its own industrial arrangements, each business-732,000 of themmaking its own arrangements for wages and for job and work conditions. One knows what the result of that would be. It would be the same old wage explosion of 1981-82, the same old rampant inflation, the same old collapse in the economy, the same old massive increase in unemployment. We can add the Opposition's fascinating formula for lifting family living standards. Its response has been that the tax cuts and the ,wage increases are inflationary in this rapidly growing economy. In other words, it is saying that the tax cuts are too high and the wage increases are too great. By keeping tax .cuts down and by not giving wage increases other than of the order of one per cent, members of the Opposition would somehow lift family living standards in a magical fashion. It is a fascinating formula. The wage increases that this Government is going to support before the Industrial Relations Commission are wage increases that are linked to participation in the award restructuring process, a process that will give us greater flexibility in the use of labour, increased productivity, increased efficiency and better trained workers and put this nation in a position where it can compete more ably with industries and countries abroad. In the a ward restructuring process we will see an overhaul of the job classification procpro- ess and work arrangements, abolition of demarcation problems and, as I said, greater flexibility in the use of labour. To that end I can say to the honourable member for Burke that the Government is providing some $12m in the coming year to assist employers and employees through that process of changing their job classifications and arrangements in the workplace and introducing the new training arrangements. That process is something that is new to the Opposition. It will be new to many of the managements in this country, but it is the fundamental change into which the trade union movement is locked through the accord process. That is the way in which we will enable Australian products and Australian services to become more competitive in this country and more competitive abroad. That will give us the ability to build on the 1.3 million new jobs that have been created under this Government. NA",65
103,Mr HOWARD,HOME LOAN INTEREST RATES,I ask the Prime Minister: Will he assure the House that last night's economic statement will not be followed by further increases in home loan interest rates?,66
104,Mr HAWKE,HOME LOAN INTEREST RATES,The Leader of the Opposition gives further evidence to the fact that he is a considerably slow learner. Mr Beale-That is an easy question.,66

108,Madam SPEAKER,HOME LOAN INTEREST RATES,Order! The House will come to order. Mr Downer interjecting,66
109,Mr HAWKE,HOME LOAN INTEREST RATES,"Little boy, calm down and listen.",66
110,Madam SPEAKER,HOME LOAN INTEREST RATES,Order! The honourable member for Mayo has been told to come to order.,66
111,Mr HAWKE,HOME LOAN INTEREST RATES,"As I was saying, neither the Treasurer nor I will speculate in terms of likely movements in the short term on interest rates because the very fact that either the Treasurer or I should undertake such speculation in regard to short term movements-as the honourable gentleman opposite, who has himself been Treasurer of this country, disastrously, would know-would of itself have an impact upon what will happen in the market. However, the Treasurer and I-and I am prepared to say it again-have put in place the macro-economic policies in terms of responsible fiscal policy, responsible wages policy, which together, as exemplified last night, will create the conditions that I believe and the Government believes in the longer term will have the impact of bringing interest rates down. There is no reason at all to doubt that. As my colleague the Treasurer said, it ill becomes this failed Treasurer, that now temporary Leader of the Opposition, to talk about interest rates or any other aspect of macro-economic policy, because in all the externally imposed difficulties that this Government has had to operate under never at any stage, including at present, have we begun to approach the figure of 22 per cent interest rates which the previous Government brought about in this country. Why did it bring it about? Because it had no idea of how to conduct macro-economic policy in the central area of wages. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that in each of the three years from 1980-81 to 1982-83 there was a double digit increase in wages; that is a fact. If the Leader of the Opposition has any understanding of the difference between the conduct of policy under this Government and under him, he oughtif he has not already-to turn to page 23 of attachment A, because it is all spelt out there. In figure 3 in attachment A there is set out, going back to September 1966 and up to the present, the correlation between wages movement and overtime. A second graph shows the correlation between wages movement and capacity utilisation. What we find is this: under the Leader of the Opposition's stewardship in 1981, the economy was booming, overtime was going up and capacity utilisation was rising. What did we see? Wages went up massively. What has happened under this Government? Overtime and capacity utilisation have gone up with a growing economy, out wages growth has been low. That is the essential difference between this side of the House and the other. We have the secret of the conduct of economic policy because we know how to control the level of wages. Under the former Treasurer what happened was that when the economy started to move upwards wages exploded because he had no relationship at all with the trade union movement; he treated the trade union movement and the organised workers of this country with contempt; he regarded this area as a battleground. In the battleground that the previous Government created, it had wages going through the roof. I remind those opposite that this is what their proud record was: in each of the three years, 1980-81 to 1982-83, wages increased in double figures. When a government cannot control wages policy, that is the inevitable result. The inevitable result was what happened in 1982 and 1983: unemployment went through the roof. The previous Government achieved the hitherto unachieved double.· It got the great quinella: double digit inflation and double digit unemployment. No Treasurer in the history of this country had ever achieved that quinella before. And honourable members opposite have the temerity to get up in here and talk about interest rates. The reason why interest rates are high now is quite deliberate. They are high because we have got wages policy as tight as we can. We have got fiscal policy as tight as we can. One little thing the Opposition will have to do tonight is bring the people of Australia into its confidence. If the Opposition believes that fiscal policy can be tighter, it will have to face up to the barrier. If the Opposition would have tighter fiscal policy it will have to tell people where it would cut. Would it cut defence? Would it cut roads? Would it cut schools? Would it cut pensions? Where would it cut? Where would it make fiscal policy tighter? If honourable members opposite ever face up to that barrier there will be an almighty yawn from the people of Australia. They will say 'Johnny, you have been there. You have tried it. We gave you the responsibility. You did what no other Treasurer has ever done. In percentage terms, you got double digit unemployment and double digit inflation. We have tried you once. We don't want you again'. But honourable members opposite probably will not be given that opportunity because the most interesting statistic around this Parliament at the moment is the number 34, the current tally of votes the shadow Treasurer has in the attack that he is making upon the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition. If any figure is likely to rise in the next few days it will be the number 34 because the intelligence is that gradually the shadow Treasurer is increasing his numbers. I hope that he does. NA",66
112,Mr LEE,AGE PENSIONS,Is the Minister for Social Security aware of claims that the better-off aged have the most to lose from yesterday's economic statement? Can the Minister advise the House of the validity of these claims?,67
113,Mr HOWE,AGE PENSIONS,"The Sydney Morning Herald today carries quite false claims regarding the impact of the Government's economic statement on retirees. It begins with the false premise that a married couple with income of just over $20,000 is ineligible for the age pension and, therefore, miss out on government assistance. The facts are that pensioner eligibility for a married couple does not cease until private non-pension income reaches $484.20 a week combined, just over $25,000 per annum. Therefore, the retiree couple example in the article with a private income of $420 a week would have a pension entitlement of $32.10 or $1,669.20 per annum. If they were renting privately they would be entitled to additional assistance. From the false premise that this couple would have no pension entitlement, the author proceeds to label the couple as the biggest losers from the Hawke Government's mini-Budget. Far from losing, such a couple would gain from the bringing forward of their pension indexation rises in three stages to secure by 1990 the speediest indexation of consumer price index (CPI) increases in history. By then pensions will be paid at a higher indexed rate for 24 weeks of each year. They would gain $6.72 a week in tax cuts from the tax changes announced last night by the Treasurer, as acknowledged in the article concerned. The article also claims the gains made by such a couple would be eroded or even exceeded by changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. That is equally false. As my colleague the Treasurer indicated last night, pensions will not be affected by changes in relation to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. So, far from this couple being losers, it is more than likely that they would want to join the Australian Pensioners Federation in describing the Treasurer's announcements last night as good news for Australia's older people. The Australian Pensioners Federation correctly understood that the two reforms with respect to the aged announced last night were both unprecedented reforms, that is, they were not marginal changes. They were changes that mean, firstly, that the delay with respect to the CPI will be referred to an earlier point than ever before. Secondly, for the first time full rate pensioners will pay no tax at all. The income test free area will become equivalent to the tax free area. This second change is also historic. It will benefit 80 per cent of aged pensioners. It means that 80 per cent of aged pensioners-more than one million pensioners-will not pay tax. One can understand the Australian Pensioners Federation welcoming last night's decisions as part of the Government's review of retirement incomes. It is impossible to avoid the contrast between the Government and the Opposition, either in respect of families or of the aged. In the case of families, in the Opposition's period in government we had ad hoc reforms, which were never pursued and which never resulted in any real change, reforms that melted like ice in the Sahara. In respect of the aged this Government has made two more significa.nt reforms, not as the end of a reform process, as is understood by the Pensioners Federation, but in the context of the review by Professor Cass of the retirement incomes system and as the first major instalment of what will be a comprehensive review of retirement incomes. That is the difference. Under the previous Government we had ad hoc changes and a deterioration of living standards. This Government not only has achieved substantial reforms but also will ensure that those reforms are entrenched and will remain for decades to come. NA",67
114,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSUMER PRICE INDEX,"I ask the Treasurer: In the light of last night's economic statement, is the assumption in his Forward Estimates of a consumer price index increase of around 4.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent in 1989-90 still valid or is the projection by the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support earlier this week of a CPI increase this year of between 7 and 8 per cent correct? Would the Treasurer now advise the House what his current projection is for inflation next year?",68
115,Mr KEATING,CONSUMER PRICE INDEX,"The increase will certainly be higher than 4.5 per cent. We have made that clear for a long time now. But as I said yesterday-I repeat it-we expect inflation to decelerate over the course of 1989-90 and 1990-91. We have secured a better wages outcome than the market would otherwise have secured under the kind of policy mix which the Opposition would administer. That will permit a decline in inflation over time, particularly as productivity improves. The measure of productivity will improve as employment slows somewhat. We will see the productivity improvements of the last couple of years eking their reward on the measure of productivity, thus reducing inflation even further over time. I remind the right honourable member that his colleagues the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance spokesman did not understand the difference between the non-farm gross domestic product deflator, which had export prices in it, and the broadest measure of consumption, the implicit consumption deflator, which was 7.1 per cent for the year. That is much closer to the level which the Government believes inflation is really at now, around 7 per cent. That is why the Australian Statistician is now reviewing his methodology regarding the measure of housing costs in the CPI for the next quarter. It is awfully difficult to predict what the CPI may be when we are uncertain what methodology the Statistician will finally employ. NA",68
116,Ms FATIN,SCHOOLS,Would the Prime Minister advise the House on the extent of the Government's commitment to improve Australian schools?,68
117,Mr HAWKE,SCHOOLS,"I thank the honourable member for Brand for her question. I remind her-she would well know this and it should certainly be remembered on the other side of the House-that under this Government the year 12 retention rate has increased from 36 per cent in 1982 to 57 per cent. It is interesting to compare that tremendous increase with what happened in the last five years of our predecessors, when the rate went up by one per cent. It moved up from 35 per cent to 36 per cent in the last five years of the Government of our predecessors. As a result of the Government's concern for social justice, increased retention has not been occurring only in middle class schools. It is very important that this be understood. Year 12 completion rates amongst the lowest socio-economic groups in society are also increasing dramatically. Children from the most underprivileged 10 per cent of our society, in the very lowest socio-economic category, are now completing their full secondary education in about the same proportion as the great bulk of children in the middle socio-economic groups. I believe that is something which this whole country ought to be profoundly proud of and gratified by. I speak with pride, as the leader of this Government, at having seen that dramatic change. The stagnation under this Government's predecessors meant that we inherited a country with an abysmally low retention rate compared with that of any other developed country with which Australia would normally compare itself. Of the many bitter legacies left after seven years of conservative government, many of which honourable members opposite should be totally ashamed of, there is none of which they should be more ashamed than that 36 per cent retention rate. All Australians-irrespective of their political persuasion and socio-economic group-should take pleasure in the fact that our greatest asset, Australian children, as a result of the policies of this Government are now staying on in school. This applies no matter what socio-economic group the children come from. It does not matter how low the income of their parents is; because we have more than doubled the rate of the secondary allowance to kids and undertaken a range of other reforms, these children are now staying on in schools. Honourable members opposite should be ashamed of their record. Our record is something that we are entitled to be proud of, and the whole Australian community is entitled to share in that pride. As proud as we are-and we are indeed proud of that great achievement-more can always be achieved in education. Of course, to achieve it, given the division of powers we have in this country, there has to be cooperation between the Commonwealth Government and the governments of the States. All Australians know that in regard to education there is this division of power and responsibility between the Commonwealth and the States. While the honourable member for Brand and all other members of the House will know that we cannot tell States what to do with their schools, we can and do encourage them to participate in initiatives which will assist schools in meeting the undoubted challenges that they now face with these increased retention rates. The honourable member for Brand will be interested to know that a year ago I wrote to all State Premiers asking them to support a Commonwealth initiative called Strengthening Australia's Schools. This document-",68
118,Mr HAWKE,SCHOOLS,"This subject is far too important to be interrupted by the honourable member's ridiculous and irrelevant observations. This document, produced by my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, set an agenda to strengthen Australia's schools which include national goals for schooling; and annual national report on schools; common curriculum frameworks; and the removal of unnecessary differences between school systems, particularly between States. I think all members of this House, irrespective of which side they sit on, will understand the very considerable difficulties for Australian families-remembering that some half a million young Australians move home each year-that are entailed in having eight different education systems. Mr Beale-But they don't go from State to State.",69
119,Madam SPEAKER,SCHOOLS,Order! The member for Deakin will not interject again.,69
120,Mr HAWKE,SCHOOLS,"The honourable member for Deakin does not even know what a CAE is, so I do not think we need to worry about him. The Australian Education Council, which, as honourable members know, is a body comprising all the State Ministers in conjunction with the Commonwealth Minister for education, met several times in the past year to consider the issues raised in this document issued by my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. At its meeting in Tasmania this weekend, which the Minister will attend, the Australian Education Council will, 1 hope, make a commitment to implement reform in these areas. 1 repeat that the future of these and other reforms lies ultimately in the hands of the State Ministers for educati,on. The Commonwealth has taken an important initiative to lead this debate. But the simple and unavoidable fact is that, without the cooperation and agreement of the State education Ministers, our attempt to strengthen Australia's education system still further will not succeed. 1 hope that 1 speak on behalf of every single member of this House in expressing the hope that at this important meeting of the Australian Education Council this weekend-when it has before it the agenda, the opportunities and the challenges set out in the Commonwealth document-all those present will be able to rise above party political considerations and put the interests of Australian children first. That is something honourable members opposite were not able to do when they were in government. We have done it federally, and we hope that, with the cooperation of all the States, we will be able to improve further the quality, the quantity and the relevance of Australia's education for its greatest asset; that is, the children of Australia. ECONOMIC STATEMENT: BALANCE NA",69
121,Dr HEWSON,OF PAYMENTS,"I refer the Treasurer to a statement he made in his press conference on the February balance of payments, when he said: Now, the only way we can increase the available savings within Australia is by a program, an ambitious program, of even further public sector dissaving. And if we believe that cannot succeed, there is only one instrument to be using. and that is monetary policy to actually reduce the size of the ment phase. I ask the Treasurer: Given that he is now running down his public sector surplus, does he intend to use monetary policy to contain the prospective boost to consumption from last night's mini-Budget?",70
122,Mr KEATING,OF PAYMENTS,I said here two years ago that this gentleman prides himself on having some technical facility. Mr Reith-He runs rings around you.,70
123,Mr KEATING,OF PAYMENTS,"Well, the honourable member would like to hope he would but he is not, is he? That is what worries honourable members opposite. More professors of economics have sunk without trace in here than Premiers. There is one two tows back. But the honourable member for Berowra has something going for him-we like him. The premise of the question is that we have run down the surplus. Two days ago the shadow Minister asked me about unfunded tax cuts from a surplus, and I made the point, 'How could they be unfunded from a surplus?'. He put out a press statement saying, 'I have been saying this often. The press knows that. The frequency of the misinformation guar-. antees that it should be taken notice of'. It was the most absurd comment 1I have ever seen. We now have talk about running down the Budget surplus. The Government is saying that next year the Budget surplus will be at least $5.5 billion-no less than this year's surplus. There is no running down of the surplus. Therefore, the net difference be-. tween one year and the next in relation to the stimulus coming from public policy is zero. There is no difference from this year in the stimulus coming from public policy with a $5.5 billion surplus next year. So the whole premise on which the question is predicated is wrong.",70
124,Dr HEWSON,OF PAYMENTS,"Come on, you are struggling.",70
125,Mr KEATING,OF PAYMENTS,"Come on! The honourable member for Wentworth is supposed to be the professor of economics. He must have got his chair at the University of New South Wales out of a lucky dip. If the honourable member does not understand that a surplus of $5.5 billion next year following a surplus of $5.5 billion this year adds nothing to the invest- stimulus to the economy-it might change the composition of demand, but it adds nothing to the fiscal stimulus coming from the Commonwealth-he ought to. go back and re-swot his textbooks. NA",70
126,Mr CUNNINGHAM,TAX CUTS,"I refer the Treasurer to the statement he tabled last night in the House, indicating that the tax cuts would more than offset what is known as fiscal drag or bracket creep. Would he please explain to the House why this is so and how it compares with other recent periods in Australian history? Mr Beale-You are the bracket creep.",71
127,Mr KEATING,TAX CUTS,"The member for Deakin is such a scintillating wit. The shadow Minister did one clever thing in his life; he chose his business partner well. In dealing with this question of fiscal drag, during all of yesterday the Opposition tried to give credence to the lie that, had the Government indexed the tax scales back in 1983, somehow there would have been a lower tax burden on the Australian taxpayer. The fact is that, had the Government indexed the tax scales' from 1983, there would have been a larger tax burden than there is now, because mathematically the Government has given back more than tax indexation would have. The facts which the Opposition ignores in its analysis are the employment growth and the fairness in the tax system by the broadening of the tax base, making former avoiders and evaders pay their way so there is more revenue. That increase in revenue does not imply that there has been anything less than tax indexation since 1983. The Opposition can persist with this line of argument if it chooses. It is mathematically wrong. It will finally have to abandon it or correct it. It had best abandon it, rather than correct it, by not continuing to peddle it. NA",71
128,Mr HAWKE,HEALTH COVER,"Madam Speaker, I seek your indulgence, to add to an answer I gave in the House yesterday.",71
129,Madam SPEAKER,HEALTH COVER,My indulgence is granted.,71
130,Mr HAWKE,HEALTH COVER,"Yesterday, the honourable member for' Chisholm raised with me a question concerning health insurance coverage before the introduction of Medicare. He asked me to provide the basis of my statement of the previous week that Medicare enfranchised the two million Australians who were without health cover under the previous Government. The answer to the honourable member's question is contained on page 1 of the very Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Bulletin 'Health Insurance Survey March 1983' to which he referred yesterday. Let me quote, for his benefit, from page 1 of the bulletin from which he quoted. This is what it states: 1,031,500 contributor units (containing 1,826,300 persons) were without health insurance cover and were not identified in the survey as having access to special Commonwealth health benefits. In March 1982 there were an estimated 1,129,300 such contributor units (1,953,000 persons). Table 14, to which the honourable member referred, deals with ,contributor units, not individual Australians, as claimed in his question. Here is a medical practitioner who one' would assume knew the difference between contributor units and individuals. My statement, therefore, is validated by the ABS bulletin. The assertion by the honourable member for Chisholm that 1,031,000 Australians were uninsured is plainly, simply wrong. Let the doctor go and do his homework. I hope his prescriptions are better than his analyses in this place. I do not wish to detain the House longer by providing more detail about further mistaken assertions contained in the honourable member's question. I therefore table, for the information of the House, a copy of the letter which I have provided today to the honourable member' for Chisholm, putting right his profoundly and obviously' incorrect statement. STANDING ORDER 145",71
131,Mr SHACK,HEALTH COVER,"I seek your indulgence, Madam Speaker, to make a brief but concise submission to you on standing order 145.",71
132,Madam SPEAKER,HEALTH COVER,Are you asking a question of the Speaker?,71
133,Mr SHACK,HEALTH COVER,"No, I am seeking your indulgence to make a brief submission to you on the status of standing order 145.",71
134,Madam SPEAKER,HEALTH COVER,My indulgence is granted.,71
135,Mr SHACK,HEALTH COVER,"Thank you for your indulgence, Madam Speaker. I make this submission after Question Time, not wishing to be accused of interrupting Question Time and in recognition of the fact that you warned the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) for raising points of order understanding order 145. It is a brief submission. I ask you to hear me out. I do, not wish to engage in argument with the Government.",71
136,Madam SPEAKER,HEALTH COVER,I interrupt you for one moment. I warned the honourable member for O'Connor for shouting across the table when he was out of order. It had nothing to do with standing order 145.,72
137,Mr SHACK,HEALTH COVER,"Thank you, Madam Speaker. Standing order 145 is a very brief standing order, as I have pointed out in a previous submission to you. It simply states: An answer shall be relevant to t-e question. In responding to my earlier submission, Madam Speaker, you came. back into the chamber and pointed out that in the Chair's opinion it was very difficult to define relevance. My submission to you is that relevance has been defined by a previous Speaker, Speaker Snedden. That definition has been employed by you as we, on a number of occasions, have reminded you. In the Parliament, on 27 August 1981, Speaker Snedden said: The Minister will answer the question and not engage in irrelevancies, such as contrasting the Government and the Labor Party. We, at that time, were in government and the Labor Party was in opposition. My submission to you, Madam Speaker. I will come to a conclusion very quickly-is that standing order 145 has been defined by a previous Speaker; there is a precedent. If you go through all of your rulings-I will not draw them to your attention-you will find that on some occasions you have adhered to that precedent and on others you have not. I recognise that contrasting one political party with another is the substance of politics. But the substance of standing order 145 is that one does not do it in Question Time. There are plenty of times to do it under the Standing Orders. Both sides of polities engage in that sort of contrast. But standing order 145 is supposed to ensure that honourable members may ask questions of the Government and they may receive from the Government succinct answers. I conclude on this point: it is very likely that this Parliament is soon to be prorogued for an election. As you know, Madam Speaker, things get very hot in this chamber as we get to election time. You, yourself, have but a few weeks, I would imagine, before you retire.",72
138,Mr BEAZLEY,HEALTH COVER,"Madam Speaker, I wish to raise a point of order.",72
139,Unknown,HEALTH COVER,Opposition members interjecting,72
140,Mr BEAZLEY,HEALTH COVER,"Madam Speaker, there is nothing wrong with raising points of order when an honourable member is speaking with the indulgence of the Chair. There are very strict provisions in Standing Orders about reflection on the Chair. Quite clearly, the last remark which the honourable member directed towards you, Madam Speaker, which suggested that your time in this place was to be foreshortened-particularly the way in which he presented it-whilst not by any means the most severe insult which has ever been imposed upon you by the Opposition, nevertheless, was outside the area of indulgence and a reflection upon you. I would seek that you protect yourself on this matter.",72
141,Madam SPEAKER,HEALTH COVER,If I ruled on that I would not rule it in order. I would consider it an error of judgment made by the honourable member for Tangney and not a prediction of what will happen to me or my health. The honourable member for Tangney may conclude his remarks.,72
142,Mr SHACK,HEALTH COVER,"Madam Speaker, I will conclude, simply by asking you to reply to my submission-not today, but to take the next fortnight to consider it-and to come back into the Parliament when we resume in May to uphold the integrity of Question Time; to uphold the status of standing order 145 and, indeed, to secure for your place, and for you as a Speaker a lasting reputation.",72
143,Mr BEAZLEY,HEALTH COVER,"Madam Speaker, I seek your indulgence to make one or two points on the same matter.",72
144,Madam SPEAKER,HEALTH COVER,My indulgence is granted.,72
145,Mr BEAZLEY,HEALTH COVER,"The point about relevance and Speaker Snedden's direction in that particular instance obviously depends on the nature of the question asked and whether the nature of the question asked permits a contrast of Government and Opposition poliey. Nobody in this place-not you or mewho has sat in opposition can recollect a Question Time in which an occasion was not taken to contrast Government and Opposition policy-indeed, this has occurred when the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) has been here. Standing order 142, which outlines the way in which questions may be put to Ministers, states: Questions may be put to a Minister relating to public affairs with which he is officially connected, to proceedings pending in the House, or to any matter of administration for which he is responsible. The public affairs with which a Minister is officially connected obviously incorporate those public affairs related to policy development in the area of the Minister. Obviously, there will be a wide variety of views circulating in the community, and for a Minister to be deprived of opportunities to comment on those views, be they from the Opposition or anyone else, and whether those views constitute a rational course as opposed to the course the Government follows, is clearly within the anticipation of Standing Orders and was clearly endorsed by Speaker Snedden when he was in the chair on the many occasions when he permitted a contrast to take place between Government and Opposition polices.",72
146,Madam SPEAKER,HEALTH COVER,The Chair will take on board what the honourable member for Tangney has had to say and will reply to him at a later date. NA,73

149,Mr SPENDER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal explanation.",73
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,73
151,Mr SPENDER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I do, comprehensively.",73
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Leave is granted.,73
153,Mr SPENDER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I claim to have been misrepresented by Mr Laurie Oakes in the most recent edition of the Bulletin under the heading 'Back to the '50s'. Mr Oakes claims that the coalition is 'unwilling to acknowledge or understand' the dramatic changes that are taking place in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and implied that I do not, see much difference between Stalin and Gorbachev. Neither of those claims is true. The coalition's foreign policy was released at a public launch, noted by Mr Oakes in his article, to which I personally invited him. He is a busy man; he did not attend. If he had, he would have heard me speak of a time of change, of hope and welcomed reform in the Soviet Union and some Eastern bloc states, of a more stable, constructive international climate, with agreement on intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) and progress on strategic nuclear systems, to take but two areas. He would also have heard me express my hope that one day we might welcome the Soviet Union to the ranks of the democracies, hardly the views of someone ignoring the processes of change or who sees little difference between the dreadful Stalin era and the present time of hope. Having missed the opening, and not having bothered to canvass with me separately my views on the Soviet Union-which I would have thought to have been fairly basic before attacking them-he even managed significantly to misrepresent the coalition's policy. Mr Oakes chose to ignore the policy's specific references to radical reformists in Eastern Europe-",73
154,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Claims of misrepresentation under Standing Orders should be addressed by reference to where a member has been misrepresented. If the policy of a party has been misrepresented, the matter can be dealt with in the various forms of debate in this place, not by way of personal explanation.",74
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Yes. I would like the honourable member for North Sydney to restrict his explanation to where he personally has been misrepresented.,74
156,Mr SPENDER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, most certainly. Mr Oakes said that 'Spender's policy mentions glasnost and perestroika in passing'. In fact, Mr Oakes chose to ignore in 'Spender's policy' specific references to radical reformists in Eastern Europe, our welcome of Soviet policy reassessment which led to the INF agreement, and the withdrawal from Afghanistan. He also ignored our call for exploring opportunities for constructive agreements in relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern bloc states and the following statement by me in the policy, which I drafted, on Gorbachev's domestic reforms, namely: Gorbachev is trying to revitalise the system with more economic incentives and competition, individualism and openness, legality and political accountability.",74
157,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: while we are intrigued by the fact that Opposition policy has come to the point of discussing the Soviet Union, this is no longer a question of personal misrepresentation. It is a debate or a presentation of policy. This really is an abuse of this period of time in the House.",74
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I ask the honourable member for North Sydney to wind up and say where he has personally been misrepresented.,74
159,Mr SPENDER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"There are other matters, which I will go to. Mr Oakes also said: . . . it makes no sense to behave as though the cold war is still going on. I entirely agree and I have never at any time suggested that it was still going on.",74
160,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: this really is becoming absurd. This has absolutely nothing to do with a personal explanation. I urge you to ask the honourable gentleman to draw his explanation to a conclusion. He is debating a matter of policy which he could raise as a matter of public importance. That is quite clearly open to him.",74
161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I have already done that. I ask the honourable member for North Sydney to bring his personal explanation to a close.,74
162,Mr SPENDER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I refer then to another statement, concerning me directly, made by Mr Oakes. He said: Henamely 'Spender'conveniently ignores the fact that the US itself has had such an agreement . . . He said that in respect of fishing agreements. I should like to quote, if I may, from a statement which I had previously made-",74
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! The honourable member has gone far enough with his personal explanation.,74
164,Mr SPENDER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Mr Oakes has claimed that I ignored a certain matter.",74
165,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,You have said that you did not and I think you have made that clear.,74

170,Mr SPENDER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"No, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was simply going to make the point that not only did Mr Oakes-",75
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I ask the honourable member to resume his seat.,75
172,Mr SPENDER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Not only did Mr Oakes not get things right; he did not even seek to get things right.,75

178,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"At the end of Question Time today the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) added to his response to a question that he was unable to answer yesterday and claimed that my figures were incorrect. For the record, I say that the Australian Bureau of Statistics document shows 1,031,500 contributor units without health insurance, of which 391,800 live in Queensland. The Prime Minister knows very well that people in Queensland had access-",75
179,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.",75
180,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I inform the Leader of the House that I have been listening carefully to the honourable member.,75
181,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,My point of order is that the honourable member is now going on to debate the matter. He is arguing the position of Queensland. He says he has been misrepresented. There is a very limited ambit for misrepresentation discussions in this House. He can make these points on the adjournment.,75
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,That is certainly the case. I was listening carefully and I am sure the honourable member will not go on to debate the matter but will show where he has been misrepresented.,75
183,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I have no intention of debating the matter. I just want to say what the facts are. The Prime Minister said my figures were incorrect. I seek briefly to show that the Prime Minister was not correct in the assertion he was making. If one takes out Queensland, one is left with 639,700 people. If one takes out those eligible for a health care card, one is left with 449,400 people. If one takes out those who are healthy enough, one is left with 376,500 contribution units.",75
184,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the honourable member is not at all within bounds. Obviously this lengthy debate on statistics is appropriate for the adjournment debate and is not a point of personal misrepresentation. Personal explanations are being consistently abused in this place. Mr Rocher-On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the honourable member is entitled to point out the facts on which he claims he has been misrepresented. He was doing that very concisely. The Leader of the House is anticipating what he mayor may not do. I suggest it is for you to determine whether the honourable member breaches protocol in these matters. The honourable member has not been given the opportunity to point out the basic facts, so that he may then claim to have been misrepresented in a most ungraceful way by the Prime Minister.",75
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I will allow the honourable member to point out to the House where he has been personally misrepresented.,75
186,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I have been personally misrepresented because if one multiplies this last figure by 1.77 one gets 666,000 Australians, not two million as the Prime Minister was suggesting. I have done my homework and I will put my integrity against the Prime Minister's any time.",75
187,Dr HEWSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I seek leave to make a personal explanation.,76
188,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,76
189,Dr HEWSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do.,76
190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member may proceed.,76
191,Dr HEWSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I refer to some comments made by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in Question Time today when he suggested that I had spoken of tax cuts unfunded out of a surplus. I did not. I said they were unfunded in the sense that they were not accompanied by necessary expenditure restraint. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance,76
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LIVING STANDARDS,"Madam Speaker has received a letter from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition  ter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The adverse impact of continued high interest rates and high inflation on living standards flowing from the Treasurer's economic statement. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places to commence this discussion of a matter of public importance by quoting from an editorial in the Australian newspaper of today's date. I will start not at the beginning but with three brief quotations. This refers to last night's economic statement: The inescapable conclusion is that it no longer has a policy other than preserving the accord with the trade unions. That refers to the Government. Earlier the editorial says: But having finally admitted that the key forecasts of the Budget cannot be achieved, the Government still has not explained what its economic strategy is, or detailed its revised forecasts. On the contrary, it has even covered up its own calculations. Those two statements are damning enough, but let me take the House to the first paragraph: The most telling assessment of the contents of the Hawke Government's package of give-a ways is Mr Keating's statement: 'If a Government cannot run wages in Australia it cannot run the Australian economy.' Last night the Government disqualified itself from running the Australian economy. And that is it. The editorial in the Australian said that.",76
193,Mr KEATING,LIVING STANDARDS,"Written by a rabid right winger.  all those people in the audience on the television program last night; 99 per cent of them vote Labor but the Treasurer (Mr Keating) was into them as tories. He would not have a bar of them because they would not listen to him. Honourable members know what happened last night, of course. Those people came along here last night and they could see through the cruel hoax that the statement was and the cynicism that they felt is rampant today. I will not confine myself if the Treasurer wants to do a good spray around of the editorial writer of the Australian. Let us get on to his old mate Paddy MCGuinness.",76
194,Mr KEATING,LIVING STANDARDS,"He is just as mad.  sard by saying that it ought to go on the record. Paddy MCGuinness wrote in the Australian: The saddest thing about all this is that iit shows that the Treasurer, who not so long ago was offering himself as a source of dynamism and new ideas that would infuse a government of which he would be the Prime Minister, has shown that he is devoid of ideas, groping for support, lacking in dynamism, and hopelessly lost in a policy blind alley. There may have been a parting of the ways in recent times, for which fact we are sorry, but Ross Gittins-a former close friend of the Treasurer and certainly an advocate for the policies he was pursuing-wrote: At last Paul Keating's new economic strategy is revealed: Step 1, get re-elected. Step 2, worry about the economy after the election . . . But you don't need a degree in economics to find the catch. It's the pressing matter Mr Keating hardly mentioned: interest rates. And that is it-interest rates, and that is the motivation for this matter of public importance. The Government's tax cuts and wage rises will be swallowed up by high interest rates, high inflation and high taxes. At Question Time I heard the Prime Minister refer to some quinella in answering a question and relating it to the performance of the previous Government. I can do one better than that. I can refer to the Keating trifecta. Last night we got the usual Keating trifecta-high inflation, high interest rates and hyperbole-and so much of it. This economic statement is at root a recipe for high interest rates and high inflation. The Treasurer can give the editorial writer a' spray, but nothing he says in here can take away from the fact that the Managing Director of the National Australia Bank Ltd, Mr Nobby Clark has predicted that under the current economic policies pursued by the Treasurer, mortgage interest rates will increase further. Last night the Treasurer did not even give the nation a forecast of inflation. The forecast for average weekly earnings appears on the low side. With no guarantee of productivity improvements, wages growth will fuel inflationary pressures, leaving nobody better off. Because wages are unrelated virtually to productivity, the increases will fuel inflation. The Treasurer came in here and told the House about the wages accord and award restructuring. His wages policy, dressed up as award restructuring, involves stitching up a deal with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) leadership and shoving it down the throats of all Australian employers and businesses which are forced to live with the consequences. The headline of the Australian editorial I quoted from reads: 'A package for the ACTU, not Australia'. We ought to get Kelty along here, bring him to the bar of the House and let him tell us-",76
195,Mr KEATING,LIVING STANDARDS,"He would eat you alive.  mate: if he came in here, we would be hearing from the ventriloquist and not the dummy; so bring him in. And if he comes in we might ask him about how the Treasurer consummated this little deal last weekend. The Treasurer got into bed with him over the weekend and I would like to ask whether he still respected you in the morning. I would like him in here to answer a few of these questions. The Treasurer has implicated what he calls a wages policy. He ought to have a look at it. I have a document here and, as I said, it it like a grid; everything connects to everything. That is interesting. Either Lenin or Marx said years ago that everything related to everything and everything connected to everything. It is interesting that it should have been one of those two because, just on the point of Lenin and Marx, the Treasurer is about the only person running an economy these days who is going backwards and trying to centralise things. Even in the Soviet Union the Government is trying to free the system up-but not the Treasurer here. I have here the new wages policy of the Government, that is, the national wage case submission of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It was the old award restructuring which was accepted by the Government. It is in the form of a grid. The Treasurer drops the Government's wages policy in the grid; he gives a figure to the metals industries as an increase and off the policy goes, all over the grid. The increase is given to the fitter, the carpenter and the building industry. It is a most unbelievable proposition. This wages policy is already the most unsuccessful wages policy in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries because it has delivered high inflation in every year, abysmal productivity growth, low real wages, one of the highest unit labour costs in the OECD countries and total factor productivity declining by 0.2 per cent a year. The Treasurer talks about a wages policy that increases wages in relation to productivity. We have had an increase of only 0.5 per cent in productivity. That is all the Treasurer has given. I would be totally ashamed if I was the Treasurer and I said that productivity was only 0.5. It would not, of course, happen under us. We give employers and employees the right to negotiate at the enterprise or industry level to take account of what is transpiring in their own area. If they do not want to do it and they want to remain within the Treasurer's so called centralised system, we will amend the Industrial Relations Act and require the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to take account of productivity, employment, inflation and international competition. That is vastly different; it is related to what is actually happening. That is a wages policy. It is not like the grid that I have here where the Treasurer drops a wages policy in and it spews through wherever it moves, with everything going up, thus retreating to the old comparative wage justice notion and further cementing rigidities at a time when the test has to be for this economy. If the Treasurer was right about freeing up the financial system and the banks, the test is to free up the labour market, and the party which can do it is the party to govern Australia. That is the point. It is not the person who can fit into this slot or grid. That is the harsh reality today.",77
196,Mr KEATING,LIVING STANDARDS,"You wouldn't know what you were doing.  terjecting. I will use the phrase that he used again last night: if a government cannot run wages in Australia, it cannot run the Australian economy. We have heard what the Australian newspaper thinks about that. We think that the Treasurer is right. The Treasurer has the worse wages policy. The Treasurer is running the economy into the ground with low living standards and huge foreign debt. Unlike the Government, as I have just explained, we are free to formulate our own wages policy giving back to employers and employees in factories and at the industry level the right to settle working conditions and wages. We will give back to Australian workers the right to organise their own affairs and, hence, the opportunity to raise productivity and real wages. That; in association with the amendments that I talk of in terms of the direction of the Industrial Relations Commission, is a real wages policy. It is not some dolliedup version of a centralised system with rigidities given to the Government by the ACTU. After the tax changes, there is one inexorable fact, that is, the Treasurer will continue to hold his position as Australia's highest taxing Treasurer in postwar history. He is the highest taxing Treasurer in the history of the nation. We know of the figures and the fiddling that the Government is about. Whether one is on average weekly earnings or cutting into the top rate when one earns $35,000, we know· of the impact of high rates of taxation under this Government. Even the tax cuts make negligible changes to the top marginal rate for wage earners earning above $20,600 per annum. This is well below average weekly earnings. As a result, there will be very little additional incentive for Australians earning more than $20,600 to work and to save. At the end of the year, most Australians will be no better off and most Australians will still have little incentive to work harder. The Treasurer's gamble with the living standards of Australians will simply not pay off. This wage-tax deal, as I said near the outset, is a cruel hoax. In one breath, the Treasurer offers tax cuts but in the very next he sets an economic policy which will devour the tax cuts. What he gives with the one hand he takes away with the three. It is the old trifecta again-other than the hyperbole-of high interest rates, high inflation and more tax. What we witnessed last night was a total abrogation, of economic leadership by this Government in the pursuit of a cheap election bribe. This out of touch Treasurer, as I sat with him in a studio last night, could not camprehend the disillusianment of the Australian people with what he had introduced. As I said last night, the Budget strategy remains in tatters with every projectian gone asunder. Inflation .was to be 4.5 per cent; it is nearly dauble that. It is certainly well in excess af 7 per cent-claser to. 8 per cent. Interest rates were to come down; they have gone up. The balance of payments was to have impraved; it has deteriorated. It maved me to. sayan ane occasion that the cansequence now is that the natianal accaunts laak like the balance sheet of the Victarian Division af the Natianal Safety COJlncil af Australia. It is not something to be proud of. There is no forecast, nevertheless, of inflation. There is no forecast despite high inflation and high interest rates that are crippling people. Perhaps the Treasurer is having difficulty counting; I do not knaw. Last year I recall saying that he was forced to. caunt on eight fingers. That left him twa to say 'G'day' to. the Prime Minister-but he was having a battle at that time. His campaign manager has gane to bed. He has given up that naw. So I suppose he is counting with eight fingers and the other two are permanently crossed. That is about all that Australia has going for it at the moment. At root the statement was a disgrace. At root the Treasurer produced a hoax. The Treasurer has been doing interviews around Australia today and so have I. I have never known a reaction like it. Commentator after commentator has seen through what the Treasurer has done. It is a sham and the Australian people will take it out on the Treasurer and the retribution will be strong. If the Treasurer thinks that he can pull a ploy like that and get support, brother, has he got something coming. As a political ploy, last night's statement was a disgrace. It was a failure. As an economic policy, last night's statement was a disgrace and a failure. That pretty well sums up the record of this Government. It is a disgrace and a failure to millions of Australians who have seen through the Treasurer's hoax last night. No amount of moving the figures around and stroking the platitudes until they purr will give the Treasurer anything but a warm inner glow. Those who are struggling at the end of the day know that an environment of high inflation and high interest rates will simply erode the benefit of their tax cuts. They know not only that the wages rises, will be hit by more taxation but also that the fact that they are unrelated to productivity means that the Treasurer will fuel inflation. Whilst we have all the dressage in advance of the event, with the posing of economic responsibility as a guise of the means whereby the Treasurer was bringing in a responsible statement, we have one that will continue to have Australians living with depressed living standards and with little chance at all. If the Treasurer pulls this as an election ploy, he is closer to a kamikaze pilot than I ever thought.",78
197,Mr KEATING,LIVING STANDARDS,"The speech by the honourable mem entertaining. He really missed his calling as either a horse owner or an actor. I suppose it is true he knows more about horses than the rest of us but he does not know much about economics. At' the moment the key thing is to know about economics and public policy and not about horses. All his comments ab'out dressage, horses, strutting and the rest come, as an old show pony from Flemington, as an easy jump across the lobes to produce. But the fact is that it is not an easy jump when it comes to a bit of substantial policy. We hear about the Australian newspaper. Of course, journalists at the Australian think they are a bunch of William F. Buckley Juniors putting forward the new conservative model. But honourable members should just cop this. The editorial in the Australian says: The package imposes a wage equivalent rise of 12 per cent on the economy . . . That is, the Australian newspaper bases an editorial on a wage cost on the economy twice what it actually will be. That is not called conservatism; that is just plain incompetence. The wage cost to the employers and to the nation is 6t per cent. Yet the Australian says: Yet the package imposes a wage equivalent rise of 12 per cent on the economy. Some paper cut-out of William F. Buckley Jr tapped away in fury at the typewriter to produce this drivel for the rest of us this morning. We will say no more about him. The modest agenda of Paddy McGuinness-the real wage overhang, do honourable members remember that?-was drummed into our heads by him over about five or six years along with a few other modest, objectives. We met that. We exceeded his modest agenda in 15 months. He has had it in for us ever since. There is nothing like the wrath of the jilted guru. The fact is that he has now addressed it to that right wing broadsheet-the Australian newspaper-where he can prosper with this right wing rot. It was not that long ago that Paddy was wandering down Fleet Street in a bowler hat with a black rolled-up parasol playing the London banker number. He then got into the black priest-like uniform and played the economic guru, the salvation of Australia. But when we ran past that modest agenda he was awfully chuffed, and he remains chuffed to this day. Good old Paddy. He is now rotting away in the Australian. The honourable member for Kooyong then talked about Ross Gittins. Ross Gittins is somebody I admire. But I say seriously that the sad thing about Ross Gittins is that he does not have the personal courage to write what he actually believes. That is not something that I can say about most journalists but sadly, I now have to say it about Ross. I h-pe that he sees· the error of his ways before long and goes back to being the great journalist he once was. Let me get on to the real issue about award restructuring. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong, talked about shoving it down the throats of employers. In other words, we will shove 6t per cent down the throats of employers when employers would shove l6t per cent down their own throats. Employers would pay a wage increase of 15 to 16 per cent. By using the Budget surplus to carry the lax cuts we are bringing about a cost to employers of 6t per cent. Every employer in the country would have put up a cheer last night knowing that it was not coming out of his pocket but out of the Budget surplus; Yet the shadow Treasurer makes this inane comment about award restructuring and shoving it down the throats of employers. He should listen to the Metal Trades Industry Association or the other people running large companies in the real world of Australian industry and commerce and see what they have to say. He should see what ordinary wage and salary earners and pensioners, the people who have restrained their incomes over these years and whom we now want to assist and support, have to say. They do not speak of that package in his derisory terms. The reason why the package can be delivered is that it is coming from the Government's hardwon Budget surplus: by cutting public sector expenditure over six years; by sitting in the Cabinet room for three or four months at a time, 10 or 11 hours a day, cutting back the profligacy that we inherited from the previous Government. It is only by reducing those outlays to 24 per cent of gross domestic product that we can afford to have tax cuts funding a smaller public sector. That is where the tax .cuts are paid from. The shadow finance spokesman, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), who insists on making a mug of himself, got up after Question Time to make a personal explanation, claiming that tax cuts paid from a Budget surplus are unfunded. He really believes that these tax cuts should have been matched last night with their equivalent value in spending cuts.",79
198,Mr GEAR,LIVING STANDARDS,Which he won'.t nominate.,80
199,Mr KEATING,LIVING STANDARDS,"Which he will not nominate. That is the position of the Opposition. The shadow Treasurer believes that we should have a tri-fiscal policy, but he will not say so, and the' shadow finance spokesman believes that there should be no tax cuts which are not offset-and not just from the surplus. In other words, he believes that we should retain not just the Budget surplus but another $5.5 billion by cutting public expenditure. A couple of weeks ago on the Face to Face program he told us that he would hop into the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs and rip them apart. That was after he said that he would not serve in the lowly position of Minister for Veterans' Affairs. That was below his station in life. Yesterday he said on the AM program, 'We are very concerned about tax cuts that are not substantially funded by cuts in government expenditure'. What he means by that is that there should be more cuts on top of those which this Government has introduced-a further cut of $5 billion to finance tax cuts of $5 billion. In other words, he wants a surplus of $11 billion and he wants the tax cuts to be funded by another round of $5 billion. He reinforced that view by' saying after Question Time today that he believed that the tax cuts ought to be funded by further cuts in Government expenditure. He said on the 'Face to Face program that a Liberal government would make no draconian cuts-only $5 billion worth, and that is on top of the $20 billion worth of cuts under this Government. But where will they come from? He is silent. He does not know. He will 110t say. There are two really compelling charts on page 23 of yesterday's Government statement. One shows overtime relative' to wages growth and the other shows capacity utilisation. Let me just explain the import of these charts. The first chart, which runs from 1966 to 1987, shows that, in 1972-73, when overtime rose, wages followed very quickly and there was a wages explosion. In 1981-82, under the former Government, when overtime rose, although the rise was nothing like that of 1974, a wages explosion still followed very quickly. The table for this period shows overtime at a record level, way beyond any other in the charts, but with wages holding at 5 or 6 per cent.. It is the most amazing illustration of the performance of wages in the economy compared with the performance in two other periods, the last period when the former Government was in office. The capacity utilisation chart shows when the system is straining with full capacity, high capacity utilisation rates. It shows that, in 1972-73, the moment that capacity utilisation peaked a similar shadow peak, the boom in wages, followed. The same thing occurred in 1981-82 but the increase was nowhere near as large. The previous Government got a wages explosion out of a fairly modest lift in capacity utilisation. But, under Labor, there has been a massive lift in capacity utilisation and wages are still running at 5 or 6 per cent. That speaks volumes about this Government, its accord, the trade unions and our running of the Australian economy. Anyone in business or in finance who had any doubts about this period. who looked at those two charts would say, 'How could we return to that?'. This debate is about tax cuts being used from a hard-won Budget surplus to maintain moderate wage outcomes, to keep inflation down, to keep the country competitive and to maintain investment with employmentin other words, to keep economic growth going without the disruption of a recession. That is what our policy is about. It is not designed to buy votes, with an election in mind; it is designed to go straight to the main chance-to keep economic growth going and complete the structural transformation in Australia. We have heard nothing but jeers from the Opposition. There is no recognition of the fact that with these changes we will usher in the greatest change to the award structure of Australian trade unionism and pay scales ever and introduce into. the wages system a totally non-confrontationary model whereby a worker, rather than having a fight with his enterprise employer about his wage rate, can actually get a larger wage increase by training himself or herself to become multiskilled and do a more interesting job. If the worker finds that that does not bring him enough money he can go to another level of multiskilling and receive more money by being more productive in that enterprise. That is one of the largest micro-economic reforms that the Government .has presided over as part of these changes, as part of the agreement with the Australian Council of Trade Unions as to the new wage system that will be established and presided over by the Industrial Relations Commission. That is what is at stake here, but we would never know it from listening to the speech of the honourable member for Kooyong. It was like a speech· that we could have expected in the Sydney Tivoli in the early 1950s-a bit of soft shoe shuffle at the foptlights; a bit of vaudeville; a bit of fun and games; a few empty phrases thrown aro-nd; a couple of old jokes; a few horse jokes from Flemington. That passes as economic debate. We know, because he. has told us, that the fellow who answers the hard, technical argument is the honourable member for Wentworth. He has told us that the shadow Treasurer does the pappy stuff but that he does the hard technical stuff. He is the hard man, but he does not seem to understand the difference between one surplus and the next being the same and not changing the stimulation of the economy from public policy. He wants us to believe that he has all this technical ability but he does not understand a basic economic fact. For example, he did not understand the other day his remark about unfunded tax cuts. That is how the two honourable members opposite behave. They think that Australian companies, the employers-the serious people who run the companies, employ people, run a business, carryall the costs, pay the wages at the end of the week, find business in a competitive market, are competitive, price their products properly and keep the game going-are going to give the jokers on the Opposition side a go, so they can wreck their businesses like they did in 1980-81. The interesting thing is that the whole group is back-the former Treasurer as Leader of the Opposition and his principal economic adviser, the honourable member for Wentworth. He is back on the job, so he can wreck the economy twice. No-one would believe that a political party, having dredged up such a duo once, could do it a second time, but here they are back again. No comment has been made about the fact that low and middle income earners will have their tax burden relieved and that there has been a real change for those people, nor was there any comment about the fact that we have taken pensioners with income in the free· area right outside the tax system. There was no comment about the fact that a taxpayer on about $20,000 with two children has a net tax of zero, or that a taxpayer on $24,000 with three children will also have a net tax of zero. The Opposition could not care less. I ask whether the Opposition, on race day at Flemington Park, cares whether a family on $20,000 with two children has a net tax rate of zero. When His Nibs, the honourable member for Wentworth, drives around Vaucluse in his Ferrari does he care whether someone on $20,000 a year with two kids and living in Blacktown or Bankstown has a net tax rate of zero? He could not care less. He sheds crocodile tears about the public and how it has been duped. The public is a lot smarter than the jokers on the Opposition side of the House think it is. The public understands where value is, and where employment is. This Government has seen a 20 p.er cent growth in the employment rate in six years compared with the 4 per cent in six years achieved by the Opposition. There were all those kids leaving school with no jobs to go to. There was a massive growth in unemployment. There was a high work force growth and no employment. The Opposition achieved a 4 per cent growth in employment in six years and we have achieved five times as much. Yet the Opposition still has the hide to say that it is better when it does not even have the fundamental policy in place-wages. How can the Opposition ask to be taken seriously? At the end of a couple of days of hard debate and exposition of our policy and the changes, I found it was a good opportunity to expatiate upon them and, more than that, to be entertained by the shadow Treasurer and his equally entertaining colleague the honourable member for Wentworth.",80
200,Dr HEWSON,LIVING STANDARDS,"We have just seen a classic Keating performance-with the Treasurer playing the man rather than the issue. In the space of 15 minutes this turkey, the Treasurer, attacked my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Op Australian, Paddy MCG.uinness, and Ross Gittins and he spent a fair bit of time attacking me. Now, of course, he is about to leave rather than stick around for the debate. He has absolutely no interest in serious economic debate. I pick up a couple of points the Treasurer made. For example, when he attacked Paddy MCGuinness he said, 'There is nothing like the wrath of a jilted guru'. What we have seen today is the wrath of a jilted world's greatest Treasurer. This turkey has no understanding of economic debate. He has no capacity to participate in debates on matters of substance, and he just takes cheap shots at anybody who dares to disagree with him. Of Ross Gittins, of whom he has spoken highly in the past as an. individual and a journalist, he says 'He does not have the personal courage to write what he believes'. The Treasurer does not have the personal courage to tell us what he believes; he does not have the personal courage to inform us of the advice that he has received from his Department or, more importantly, the Reserve Bank about the current state of the economy. He does not have the personal courage to come clean. All we got last night was 17 pages of an election speech. We did not get any eco-, nomic analysis. Of the 17 pages a little more than one page was devoted to the economy, in a situation where there is no doubt that the Government's entire economic strategy is in tatters. The Treasurer, in the run-up to the election, is trying to hold things together and get himself re-elected, rather than face up to any· of the economic issues. I remind the House of the situation which existed a few months ago at the time that the Budget was delivered. The Treasurer painted a very optimistic picture of the Australian economy. At that time he talked of how he would control inflation, how the balance of payments would improve, and how he would get a wage-tax trade-off from the union movement. He talked in terms of a zero increase in average weekly earnings as a trade-off for a tax cut to be made in July this year. Since then everything has gone wrong with that strategy. All the forecasts are in total disarray. For example, a key Budget forecast was for a current account deficit of $9.5 billion. It now looks like being $15 billion. That forecast got one sentence in last night's statement. The inflation rate which the Treasurer predicted would fall to 4t per cent by the middle of this year and 3 to 4 per cent by the middle of 1990 also got only one sentence in last night's statement. The whole document presented last night was devoted to the fact that the Treasurer has been decisively rolled by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and that he has been forced by them to eat crow on wages and economic management. It is quite clear that the Treasurer has come here as a puppet. There is no more substance to this man than the strings which are being pulled by Bill Kelty and, perhaps, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) in the preparation of a document like we saw last night. There is no doubt that the Treasurer, who wanted a zerO increase in average weekly earnings a few months ago when his Budget strategy was laid down, has now settled for a substantial wage increase, quite unrelated to productivity, in circumstances in which his Budget is in tatters. The Treasurer is a joke. He says that some people in this place do not know anything about economics. I have never seen him demonstrate any understanding of economics. He constantly demonstrates that he is a total captive of his politicised department and a few of his private office advisers, yet some people who have left his staff now spend all their time pointing out to him just how misguided he is. For example, Professor Barry Hughes, who left the Treasurer some time ago, warned him at the time of the last Budget that his forecasts for wages, prices and the balance of payments would not be achieved. Just the other day Barry Hughes again criticised the Treasurer; he pointed out that the Treasurer is in a balance of payments stranglehold. One the Face to Face program last week he pointed out that the Treasurer had embarked on 'a very high risk strategy'. The wage-tax situation presents a very high risk strategy. Barry Hughes said that we will have to spend most of 1989 hoping that 'something nasty' does not pop up. That is the situation in which the Treasurer finds himself. He is disowned by the thinking media in this country and his past economic advisers and he is a total captive of his present over-politicised Department. The tragedy is that today when we are discussing a very important matter of public importance about what will happen to interest rates and inflation under this Government the Treasurer does not have the grace to lower himself and discuss the basic issues which are of importance to the average Australian. Why is that? It is because the Treasurer's track record in all these areas is absolutely pathetic. He has had a pathetic track record during his time as Treasurer in predicting and controlling the rate of inflation. When one considers the Budget forecasts the Treasurer has made during the last six years, one sees that he has bettered his inflation forecast only once, and that was in the first year. Ever since then he has got it wrong. Not surprisingly, the Treasurer is not prepared to talk about inflation in this place. Of course, he also has a long standing, well established record of playing politics with interest rates and spending all of his time manipulating interest rates for short term political ends. He has no genuine interest in getting interest rates down. He does not care. He has no personal interest in getting interest rates down for the average Australian. He does not care that so far in this financial year the average person is paying $40 more a week-about $2,000 a year-as a result of the increases in home loan interest costs. He has a house in my electorate, which is sitting there unoccupied and allowing him to speculate on the capital gains. He is one of my constituents. I imagine he votes for me! He sits here in Canberra cheating on his expenses rather than dealing with the issues of this fundamentally difficult set of economic circumstances that are before us at this time. Look at his record on interest rates-Mr Cunningham- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. My point of order is that for the honourable member for Wentworth to use terminology in respect of the Treasurer that he did he would need to move a substantive motion. He should be asked to withdraw it. The Treasurer is not cheating on. anything in relation to his allowances in this place.",82
201,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LIVING STANDARDS,I think that particular matter has been canvassed quite considerably in the past. I amsure the Treasurer would be offended by the remarks. I ask the honourable member to withdraw them.,84
202,Dr HEWSON,LIVING STANDARDS,I thought he admitted it in his explanation.,84
203,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LIVING STANDARDS,I ask the honourable member to withdraw.,84
204,Dr HEWSON,LIVING STANDARDS,"I am happy to withdraw. The key point is that the Treasurer is not the slightest bit interested in serious economic debate about these issues. He is prepared, however, to play politics with interest rates, to push them down and to mislead the electorate as he has in the lead-up to every major political contest in recent years, only then to put them up subsequently. Indeed, for most of last year, for example, he was not prepared to admit that he was putting them up. He was not tightening; he kept denying that he. was tightening while he was busily instructing the Reserve Bank of Australia to do differently. In the lead-up to each recent electionthe July 1987 election, the New South Wales election, the Victorian State election last year and the Oxley by-election-there is evidence that interest rates were manipulated by this Government. They were restrained in an upward direction recently, and pushed down in the first two cases in order to create a favourable impression in the eyes of the electorate. The fact is that as a consequence of that sort of political manipulation he set this economy on a roller-coaster. He has had periods of boom followed by periods of bust. He is now coming out· of a period of boom, and has been since the end of 1986 and the pick-up in the terms of trade, and the economy is now dead-set in the direction of an economic bust. Interest rates will 'probably be put higher by this Government, they will ultimately bite and they will ultimately send this country crashing down. The thing he fears most, a pick-up in unemployment, is indeed a very real possibility in the course of this year. The Australian community can look forward to higher interest rates, higher inflation, more bracket creep and job insecurity. All of them in one way or another, will claw back the temporary benefits of last night's mini-Budget, which at best can be described as a cruel hoax.",84
205,Mr GRIFFITHS,LIVING STANDARDS,"Maribyroong) (3.53)The honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) in his opening remarks made his contribution to our balance of payments situation very clear when he said, 'My Ferrari is fine'. As he travels around his electorate in his car worth many hundreds of thousands of dollars, I hope that his constituents reflect on his personal commitment to basic things such as making a choice where possible that ensures that Australian technology and Australian workers gain the benefit. 'My Ferrari is fine' evokes the feeling of just how out of touch some people are. The honourable member went on to criticise the Treasurer (Mr Keating) for allegedly attacking the man. During Question Time he sat next to the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who in his usual way made one of the most vile and personalised interjections ever made in this chamber. But did he distance himself from that attack on the man? Of course he did not. He did not distance himself and he has the opportunity of doing so. He is also the individual who has gained a reputation bar none for attacking the individual integrity of public servants, no matter what their commitment or their length of service. As bipartisan independent public servants, they will be reasonable targets for the invective of the honourable member for Wentworth. The other slur, the other nasty little bit of personal invective and attack, is to imply that the Treasurer is getting a capital gain from his only place of residence. Everyone in this chamber knows that there is no such thing as a capital gain on a principal or sole place of residence but, once again, attacking the man is not too much for the honourable member for Wentworth. Let us go to some of the more important matters that we should be addressing today. In both contributions, that of the honourable member for Wentworth and that of the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia and honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), there was no substantive discussion of the economic issues that from their own mouths are to be regarded as the important areas for debate. The honourable member for Kooyong spent most of his contribution commenting on today's editorials or newspaper coverage. He referred to the accord. One particular editorial alleged that the whole thrust of last night's statement was to ensure the survival of the accord. Of course it is. What is that about? It is about a coherent wages policy. If we look back over the last few years Australian economic history, we will understatement stand that the governments that will retain control of the economy are those governlast ments with a viable wages policy. What hapgoing pened in 1974? There was wage pressure, a wage break-out, inflation, recession and loss. They all happened, and it is a matter of record. In 1981-82 again there was no wages policy. What was the outcome? When pressure built up, reflected first in overtime rates, there was a massive wages break-out and everyone in this chamber knows the result of that: high inflation, recession and massive and unprecedented job loss in this country. In the last year of the previous Governrecord ment hundreds of thousands of people were thrown out of work. When we talk about families, we ought to be talking about a job means. In a society such as ours a job means a decent environment and dignity. is not something that is necessarily important to someone travelling around his electorate in an imported Ferrari. A job means dignity; it means waking up in the morning and entitled knowing that one's kids can get a decent feed and go to school with decent clothing, and that one's environment is conducive one's self-respect. We have a world record in terms of job creation. When we talk about the 1.3 million jobs that we have created, to the other of the House that is something to be critiOpposition's cised. On this side of the House we are proud of the fact that all those factors I have just mentioned are relevant for 1.3 million people and that they have the dignity and security of employment. That is something that everyone on this side of House should continue to be proud of. Let me refer to the numeracy skills of Opposition. The honourable member for position's Kooyong stands up and says that he has heard of the quadrella. He went one better and referred to the Keating trifecta. Even with the repartee in this chamber he cannot get his numeracy skills in order. Let me go back to the wages policy. There is no wages policy on the Opposition side of the chamber. Every Australian and the people in the galleries here today should take the opportunity of listening to the replies of in members of the Opposition to last night's by the Treasurer because I can guarantee one thing: if precedent and the six years of my time in this chamber are to be any guide, they will be verbiage. There will not be a single positive, sensible job recommendation about how members of the Opposition would contain a wages explosion. . We have all their public statements on record. For example, in February last year the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) indicated that by August of last year members of the Opposition would have their policies put together. It is no good my going through the record. John Elliott is on the record. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is on the on. a number of occasions. The Leader of the Opposition is on the record, again as recently as May, as is the honourable memwhat ber for Wentworth. They are all on the record indicating that their policies are about It to arrive. We really would not want to be hanging by our fingernails waiting for those policies to arrive. The Opposition lacks a wages policy. It has produced a document Future Directions but it looks to the past. We should look back for our own analogies. An analogy that comes to my mind to most sharply about the Opposition's wages policy or lack thereof is Henry Lawson's The Loaded Dog. We can all recall the image of that great slobbering dog running around with a stick of dynamite in its mouth and side the fuse burning down. That is what the wages policy represents, because that is precisely the impact it would that have. If we had no wages policy in our those contemporary economic environment we would have this stupid dog running around, wagging its tail exuberantly, with a stick of the dynamite with the fuse burning down. As sure as God made little green apples, the the end result of the implementation of the Opnon-existent wages policy would be a repeat of what we have seen before. We saw it in 1974. We saw it in 1982. The end result would not be some theoretical outcome. The end result would be massive job losses and the commensurate misery that would represent for Australia. Last night's economic statement was really all about politics as the ideas market. It was not only about-although this was important-massive support for ordinary Australian families and pensioners. It was much more fundamental than that. In terms of wages policy it was about a structure and, as the Treasurer indicated, order. In terms of a wages policy it was about award restructuring, in my view, the single most important micro-economic reform that this country has ever grappled with. In terms of the workplace it was about efficiency, competitiveness, productivity and workplace involvement and the quality of workplace involvement for ordinary Australian workers. It was about multiskilling. As I have said, it was a rational framework for wages policy. I would like to have said a number of other things. Let me conclude on this note: in 1974 I was working as a rigger on a construction site. When we talked about what we could do on the wages front we knew that we had one choice, and one choice only. We jumped on that treadmill and we went as hard as we could because we knew that there was no alternative. If we missed out, then we missed out forever. The difference now is that workers in this country know that there is a tax trade-off, that they are guaranteed to get a decent increment to their standard of living, and that a whole raft of other policy areas has been attended to by this Government. It takes the chance out; it puts in certainty. Where there would be chaos under the Opposition, we offer order.",84

Ordered that the reports be printed.",86
209,Mr HOLLIS,WORKS,"by leave-The reports which I have just tabled bring the number of reports tabled this year to nine and bring to $222.15m the expenditure· recommended by the Committee to date in 1989. The report relating to the Army's Logistics and Training Complex at Bandiana, Victoria, represents the first stage of a major redevelopment of this complex at an estimated cost of $68m at August 1988 prices. Phase A of stage 1 will commence in mid-1989 while phase B will commence in 1992-93 with completion of both phases scheduled for mid1995. In recommending the redevelopment to the Parliament, the Committee has drawn attention to two matters which it believes require further examination by the Department of Defence and Australian Construction Services. These are: the need for Defence to examine and review security arrangements at the Bandiana complex; and the need for Defence and Australian Construction Services to re-examine the location of the distribution centre, as the Committee is concerned that it is proposed to be built over an existing water channel. The Committee's report relating to the upgrade of living-in accommodation at HMAS Cerberus, Crib Point, Victoria, at an estimated cost of $15.7m at September 1988 prices is the second report the Committee has tabled this yeartelating to the Navy's main training establishment. The Committee's second report of 1989 related to the construction of new communications and recruit schools. The objective of this proposal is to upgrade accommodation buildings at HMAS Cerberus to provide a standard of under living-in accommodation which is as close current service scales and standards as the existing building envelopes and layouts mit. The conversion of existing four-bed rooms to two single cabins will create shortage of junior sailor accommodation which will be overcome by the construction of an additional junior sailor accommodation block. The final report I have tabled relates the development of RAAF Base, Wagga, New South Wales, at an estimated cost of $23.6m at April 1988 prices. RAAF Base, Wagga, is the RAAF's main base for techboth nical training and the proposal reported by the Committee allows for the construc- $80m at Mulwala. tion of a number of new buildings, the refurbishment of a number of existing buildings and the upgrading of engineering services. recommending the construction of the work in this reference the Committee has comingly, mented on a number of issues which require examination by Defence and Australian Construction Services.. The Committee believes that Defence should commence negotiations with the State Rail Authority with the aim of resuming the rail easement through the Base. The ComCerberus mittee is concerned regarding the location the proposed fire station and the apparent lack of an adequate fire and emergency servthat ice to the airfield and has recommended this matter be further examined. The ComCommittee. mittee has also drawn attention to the fact that the flammable goods bulk store appears to· be located too close to accommodation blocks and has recommended that either be relocated or that appropriate mounding and landscaping be provided. I commend the reports to the House.",86
210,Mr TIM FISCHER,WORKS,"by leaveformer Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not wish to take too much time because I know that my colleagues also wish to speak on these public works projects. Commendably, they decenWagga, tralise certain aspects of defence in this country. I was with the Parliamentary ing Committee· on Public Works when it visited the Albury-Wodonga military area for the detailed hearings in relation I point out that the Committee had some foresight because the drainage system which the Committee was concerned about has been intense pressure in the last four weeks to because of the bizarre seasonal conditions which apply across much of south-east Auspertralia. They will possibly lead to a green drought. .Farmers this year may not even a have the opportunity to sow their wheat crops, let alone harvest them. I commend that aspect of the Committee's report relating to the complex at Bandiana and point out that that, combined with the to decentralisation of the Mulwala explosives factory which the Committee reported on last year, will lead to a big boost in the border region, with an economic impact on sides of the border .. The expenditure on totals some $148m-$68m at Bandiana and I will leave the Royal Australian Air Force In Base at Wagga to my colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife). Interestit will impact on the old railway line that runs through the base. I know that the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) welcomes the expansion at HMASCerberus. I mention as an afterthought that if the Committee could have been so generous as to recommend an extra bridge to Phillip Island from the other side-that is, from the side-it might well .have eased the of .burden of problems such as those created with the Grand Prix last week. But I realise such a recommendation would have been that outside the terms of reference of the MrFIFE (Hume)-by leave-I will not delay the House very long. I just want to it commend the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for the detailed work that it has undertaken in relation to the matters currently before the House. As a Deputy Chairman of the Committee, I know of the work entailed. In respect of the report on the development of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base at Wagga I was present during the period of the Committee's visit to Wagga Wagga. I Standwant to thank members of the Committee for the interest they took and the detailed questioning that they participated in in relato that area. tion to this project. The Government proposes to spend of the order of $23.6m in April 1988 prices in upgrading the RAAF base at Wagga. This upgrading commenced in 1981 when the former Government was in office, and I am delighted that this Government has seen fit to pursue the matter. The RAAF base at Wagga is of tremendous importance to the RAAF. It is its school for technical training. All young people who enter the RAAF for technical training pass through the city of Wagga Wagga and the RAAF base there. Literally tens of thousands have gone through since it was established. They are fine young people. There is a trelllendous rapport between the RAAF base and the city of Wagga Wagga. Sometimes these institutions tend to be apart from rather than a part of a centre. In this case, as in the case of the Army base on the other side of Wagga, Kapooka-there is a tremendous link between the city and the institution. The only comment of a substantive nature that I wish to make relates to the recommendation that land be resumed from the State Rail Authority. The rail link concerned is not now being used by the State Rail Authority, and I think it would assist the RAAF to have control of the land. without being impeded by the existence of a line which is not being used. I appreciate, of course, that the State will probably require the Comqlonwealth to undertake to re-establish the line should it be required in the future. I am sure that it will not be required in the future, and I support the recommendation of the Committee.",87
211,Mr EWEN CAMERON,WORKS,"by leave-I would like to join my colleague the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) in congratulating the Standing Committee on Public Works on its report. I would like to refer particularly to the $68m project at Bandiana, which is at Wodonga in the electorate of Indi. I note that the Committee recommends that the Department of Defence examine and review security arrangements at the Bandiana military complex. I fully concur with that recommendation. There is certainly a great necessity for that because of the very valuable equipment housed in that area. I know that the present security arrangements have been just adequate until now, but for the future I think they will have to be strengthened to a large degree. I would like to draw attention to a matter outside the ambit of the Committee. The offbase housing situation in that area will have to be looked at very seriously by the Government due to the increased number of personnel that will be based at Bandiana. Of course, there will be on-base accommodation, which is covered in the report, but there will also be a great necessity for offbase housing. I commend the Committee on its finding. .

213,Mr WILLIS,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill 1989 is the second and final stage of legislative. changes to implement the Government's reform package for Telecom Australia, announced in the ministerial statement of 25 May 1988, 'Reshaping the Transport and Communications' Government Business Enterprises'. The first stage was implemented by the Telecommunications Amendment Act 1988. A central plank in the Government's micro-economic reform agenda for restructuring the public sector is. that government business enterprises-GBEsL-should be as efficient as possible and responsive to consumers' needs. The GBEs within the Transport and Communications portfolio, in addition to producing final goods and services for consumers, also produce intermediate inputs for the rest of the economy, with a resulting impact on Australia's overall cost structures and the ability of Australian businesses to compete internationally. Telecommunications is an increasingly important input factor in the production of other goods and services by Australian business for supply to domestic and international markets. The Government sees the commercialisation of GBEs as a necessary and fundamental pre-condition to improvements in efficiency. GBEs such as Telecom are being placed on a more commercial footing, bringing them more into line with private sector competitors, and subjecting them increasingly to the disciplines of the marketplace. Implementation of the Telecom reform package, together with real reductions in the average price of a basket of basic telecommunications services through the price control formula CPI-X, will bring about increased efficiencies and economies in the provision of telecommunications services by the public sector. As announced in the 25 May 1988 statement, the reform package strategy for Telecom has as its key elements the implementation of a new corporate and financial structure, establishment of new planning and accountability mechanisms, modification of major strategic controls and removal of day to day ministerial controls. The Telecommunications Amendment Act 1988 was principally concerned with putting in place the new corporate structure and removing ministerial controls. In particular, from 1 January 1989 the Australian Telecommunications Commission-Telecom-was renamed the Australian Telecommunications Corporation. Telecom became a statutory corporation, with a separate Board of Directors, instead of commissioners who were members of the Commission. This structural change did not change Telecom's legal identity or status, but the separation of the enterprise and the Board assisted in a clearer definition of the roles of the Government as owner, the Board accountable for performance and Telecom management responsible for operations. In line with the philosophy of moving from oversight of the proceeds to an emphasis on results, the Telecommunications Amendment Act 1988 also removed a range of controls over day to day activities such as approval of individual contract and borrowing proposals. These are now appropriately the responsibility of the Board. This Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill 1989 replaces the Telecommunications Act 1975, under which Telecom is established, with a new Act, planned to operate from 1 July 1989. The provisions in the Telecommunications Act dealing with regulatory issues are now contained in the Telecommunications Bill 1989, which establishes the new regulatory body Austel. The Australian Telecommunications Corporation will continue in· operation, again with no change of legal identity or legal status. The provisions in the Bill relating to appointment of directors and meetings of the Board, appointmertt of the Managing Director, and employment conditions for Telecom staff repeat, without significant changes, the new provisions inserted by the Telecommunications Amendment Act 1988. Telecom's functions and 'powers have been redefined. The Bill emphasises Telecom's principal role as a provider of domestic telecommunications services, but it has subsidiary functions allowing it to engage in other business or activities related to telecommunications within and outside Australia, related to telecommunications, and incidental functions allowing it to conduct other business in the course of fulfilling its principal role. The Bill provides Telecom with all the powers necessary to carry out its functions. The Bill places commercial, community service and general obligations on Telecom, to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice. It is an integral feature of the reform packages for GBEs that commercial performance is the primary responsibility of the enterprises. However, this does not detract from Telecom's social responsibility to provide universal service, that is, to deliver its community service obligations (CSOs). Telecom's statutory CSO is the supply of a standard telephone service as efficiently and economically as practicable. This service must be reasonably accessible to all people and on an equitable basis wherever they reside or carry out business within Australia. Also there is a requirement that service performance standards reasonably meet the social, industrial and commercial needs of the Australian community. The importance of meeting CSOs is evident in the corporate planning process I describe later. Telecom's plan for, and delivery of, CSOs are part of the accountability measures of the Board. The costs involved will be separately identified and will be taken into account in fixing the financial target Telecom is expected to meet. Austel has the function of monitoring and reporting on Telecom's delivery of its CSOs. Telecom is also required to comply with directions by the Minister and, where these are notified in writing, government policies. The Bill provides for the remaining key elements of the reform strategy, which are the implementation of a new capital and financial structure and the establishment of new planning and accountability mechanisms. The Bill also provides for Telecom's initial capital to be determined by the Minister for Transport and Communications as soon as possible after commencement, which will involve conversion of some part of existing Commonwealth loans to capital. Telecom's assets will be revalued before 1 July 1989. Following this, the Government will determine an appropriate debt-to-equity ratio for Telecom on a basis comparable to leading telecommunications companies in other parts of the world. Telecom's assets will be revalued at least once every five years in accordance with normal commercial practice. The Bill gives Telecom a commerciallyoriented financial structure with the usual commercial obligations to pay taxes and charges and appropriate dividends on owner's equity. The removal of day to day controls means Telecom is no longer subject to routine oversight by Government of the way it carries on business. This Bill provides for more structured oversight by the government, as owner, of the objectives and strategies proposed by Telecom and for the Government to indicate the financial target it expects Telecom to achieve. The Board of Telecom will be required to prepare and revise a corporate plan for a period of between three and five years, the first plan commencing on 1 July 1989. The corporate plan will set out the objectives of Telecom and its subsidiaries and outline the overall strategies and policies it must follow to achieve those objectives, including meeting its CSOs. Financial matters to be included in the corporate plan include an overall financial target to be agreed with the Minister, overall pricing, investment and borrowing strategies and estimates of the costs of carrying out CSOs and general governmental obligations. The Board is to provide the Minister with a copy of the corporate plan. The Minister can direct the Board, within 30 days, to vary the financial target and/or the strategies and policies to meet its CSOs or both. The Bill also provides for other accountability requirements, including timely presentation of annual reports and financial statements audited by the Auditor-General; disclosure of the objectives, strategies, policies, operations and performance of Telecom and its subsidiaries, and details relating to CSOs. The Board will also be required to give the Minister prior notification of significant business activities in which Telecom and its subsidiaries propose to engage or in which they cease to participate. Telecom will be subject to taxation under State and Territory laws from 1 July 1989. Transitional provisions are set out in the accompany""ing Telecommunications and Postal Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill. Telecom's current exemption from other State and Territory laws will continue until a sunset provision in the Bill comes into force on 30 December 1990. This can be extended by regulation generally, or for particular laws or classes of laws. With the enactment of this Bill the Government will have substantially completed the implementation of the key elements of the Telecom reform package. Some other aspects of reforms have been completed. These include revised industrial relations monitoring arrangements. Controls relating to Telecom's borrowings, executive remuneration and superannuation are under progressive review. The Government has put in place the key elements of its reform strategy for Telecom including planning and accountability mechanisms. These, in conjunction with the measures reflected in the Telecommunications Bill 1989, will significantly change the Australian telecommunications industry. I commend this Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Braithwaite) adjourned. NA CORPORATION BILL 1989 Bill presented by Mr Willis, and read a first time.

It is an integral feature of the reform packages for GBEs that commercial performance is the primary responsibility of the enterprises. However, it does not detract from Australia Post's social responsibility to provide universal service; that is, to deliver its community service obligations (CSOs). Australia Post's statutory CSOs include the provision of a letter service available at a single uniform rate of postage for carriage within Australia, by ordinary post, of letters that are standard postal articles. Also there is a requirement that service performance standards must reasonably meet the social, industrial and commercial needs of the Australian community. The importance of meeting CSOs is evident in the corporate planning process I shall describe. Australia Post's plans for, and delivery of, CSOs are part of the accountability measures of the Board. The costs involved will be separah-ly identified and will be taken into account in fixing the financial target Australia Post is expected to meet. This Bill changes significantly the way reserved services are handled compared with the Postal Services Act 1975. In that Act it was a criminal offence for anyone other than Post to carry a letter for reward, with some exceptions. 'Letter' was not defined and this has made it difficult to mount prosecutions. In the Corporation Bill 'letter' is defined broadly. Post is given the exclusive right to carry letters in Australia and between Australia and overseas but there are a number . of exceptions to that exclusive right. Australia Post's power to enforce the reseFved services provisions will be through the ability to seek an injunction, damages or an account of profits in the Federal Court. This should have two advantages: the issue will be dealt with in one superior court; it should allow more consideration by the court of the justification for reserved services and the effects of an infringement on the capacity· of Post to meet its CSOs. Post also has the exclusive right to issue postage stamps but no monopoly on their sale. Australia Post is also required to comply with directions by the Minister and, where these are notified in writing, Government policies. The Bill also provides for the remaining key elements of the reform strategy, implementation of a new capital and financial structure and establishment of new planning and accountability mechanisms. The Bill provides for Australia Post's initial capital to be determined by the Minister for Transport and Communications as soon as possible after commencement, which will involve conversion of some part of existing Commonwealth loans to capital.

(TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1989 Bill presented by Mr Willis, and read a first time. Second Reading",91
215,Mr WILLIS,POSTAL SERVICES,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is related to the Telecommunications Bill 1989, the Australian Telecommunications 'Corporation Bill 1989 and the Australian Postal Corporation Bill 1989. It repeals the Telecommunications Act 1975 and the Postal Services Act 1975, which are replaced by the new legislation and makes consequential amendments to other Acts. It also includes transitional provisions for the imposition of ,income tax and State and Territory taxes and charges, and for other purposes. The Bill inserts new parts in the Crimes Act 1914 covering postal and telecommunications offences, covering the same ground as in the existing legislation. However, the opportunity has been taken to, revise the offences, taking into account developments since 1975 and treating Aust-alia Post and the three carriers-Telecom Australia, Overseas Telecommunications Commission Australia (OTC) and Aussat Pty Ltdconsistently. In some cases the existing Telecom and Australia Post offences are adequately covered by general Crimes Act provisions and have not been repeated. The consistent treatment of the three carriers is desirable because of the natiomtl importance of the telecommunications network and services and an exception has been made to the general classification of Commonwealth bodies for the Crimes Act. OTC and Aussat will be deemed to be public authorities for all purposes under the Crimes Act, and their employees, including people who perform services for and. on behalf of Aussat and OTC and their employees, will be treated in the same way as Commonwealth officers. This inclusion of OTC and Aussat within the Crimes Act umbrella is a temporary measure only and is subject to the Government's decision about which, if any, of its business enterprises should be so protected. At present, Telecom and Post security personnel investigate offences under their Acts in cooperation with the Australian Federal Police, under guidelines about the break-up of responsibilities. This situation will continue. However, we have made one important change. Under the existing legislation, Telecom and Australia Post employees and any other person are given a power of arrest without warrant for certain property offences. There will be no such powers conferred under the new legislation. The Bill repeals redundant provisions in the OTC and Satellite Communications Acts to be covered in the new Telecommunications Act and makes minor consequential amendments to bring the language into line with the language in the Telecom and Australia Post Acts. Australia Post and Telecom will be subjected to State taxes and charges from commencement, planned for 1 July 1989. The Bill provides that the enterprises will not be subject to stamp duty or similar duties on property acquired, transactions entered into or securities issued, before the commencing day. The transitional taxation provisions in the Bill complement the details of the imposition of income tax on Australia Post and Telecom from the 1990-91 year of income and provide for arrangements to apply in respect of valuation of trading stock, capital gains tax and depreciation. Austel, established by the new Telecommunications Act, will investigate complaints about failure to provide telecommunications services, connect customer equipment or perform cabling work. The Bill amends the Ombudsman Act 1976 to give the Ombudsman a discretion not to investigate such complaints where Austel would deal with them more effectively, and for the transfer of the complaints. In deciding whether or not to issue licenc·es under the Radiocommunications Act 1983 and when imposing conditions on such licences, the Minister for Transport and Communications will now be able to take into account the policy for the regulation of telecommunications networks stated in division 1 of part 3 of the new Telecommunications Act. Part 9 of the Bill contains a number of consequential amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. That Act currently affords protection from interception to communications passing over telecommunications systems provided by or with the authority of Telecom. The Act also provides for the interception of such communications in the limited circumstances specified in the Act, such as under a warrant or in connection with the operation or maintenance of the telecommunications system. However, with the enactment of the Telecommunications Act 1989, both OTC and Aussat will also be able to supply certain domestic telecommunications services. The amendments to the Telecommunications Interception Act take account of these changes to the telecommunications industry. They are designed to preserve the ambit of the Act's prohibition on interception of communications, the scope of the provisions allowing for interceptions, and the communication of information obtained thereby, in specified circumstances. I commend this Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Braithwaite) adjourned. WHEAT MARKETING BILL 1989 Bill presented by Mr Kerin, and read a first time. Second Reading",93
216,Mr KERIN,POSTAL SERVICES,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to introduce new marketing arrangements for the wheat industry and thereby establish a sound future for one of Australia's most important export earners. In a speech to the annual conference of the Grains Council of Australia (GCA) last year, I invited the industry to take the opportunity of the need for a new wheat marketing Act and the report of the Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport to think seriously about the future structure of the wheat industry and its position in the Australian and world economy. It is a matter of some regret that the GCA has been unable to articulate a vision for the""future of its industry and has adopted a position of non-negotiability on the major issues. While the GCA has been arguing for the status quo it seems not to understand that this is an industry which has been undergoing continuous and, in some cases, quite major change. For instance: wheat growing is becoming part of a broader grains industry in which more growers are prepared to make changes in their cropping based on relative prices. The industry has recently weathered extremely unfavourable market conditions caused by heavy export subsidisation by the United States (US) and the European Community (EC). Wheat purchasers are becoming more specific about the quality characteristics they seek. Australian Wheat Board (A WB) operations have changed significantly over the last decade. For instance, the Board is now a significant offshore borrower. More recently the AWB has provided growers with more flexible delivery options through the introduction of pool cash out arrangements, warehousing and a special stock feed segregation. The domestic market has already been partially deregulated with the introduction of permits for feed wheat and continued black market trading. Growers have been getting more experience of alternative methods of selling their grain. Even the GCA has recognised this through its recent establishment of the National Grain Exchange. The industry has shown that it can respond to the pressures for change. It must continue to have this flexibility. The wheat market is currently very buoyant due to a combination of crop shortages and a rundown in United States stocks. However, the mechanisms which encourage overproduction in some countries remain in place. We are seeking through the General Agreement on Tariffs and. Trade Uruguay Round to have these measures wound back, and I am very pleased that during recent negotiations in Geneva progress was achieved in setting out a long and short term framework for liberalising agricultural trade. However, much remains to be done and, as I have said before, Australia cannot compete with the treasuries of the US and EC. We can only respond to difficulties on the world market by ensuring that we not only grow but also handle and market our grain as efficiently as possible. This objective cannot be achieved while unnecessary regulation and controls limit the AWB's effectiveness and impose extra costs on growers and users of wheat. The Bill contains provisions to retain the AWB's export monopoly, but to open up more choice for growers by deregulating the domestic wheat market. In place of the compulsion contained in the current marketing arrangements, the Government is introducing a range of measures to extend the AWB's commercial powers and flexibility to ensure that it will be able to compete effectively in a deregulated market. The Bill also gives effect to the Government's concern to minimise its own control over the AWB's operations and to extend the Board's accountability to growers. The AWB will not be weakened, as has been claimed, but will be significantly strengthened. Specifically, and most importantly, the AWB will have clear powers to buy wheat for cash. This will enable it to remain a force in the domestic market, but will also ensure that it has the flexibility to access particular qualities of wheat for export if these are not made available through the pooling system. Second, while the AWB's principal objective will remain the marketing of wheat, it will have the scope to market other grains and wheat grown in other countries where this assists its own wheat marketing effort. Third, the AWB will still be able to pool returns, but it will have flexibility in deciding how to conduct these operations. Under the current Wheat Marketing Act there is a single Australian standard white (ASW) pool with differentials established for other grades. This leads to inflexibility. Ul)der the new legislation the AWB will be able to establish separate pools for separate grades or time periods. This, together with a wider range of payment options, will provide greater scope for responding to market movements. I should also point out that the legislation does not make any specific requirements of the AWB regarding its pooling activities and the balance between these and any direct trading in wheat. This will be for the AWB and growers to decide in consultation. The AWB will also have powers to enable it to establish subsidiary companies and to engage in other commercial activities such as countertrade, processing, storage and handling. To assist these activities the legislation will also provide for an industry fund to provide the AWB with a much needed capital base. I will elaborate on arrangements for the fund later in this speech. To complete its marketing powers the AWB must be able to operate within States. The Government urges the State governments to ensure that the Board is not weakened by the lack of appropriate facilitating legislation. A significant issue for Australian grain producers is the cost associated with the storage, handling and transport of their product. The Royal Commission identified that in 1987-88 these costs were equivalent to around 22 per cent of the f.o.b. price for wheat. It recommended a series of deregulatory moves which included the removal of sole receival rights for grain handling authorities, removal of restrictions on the transport of wheat in certain States and the disaggregation of charges for these services to enable growers to make informed decisions about least cost grain paths. The Royal Commission estimated that these changes could lead to potential resource cost savings of up to $10 per tonne. The Commonwealth Government has endorsed the broad thrust of the Royal Commission's findings and last year amended the Wheat Marketing Act to provide the AWB with choice in contracting for grain distribution services and to disaggregate charges to growers. Much of the responsibility for putting the Royal Commission's recommendations into effect rests with the State governments. However, New South Wales is the only State to announce a positive response. If the AWB and other grain trading corporations are to realise the savings estimated by the Royal Commission, they must have the scope to use least cost methods of handling and moving grain. The amendments to the 1984 Wheat Marketing Act, which I have already mentioned, were a step in this direction. However, some States have chosen to deny growers the opportunity of benefiting from the potential savings by continuing monopoly practices in their handling and transport sectors. May I provide some examples. In Victoria, section 188 of the 1983 Transport Act restricts the mode of transport of certain goods. Bulk wheat, barley and oats are not to be carried by private road hauliers beyond a 60kilometre radius of the place of consignment unless the vehicle owner has been granted a permit by the State Transport Authority. Under section 10 (2) of the Grain Elevators Act, the Grain Elevators Board has the exclusive rights to handle grain in the State. In Queensland, similar regulations effectively restrict to rail grain transport over distances greater than 120 kilometres. Section 26 of the Grains Handling Act provides Bulk Grains Queensland with exclusive rights to the storage and handling of export grains shipped from Queensland. The AWB and other grain trading corporations must not be disadvantaged by this lack of action on the part of the States. The new Wheat Marketing Act provides clear powers for the AWB and other grain trading corporations and their service providers to enter into contracts for storage, handling, transport, port services and marketing of grain i,ntended for interstate or export unencumbered by State regulations. I turn now to the marketing provisions in this Bill. The Government recognises that world grain markets remain under the influence of distorting Government policies. I have decided, in response to widespread concerns expressed by the GCA and growers generally, that the A WB should remain the single export marketer for all Australian wheat. The AWB will continue to be able to use private traders as principals or agents as it does now and it will be able to authorise the direct export of wheat if the Board and growers judge it in their best interest. While it continues to have this export monopoly, the AWB will continue to be the receiver of last resort. This will, however, not preve-t it from setting standards for the wheat it receives. There is no justification for continuing the AWB's domestic marketing monopoly. Wheat is the only industry subject to Commonwealth regulation which has this control. In its 1988 May economic statement the Government announced that domestic support arrangements for agriculture should be progressively reduced in accordance with the general reductions in protection and assistance across the economy. The Bill provides for the domestic marketing of wheat to be freed up, and this will be achieved through the removal of compulsory acquisition and termination of the arrangements for an administered domestic price. The objective of this move is to give growers greater choice in how they sell their wheat and when. Growers will. still have the option of delivering to the AWBs pools but, in addition, they will be able to sell their wheat for cash either to the AWB or to other buyers on the domestic market. It is quite clear that many growers want this choice. Some 90 per cent of the wheat used for feed purposes is traded under the permit system. It is also a fact that wheat continues to be traded on the black market and, as indicated recently by the Flour Millers Council, that milling wheat is being sold through the feed wheat permit system. The essential point is that compulsory acquisition is no longer needed for an efficient marketing effort. I am confident that the AWB will remain the dominant force in a deregulated domestic market, given its expertise and the additional commercial powers which I outlined earlier. An important benefit arising from freeing up the domestic market will be the greater scope growers will have to arrange their own storage, handling and transport. These additional competitive pressures will assist in achieving the potential resource cost savings in this sector identified by the Royal Commission. Users of wheat, particularly feedlotters, will also benefit from a freer domestic market and the removal of the costs and red tape involved in the current grower to buyer ·and permit systems. In the recent debate on wheat marketing much has been made of the effect of domestic market deregulation on growers' returns. The argument has centred on concern that when prices are depressed by heavy subsidisation on overseas markets, this will be reflected in the domestic market price. This effect, however, depends on the level of subsidisation and also the size of the Australian crop. During the last season the smaller Australian crop and improved market opportunities meant that there was little need for the AWB to discount its prices, even though there was continued strong subsidisation by the US and EC. When market prices are rising rapidly, the domestic price arrangements can cost growers money. The inclusion of past prices in the formula can lead to the home consumption price being lower than the free market price. The AWB through its export monopoly will still control some 80 per cent of the wheat produced. Average export prices as reflected in the expected net pool return will put a floor in the market. Contrary to claims by the GCA, no grower selling wheat outside the AWB system is likely to accept a farm gate price which is less than the price obtainable through the pool. Estimates show that over the last four years, if none of the wheat sold domestically had passed through the AWB pools, the loss to the pools would be in the range 23c per tonne to $2.93 per tonne overall. This is the worse that could happen and, in my view, is highly unlikely to happen. In a free market millers can be expected to continue to pay a premium to secure their special requirements for regular supplies and there will be scope for individual growers to achieve quality premiums within the ASW range, something that is not available to the AWB under the current administered domestic price. In addition, the potential savings through the use of more efficient storage, handling and transport facilities can be expected to more than outweigh any transient reduction in prices likely to result from subsidisation on export markets. These new marketing arrangements will meet the needs of growers of specialty wheats, such as durum, and organically grown wheat. Currently these producers incur the AWB's pool costs even if they do not use its services. In future they will be able to sell their wheat freely on the domestic market and I would expect that the AWB will be able to accommodate the export needs of these producers either through its additional pooling flexibility or through the scope it has to authorise the direct export of wheat. While the AWB will have extended commercial powers and a continued export monopoly it should not abuse its market power. The Trade Practices Act· will apply to its commercial activities. In this regard it will be' important for the Board to keep its tradingand pooling activities at arm's length and for it to visibly and separately account for these activities. Concern has been expressed that domestic market deregulation will affect Australia's ability to maintain its current high standard. of grain hygiene and that this will affect our export effort. I do not believe this. will. be the case .. The AWB will be able to enf-rce-xist1ng hygiene, standards through its contractual arrangements with those providing storage, handling and transport services. The legislation will make the Board's powers clear in this r-spect. Wheat which moves outside the AWB will be subject to market pressures if it does not meet hygiene standards acceptable to buyers. Some growers may choose to store more wheat on farm, but this is unlikely to be extensive particularly since the option of warehousing is now available. A guaranteed minimum' price (GMP) scheme has operated in the wheat industry for 10 years. This scheme has its drawbacks. Because of the averaging effect of the GMP formula the GMP, and therefore advance payments, is not necessarily a good indication of expected market returns. For instance, because of the recent· strengthening of the wheat market, the final' GMP set recently for the current season is only about· 80 per cent. of expected net pool returns. The GMP has tended to be used as a market indicator but is clearly a poor one. The GMP arrangements have also b-en the source of rigidities in the operation of the current wheat marketing arrangemen-s, part,icularly with respect: to the A. WB's pooling In all years the principal benefit of the GMP scheme has been the backing it provides to enable the A WB. to borrow at favourable interest rates and pay a relatively high first advance to growers delivering wheat to the AWB pools. The Government will continue to provide this benefit via a specific borrowing guarantee. Essentially this means that the AWB's borrowings will continue to be underwritten by government. Should there be a call on the guarantee the Government will meet its obligation and will not seek repayment by the industry. This is a significant commitment and is indicative of the Government's willingness to continue to back the wheat industry. In the initial year of the new arrangements this guarantee will be set at a level which will enable the payment of a first advance equivalent to 90 per cent of estimated net pool returns in the current season. I would point out that because of the current rising' market prices, this will result in a higher first advance than would have been available under the GMP scheme. Iii the 1988 May statement the Government announced that industry should progressively· take over responsibility for funding the costs involved. in reducing price uncertainty through underwriting schemes, Consistent with this intention the level of the borrowing guarantee will be phased down to 80 per cent of estimated net returns in year five of the new arrangements. The guarantee will be subject to review within five yelj.rs. Should the industry wish to have a higher level of first advance than that available through the borrowing guarantee, provision has been made for it to introduce its own mechanism to make any additional payments. Arrangements for setting the level of the guarantee will involve preliminary ministerial determination, in consultation with the Australian Wheat Board and the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, of the estimated net pool return for ;the season by 1 October. As under the current arrangements, a final guarantee and advance could be established later in the season. It will be up to the Australian Wheat Board in consultation with the Grains Council of Australia to determine the actual level of first advance for particular categories of wheat delivered to pools which will be based on the level of . operation. available borrowings. The level of the Government's financial commitment, however, will be limited on an aggregate basis to the level of the borrowing guarantee. I am aware that the averaging arrangements in the previous GMP scheme provided support to growers in circumstances of extreme market downturn such as in 1986-87. If such a crisis were to occur again the G-vernment would need to give close consideration 'to special support arrangements for the industry. I would also point Ollt that the Government is also providing drought assistance and national interest insurance cover to the wheat industry. Mr Hawker- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. I am reluctant to intervene in the Minister's second reading speech, but I draw his attention to page 89 of the notes attached to the Treasurer's April statement last night, where he said in part: The Government has decided to discontinue, with effect from 1 July 1989, reimbursement of expenditures by the six States-",94
217,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,POSTAL SERVICES,"Mr Mildren}-Order! What is the point of order? Mr Hawker-The point of order is about drought relief. It has been discontinued. The statement goes on to say: In addition, the Commonwealth will not support expenditures on any relief measures for drought larations made after 12 April 1989. Mr ·DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! There is no point of order. - r Hawker-I just want to draw it to the Minister's attention.",99
218,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,POSTAL SERVICES,There is no point of order.,99
219,Mr KERIN,POSTAL SERVICES,"Let me just respond. The provision for drought assistance has effectively been transferred from the Minist.er for Finance to the Minister for PriIpary Industries and Energy and the new arrangelTlents will be announced. The financing arrangements I have just described relate only to the Australian Wheat Board's pooling operation. However, as I have indicated, the Board will have a broader commercial role and there is a need to establish a capital base for it. It is a source of major weakness to the industry that the Australian Wheat Board has no asset base despite its role as one of the country's largest marketers; probably the second· largest. The new wheat marketing legislation will provide the mechanism for the establishment of an industry fund through a levy on all wheat sold. 'The Government will also assist in the initial establishment of this fund through the provision over five years of a loan guarantee of up to $100m for the purposes of the fund. This will not be a stabilisation fund. It will provide finance for a range of activities which woulc;l include: the Australian Wheat Board's commercial undertakings, including cash purchases; mal?ng advance payments above the level provided through the AWB borrowing guarantee; and providing insurance on credit sales. It will be for the GCA in consultation with the AWB to determine the specific uses to which finance from the fund will be .put. The fund will be a powerful new· avenue through which the industry will be able to influence its future. Detailed arrangements for the fund are still being considered by the GCA and the AWB and will be incorporated in regulations. I would emphasise, however, that the Government would want to· see a commercial relationship between the fund and the AWB and proper equity arrangements established for growers. The fund will be activated only if industry agrees to the decintroduction of a levy for this purpose. Levy arrangements are the subject of separate Bills. The AWB will be moving into a new phase of its operations and facing new challenges. It will be undertaking expanded commercial operations with a minimum of Government control but with Commonwealth Government borrowing guarantees. If the AWB is to perform effectively in this new environment it is essential that the best qualified people are appointed to the Board. It must be able to develop clear corporate strategies and purpose. The new Act will provide for Board members to have a balance of skills in the areas of production, marketing and finance. It will also be essential for the A WB to have a highly skilled management. team. It must have a managing director as the chief executive who the Board should be able to pay at market rates, free from the Remuneration Tribunal constraints which operate at present. In principle I favour the appointment of a non-executive chairperson who in the long term would be part time. I recognise that the Board faces a challenging task in the transition to the new arrangements and that stability in its leadership structure is desirable. I have indicated to the GCA that· the AWB will continue· to have a grower chairperson. I am aware of grower concern about 'loss of control' of the AWB. Let me emphasise that the Board will continue to be accountable. to growers. However, tQis responsibility will be exercised through the the Australian Wheat Board Selection Committee and consultative arrangements between the Australian Wheat Board and Grains Council of Australia rather than through participation in the day to day running of the Board. The new Act will make clear provisions for the AWB to consult the GCA on the performance of its functions. In particular, I would expect the AWB to consult the GCA on such issues as the establishment of subsidiaries, pooling arrangements and general policy on trading in other grains and wheat of other origin. While the Act provides for a minimum of one consultative meeting each year, I would expect the AWB and GCA to consult more frequently than this. Given its continuing role as a statutory authority, the Australian. Wheat Board will also continue to be accountable to the minister and the parliament. The Board's annual report, corporate plan and annual operating plan constitute important avenues of accountability both to the Government and the Grains Council of Australia. The current arrangement under which the cost of shipping wheat to Tasmania is funded through' a levy on domestic wheat sales will be terminated with the deregulation of the domestic market. The Government has, however, undertaken to continue funding this assistance from consolidated revenue. The exact amount of this assistance has still to be worked out, but in 1989-90 I expect it to be close to the average level of about $3m which has applied in recent years. The assistance will phase down by 25 per cent over the five-year period commencing in 1989-90 and the scheme will be subject to review within five years,' There are no other direct financialimplications arising from the legislation, although the Government is committed to assuming .contingent liabilities under the proposed borrowing guarantees. I believe that this new legislation will set the Australian wheat industry - on a clear path for a prosperous future. It provides for a commercially strong Australian Wheat Board, free from unnecessary regulation and with clear lines of responsibility to growers. The marketing arrangements will provide more flexibility and choice to growers and an opportunity for both growers and end users to keep costs down. These changes together with the introduction of new financing arrangements for the AWB will ensure that the industry is in a strong position to meet competitive challenges into the next century. I commend the Bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Tim Fischer) adjourned. NA 1989 Bill presented by Mr Kerin, and read a first time. Second Reading",99
220,Mr KERIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY FUND LEVY BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill and the associated Wheat Industry Fund Levy Collection Bill is to enable the wheat industry to impose and collect a single ad valorem levy on wheat, for distribution between the Wheat Research Trust Fund and any industry fund which may be established under the provisions of the Wheat Marketing Bill 1989. This latter Bill is the basis for the whole legislation package covering new wheat marketing arrangements to apply from 1 July this year. The levy will be paid on wheat that is sold, delivered or processed by or on the growers' behalf from 1 July this year. This will enable the continuation of the current research funding arrangements based on growyr and matching Commonwealth contributions from that date. The Grains Council of Australia will determine the rate of levy, based on a percentage of sales value, for payment to the research fund. This percentage, which will be set by regulation, cannot be less than 0.25 per cent, and this compares with the current rate of research tax of about 0.35 per cent of value. The industry has already indicated a preparedness to increase its contribution to research over a three-year period in order to move towards the ceiling of the Government's matching contribution of 0.5 per cent of average gross value of productionThe industry fund provided for under the Wheat Marketing Bill to finance a number of commercial activities by the Australian Wheat Board will be activated only if the industry, through the Grains Council, determines that a percentage of the total levy to be imposed under the levy Bill is to be used for this purpose. This percentage of sales value cannot be less than :2 per cent which is equivalent to about $3.80 per tonne for standard quality wheat. The decision to implement an ad valorem levy to replace the previous fixed rate per tonne wheat taxes, which were imposed for research purposes, and the operation of the stock feed permit scheme, was designed to make the levy as equitable as possible. For example, a tonne of prime hard wheat is more valuable by about $35 than a tonne of feed wheat and therefore an ad valorem levy will distribute the levy burden more evenly among growers of different qualities of wheat. The amount of revenue collected for wheat research purposes under the new levy arrangements is not expected' to vary from current estimates, which reflect the industry's agreement to increase its contribution to research. Revenue is expected to increase to $1l.8m by 1991-92 from the current level of around $1O.5m"" It is estimated that if the industry fund is activated the component of the levy for payment to the fund would initially be set at 2 per cent of sale value. This would result in revenue of an estimated $55m in a full year. Administration of the levy collection arrangements will be undertaken within the existing resources of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy.

226,Mrs KELLY,WHEAT INDUSTRY FUND LEVY,"Canberra-Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support) (5.17)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. On 25 May 1988 the Government released a policy statement outlining a new framework for telecommunications services in Australia. This was an integral part of the Government's third term micro-economic agenda, which emphasised the need to improve the efficiency of our economic infrastructure. The new arrangements for telecommunications were designed as part of a process of structural adjustment of key industries, with a view to establishing and sustaining longer term economic growth. Also, the Government will continue to serve the significant social objectives associated with the important role in the Australian community of access to telephone services. The Australian telecommunications industry is of strategic importance to both· the manufacturing and service sectors of the Australian economy. It is a key to export led growth. The importance of information industries in the world economy is growing. The world's telecommunications market is currently estimated at around $400 billion per annum, more than computing, pharmaceuticals or air travel. The Australian market is about 2.5 per cent of the world market or $10 billion. Australia's telecommunications industry must be established on a sound and efficient basis, so it can adapt to changing technologies and user needs. This will contribute to Australia's ability to compete effectively in the rapidly growing world market. Greater efficiency and competitiveness are also required if the Australian people are to continue to receive high standard communication facilities, provided efficiently, economically and on an equitable basis. Significant reforms are being undertaken by the Government to achieve these goals. Changes to the structural frameworks of the telecommunications carriers-Telecom Australia, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) and Aussat-are being implemented separately. These changes will ensure that these .government business enterprises are more efficient, responsive and accountable to both government and Australian users of telecommunications services. \ New regulatory arrangements, introduced in this Telecommunications Bill, will separate the technical and regulatory functions from the operations of the carriers and place these responsibilities in the hands of an independent industry regulator, the Australian Telecomm unications Authority - A ustel. Austel will also be responsible for consumer protection, promotion of competition in the industry, and monitoring the efficiency and adequacy of the services provided by carriers. This is the most significant reform in Australian telecommunications since 1975, when the Whitlam Labor Government created two major public enterprises, Telecom ap.d Australia Post, from the former Postmaster-General's Department. There are five key elements in the Telecommunications Bill now before the House: the establishment of the Australian Telecommunications Authority, Austel, as the telecommunications industry regulator, with both technical and economic regulatory functions; the definition of those telecommunications services which will, for reasons of network development and social objectives, be reserved to Telecom, aTC and Aussat; the creation of a streamlined licensing regime for other services which, combined with safeguards against discriminatory behaviour by the carriers, will allow free and fair competition in the provision of value. added services and the efficient operation of approved private networks; the assurance of fair and open competition in the customer equipment market; and the provision of mechanisms to ensure that consumer interests are protected and the Government's social objectives are achieved by the telecommunications industry. As the new industry regulator, Austel will encourage the right environment for growth in the telecommunications industry. In addi"" tion to administering the provisions which define the boundaries of the monopoly, Austel will take over from Telecom the function of approving equipment for connection to the public-switched telephone network. Industry will play a major role in the development of appropriate technical standards which will be administered by Austel. There will be close cooperation between Austel and the Standards Association of Australia in the development of both mandatory and voluntary standards for the telecommunications industry. As well as being the technical regulator, Austel will have an economic regulation role. Austel will operate with a Chair and two other statutory office holders. Austel will have approximately 70 additional staff, and the cost of running the Authority is estimated to be $5m per annum. It is our aim to have Austel operational on 1 July 1989. It is intended for Austel to develop close links with the Trade Practices Commission, in order to assist both bodies in their respective roles of ensuring that the carriers do not misuse their monopoly powers in competitive markets. The Government intends to appoint the Chair and one other member as part time associate members of the Trade Practices Commission. The Bill contains mechanisms to ensure that those affected by an Austel decision have the right to seek reconsideration by Austel or review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It is not the intent of the Government to foster legallstic processes which could be used to thwart Austel's legitimate decision making processes, but to ensure that those involved receive natural justice. If the appeals machinery is abused or proves too cumbersome in practice, I will move to amend the legislation as necessary. As for other similar statutory authorities, the Government expects Austel to seek to recover some of its costs of operation from the industry. A companion piece of legislation to this Bill, the Telecommunications (Application Fees) Bill 1989, provides for the setting of fees for a range of Austel services such as applications for variations to class licences and applications for permits to Austel attach equipment to the network. These fees will be set to recover direct costs only and Austel will be asked to report to Government, following consultation with the industry, on the practicalities of recovering some of the other costs of its operations from the industry. Provision has been made for a power of ministerial direction over Austel, but only as regards policy matters. This power of direction will not extend to specific decisions in individual cases. The Minister will also be able to request reports from the Authority on a broad range of issues. In this regard, I will shortly be writing to the Chair of Austel to seek reports on matters affecting both the operations of Austel and the wider operations of the telecommunications service industry. As foreshadowed in the 1988 May statement, these will include a report on the implications of licensing an additional operator of public mobile telephone services and a report on the appropriateness of the current policy on the joint use of private networks by 'common interest' groups. Basic Network Services After reviewing telecommunications policy early in 1988, the Government decided that certain services should be reserved for provision by the three established carriers only. One reason for this was network development. There is a clear need to secure the orderly and efficient development of the basic telecommunications network by taking advantage of the economies of scale and scope that exist in the industry, and by. avoiding costly and uneconomic duplication of facilities that can be most efficiently provided by a single supplier. The other reason is the important need for universal service, which is a particular community service obligation placed on Telecom Australia. The Government expects Telecom to provide equitable access to standard telephone services as efficiently and economically as practicable. It is therefore necessary to allow for Telecom to average its prices and practise some cross subsidy. Telecom will be specifically accountable to the Government, through Austel, which will monitor the efficiency with which Telecom meets its obligations. This legislation provides for the continuation of a monopoly by the carriers in the provision of telecommunications facilities. It also specifies certain services which can be provided on those facilities only by designated carriers. Telecom will be the sole domestic provider of public-switched voice, data and video services, public switched integrated services digital networks (ISDN), nonsatellite leased circuits and public mobile telephone services. OTe will be the sole provider of these services internationally, and Aussat will be the sole provider of satellite facilities within Australia and is given extended scope to provide private network facilities to and from Australia. Third party carriage, or the shared use and resale of leased circuits, will continue to be prohibited. The legislation also includes provisions to ensure equity within the industry and to encourage the efficient utilisation of our telecommunications infrastructure. These provisions require the carriers to supply capacity on a non-discriminatory basis to all valid customers: residential or business users, private network operators or value added service providers. Value Added Services Beyond the reserved services, the legislation provides for full and free competition in the provision of value added services, or VAS. This Bill creates a licensing regime for VAS which will minimise government intervention in routine commercial activities. The introduction of a· class licence, subject to standard conditions, will provide for the operation of all currently approved forms of VAS. There will be no need for a VAS provider to obtain specific approval for a service which clearly falls within the class licence. A person who wishes to introduce an innovative service which is not already covered in the class licence may apply to Austel for a specific authorisation. No authorisation will be given to a serviCe which infringes on the reserved services. If it does not infringe, the class licence will then be amended to encompass provision of the new service by any VAS operator. In this way, the costly and burdensome practice of individual licensing can be avoided. Austel, and not the carriers, will be the arbiter of what is a value added service. Austel will thus administer the boundary determined by this legislation between the reserved services and the competitive services. Provisions in the legislation require carriers to provide carriage for all authorised VAS, and to ensure that there is no price discrimination. The carriers will be required to maintain separate accounting arrangements for their own VAS activities, to provide a level playing field for competition in these services. This Bill maintains the status quo with regard to video and audio information and entertainment services (VAlES), but should the current review of the broadcasting legislation require amendments to this legislation, then I will move them as necessary. Customer Equipment With the exception of the first phone, steps have already been taken to liberalise the provision and maintenance of cu-tom-r equipment. These are formally recogmsed this Bill and in conjunction with the new regime for value added services, they will open up new opportunities for Australian plaints industry to develop and expand. The encourwill agement of active competition provided by this legislation is a major step towards ing the telecommunications sector - tronger and more able to compete on an mternaintended tional level. There is provision in the legislation to effect to the Government's new industry velopment arrangements for the customer equipment manufacturing sector. These were announced in December last year and are aimed at making the industry internationally competitive. I will be directing Austel, the legislation, to ensure that all relevant customer equipment complies with these arrangements. Consumer Protection and Social Obligations One of Austel's prime roles will be as consumer watchdog, reporting on the perBill formance of the carriers in their delivery reserved services. It will administer the ernment's formula for the price capping basic services, which will ensure that the average price of a basket of basic telecomcommunications munications services will fall in real terms. The legislation also provides a power for the Minister to declare that a specified reserved service charge is to be subject to notification and disallowance. This will provide an addithis tional safeguard for consumers and Austel will be able to give advice to the Minister on pricing practices for carrier reserved services. Austel will also report to Government on the performance of Telecom in meeting its community service obligations, including its responsibility to provide universal service and other socially necessary services such as public telephones. With regard to consumer complaints, Austel may deal with them itself if general regulatory considerations are involved, or it may direct them to the Trade Practices Commission or the Federal Ombudsman. It is not intended that Austel will take over any of the Ombudsman's current activities regarding the investigation of individual complaints. Appropriate arrangements will be developed m to co-ordinate the work of Austel and the . Ombudsman's Office. Austel will, however, have a responsibility to investigate comthat raise regulatory questions, and it work closely with the Ombudsman's Office to ensure that complaints against the makcarriers are investigated promptly and that any necessary follow-up action is taken. It is that there will be a review of the respective roles of Austel and the Ombudsgive man within two years of Austel's creation to deensure that consumer complaints are being handled as effectively as possible. The Government is confident that these measures-stabilising an independent regulator, defining specific community se-vice obunder ligations for Telecom, guaranteemg t.hat average price rises for basic telec?mmum-a­ tions services fall in real terms, mtroducmg new accountability arrangements for the carriers-will protect the rights of consumers and ensure that the telecommunications industry fulfils important social obligations an? a contributes to national economic growth. ThIS has widespread support within both the of telecommunications services industry and the Govgeneral community. There was extensive of consultation with interested groups before the Government's decisions relating to telereform were announced in May 1988, and this consultation has c-ntin­ ued. A draft of this Bill was made avaIlable to the industry for comment and a wide range of interested groups responded. While legislation incorporates the results of these consultations, the Bill does not simply reflect the demands of sectional interests. This Bill is an important element in the Government's program of micro-economic reform. It serves the interests of the telecommunications industry and at the same time it legislates for the continuation of universal service. It will benefit all members of the Australian community. Before I conclude I would like to thank some members of the Australian Labor Party, particularly those involved in the Caucus committee, for their long term consultations with us. I would also like to pay tribute to representatives of my Department who, under the leadership of Miss Vanessa Fanning, led. these consultative teams in very elaborate discussions. The Bill is a result of their very hard work, including the work of Jane Smith from my office and the work of officers from the office of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis). I present the explanatory memorandum and .present this Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Ewen Camef()D) adjourned.

NA LABORATORIES, STAGE 1, NORTH RYDE, NEW SOUTH WALES Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act",106
228,Mr WEST,SITE REDEVELOPMENT OF CSIRO,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: CSIRO North Ryde Laboratories, site redeveloped, stage I. The proposed public work involves the first stage of a long term program to construct new laboratory facilities, refurbish existing buildings, demolish inefficient and unsafe buildings and upgrade mechanical services, site entry, internal roads and car parks at the Commonwealth' Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), North Ryde. The North Ryde complex is the CSI-"" RO's principal research centre in New South Wales. It currently accommodates some 700 staff and is the national headquarters for the divisions of biotechnology, coal technology, food processing and a principal centre for the division of exploration geoscience., The site also accommodates parts' of other divisions. Works include a new three-storey gene technology laboratory' building, a new computer and administration building, additions to the library-conference centre and' refurbishment of an existing laboratory for the division of biotechnology. Also included is a neW three-storey geophysics laboratory building for the division of exploration geoscience, the first stage of a central chilled water installation for the divisions of exploration geoscience and coal technology, and refurbishment-;-modification of part of two buildings to be occupied by the division of coal technology. The scope of work further includes demolition of some obsolete and substandard buildings, relocation of some existing roads and services, and upgrading of car parks and landscaping The work' accords with the master development plan prepared for the site in 1984. This redevelopment proposal is essential to permit increased research into topics of vital national impprtance.The estimated cost for this project is $18.5m at August 1988 prices. I believe that it is expedient that this work be carried out and I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA 2ND CAVALRY REGIMENT, DARWIN Reference of Work: Public Works Committee Act",106
229,Mr WEST,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration . and report: Construction of facilities Cavalry Regiment, Darwin. This Government's defence policy includes the permanent deployment of both Royal Australian Air Force. (RAAF) and Army units in northern Australia. The proposal now before the House is for the construction of new facilities to allow for the relocation of the Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment from New South Wales to Darwin. The operational role of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment is to conduct reconnaissance, provi,de security and engage in offensive, defensive and delaying action in northern Australia. The 2nd Cavalry Regiment currently occupies permanent working and living-in facilities at Holsworthy in New South Wales. The move to the Northern Territory will involve around 400 service personnel and equipment, including some 70 armoured fighting vehicles. As defence facil.ities currently available in Darwin are fully committed, new working, training, recreational, messing and living-in facilities are required for the unit. Some additional administrative support facilities are also required. The extent and areas of the proposed work are as follows: New 2nd Cavalry Regiment barracks and training facilities will be provided on a newly acquired site at Palmerston, approximately 20 kilometres east of the Darwin central business district. The site is of sufficient size to accommodate the working, recreational, messing and living-in facilities for the unit, and also provides a close training area for the unit. Additional administrative support facilities are to be provided at the existing Larrakeyah barracks near central Darwin. There will be both the provision of some new buildings and the refurbishment and extension of some existing facilities. Additional ammunition store houses are to be provided within the proposed RAAF explosive ordnance storage complex to be built at RAAF Base Darwin. The estimated cost of this proposal is $62.7m at December 1988 prices. Subject to parliamentary approval and Department of Defence funding priorities, the construction program is planneq to enable the 2nd Cavalry Regiment to relocate to Darwin by the end of1992. . I trust that. my action today in referring this important defence project to the Public Works Committee illustrates our commitfor 2nd ment to proceed with this project. There have been some ill-informed comments in the Northern Territory by Ministers of the current Government of the Northern Territory to the effect that this project might not proceed, despite repeated assurances on this subject by me and the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). I trust that our actions here today will put the matter to rest once and for all. We are committed to this project. We expect that it will be dealt with expeditiously by the Committee, and I will come back to the House as soon as possible to recommend expediency. I have much pleasure in tabling the plans.",107
230,Mr WHITE,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,1 put on record yet again that the Opposition totally supports the move of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment to the north. Mr Snowdon-lam pleased to hear it.,107
231,Mr WHITE,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,"I hope the honourable member for the Northern Territory is listening, 'because he has been running around this country telling lies. He told one here today in this House. Mr Snowdon- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I ask the honourable member to withdraw the statement that I have told lies. It is totally unparliamentary and an accusation which I refute.",107
232,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,Mr Cowan)I ask the honourable member to withdraw.,107
233,Mr WHITE,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,"1 withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. The honourable member has been running around this country being extremely careless with the truth time after time. Will he get it through his thick head that nowhere is there a record of the Opposition ever opposing this move? Let us get that straight. If the Government has problems with some of the people on its side of the House, the honourable member for the Northern Territory is probably the bloke who is causing them. Mr West-No; it is the Ministers from the Northern Territory who have been attempting to say that this will not proceed. You know what this is all about.",107
234,Mr WHITE,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,"Well, the Minister has put the matter to rest for his side of the chamber.",108
235,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,I suggest the honoura1;>le member for MCPherson ignore the interjections and proceed with his speech.,108
236,Mr WHITE,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,"Let me put the issue to rest once and for 'all for this side. We have always supported this movement of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, and we still do. We support the reference to the Public Works Committee and we hope it will be dealt with expeditiously. Some 400 men and women are to move to Darwin. It is, from a defence point of view, a very sensible move to have a reconnaissance regiment in the north. I guess some 200 of those people will be married. Although I did not hear a reference to the building of married quarters, I presume that that is something that will be coming. I ask the Minister whether that is correct. Mr W est- Yes, there will be quite a number of houses constructed as part of this project, but it is not included in this reference.",108
237,Mr WHITE,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,"The regiment will take with it some 70 armoured vehicles. It seems appropriate at this time to make reference to those because there is something very strange about the Government's program to equip this regiment. The regiment is at the moment equipped with M-1l3 armoured fighting vehicles. Last year the Government offered, unbeknownst, I might say, to the Chief of the General Staff and his officers, to purchase 100 wheeled armoured fighting vehicles from the United States of America. There were no trials on these vehicles-nothing to say whether they were suitable or unsuitable-but the offer was made. I do not know at this stage whether it has been accepted. The point I am making is that to equip this reconnaissance regiment with wheeled armoured fighting vehicles before it goes to the north-Mr Leo MCLeay- This is out of order.",108
238,Mr WHITE,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,I do not need any advice from the honourable member. Not knowing whether these vehicles will be suitable is a very strange way to conduct-,108
239,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,Order! The Chair thinks the honourable member for MCPherson is straying from the motion before the House. I ask him to come back to it.,108
240,Mr WHITE,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,"The development of this facility in the north follows the opening of RAAF Base Tindal a couple of weeks ago. I just remind the House and the people of Australia that, while the Government claims credit for that development, the decision to develop Tindal and place a fighter squadron there was made in the days of the Fraser Government. I would have thought that during the opening of that base some acknowledgment of that could have been made. Mr Rocher-Will there be any accommodation fo- those vehicles under this project?",108
241,Mr WHITE,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,"We do not know so far what vehicles will be taken. To meI,ltion another matter just briefly, I refer to the naval facilities in the north in Darwin. That is something that will have to be closely looked at in due course because the facilities at the moment can take only patrol boats and there is an obvious requirement that in later years-or as soon as possible-some facility be put there to look after the increasing deployment of our destroyers and frigates to the north. In short, we very much support this project. We want to see it go to the Public Works Committee and dealt with so that it can physically get under way as soon as possible.",108
242,Mr SNOWDON,CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES FOR,"I am encouraged by the support that the shadow Minister for defence, the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr White), has given to this project. I might say that, far from walking around this country misrepresenting him or telling what he would describe as untruths, I have represented his view very accurately. His difficulty is that the only time he opens his mouth is when it is to change feet. If he were to take note of what he has said to people he would recognise that he has undermined the confidence of the Northern Territory community-I am pleased that he has done it-in the Opposition's policy on defence. He has implied on a number of occasions that the Opposition is concerned that the Northern Territory is getting too good a deal out of this Government in terms of defence expenditure. I would like to see this matter referred to the Committee as quickly as possible. I am assured by the Chairman of that Committee that it will be dealt with expeditiously. This will be done for a number of reasons, one of which is its importance in terms of the Gov-· ernment's defence strategy. Another reason is its importance to the Northern Territory community. It is important not only in the context of having Australia's armed services posited in the north but also because of the money which will go into the Northern Territory economy at a time when it needs it. The construction industry in particular has been experienCing a slump for 18 months or so. The infusion of funds into the Northern Territory economy as a result of this decision when it is finally made by the Parliament will add tremendously to business confidence in Darwin in particular and in the N!Jrthern Territory in general. Another matter which relates to this project is Kangaroo 89, I am sure that the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, or elements of it, will be involved in that exercise. That, too, is something which has been kyboshed by the shadow Minister who has just spoken. I would suggest that, rather than making accusations about what I have or have not said about him, he need only get a transcript of what he himself has said. He will then realise that what he has said has undermined the community's confidence in his side of the Parliament. In fact, decisions such as the one this Government is making about the 2nd Cavalry Regiment restore the faith of the Northern Territory community in Government's ability to deliver-on its promises, not only in terms of defence policy but also in terms of providing infrastructure in northern Australia generally which will be of use to the whole community. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA LOGAN CITY, QUEENSLAND Reference of Work: Public Works , Committee Act",108
243,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES IN,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Construction of Commonwealth offices in Logan City, Queensland. In line with the Government's objectives of increasing Government owned office accommodation and reducing overall rental costs, it. is proposed to build Commonwealth office accommodation in Logan City, Queensland. This proposal is for the construction of a three-level office building of some 5,600 square metres of office accommodation. The proposed building will be ideally situated in the Logan City central business district and will house elements of the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training, providing them with shopfront accommodation. Secure underground car parking for 120 vehicles and additional parking for motorbikes are special features of the proposed building. The building has been designed with the surrounding suburban environment in mind and provides a focus for Commonwealth activity in Logan City. In recognising the need to cater for the future needs of intended occupants, the building allows for the expansion of approximately 800 square metres of office accommodation at the upper floor level. The cost estimate for the construction of this work is $9.6 million at April 1989 prices. I table all drawings of the proposed works and I commend the motion to the House.",109
244,Mr JULL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES IN,"The Opposition welcomes the announcement made by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) of the referral of the construction of this the new Commonwealth offices in Logan City to the Public Works Committee. May I say, as one of the members who represents Logan. City, that it is more than welcome in the community. I know the Mayor of Logan City, Alderman Fred Huntress, and Alderman Ken Cameron will be delighted with this particular news. Obviously, I would like to see its speedy passage through the Committee. Logan City, south of Brisbane, is one of Australia's newest cities. It has a population of about 150,000 people and is one of the fastest growing areas of Australia. There are some very real difficulties in this part of the world. Ten years ago, Logan City was divided off from the Albert Shire. I do not think I am being unkind when I say that the infrastructural requirements of that particular city were, to a very great degree, affected by the then Queensland Government and the hosting Albert Shire. However, after a great deal of hard work and good management, Logan City is now very much playing its part in being the second largest city in Queensland. This move by the Commonwealth to construct a three-level office building of some 5,600 square metres at a cost of more than $9 million will be more than welcomed by the community. Not only will it provide a centrepiece to the central business district of Logan City, but also it will bring together those Commonwealth s-rvices so urgently reReport relating to the program of business Pursuant to sessional, order 28D, the Selection business listed below to be accorded priority on allotment of time determined by the Committee Committee and delegation reports Parliamentary delegation to UK and Ireland Order of the day Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation-Motion [Time allotted for debate-IS minutes.], Private Members' business Order of precedence * MR TICKNER: To move-That this House: (I) supports the South (2) opposes the (a) stationing *2 MR BURR: To move-That this House condemns the Government for its inept handling of the Wesley Vale of a $1 billion development and comprehensive set of guidelines of urgency.

Unfortunately, Logan City has one of the highest percentages of young unemployed in Australia. There is now no doubt that the present facilities, in terms of the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security, are stretched to the limit and have been stretched to the limit for a great number of years. The consolidation of the Commonwealth facilities will be a great boon to this district. In a personal sense, I welcome it. I know the Logan City Council will welcome the move.

246,Mr DOWNER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,1 would like to say a few words in relation to the amendments which have come from the Senate on the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1987. I understand the other Bill will be taken separately.,114
247,The CHAIRMAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Three Bills will be dealt with in committee.,114
248,Mr DOWNER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"As far as the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill is concerned, the Opposition will oppose these amendments. We believe that the whole saga of the Customs· and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill is a ·very sorry one. This Bill .was originally introduced in 1987; hence its title has the year 1987 in it.· It was greeted with uproar from the customs community. Enormous concern was expressed about this legislation and the concern was transmitted back to the Government. The Government has not responded adequately to the concerns that were raised, many of which were entirely justified. I get the impression that throughout this whole legislative process we have been dealing with a Yes, Minister saga. Proposal, after proposal has been put forward. The Government strikes me as having a scant understanding of what is actually going on in the context of this legislation. That is the reason why the Government has not responded properly to representations put to it by this side of the House and by a number of different people in the business community. The amendments to this Bill were sent to the customs community in February of this year. Customs was given about one week to comment on those changes before the legislation was due to be debated in the Parliament. I regarded that· as entirely inappropriate. Consequently, the Opposition went to the Government and said, 'For Heaven's sake, give that community more time to examine the proposals that you are putting forward and to consult more fully with you'. The Government agreed to that proposal so last week these amendments were passed through the Senate and came to· the House of Representatives. As a result of the Government's not considering the representations made to it in relation to these amendments, we have bad legislation which is being made worse. First of all, we have massively complex valuations of imported goods, valuations affected by these amendments, which cover some 38 pages. That compares with Canada's legislation, which contains only 10 pages of similar valuations. The interpretation sections of the actual Bill cover 18 pages and there are 56 definitions. The only way we will ensure that the Australian Customs Service operates efficiently is if people can actually understand what is going on. The Government, however, has decided to go down an extraordinarily complex path; a path which will involve enormous costs to the customs community, to customs agents and to importers in general. It is a path which, in turn, will disadvantage the general flow of trade in and out of Australia. Secondly, these amendments include an amendment-I think it is No. 14-in relation to the duty on foreign inland freight. We made these points to the Government in another place, but the Government apparently paid scant regard to our concerns. We are not satisfied with its argument that by imposing duty on foreign inland freight the costs of imported goods will be increased. The Government's argument is that it will refer those to the Industries Assistance Commission, which can then make recommendations to the Government and the Government can adjust .duty appropriately. The fact is that the Government has said this will be done in the context of soda ash, and the soda ash industry is one of those most concerned about this. But what about timber and paper products? Will the Government subsequently refer these things to the Industries Assistance Commission? Will we have months of examination by the Industries Assistance Commission and recommendations from the lAC going back to the Government? Progress reported.",114
249,Unknown,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Sitting suspended from 6 to 7.30 p.m. NA Ministerial Statement Debate resumed from 12 April, on motion by Mr Keating: That the House take note of the following papers: Economic Statement, April 1989, Ministerial Statement, 12 April 1989. Taxation of foreign source income-An information paper.",114
250,Mr HOWARD,ECONOMY,"Last night's statement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has been greeted with widespread cynicism and disbeity lief throughout the nation today. That is not because Australian families do not want and need taxation relief. It is because last night the Treasurer offered not a glimmer of hope that the benefits he announced would not quickly disappear under the heat of the high interest rates and high inflation which the product of the policies of the Hawke Government. That is the central reality of the April statement. That is why today Ausof tralians all around the country simply do not believe the Treasurer and do not believe Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Last night the Treasurer, the man who presided over the largest tax bite in AustralII is's history, wanted everyone to believe that he was extending his hand to Australian taxpayers, but honest taxpayers already know that hand only too well: it has been in their pockets for the last six years. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have both ted that under their policies there is no fall in interest rates in sight. Since the 1985 package Labor has grabbed an extra $10 billion in tax, and last night it gave us $5 billion. So that not even the Labor Party can lie· and misrepresent our position, let me tell this Parliament where we stand. We believe that hard-working people should receive tax cuts and wage justice, but we also believe that because the Government has failed to solve the key problems facing the Australian economy, any benefits delivered last night of foreigners. are likely to disappear very quickly. We want lasting improvements for all Australians, not temporary benefits which vanish. Last night was an exercise in diverting public attention from a collapsing economic strategy. It was the politics· of the warm inner glow in the desperate hope that no awkward questions would be asked. But those questions have been asked and indeed they must be asked. Last night the Treasurer did not tell us that in 1983 we spent 26c every export dollar meeting our overseas debt commitments and that that figure has soared to 63c of every export dollar. He did not tell us that we had the highest inflation <rate amongst major industrialised countries. He not tell us that home interest rates are at record levels. He did not tell us that, despite a dramatic improvement· in commodprices, our trade balance remains in chronic deficit. He did not tell us that our productivity levels are amongst the worse in the industrialised world. He did not tell us that over the last six years living standards of an average family have declined sharply and he did not tell us that almbst all the are major economic forecasts made in his last :eudget have gone hopelessly astray. To borrow a phrase, it takes a special kind talent to have done all of that damage to the Australian economy despite the fact that the while the Hawke Government has been in power the world has experienced the longest has sustained boom since the end of World War and domestically we have enjoyed some of the best farming seasons for decades. One can only imagine the further economic wreckage we would now survey if the Hawke Government had faced a world recession and a desperate drought, both of which· afflicted admitAustralia in the, early 1980s. There was an air of total unreality about tax last night's exercise. Today we are more in hock to the rest of the world then ever back before. We owe foreigners more than $120 billion. That is $7,500 for every man, woman and child. In 1982 our total foreign debt was $24 billion. I would say to those who rail against foreign investment that they should direct their anger not at foreigners who invest in Australia but at a Government which has produced this massive slide into debt and created a drug-type addiction to the saving Foreign debt is piling up month by month, living standards are being squeezed, productivity is stagnant and inflation is surging. Yet in this climate the Treasurer asks us to believe that his tax cuts are going to be of lasting value. How can they last, unless we have lower interest rates and lower inflation and unless we reduce our high overseas debt? At present as a nation, we are spending far more than we are producing. That difference of is being made up by imports, and we are paying for those imports by drawing on fo1'eign savings to the tune of about 4 per cent of our gross domestic product (GDP). That is why our foreign debt continues to grow. These are the alternatives for Australia: We can go on using high interest rates to squeeze activity and thus slow down imports, but ultimately that means lower investment and less economic restructuring and does nothing to address the root causes of our foreign debt problem. Alternatively, we can reduce our reliance on foreign savings by raising domestic savings, increasing the incentive to invest and lowering the cost of our export and import competing industries, thus turning around our chronic balance of payments deficit. To do this we must sweep away restrictive work practices, archaic production techniques, regulations which hinder entrepreneurial initiative and drive, and other measures which stop resources from flowing to their most valuable national uses. That is the only path to higher national productivity and efficiency. It is a path that a coalition government will take, and it is a path which this Government turned its back on last night. To have been credible last night the Treasurer should have announced the following: first, further measures to reduce Government spending and eliminate waste and inefficiency, to give taxpayers value for money and further lower the tax burden in future; second, promotion of domestic savings and a more family oriented tax system to reduce our reliance on foreign capital and to give real incentive to families to look after themselves; third, a comprehensive program of privatisation to reduce industry costs. Improve consumer choice and, importantly, to repay national debt; fourth, a more productivity and enterprise based industrial relations system to encourage employers and employees to work together to improve company performance and reduce industrial disputes; fifth, a more flexible and entrepreneurial higher education system; sixth, fundamental freeing up of our coastal shipping and waterfront scandals-because it costs more to carry cargo from Burnie in Tasmania to Newcastle than it. does from Newcastle to Los Angeles on the west coast of the United States of America. The seventh announcement should have been a reduction of the barriers in many areas of telecommunications. Tonight I am releasing with this address, policy papers which flesh out our proposals in the key areas of award restructuring, the waterfront, coastal shipping and contracting out of public services. I want to spend a few moments addressing some remarks to those particular areas. Last night's statement totally ignored the huge disincentives for savings that exist within our present taxation system. Labor's capital gains tax is a tax on savings and that is why we intend to abolish it. In its place we will have a sliding scale speculative gains tax. We will tax a declining proportion of the real capital gain over the first five years of the investment. This will encourage savings and reward patient investors who wish to build up a business or accumulate a nest egg for their retirement. Once an asset has been held for five years there will be no liability at all for capital gains tax. This change will remove the distorting impact of Labor's capital gains tax on housing which is one of the major reasons the price of housing is so high in the major cities of Australia. Superannuation is an important form of national savings and in recent years the tax treatment of superannuation has been radically revised. Because of the complicated nature of the legislation, the Government has yet to present it. I want to make it clear that we are opposed to changes that will act as a disincentive to saving through superannuation. Our recently released retirement income policy contains a number of proposals to promote self-provision for retirement and, in particular, our pension bonus plan will reward workers who defer retirement beyond the age of 65. We believe we should reverse the trend of the last 20 years towards early retirement in favour of a policy which encourages able men and women to remain in the work force much longer. We will facilitate the establishment of retirement savings accounts for part time and casual workers. This will be of particular benefit to female employees. The current taxation system has worked savagely against Australian families in recent years. The cost of raising ci)ildren substantially affects the capacity of families to pay tax and should be given proper recognition in the taxation system. . That recognition should never be regarded as a welfare out. It puts· greater equity back into the system and is an investment in our country's future. I welcomed last night's adjustments to family allowances and to the dependant spouse rebate. They are a belated acknowlthreaten edgment that over the last six years this Government has deliberately' shifted the tax burden 011tO families through higher taxes and non-adjustment of family allowances and the dependant rebate. The increase in family allowances, while appearing substantial, significantly less than the amount required to restore' their value to what it was in March 1983 when the Hawke Government came to power. The increase in the dependant rebate is less than half. the amount required to compensate for the fall in the real value of that rebate since 1983. over, the income level of $282 is absurdly low and remains a substantial barrier to those married women wishing to work part time, thus balancing family and paid work responsibilities. The Treasurer frequently boasts that fiscal policy is as tight as a drum. I therefore invite his attention to a vast area where substantial savings can accrue through competitive ering for services provided by Government. movement. At present, many services are provided inhouse so that incentives to efficient and nomic service provision are weak, if not sent entirely. The objectives and quality service are often not clearly defined. Overwhy seas experience such as in the United dom suggests that savings of .at least 20 cent in the cost of services are possible out adversely affecting service quality. More flexible, efficient and economical methods providing government services should result in a closer matching of service quality cost and yield s,avings which can be used to increase program coverage. For example, private child care is up to $,11 a week .cheaper than public sector facilities,even after a-­ justing for differences in the number of and age of children being cared for. If honourable members doubt that comparison, I invite them to have a talk to Senator Walsh. In recent weeks, the Government has said much' about the relationship between the handtrade union movement of Australia and a tax future coalition government. The Government simply cannot have it both ways. It cannot in one breath extol and applaud. the alleged' responsibility of the Australian trade union movement yet in the next breath that same trade union movement which stands ready to sabotage the next coalition government. It simply cannot have it both ways. The union movement· is either responsible or irresponsible. The truth is,as is' acknowledged by union . leaders such as Simon' Crean and. Michael Easson, the newly is elected Secretary of the Labour Council in New South Wales, the trade union movement of 1989 will work with the next coalition government of this country. Our relationship with that trade union movement will be different from that of the MoreHawke Government. Unlike the Hawke Government, ·we will not be owned by the trade union movement but. importantly, unlike former coalition governments, we will have an unarguable mandate to implement a new and better approach to industrial relations. More importantly, the trade union movement will work with the next government because the policies of that government will carry enormous benefits for the rank tendand file members of that trade union Our industrial relations policy seeks .to ecobring individual employers and employees abtogether so that they have a common stake ,of in the success of their enterprise. That is we support enterprise based, profit sharKinging performance related pay schemes and per employee share ownership. Such measures withencourage managers and workers to improve communications within the firm, sweep away of archaic work restrictive work practices and continually search for better ways of doing and things and meeting customer needs. The shadow Minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), is currently working on a proposal to in. crease significantly the attractiveness of emplaces ployee share ownership schemes. That proposal will be released in the near future. A more enterprise or industry based union structure will red-ce wage flow-ons to other industry areas and areas which face different economic conditions. The award restructuring proposals of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) do not sufficiently encourage productivity improvement. While some pay scales will be related to acquisition of formal qualifications, they will not equate with actual on the job productivity and thus cannot be used to motivate improvement. Our proposals for voluntary unionism are based on our belief in the benefits of competition. Compulsion infringes human rights and results in the exploitation of third parties. That applies whether one is dealing with trade unions or any other section of the Australian community: Unions have nothing to fear from competition if they are efficient and effective in representing employees. We will also enact secret ballots so that unionists are able to express their views free of intimidation. Governments should not be involved in activities which can be performed better by the private sector. Public ownership insulates enterprise management from genuine competition, encouraging inefficiency, restricting work practices and lowering living standards for all Australians. That is why the coalition, unlike the Government, has for three years embraced a full-blooded policy of privatisation. We do not have a Clayton's privatisation policy where the Prime Minister of this country is begging his party for permission to raise some much needed capital for Australia's international flag carrier, Qantas Airways Ltd. We have a full-blooded privatisation policy that will offer enormous incentives and benefits for the employees of our great national enterprises. Privatisation is not an exercise in flogging the national silver, privatisation is an exercise in selling into the hands of individual Australians the ownership of our great national enterprises. I am very happy to say that my colleague the shadow Minister for business and consumer affairs, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), has developed a detailed program of privatisation which is winning the support and the .admiration of the business community and intending shareholders in those enterprises throughout Australia. Last December I released on behalf of the Liberal and National parties our Future Directions blueprint, which set out the values, the beliefs and the policies of the coalition parties. Future Directions raised three crucial tests to be applied by the next coalition government to any policy proposal. The first of those tests was: Does the proposal strengthen the family unit within our Community? The second was: Does the proposal give individuals more incentive and hope? The final test was: Does the proposal give a preference to private enterprise over government enterprise and government monopoly? The Prime Minister and his Ministers, despite their furious denials, have been panicked into trying to respond to the agendas set by Future Directions since its launch last December. In that context, I welcome a number of the measures announced last night which reduce some of the bias in our tax system· against families. But let us not delude ourselves. We are still left with a tax system which has a profound bias against families, we still have an economic climate which hobbles initiative and enterprise and denies individuals lasting incentive; we still maintain massive public monopolies which cheat consumers; and this Government still dabbles with the notion that politicians and bureaucrats can run businesses and peoples' lives better than individual Australian men and women. In other words, the Government, having acknowledged the agenda set by Future Directions, has manifestly failed to match the standards of that document. I believe that both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have underestimated the intelligence of the Australian community. Australian families know full well that a tax cut rapidly devoured by higher inflation and higher mortgage interest rates is no tax cut at all. For years now we have lived with economic crisis and different excuses have fallen from the lips of the Government Ministers. Three years ago we were on the verge of being a banana republic but, now that our commodity prices are booming, new scapegoats must be found and, no doubt, as further failure compounds current failures, something else will be put in the dock. Tonight I have outlined what the Treasurer should have said last night. Australia's problem is not that we lack resources. It is not our people; they are amongst the best and hardest working in the world. We are a stable nation politically and economically because we do not use our human resources productively enough, we continue to have economic problems. The challenge to raise our national productivity was the challenge that the Treasurer utterly failed to address last night, and that is why his statement has been greeted with cynicism. Mr Tim Fischer-Madam Speaker, I raise a point of order. On the basis of the criterion of a fair go in this House, would you care firstly to explain to the House the cause of the technical interference during the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and, secondly, to comment on the conduct of the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) in the course of that televised address?",115
251,Madam SPEAKER,ECONOMY,"The Chair can only explain that something has gone quite wrong with the air-conditioning and that was the noise the honourable member heard. I am sorry, I was not watching the honourable member for Prospect; I was looking elsewhere. Debate (on motion by Mr Beazley) adjourned. NA NA (No.2) 1987 In Committee Consideration resumed.",119
252,Mr ROCHER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The amendments which are proposed to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1987 will leave the Bill with only some major planks which seek to prevent importers minimising customs duty. However, according to the financial impact statement, the only directly measurable revenue gains will be $5.2m. This revenue derives from amendments, to clause 12 which will include in the valuation of imported goods for customs purposes the cost of freight and insurance of those goods within a foreign country. This will represent a direct cost to importers and ultimately, of course, to consumers. I remind honourable member's that those consumers are not always people buying retail or luxury goods but, just as often, are manufacturers who require components for the production of goods ih Australia but, which could ultimately be exported or, equally importantly, replace imports. It is not a logical or necessary change to the present position. This change has the potential to create new anomalies as further advantages are given to those who ship directly from container depots in the major overseas ports. The Government has made noises suggesting that it can see the potential problems in this provision but is not willing to do anything about that right now. This is a completely unsatisfactory position for everyone, including industry, which needs certainty and stability in the application of customs duties and laws. The change I have mentioned is only a small part of a host of problems with the legislation as it will stand if these amendments are passed. The complexity of the legislation will cause considerable concern amongst those who have had to deal with it if this Bill becomes law. The problems of complexity mirror difficulties which this Government has had with a range of its legislation. The common thread to such complexities is that they are usually concerned with revenue raising or the punitive functions of government. For example, in the Australian Taxation Office the complexity and ambiguity of poorly drafted legislation has been used to maximise the revenue gained from taxpayers through the use of penalties and a less than clear assessment of their liabilities. The. Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1987, amendments to which we are now discussing, deals with the particularly important area of the valuation of imported goods for customs purposes and audit and verification powers to substantiate valuations. Unless the procedures laid down for these areas, which are important to the easy flow of traded goods, are as simple and effective as possible, both Australian businesses and consumers will suffer. Needless complexity does not assisJ the Australian Customs Service, which must administer the legislation and sift through the ambiguity to produce consistent decisions which will stand up under legal challenge. The valuation provisions of the Bill are made more uncertain and potentially more onerous by the vast discretion given to the collectors of customs duties. It has been pointed out that 84 discretionary powers have been given to those making valuations under this Bill. The excessive use of discretionary power is not only indicative of lazy drafting of legislation, but also has the potential to produce a complete mess of the area where discretion is granted. The resort to greater discretionary and administrative powers is a feature of the incompetence of this Labor Government. The growth of these powers undermines the certainty of the rule of law and the ability of businesses to make sound commercial decisions. A further feature of these amendments is the granting of power to administrative authorities which traditionally has been exercised only by the police or through the courts. Customs officials are to be given extensive powers to enter private offices and to inspect and copy documents. It is also to be made easier for Customs to obtain warrants and conduct searches. These powers should be taken very seriously indeed; yet the Government seems willing to throw these powers around with little regard for the rights of private citizens, or for the limits of government power. I doubt that the Government, with its traditional disregard for the sanctity of private property, is really aware of the enormity of the power involved in entering someone's premises at a time suitable to the Customs officials and having the ability to search for any relevant documentation, not on suspicion of a criminal offence, but merely to verify the assessment of customs duties.",119
253,Mr COBB,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,The rights of individuals don't matter to them.,120
254,Mr ROCHER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is very heavy-handed stuff indeed. The record of other government departments which have similar powers is not very encouraging. The infamous Australian Tax Office raids on major corporations and providers of professional services is the most recent example of the disregard for the rights of citizens by Commonwealth Government administrative authorities. There is another danger to these administrative problems. Throughout the world there is a growing concern with the rapid growth in non-tariff trade barriers. Any measure which makes it more difficult or more costly to bring goods into the country is a form of protection. If Australia is to have maximum credibility in world trade debates, it is essential that Australian law dealing with trade is of the very highest standards. The amended legislation which we are considering today does not meet those standards.",120
255,Mr DOWNER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"When I spoke to the amendments before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was discussing foreign inland freight and the implications of the Government's amendments for the costs of importing into Australia certain goods which had incurred additional costs because of the application of the duty on foreign inland freight. I made the point then that I was concerned that, although the Government had said that it would refer these matters to the Industries Assistance Commission if there were any anomalies, it would take a great deal of time to resolve, and even when the Industries Assistance Commission had made its recommendations there would be no guarantee that the Government would act on those recommendations. That is a sloppy way to draft legislation; to draft it on the basis of hope-hope that the Government will do the right thing. The Government promised that it would not introduce a capital gains tax but it did. That is a very poor basis on which to draft legislation. I have had representations from people who claim that this provision discriminates against small business. For example, a full container load which is assembled in a place such as Chicago and transported to a port and, in turn, sent to Australia would not attract duty on foreign inland freight. However, products which are packed at a container depot such as Los Angeles, having been transported in smaller parts from Chicago to Los Angeles, would attract foreign inland freight duty. I would like the Minister for Science, Customs and Sma]l Business (Mr Barry Jones) to clarify that point, because there is a lot of concern in the community about that apparent anomaly in the legislation. I would be happy if the Government clarified the potential for that anomaly occurring. We on this side of the House have also expressed concern, as the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) did. recently, about the implication for civil liberties in this sort of legislation. Some of the amendments enhance very substantially the powers of the Australian Customs Service to enter premises. The Law Council of Australia is a very good example of a highly reputable and respected body which is extremely concerned about giving the Australian Customs Service the sorts of powers which the Australian Taxation Office has. When one considers the enormous number of government instrumentalities, State and Federal, which are able simply to walk into people's business or private premises with some sort of warrant and inspect those premises for all sorts of vicarious reasons, one can see how civil liberties in this country are declining progressively. This sort of Customs power is a matter of concern to us because it is yet another example of still more power being put into the hands of the bureaucracy at the expense of ordinary Australians. I have raised with the Minister and his officials my concern about Australian Customs Service officers being able to obtain warrants by telephone. I do not think that a Customs officer simply telephoning a magistrate and asking for a warrant to raid some business premises is an appropriate way of protecting civil liberties. If the community knew about the way in which those civil liberties could so easily be infringed in such a casual way, I know the broader community would support my concerns. I have suggested that, at the very minimum, if a warrant is to be obtained by telephone it should be obtained from a judge, as is the case, for example, under the provisions of the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Act 1987 and the National Crime Authority Act 1984. I know that the Government has rejected this proposal because it suits the Australian Customs Service to implement its powers in the easiest, most casual, way. I understand that it suits the bureaucracy, but my concern is not always to satisfy the bureaucracy. My concern is to satisfy the rights of individuals in this country as well. The Government's proposal that a Customs officer, good as he may be-and I am not reflecting on the integrity of our Customs Service-can just pick up the phone, under this Act, and ring a magistrate and ask for a warrant is entirely inappropriate. Let me say at once that these amendments are an improvement on the original proposal from the Customs Service that such a warrant could be obtained from a justice of the peace. In most instances a justice of the peace is not even a lawyer. It is quite outrageous that the Customs Service should have even considered including that sort of power in legislation. The Minister approved that proposal and he, not his officials, who might have put forward some advice which he accepted, is CUlpable. The Minister is responsible. He has agreed at least to restrict the issuing of warrants by telephone to magistrates, but this is still far too generous a power to give to officials. The last point I wish to make about these amendments is that this sort of legislation enhances enormously the discretionary powers of the Australian Customs Service. The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1987 will add 84 different discretions in the valuation provisions to the Australian Customs Service. Anybody in this Parliament who takes notice of his or her constituents will know of the enormous problems caused by providing that sort of discretion to the Australian Taxation Office. Quite frankly, it would be utter madness to extend such discretion to other government instrumentalities. For those reasons, we on this side of the Chamber have enormous concern about the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1987 and, indeed, the amendments before the Committee. We are concerned about the enormous complexity of the legislation in terms of the valuation provisions. We are concerned about the implications of imposing duty on foreign inland freight-a measure that has been taken simply to satisfy some obtuse gap provision. We are concerned about the increase in the powers to Australian Customs officers to enter premises. We are concerned about the casual way the Minister wants to give the Australian Customs Service the power to obtain warrants just in a casual phone call with a casual magistrate. And we are, above all, concerned about the enormous additional discretionary powers that the Australian Customs Service has been given through this general legislation and through these amendments. On this side of the Chamber, as we expressed the view in another place, we stand opposed to this particular legislation and its amendments.",120
256,Mr BARRY JONES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"1 do not propose to detain the Committee very long. I just make the point that the speech that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) made before the suspension of the sitting for dinner began by his saying that this legislation had been rushed through, that there had been absolutely minimal consultation and that it was an example of a very heavy-handed authoritarian approach by the Government and in particular-Mr DownerYes Minister legislation.",122
257,Mr BARRY JONES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member said it was Yes Minister legislation. He obviously thought that was an original line. The point is that this legislation has had about the gestation period of an elephant. It was introduced into the House in November 1987. It was clear that, as it was, it would not be able to pass the Senate because a whole number of objections were raised by various interest groups. The result was that over a very extended period, months, there were negotiations with organisers. In fact, far from it being a case of the bureaucrats whipping it past me and my applying my bare stamp at the end, I was very heavily involved in a number of the areas on which the major interest groups put their views. I was part of the negotiation and went through the whole thing with them, so I was very actively involved throughout. It has taken a long time because some of the organisations wanted further time to consult, they wanted to go back to their members and so on. The. legislation was introduced first in November 1987. There has been 18 months of consultation. What we now have, with no fewer than 45 amendments being introduced, is a piece of legislation about which, while I concede that there are points of disagreement with some of the special interest groups in the community, there is a much broader degree of consensus. The amendments. were circulated not just a few days ago, as the honourable member for Mayo suggested, but in February 1989 after, as I say, this very long period of discussion. We dealt with over 100 representations from interest groups and 45 of. the amendments have come in. This matter has not been handled in a very casual way; I think that it has been. handled· in a very responsible way. When the honourable member for Mayo raises the question of civil liberties, he knows that he is touching on a very sensitive nerve as far as] am concerned, because I certainly have a passionate regard for civil liberties and I am always very conscious of the .need to have some balance between preserving the rights of the citizen and the community at large. It is not as if we can say when we are concerned, for example, about the possibility of drugs entering the country, 'Well, this is all. terribly interesting. What we really need to do is to have an academic seminar of some sort where we get a marriage of the true minds and some sort of consensus about what we are going to do'. If we are going to act, we should act very quickly. It is extraordinary that an esteemed colleague of the honourable member for Mayo, the Hon. Ted Pickering, a Minister in New South Wales, is traducing the Government, and me in particular-equally inaccurately, I might say-by saying, 'Customs isn't doing the job. Why isn't it exercising powers? Why isn't it getting into it? Why isn't it really controlling the drug menace? '. I would have thought that if the honourable member for Mayo was following the line of-Mr Bilney- Mr Downer's friend Mrs Fuller is doing the same thing.",122
258,Mr BARRY JONES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes, so I understand. I would have thought that he. ,would be endorsing the fact that we are taking the problem very seriously. Mr Downer-It hasn't anything to do with drugs.",122
259,The CHAIRMAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! The honourable member for Mayo will cease interjecting.,122
260,Mr BARRY JONES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"-:-No, it is the way in which the Customs system operates. We are talking about the methodology used by Customs in order to protect the revenue and the Australian community. I will just take up a number of the points that were raised by the honourable. member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the honourable member for Mayo. The question of the special case of soda ash was raised. Some time ago Australian Consolidated Industries (ACI) approached the Government to express its concern over the new arrangements. On the basis of the figures presented it appears that importers of soda ask will face increased costs as a result of the new arrangements, resulting in a nificant and unintended increase in the level of assistance to the local industry. On the basis of the information presented by ACI and the fact that the Industries Assistance Commission (lAC) has considered assistance levels for the chemical industry as recently as 1986, it has been decided to introduce amendment in the Customs Tariff Amendon ment Bill 1989 to nullify the demonstrated assistance implications of the proposed valthe uation amendments in so far as soda ash concerned. Consideration will also be given to submissions on other products where as1981, sistance levels are shown to be significantly increased as a result of the new valuation provisions. The honourable member for Mayo raised a question about telephone warrants. I point out that the original provision in the legislavalue. tion was for justices of the peace. It has been changed now to a magistrate and in the circumstances it is a judicially trained istrate. The Government is proposing an amendment to provide a facility to permit in circumstances of urgency an application a search warrant to be made by radio, telewhereas phone or other means of communication. . Remember that Customs field audits and inspection of commercial documents might realistically have to be undertaken in parts of the country where chamber magistrates are not readily available. In situations urgency, to preclude the removal or falsifiretained cation of commercial records, a number safeguards are contained in the provision ensure against improper use, in particular requirement that a judicially trained magiswas trate must be satisfied that this provision cannot be used indiscriminately or improperly. Mr Downer interjecting",122
261,The CHAIRMAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! The honourreview able member for Mayo will cease interjectnew ing. I warn the honourable member,123
262,Mr BARRY JONES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"In the circumstan'ces, I think that is realistic.",123
263,The CHAIRMAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,The Minister should not respond to the interjections either.,123
264,Mr BARRY JONES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"No legislation is immutable. These matters are re-examined sigfrom time to time, and if evidence can be produced that there is some substantial injustice involved, I would not preclude the possibility of having another look at the legislation; but I am satisfied that it is a significant improvement on the original situation. The question of inland freight was raised. an The proposed amendments maintain the free board basis of Australia's customs valuation system in that all overseas freight from place of export to Australia is excluded is from customs value. However, when the present valuation system was introduced in provision relating to inland freight had the effect of making optional the inclusion in customs value of inland freight and related costs incurred in the country of export. If inland freight and related costs are paid other than to the benefit of the vendor, then the amount is not included in the customs That has created two possibilities: first, a purchaser may arrange its affairs so that all magfreighting is done by a third party to whom it pays directly; secondly, the purchaser may describe the freight carrier as a third party for in the documents supplied to Customs, that party is not in fact an arm's length third party but rather a conduit for those payments to the vendor. Customs has no way of distinguishing between the two situations by reference to the documentation provided to it by importers, since in the of latter situation relevant documents will be overseas to ensure information about of it is beyond Customs reach and knowledge. to The solution chosen in the Bill is to remove the the deduction for foreign inland freight. It indicated in April 1987 in regard to the Government's strategy on the package of amendments that where the new valuation arrangements significantly raised protection levels for local industry, the Government would be prepared to consider requests for by the lAC within six months of the provisions coming into operation. That for Mayo. remains the case. I think that covers the major matters raised by the Opposition. I tender the replacement explanatory memorandums. They cover the substance of the amendments.

(1) Subject to section 243v, where: (a) a person, whether knowingly, recklessly or otherwise:"" and substituting""'243T (I) Subject to section 243V, where: (a) a person, whether knowingly or recklessly:"". The amendment that 1I have moved to the set of Senate amendments relates to the Senate's amendment No. 11. The reason that we on this side of the chamber are unhappy about this amendment is that the words it uses-'a person, whether knowingly, recklessly or otherwise:'-in relation to those who furnish a false or misleading statement being subject to penalties, are far too liberal. Our concern is the same concern we have had throughout the debates on this series of Customs Bills; it is a concern about the civil liberties implications of this sort of legislation. Let me go to the report by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills which I have in front of me. The report talks about proposed new section 243T (1) (a), the section which We on this side of the chamber would like to amend. 1 want to read to the chamber what the Senate that is false or misleading in a Committee report says: material particular; or The Committee is concerned that innocent as well as fraudulent misstatements render the maker liable officer any matter or thing with- to duty. The Minister's view expressed in his reout which the statement is mis- sponse of 9 December 1987 that this is part of the leading in a material particular;'; price to be paid for a 'green line' Customs clearance does not in the Committee's view justify the terms of this section. The clause is brought to the attention of Senators case of an offence against para- as being possibly in breach of principle 1 (a) (i) of graph (I) (vi), by a penalty not the Terms of Reference in that it may be considered exceeding $5,000. '; to unduly trespassthat is the Committee's split infinitive, not subsection: mine, Ministeron personal rights and liberties. That report by the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee sums up very clearly the concerns we have on this side of the chamber. The Minister teils us that he is concerned about civil liberties but, as has been explained to him before, he is not making provision in this legislation for people who have simply made a perfectly honest-'let us say for the sake of argument-typographical error. If somebody who does that-for example, a typist who puts the decimal point in the wrong place or whatever it may bedoes not happen to notice this minuscule change, that person will be subject to fairly severe penalties. I appreciate that that person can seek a remission from those penalties. I appreciate that Customs can give that person a remission. On the other hand, Customs may decide not to do so. The person could then go off to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and so the process of law continues. The fact is that if somebody were to make an honest, simple slip, he would be guilty until he somehow proved himself to be innocent. I think the words 'or otherwise' are far too general. The Government is giving Customs this discretion-that is one thing-to determine whether a declaration has been misleading knowingly or recklessly, but it is adding to that discretion by saying 'and in any other way as well'. In other words, if there happens to be anything wrong with it, Customs can impose a few penalties. I am not denying the Minister's argument against this, which is 'Oh, well, we have some sort of remissions provisions'. I have been through that point. The fact is that people should not be subject to potentially officious behaviour because of casual drafting of legislation. The Minister and I have had some discussions about this matter. I have suggested to the Minister, as we are suggesting in this amendment, that the words 'or otherwise' be left out. At one stage the Minister was kind enough to suggest to me that it would not be a bad idea if we replaced the word 'otherwise' with the word 'negligently'. Let me put it on the record that, having considered the matter overnight, I would be perfectly happy to have accepted the use of the word 'negligently'. I do not think people should be negligent. I do not think they should be reckless. I do not think they should knowingly try to mislead Customs. I think Customs should act against people who do those sorts of things. But it is completely unreasonable to impose penalties on people who might have made some completely innocent typographical error. Some people argue that we can at least accept the good faith of the Australian Customs Service, that its officers are not likely to act in a malicious or officious way. That is not a bad point. My experience of Customs officers in the six months I have been shadow Minister for Customs is that they are perfectly reasonable people and I do not think that typically they are malicious or officious. But who knows what will happen in the years ahead? If the Government is presenting legislation to the Parliament, it should co so in a way that ensures that that legislation covers various unforeseen contingencies, what has become part of the Australian lexicon in recent years since the Hawke Government has been in power-unintended consequences. When one drafts legislation one has to think those things through. Who knows what the Customs officers will be like in future generations? Whilst we will be administering the Australian Customs Service in that time, I, as the Minister, will not be selecting every officer to work in the Customs Service. The legislation should be watertight. The Parliament should be outlining precisely what it intends rather than using vague language of this kind. The only other point I want to make about this Bill concerns the Australian Democrats. We do not talk much about the Australian Democrats in here. I am sorry that the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney) has left the chamber because he is utterly obsessed with the Australian Democrats. I do not think he thinks about much else during the day and possibly during most of the night as well. I imagine that he lies in bed, tossing and turning, worrying about them. There is a Senator called Senator MCLean whom I discovered recently. Senator MCLean, in a great and bold speech on this Bill, said that the Democrats would oppose this Bill unless the Government agreed to certain rather byzantine amendments in relation to the export of defence equipment. Naturally, the Government did not agree to that, as it turned out. So I assumed that the Democrats would oppose the Bill. Interestingly, after what must have been a very heated discussion between Senator Button and Senator Haines-I am only guessing, but I think that must have been what hapRened-suddenly the Democrats caved in. We want to know what sorts of deals the Government has been doing with the Democrats in the Senate over the years to find out why it is that they continually cave in on these sorts of matters. It is interesting to see the way the Democrats stand up and thump the tub saying that they will do this and they will do that. They are all so strong and brave, saying that they will stand up for these sorts of people and those sorts of people, but when the crunch comes they simply cave in. These amendments to the legislation before us provide one example of the Democrats behaving in that quite extraordinary way. Let me end on a positive note. In this legislation' the Government has changed the forfeiture provisions. We on this side of the chamber certainly welcome those changes. There have been a lot of problems over forfeiture. They have been brought to my attention in the last few weeks. I was not aware of them before that. There have been a lot of problems and inequities involved with that kind of penalty, and I am glad that these amendments clear them up.",126
266,Mr ROCHER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"As was so eloquently stated by my colleague the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), the Opposition is concerned that the imposition of penalties under the propo'sed new section 243T in the amendments is potentially draconian in its application to cases of inadvertent error rather than deceit. The proposed section seeks to act as a disincentive for any errors, no matter, it seems, what their cause. I am not sure whether my colleague the honourable member for Mayo moved the amendment whiCh was circulated in his name-Mr Downer-I did.",128
267,Mr ROCHER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That is great, because I support that amendment. I now understand from the Chair that that is the case. I am sure that industry would not object to such penalties if public officials were also given the same incentives to perform. Everyone who is involved in business can recite a long list of errors by government officials which have cost them time and money. Often these errors are minor and understandable and do not really bring discredit on the public servants involved. But, with the efforts of businesses to complete the plethora of documentation and requirements which the Government imposes on them, it is equally clear that they should not be brought into discredit either. Minor errors should not be the subject of penalties as long as action is taken to rectify the situation on discovery of the errors. If commercial enterprises are expected to tolerate the multitude of errors by government and its agencies, then government should deal fairly with people in commerce. Surely there should be reciprocal arrangements. The offending part of this Bill, and the one we seek t6 amend, imposes a penalty on , a person who 'whether knowingly, recklessly or otherwise' makes a false statement. Clearly, the term 'or otherwise' is a broad catch-all which can include a multitude of very minor sins. The solution proposed by the Government to the obviously arbitrary nature of this provision is to give yet more discretion to the Comptroller. The Comptroller has the ability already under proposed new section 243u to approve an application for remission of the penalties imposed under section 243T. Additionally, allowance is made for an owner of goods to include a statement that he or she is uncertain about particular information and thereby become exempt from the penalty if that information turns out to be favourable to the granting of an exemption. These exemptions are insufficient to protect importers from being heavily penalised for inadvertent errors. For these reasons, the Opposition has proposed the deletion of the words 'or otherwise' from this proposed section, so as to penalise only those who give false information 'knowingly or recklessly'. The penalty for recklessly making false statements should still provide incentives against repeated errors without the inclusion of the incredibly wide term 'or otherwise'. That term is so broad as to include, to give an absurd but real example, the making of false statements with, one's shoelaces undone. The Government made it clear in debate in the Senate that the purpose of this proposed new section of the Bill is to provide deterrence against underpayment of duty. It is clear from this Bill that the Government does not believe that it could prove that such underpayments are deliberate if tested in the courts. If, as has been suggested, the end to errors can really bring in another $26m of revenue-and I would be surprised if it could-if they are really errors, these penalties cannot do much to change the situation. If the shortfall does not result from mistakes, the amended clause, as proposed by the Opposition, will still be an effective measure for the Australian Customs Service to administer its responsibilities.",128
268,Mr BARRY JONES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,The Government cannot accept the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer)-Mr Downer-We proposed it-,129
269,Mr BARRY JONES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"No, not quite, because the form the honourable member has put up is not the form that we discussed at an earlier stage. Mr Downer-Senator Button wouldn't agree to it.",129
270,Mr BARRY JONES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Well, that is the honourable member's problem. This matter cannot be seen in isolation. It has to be seen as a corollary of the fast-track system, for customs clearance. It is not a matter of criminal intent. The fundamental distinction between the proposed new section to which the amendment is proposed and the previous section is. that the previous section provides for criminality, where the concept of J)lens rea is essential. Under section 234 (a), for a person to be convicted of an offence the Australian Customs Service must have been able to prove criminal animus-that something or other was done knowingly or recklessly or that someone has made a false or misleading statement-and high penalties are prescribed. . The alternative approach is deliberately designed as a catch-all. Instead of· going through· the whole business of what would, in effect, be a trial, the intention is to try handle such things administratively, with Customs not acting as a court and not trying to decide whether an error has been made. Thus, the only question will be: Is there an error? It will not matter whether an error is due to a lapse of memory, a bereavement in the family or something. The only question will be: Is there. an error? The question of motive-the question of whether it was done deliberately, falsely, maliciously, accidentally, negligently and so on-will not really come into it. The question of penalty will be a matter to be determined by regard to the drcumstances, and I would certainly hopeI am sure the honourable member for Mayo would endorse this-that, although it is a rather broad dragnet provision, it will be administered in a sensible, compassionate and balanced way. I am sure that it will be. There are strong public policy reasons why this approach has been adopted. As I said, it is a corollary to the fast-track or green line system of processing imports under which in 90 per cent of circumstances an entry will be processed based on the information provided by the importer. But we have to recognise that there is a downside. If one says, 'Accept what I have written here on its face value, and let us not go through the whole business .of inspection', one cannot at the same time say, 'Mind you, if I have accidentally misdescribed and there is an accidental error,I do not want to be called to account for it'. If an importer does not want to go through the green line system and says, 'Here you are. I am not absolutely certain that what I have described here is correct. The country of origin may be wrong. There may be some significant difference in it. I would like you to go through it all and check it out', then, of course, he does not get the fast-track system. The transaction will be held up, but the importer knows that there is no possibility of being caught by this provision. It is really a matter of saying, 'Which way will I go?'. Does one choose the green line system with the implication that one accepts full accountability or the imposition of strict liability, or does one do it the other way, whereby one says, 'No, I am not absolutely certain that what I have described is right. I want to go through it all. Inspect it; check it to out'? In that case, it is the responsibility of Customs to make the decision and the importer is not held strictly accountable for anything, unless he has put something down that is deliberately, knowingly, falsely or recklessly wrong. Then that is a criminal offence. One has to see those twq things as a corollary; they are inextricably linked. Even where there is an innocent mistake-the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) adverted to this-for example, the transposed decimal point, it has the effect that government rev-nue is reduced but it also means that the amount of protection given to Australian industry because of the presence of the tariff is reduced and that other importers competing in the same market place, who have paid the lawful amount of duty, are prejudiced. If one went to the people who complain about this and said 'All right, let's go right back to where we were before. Let's abandon this section, but at the same time, let's abandon the green line approach as well', I do not think one would get too many takers, because the answer would be 'No, it suits us to have the fast-track method; it suits us to go through as quickly as we can,' and 90 per cent of them go that way. One can then say, 'Okay, in that case you pay the price and the price is that you have to acknowledge the obligation to meet a test of strict liability. The honourable member for Mayo referred to what he called an honest error. In this context there is no such thing as an honest error. The only question is: Is it an error? Mr Rocher-I know, but that is what we were worried about.",129
271,Mr BARRY JONES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"If people do not like it that way, they should not use the fasttrack system. If people want us to get rid of the fast-track system perhaps we can be accommodating, but importers will not think that that is a terrific idea. I reiterate-at the risk of tedious repetition-that that is the point. If we want the fast-track system we have to take the lumps with it. If we do not want the fast-track system, we have to get our constituents and the importers - o say that they do not want it and we will have another look at it. If we have the benefit of fast-track, we have to take the detriment as well. The Government rejects the amendment.",130
272,Mr DOWNER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Let me say, for the record, that the Opposition is not opposed to the fast-track system, or the green line system. There is no question of that. Nobody would think for a minute that we were. Customs should be looking out for people who are using that system. Customs have random checks within that system-l think I am right in saying it checks one person in 10. Customs should be trying to catch those people who frankly are knowingly and recklessly making misleading statements, not people who have made unfortunate oversights. Mr Barry Jones-But you get them under the earlier section.",130
273,Mr DOWNER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"And under this section, which gives Customs the power to impose administrative penalties where there is clearly not some sort of massive criminal intent involved. I also wish to make a couple of other points. The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) said that he hoped the system would be administered in a fair way. I guess that confirms my concerns; it is not a matter of hope with legislation. It is a question of the Parliament saying, 'It will be administered in a fair way'. This is what we define as 'administered in a fairway'. I do not think we should send legislation out from this Parliament just on a wing and a prayer-in hope. There was an interjection, which would have gone on record in Hansard. I want to clarify it. I said at one stage, when the Minister was talking about some discussions we had about an alternative amendment which included using the word 'negligently' rather than 'or otherwise', ,that I should have moved that amendment here and the Minister said, 'That is your problem'. Actually, it is not because I know from the way the Government voted in the Senate, that the Minister, would have opposed that amendment had we moved it.",130
274,Mr BARRY JONES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Opposition did not move that way in the Senate. It moved in the Senate simply to cut out the words 'or otherwise'. Mr Downer-We proposed it to you and then we were told by Senator Button that he would not do it, that he would not agree to it. MI' BARRY JONES-I think I was wrong to have been as conciliatory as I was. There was some question at that stage as to whether the legislation would be carried in the Senate because of the views of the other party. Once it became clear that the legislation would be carried in the Senate, perhaps we would not have needed to negotiate for so very long that night. I table the revised explanatory memorandum.

The Opposition did not oppose this Bill before in the House of Representatives, but we did move, when it went to the Senate, for an inquiry into the sugar industry, because the original Bill proposed some changes to the level of protection for the sugar industry. The Government has now proposed two amendments to the Bill which were passed through the Senate. The first was to amend the operative date for changes relating to vinyl wallpaper. We have no problems with that. The second was to delete the proposed new Customs duties for certain sugar products, which obviated the need to refer that matter to a Senate committee. Therefore, the Opposition welcomes the amendments. Throughout this tortuous process of going through these very complicated and detailed pieces of legislation, I have had very great cooperation from the officers of the Australian Customs Service. I would like to thank them for the enormous amount of time they have spent in coming to my office and going through this legislation. There were numerous telephone calls, in particular to Ken MCKinniss. Their patience has been tremendous. I know they certainly serve the Minister very well, even though, curiously enough, at the end of the day he often makes some very strange decisions. Question resolved in the affirmative.

Debate resumed.",131
276,Mr BILNEY,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I have great pleasure in supporting the remarks of my colleague the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles), who earlier today presented this very important report on Australia's relations with the island states of the South Pacific. The report represents more than three years work of a subcommittee of the Joint Committee, and I congratulate all 15 members of the subcommittee on their hard work, dedication and perseverence in agreeing to this unanimous and, in my opinion, very valuable report to the Parliament. It is not often realised that much of the work that is done in the Parliament is done with cooperation among members and with agreement among them on the matters that come before them. This very thick report represents just such an instance of that kind of cooperation and consensus. Indeed, I am reminded of an occasion two or three weeks ago when the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade brought down a report on Australia's aid and development policies. Similarly, that policy was agreed to by all parties and it managed to get five sentences in the Advertiser newspaper in my home State. On the same day some candidate for the mayoralty complained about junketing by another candidate and that got 18 sentences and a picture on page 2. Inescapably, the conclusion is that the media pay attention only when there is some sort of suggestion that politicians are junketing or brawling; they pay very little attention to the much more constructive work which is done by most of us most of the time. This report is a very important one. Although Australia has had a long standing inOrders volvement in and contact with the South Pacific region, until relatively recently it has not been an active participant in regional affairs. Earlier contact was primarily for reasons of commercial exploitation or, at the other end of the scale-perhaps closely related-through the work of missionaries. There was a period of administration of a number of territories and naturally involvement in military action in both world wars. Report As the report notes, until the middle of the 1970s, Australian governments tended to treat the region in a benign but rather paternalistic fashion. However, the rate of change within the region, particularly in the last 10 years or so, has brought home to Australians in a very powerful way that the Pacific is pacific no longer. Australia's changing responses to events in this rapidly evolving region are documented in the report. The Committee's report itself is a reflection of the fact that Australia is now according appropriate attention to regional matters. I do not intend to delay the House for too long, because I know that other members of the Committee wish to speak in this debate. The honourable member for Isaacs has already highlighted a number of important areas in which the Committee makes major observation and recommendations, including political developments in the region, education and migration issues and economic development. However, I would like to highlight development assistance to the region, which has come to assume a very important part in recent times, and to indicate some of the Committee's other considerations. In volume terms, Australia is the major aid donor to the independent South Pacific states. Indeed, about 50 per cent of the country program of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) goes to the South Pacific, in which one includes Papua New Guinea. Despite this and other substantial and increasing amounts of aid, the smaller Pacific nations remain largely economically dependent. Among the reasons for this situation, the more important factors are the natural characteristics of the smaller states-their so-called micro nature and remote locality, their limited revenue base and their high population growth rates by world standards. The report notes: The total land area of the whole region is relatively small in proportion to the ocean in which these states are situated. Small populations, revenue base, geographic remoteness and fragmentation, limited telecommunications and high transport costs have hindered the development of not only production of goods for domestic user, but also participation of these countries in the world market. Economies of scale are difficult to achieve with small, scattered populations, and many of the countries have insufficient funds from domestic revenue sources to finance the type of developments in infrastructure necessary to attract foreign investment. Notwithstanding these factors, the Committee has concluded that to varying extents the island states' economic performance could be improved in three major areas. These areas involve improvements in and diversification of primary production, the development of tourism and the development of small scale industry. The Committee recommends that the Government promote the establishment of a South Pacific Forum agricultural diversification unit. If further recommends a more regional approach to marketing and promoting tourism with the region and specifically calls for action by AIDAB to review regional assistance in the tourism and hospitality industries. The report examines in some detail Australia's economic relationship with the region, including trends in the relationship, the pros and cons of preferential trade agreements and the prospects of greater private sector involvement in investment in the region. It looks at regional defence and security issues, in which some of my colleagues have a particular interest. The report also analyses political developments and trends, concluding with an examination of levels of public awareness in Australia of regional conditions and issues and the impact of Australian media activities. I could deal with a number of other issues, but I do not want to take too much time. However, I would like to conclude by quoting the last two sentences of the report: Australia has expertise and knowledge of the region, arising from long involvement, particularly with the Melanesian countries, and should offer such expertise freely. Australia and the region have great potential to strengthen their ties of friendship and co-operation; with goodwill and continued effort on both sides the next century should truly be the age of the Pacific. I believe that sentiment is widely shared not just within the Committee, but also within a limited the House. It encapsulates the tone which goes through this report. I believe the report is a most timely and significant contribution to public discussion of Australia's role in regional affairs. Again, I congratulate the honourable member for Isaacs and his colleagues on the work they have done. As the process of re-evaluation of Australian foreign policy towards the region continues, it can only be assisted by a more informed Parliament, press and public. I commend the report to the House for its contribution to that process.",132
277,Mr RUDDOCK,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"1 welcome the opportunity to contribute to the discussion this evening of this report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, entitled Australia's Relations with the South Pacific. Like the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney), who spoke before me, I am pleased to have been able to participate in the development of this report. He commended the Opposition and the parliamentarians generally for a document which deals with a great variety of issues and which does not contain dissentient views. In that spirit of bipartisanship I would like to mention two other matters, the first being the cooperation of the Government in relation to ensuring that a greater number of members than usual are able to participate in this debate by bringing the matter on again for discussion tonight, and secondly the way in which the Government cooperated readily in relation to assisting the Committee in carrying out its investigation for the preparation of this report. As the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles) mentioned in the debate this afternoon, this report contains a number of parts. Whilst the body of it deals with the principal terms of reference that the Committee was asked to deal with, there is an annexure whiCh would normally be a report from a parliamentary delegation if members of parliament had travelled to the countries that are part of the South Pacific. It is a fact that over a long period only rarely have parliamentary committees been given the opportunity, in carrying out their work, to travel and to look at many of the places about which they are commenting in their report. It was my view-a view which the Government obviously shar.ed-considering the importance of the South Pacific to Australia, that it was of fundamental importance that members of the subcommittee were able to form their views against the background of a visit to the region. So in June and July of last year a visit was undertaken by the leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Isaacs, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar), Senator Schacht, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) and the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), and me as the member for Dundas. We visited the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Fiji, Western Samoa, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Nauru and Vanuatu. I will come back to the way in which that visit influenced, I think, the report that is before the House.. It is important in looking at this report to recognise the breadth of it. I have said that the region is important· to Australia and that understanding the region is fundamental to our being able to react properly to issues that might affect us. We have seen that in relation to Vanuatu and Fiji. As has been mentioned by colleagues who have spoken earlier, we are dealing with a region that is diverse racially, historically and politically. Many of us have a romantic view of the region. In 'my own electorate last weekend I attended a musical comedy presentation by The Hills Musical Society of South Pacific. We have a romanticised view of the region as a result of the many writings of those who were there earlier and the way in which the area has been of such delight to many who have toured it for holidays or short vacations. Notwithstanding that, we are now challenged by rapid political and social change that is taking place, and that makes this report particularly timely. It is because, I think, of the way in which we were unprepared for the changes that occurred in Fiji and Vanuatu that there was a desire to expedite consideration of this report. I cannot cover all the ground that the report covers, but let me note that it deals with economic issues that affect Australia, economic performance of the area itself, the constraints to development that exist, natural. resource management.in relation to agriculture, fishing, mining and forestry and the dangers associated with them. It deals with the importance of tourism. We deal with small business expansion and the economic prospects of the region. We deal with the trade relationship. with Australia-Australian-South Pacific trade-preferential trade agreements that exist, promotional assistance and Australian investment. We deal with the question whether economic relations ought to be pursued in a closer way through such arrangements as the Pacific Basin concept and private sector development, aid and trade questions. We deal with Australia's development assistance policies in the region, the purpose of aid, development potential and we look at Australia's aid projects. We look .at the volume of aid and the development of country programs where' aid has been developed on a country by country basis. We look at the collection of data, program design and selection, the role of non-government organisations. We look particularly at aid cooperation between Australia and the countries of' the region, but not only the countries of the region; we also consider the other countries that wish to give aid to the South Pacific. We look at a number of other areas, inimpacted upon me. cluding education, communications, transportation, health, women, environmental issues and the greenhouse fect in particular. Honourable members appreciate that many of the countries we speaking of are mere atolls which rise only several feet above sea level and they will appreciate why there is a natural concern amongst their populations as to their future in the context of this issue which we are addressing in Australia. We look at the quesThey tion of migration, the many calls for change, the impact of migration on the source countries, the question of remittances, guest worker schemes and other issues that affect Australia, such as illegal immigrants and the like.. Then we canvass the political and security questions, relations with Australia and Zealand, ANZUS, threats to the region, South' Pacific defence capabilities and Australia's response to those matters, the question of whether there should be a regional peacekeeping force. We undertake an overview of the political relationship, our relasome tionships as well as bilateral relations and the larger multilateral scene. We look at South Pacific development trends in the area of New Caledonia, the nuclear issue quessubstantial tion, French Polynesia, involvement of other countries such as the Soviet Union; Libya, Japan and the United States of America and whether there ought to be special ways addressing those issues .. We look at a number of other political developments, some of the law and order questions and political stability. We look Fiji's new constitution. We look at the have my home. prospects for the future of Fiji. We look at Vanuatu and the constitutional problems that it has faced. I think honourable members will appreciate that this is a very Wide-rangfrom ing report. The recommendations it contains are of importance to all Australians. I would like to take the opportunity of canvassing many of them, were there time for me to do so, but despite the Government's generosity, that time is not available. So I want to make a couple of comrnents only, arising from the Committee's visit to the region and for the purpose of emphasis. I do not play favourites with countries. l will not canvass them all but I want to emphasise two matters that The first matter relates to Vanuatu. We youth, welcomed the opportunity of meeting Father efWalter Lini. I was very impressed with him will as a man. I was very impressed with his are explanation as to the way in which Vanuatu had developed its associations with countries such as Cuba, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Libya. It was particularly important to hear what he had to say about why he had led his nation in those directions. were the countries that very early' in the piece befriended and listened to Vanuatu. Mr Bilney-You did not mention Cuba.",133
278,Mr RUDDOCK,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"I mentioned Cuba. It is important to appreciate the very difficult circumstances that Vanuatu has faced of late, the way in which it has been portrayed in our press and the adverse impact that the New way in which those issues have been portrayed has had upon Australia. Essentially, there were two incidents. The danger to individuals was not really significant in either of them, although there were unfortunate incidents. Yet Australian tourism largely turned off as a result. Economically, the impact was significant. From the time. I spent in Vanuatu I could see no reason why Australians should not holiday there and why it should not be a very desirable destination. That is emphasised in this report. It is important that we of emphasise, for the purposes of encouraging people to go there, the inherent safety of it as a location. I would have to say that I would be much happier for my family to be wandering the streets at night in Vanuatu at than in much of Sydney, where I live and Mr Bilney-It is that Greiner Government.",135
279,Mr RUDDOCK,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"Comments like that the honourable member for Kingston are not really called for in relation to this. Might I say that New South Wales is much safer than it was when it was led so incompetently by members of the Party to which the honourable member belongs. Having put that matter behind us, let us get on with the bipartisan treatment that I am offering to this matter. The second matter relates to Nauru. Nauru has particular problems associated with perhaps its relative wealth in comparison with other countries within the region. It is making rather extravagant claims in relation to Australia as a result of the phosphate mining that took place there. I suspect that, as a result of the way in which it is making those claims, Australia has largely turned off listening to some of the other issues which Nauru would like to raise with us. What is mentioned in the report is that there is a desire, notwithstanding the question of compensation, to seek technical assistance from ' Australia in relation to the restoration of that island as a result of the mining activity. We ought to look positively at that. It is emphasised in the report. I hope those who read the debate and the report will do so with an eye to picking up questions of that sort and reacting positively to them. This is a very thought provoking report. It is one well worthy of conscientious reading by all members of the Parliament.",135
280,Dr THEOPHANOUS,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"Calwell) (9.14)I also want to pay tribute to. everyone involved in the production of the report entitled Australia's Relations with the South Pacific. It is, as the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) has said, a very wideranging, and positive report dealing with many of the problems of the South Pacific. I am pleased to be associated with it as a member of the Subcommittee and also as a member of the delegation which visited the South Pacific, with the assistance of the Government, in a special trip that was undertaken last year. 1 pay tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) for supporting that trip. That support was very generous and important. The reception which the delegation received throughout the South Pacific was an indication of the high standing of the Australian Parliament amongst the peoples and governments of those· nations. We ought to do more to strengthen our relationship with the peoples and governments of the South Pacific. There is no doubt that they look to Australia for leadership, guidance and support in terms of their problems. There is much that can be done in relation to that. I want to touch on a couple of issues in relation to support of those nations. The report covers these issues quite extensively in terms of economic assistance and the problem of migration, including the guest worker program. Let me begin with the question of migration, because it was an issue that naturally, as the chairman of the Government's immigration committee, I raised in the various discussions we had in the different countries. I .am pleased to see that there is a whole chapter devoted to it in the report. It is quite clear that because of the guest worker program in New Zealand an expectation has arisen throughout the South Pacific that we ough- to have in place some program which allows people from the Pacific Islands to come to Australia to work and send remittances home to their relatives in those countrieS, thereby assisting the population in those countries with their economic problems. Remittances from relatives living in Australia and New Zealand' are in some cases the major source of external finance for many of these countries. without those· sorts of remittances the economies of these countries in certain instances would collapse. Naturally, . there was a lot of pressure on the delegation-indeed there remains pressure on the Australian Government-to do more to assist in terms of having programs similar to the one in Nyw Zealand; that is, a program whereby people from those nations can come to Australia to work and send back remittances. The problem is, as you would be aware, Mr Deput):' Speaker, that we have no such program. We do not have guest worker programs in Australia. Because of that, many people from ·the Pacific Islands have tried to get into similar programs by migrating to Australia. But again, because our immigration policy is based on non-discriminatory principles, we have the situation where we have no positive discrimination in favour of peoples from the Pacific Islands. What does this mean in concrete terms? Because of the points system that applies in immigration, many of the people from the Pacific, Islands who want to migrate to Australia, either temporarily or permanently, are not able to do so. That does not mean - hat there is anything wrong with our non-discriminatory program, but it is impacting on them in a way which they see as unfair. They see it as discrimiclear natory. They say, 'Look, Australia is our brother, our big neighbour. We expc;:ct tralia to assist us. One of the forms of assistthere, ance we expect from Australia is an opportunity to work there and be able to send remittances home. We have been told that to do so we have to migrate to AusThey tralia, but when we try to migrate to Ausety tralia under the official immigration program we are stopped by a tough points system which we understand is non-discriniinatory around the world but which is hitting us and preventing us from' being able to do what want to do, in relation to assisting our counvery try by migrating to Australia'., '. This is a complex problem. It is not one that is easily solved. Nor is it one that ought to be brushed aside because, as I say, the peoples of the South Pacific consider immitwc::en gration to Australia to be probably the No.·l issue for them in rela-ipn to assisting the domestic economies and' assisting in improvthis ing the standards of living there. The report deals with these issues and tries to come with some solutions, but it is not an easy question. At first we considered that perhaps we should exempt the whole of the Pacific and allow immigration from the Pacific Australia. But the Government is not likely to adopt such a radical pp::>posal. New land had similar sorts of proposals in terms of quotas of people from the Pacific Islands .. It found that it had to restrict the program after a period because a large number of people were coming from the Pacific Islands to New Zealand. ' The Committee has suggested that one way of dealing with this problem is for the Government to consider putting'into place some kind of special training program under which people from the Pacific Islands can come to Australia to work for a short period and gain training. If this were to be the they would be able to work and get training but they would not be in breach of our general immigration guidelines. The second thing that we have suggested is that Kiribati and Tuvalu are exceptional cases-there is no doubt about it-because their economies are in a disastrous state. Unless we do something to assist them through our immigration program, it is not what will happen to them. I cannot big emphasise enough how serious the situation Ausof these two countries is. When one goes one cannot believe the physical circumstances in which people have to live. Essentially, those nations are built on coral. There is no earth there-just sand and coral. have to build an infrastructure, a sociand industry and work on the basis of these serious physical circumstances. In previous times when the popUlations were very small the circumstances might have been idyllic, but at the moment the circumstances we are serious and the standards of living are difficult for people on those islands. I think the Government ought to take seri<;>usly the question of a special program to ,-ssist the people of those two islands. But, in broader terms, the Government must consider some kind of special relationship beAustralia and the people of the Pacific Islands for the purpose of immigration. In the longer term we will have to face up to question, and it is a question that we ought to keep under constant review. Having up said that, I can assure the Parliament that the Government's immigration committee will certainly be looking into these recommendations and will be looking to discuss the outto comes with the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (SenZeaator Robert Ray) and with the Department. Another matter which has been raised is the economic links with the countries of the region. There are a number of suggestions as to how we can strengthen economic links. But I want .to sound this warning: as we j, reduce tariffs in Australia the positive relationship with the Pacific in terms of the preference that is currently given to quotas and tariffs to countries of the Pacific will become less and less important. That means that the benefits for them will become less and less. So we have to think about whether case, we need some kind of special relationship with these countries to assist them in their economic development. I am throwing that onto the agenda. I am saying that, as a result of the reduction of the tariffs and the possibility of imports from big Third World countries, the Pacific nations will be in a difficult position. I think we have to help them, and we have to start thinking now in a bipartisan way about how we can develop policies to assist them and their economic development. There is a section in the report which deals with each of the countries in specific terms. The honourable member for Dundas mentioned several nations but I want to emphasise one-that is, Fiji-which is somewhat dear to my heart. I am outraged and I continue to be outraged by the development of events in Fiji. I think members of this Committee from both sides of politics were outraged by the way in which the internal security decree was brought down by Colonel Rabuka, the high-handed way in which he tried to justify this decree and the methods used as a result. Mr Nehl-Brigadier Rabuka.",136
281,Dr THEOPHANOUS,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"As far as I am concerned, he is still Colonel Rabuka. Let me make a couple of points about the Fijian situation. Firstly, we totally reject the explanations that were put forward in terms of trying to protect the rights of the indigenous Fijian people, even though they were becoming a minority. Substantial provisions already existed in the Fijian Constitution to protect the rights of the indigenous people. The coup in Fiji had nothing to do with the protection of the rights of the indigenous people. The coup in Fiji had to do with something else entirely-namely, an entrenched group which had ruled Fiji since the time of independence. This entrenched, privileged group, which was only a section of the Fijian population, could not accept that it had made such a mess of the place that the Indian arid indigenous Fijian people should combine to elect a multi-racial party to government, led by Dr Bavadra. That was the situation in Fiji. That real situation has been obscured by Colonel Rabuka and his followers, who have said that the Fijian coup had something to do with protecting the rights of the indigenous Fijian population. It had nothing to do with it. The coup in Fiji was an attempt by an entrenched, privileged group that had lost a democratically held election to seize power-to reinstate whom? Surprisingly, it was to reinstate the same people who had lost power. That group did not even bother to reinstate new people; it reinstated to government the same people who had lost power. That was a disgraceful exercise of anti-democratic behaviour in our region. Unfortunately, the people of Fiji as a whole-both the indigenous Fijian and the Indian peoples-have suffered dramatically as a result of this coup. Economic development is at a stalemate, tourism is virtually finished and people are still frightened of the actions of the military. In the period we were there, certain people were arrested by the Government, including people at the University of the South Pacific-in the case of one lecturer, for no other reason than that he had dared to write an article critical of Colonel Rabuka. This is the situation that exists in Fiji today. We have to take action to ensure that the Government does nothing to encourage the pseudo-constitutional process that exists in Fiji at the moment, which is intended to continue the entrenched situation of Colonel Rabuka and his followers.",138
282,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,138
283,Mr KATTER,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"1 propose to speak for only a couple of minutes, for two reasons: firstly, because 1 had an alleged illness last year that prevented my participating in almost all of the activities of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and, secondly, because what 1 propose to stress in my few words has already been dealt with by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). I refer to the great necessity for our doors to be opened, not in an irresponsible and foolish way. I have attended two South Pacific conferences. 1 was fortunate in so far as they were both held on the mainland! My dreams of going to the Pacific islands and so on were well and truly dashed as one conference was held in Brisbane and the other in Darwin. However, they were effective. People of obvious sincerity who felt they were being treated not as equals, or as a group of brothers of the Pacific, but as something less than that, made a special appeal to me and others that there should be a liberal manner but not an open door. I must not give the wrong impression; they did not expect that and would not open doors for us. They wanted a lot of the red tape which they were not anxious to cope with, or capable of coping with, set aside. If they want to come to Australia to visit relatives or to come as tourists-that would not be beyond the bounds of possibility-or for training or educational purposes, the process of doing so should be far more simple than it is now. That point was dealt with quite capably by the member for Calwell and I will not dwell on it further. A few of us, as members of the Committee, will be in New Zealand next week and we will have a frank and forthright discussion with our counterparts there. I hope that out of those discussions will come decisions-perhaps not binding on either country-which will create common ground whereby we might examine giving such people greater self-esteem and a greater feeling of belonging to a Pacific family.",138
284,Mr LINDSAY,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"The events of 1985 which led the Soviet Union to establish a fishing agreement with the Republic of Kiribati catapulted the South Pacific region into the arena of superpower rivalry. The South Pacific nations-microstates-had remained rather insular before the fishing agreement was signed between the Republic of Kiribati and the Soviet Union. The signing of that agreement brought to the attention of the major nations of this region the importance of developing secure and mature foreign policies with respect to the relationship between the South Pacific microstates, Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America. When one considers the composition of these micro-states, one has to question whether they really are sovereign states. Do they have the capacity to administer their affairs on an independent basis, both economically and with regard to security? Do they have the capacity to defend themselves from external aggression? Do they have the capacity to ensure that the development of their economy can subsist without large doses of overseas aid? Failure on any of those legs raises the question of whether they can truly claim to be sovereign states. That makes the development of Australia's foreign policy considerably difficult. Each of those sovereign micro-states has to be treated on an equal basis across the region. They have to be recognised as members of the United Nations, as indeed they are. They are entitled to be treated as sovereign countries, despite the fact that on many levels, as I see it, their would be claims to sovereign status are deficient. A dynamic process of political and economic change is happening now in the South Pacific. That change makes the development of Australia's foreign policy on our relationship with the micro-states of the South Pacific one of immediate priority. The South Pacific challenges Australia to develop a foreign policy which has strong bipartisan support and which recogriises the fundamental, long standing and unchanging interests that Australia has for the peace and security of the South Pacific. It is acknowledged on both sides of the House that Australia has clear geopolitical and strategic reasons for and interests in preserving and promoting peace in the region. We have responsibilities, as the most developed country in the. region, to discharge those duties of maintaining the peace. It has clearly been recognised by Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and, as I understand it, other countries that Australia has a role to ensure that peace and security are maintained in this region. Australia has a responsibility to develop a partnership with Pacific Island countries which promotes stability and security through economic development. It also has a responsibility to encourage, among the leadership of the South Pacific micro-states, a shared perception of strategic and security interests. It is most important that those countries are part of the ongoing development of the foreign policy issues which are essential to finding common ground between Australia and those island micro-states. It is also important that Australia and the South Pacific micro-states share a strategy of constructive commitment. That means the promotion of a close, confident and broadlybased bilateral relationship not only between themselves, but also between Australia and each individual South Pacific micro-state. The promotion of effective regional cooperation, especially through the South Pacific Forum and other regiorial organisations such as the South Pacific Commission, is an important reason for the continuation of the ongoing scrutiny of Australia's foreign policy on these micro-states. It is also important that Australia recognise that, for the Pacific Island countries, security hinges on economic and social development. It is important, therefore that Australia offer assistance to enable those countries to achieve both of those objectives. Above all, it is important that Australia have respect for the full sovereignty of all Pacific Island states in relation to their internal affairs and their right to establish diplomatic and commercial links with countries from outside the region. In that respect I mention the activities of Vanuatu which the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) referred to earlier. Despite what I have said about Australia's duty to treat these South Pacific states as independent, full sovereign countries, there is an established concern within Australia about the activities of Vanuatu. Vanuatu established relations with Cuba in 1983, and Libya, Nicaragua and North Korea in 1986. The establishment of relations with Libya should be the West's major strategic concern in the region after the penetration by the Soviet Union. This link between Vanuatu and Libya has given support to the Melanesian independence movement in various places in the South Pacific. This movement clearly plays a mischief-making role in Vanuatu. I believe that the Libyan interest has been motivated primarily to cause troubleto confound the· United States, and cause that country embarrassment with France with respect to the issue of French New Caledonia. These are important matters that must concern Australia and the United States in their security policies in that area. Vanuatu has only approximately 300 paramilitary personnel to deal with issues which have led, on certain occasions, to a dramatic downturn in that country's capacity to maintain law and order. It is important also that Australia promote within the governments of the South Pacific countries acknowledgment and a shared perception of the region's strategic interests and security interests. It is important that we lay a foundation or a basis for regional approach to security situations, internal or external, which could put regional stability at risk. It is most important that Australia develop foreign policies which identify Australia as an integral part of the South Pacific region. Australia has begun the task of shared awareness between Australia and the South Pacific nations on where the national interests of the region lie. It is important that we avoid shrill and shallow politicking on this very important issue. It is important that government not neglect the region and that the people of the South Pacific see that Australia does not neglect the region. The report that has been prepared is a constructive and detailed attempt by this Parliament to ensure that the issues of the South Pacific are before the people of· Australia and are to the forefront in consideration by the Federal Government. I simply want to comment on a few of the recommendations that have been made in the report which I believe are worthy of immediate implementation. The first concerns the training and funding of on the job experience for regional trade promotion officers and also the involvement of the private sector in such trade promotion training. The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) inentioned some of the economic difficulties that have been - xperienced by the South Pacific micro-states. I urge the Parliament to implement that recommendation contained in the report because unless the private sector is involved in trade promotion, and unless there is training and funding for on the job experience for regional trade promotion, none of the South Pacific microstates will be equipped to deal with the economic reconstruction that they so desperately need. I believe that the recommendation supporting the efforts of the Pacific Islands Association of Chambers of Commerce to provide a more coordinated approach to private sector development in the region is one that should be promoted by the Government as quickly as possible. I know-and I know that many of the people in the South Pacific believe,---that the promotion of private sector development by them is fundamentally important to the diversification of their economy and also removing them from the aid dependency, which would be one of the tragic developments of the Pacific micro-states. It is also important that the level of literJune. acy and education be raised in many of these countries. 1 commend the recommendation that the Australian teacher volunteer program, whereby Australian teachers would undertake a one or two-year posting to a South Pacific country, should be implemented .. 1 think that is an extremely important recommendation not only to develop awareness amongst Australians of the importance of relationships 'with South Pacific countries, but also to ensure that the literacy and education of these countries are catapulted to a very high level. With tpc:: other speakers, 1 commend this report to the Parliament. 1 enjoin the Government to act on the recommendations contained in the report. 1 know that Australia's relations with the South Pacific will be brought up in this Parliament again and again. It is important that that be so. As 1 said earlier, Australia has a responsibility to maintain the peace in this region. It cannot resile from that obligation. 1 know that this can be effectively maintained not by Australia acting unilaterally on these issues, but rather by the shared acceptance of responsibility to ensure economic development and regional seclirity not only by Australia but by the nations of the South Pacific.",139
285,Mr NEHL,JOINT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN,"1 must say that 1 speak on this occasion with a great deal of pleasure because 1 believe that the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Australia's relations with the South Pacific is very valuable and far reaching and is of great importance not only to Australia but, indeed, to the whole Pacific Rim. 1 pay tribute to the hospitality of the governments and the people of the island states the Committee visited last June. It was certainly a tremendous illustration of how the people of Australia and the people of the island states can really get on well together. 1 also compliment the Committee staff, particularly Joanne Towner, on the way the inquiry was conducted and on the preparation of the report. 1 also pay tribute to Miss Karina Campbell of the Department of Foreign Affairs. and Trade for the assistance she gave members of the Committee who made the visit to the Pacific nations last There are a number of issues 1 would like to raise only briefly because time is rapidly running out for this debate. The first is the question of tourism. There is obviously a great potential for tourism in the island states. They are natural areas of great beauty and great friendship. If they are going to develop tourism, they will need a great deal of assistance for the infrastructure. An influx of tourists to a coral atoll cannot be sustained without appropriate provision of water and sewerage. The Pacific is an incredibly large area with. a vast amount of water and very limited land. Transport is one major problem affecting the people of the South Pacific. If Australia is able to be of assistance to the Pacific island nations it should be considering giving a great deal of assistance in areas such as transport and communications. Wherever we went among the island states questions of migration and guest worker status were raised. Although we all in a bipartisan fashion agreed that there should be nodiscrimination in Australia's migrant intake, if we are ever going to bend, it should perhaps be in line with providing a little bias towards our Pacific island neighbours. For once 1 agree with the honourable member for Cal.well (Dr Theophonous)-it does not happen very often-when he speaks about the problems that will be encountered when our tariff reductions come into effect and the special provisions for the island states disappear. 1 think there is a great need for a special economic relationship with the Pacific island states and we should start thinking about that now. If one were to isolate the most important matter, from the vast range of matters covered by the report and the inquiry it would be education. The people in the island states really need a great deal more in the way of education. They need more teachers, more textbooks, higher standards and a much wider availability of education. It is just not good enough to build a school; we have to think about the recurrent costs involved because they can be a major problem for the people of those countries. I particularly endorse the recommendation in the report that there should be a secondary school student exchange scheme and that particular attention should be paid to the development of curricula related to Australia and the South Pacific. Australia has a special relationship with the Pacific, but, above all, we must never be paternal and we must never adopt the role of big brother; nonetheless, we have to agree that we have a responsibility and we must always maintain a relationship of one family. If we can treat the people of the South Pacific as our family, and if they can treat us that way, it will work to the benefit of all of us. It is our family; it is our region. We have to understand the Pacific way and we hope that they will understand our ways, because we need each other. Australia has a great future, as do the Pacific nations, provided we go on working together for our mutual benefit. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA (INTERNATIONAL LINER CARGO SHIPPING) AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 April, on motion by Mr Willis: That the Bill be now read a second time, upon which Mr Blunt had moved by way of amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House regrets the fact that the Government has failed to achieve micro-economic reform in the transport sector, a matter of such vital importance to the Australian economy',",141
286,Mr WILLIS,TRADE PRACTICES,"1 remind the House that the purpose of the Trade Practices (International Liner Cargo Shipping) Amendment Bill, which I must say has not received a great deal of attention in the second reading debate, essentially is to increase the efficiency of the international shipping industry by substantially reducing the protection from competition provided to the international shipping conferences or cartels. This is to be achieved by limiting the current wide-ranging exemption from the Trade Practices Act that is allowed to the international shipping conferences. These shipping conferences carry the vast majority of our non-bulk exports; so providing for more competition in this area should materially assist our exporters. This is, therefore, clearly a notable step in micro-economic reform and so adds to the substantial list of micro-economic reforms that this Government has already introduced or has in train. In this debate Opposition speakers have alleged that the Government has done little about micro-economic reform. This is a massive untruth. This Government has set in train a vast program of micro-economic reform of which the Bill now before the House is a part. I would like to take the House through a list of micro-economic reforms which have been undertaken or which are being undertaken in the transport and communications area. We have acted to put government business enterprises (GBEs) on a much more commercial footing. The Government's role has been changed from one of detailed regulation and control of their activities on a day-today basis and in various other highly regulatory ways, which was the way in which they were operated by the previous Government, to a more removed process in which the Government sets the charter and the functions of the organisation, establishes a corporate plan, financial targets, any clearly established community service obligations and then essentially sends the enterprise off to run as a normal commercial business enterprise. This is a very substantial reform which affects some major enterprises in this country. We are talking about such enterprises as Telecom Australia, the largest enterprise in the country, Australia Post, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) , Australian Airlines, Aussllt, Qantas Airways Ltd, Australian National Line (ANL) and Australian National Railways (AN). To.come we have reform packages for the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority. All of these bodies are being set on a commercial footing. They are being separated from the government in. the sense of day-today controls. They are being made as much of a commercial enterprise as is possible to make them whilst they remain government-owned, and bearing in mind the community service obligations which at least some of these enterprises have to provide. That GBE reform, which is very substanthe tially on the way, is a major exercise micro-economic reform. In addition, particreviewed ular industry level reforms have been underficiency taken. We have deregulated domestic aviation from October 1990; we had to give three years notice, as honourable members know. . That means that from October next year we will have a much more competitive domestic aviation industry. This industry has been highly regulated all through the long years of Liberal and National Party Government, through the 1950s, the 1960s and the seven Fraser Government years. The act of dereinquiries gulation has been taken by this Government. We have taken major decisions to improve the infrastructure for the aviation industry, the most notable of which is the decision proceed with the third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. In addition and less well known are the steps taken to velop major international terminals. At Sydney Airport there has already been $40m expansion, with a $240m expansion come. At Brisbane Airport there has been small improvement to the existing highly adequate terminal. Expressions of interest have already been called for the developdations ment of a whole new international terminal at Brisbane. A $11 7m expansion of the intercriticised national terminal at Melbourne Airport been announced. In Darwin there is to be $65m development of virtually a whole new this important industry. civil aviation infrastructure. There will be $20m spent on Alice Springs Airport. Obciency viously, a massive amount of expenditure involved in the development and improveper ment of aviation infrastructure at that small handful of airports. We have instituted a program of aviation cost recovery which aims to ensure that erators pay substantial contributions to the cost of providing the infrastructure for their industry and to ensure a rational allocation of resources in this area, a major step in rational resource allocation. We have estabciency lished a trend setting process of award reindustry. structuring in the coastal shipping industry through the Maritime Industry Development Committee which was established by my tions predecessor-one removed-as Minister for Transport, the honourable member for ciency.  reduction of crew numbers, multiskilling of seagoing work force and increased effiin ciency in operations. We have now further the industry to achieve greater efthrough the coastal shipping task force which will be reporting to the Government shortly. I am confident that that will provide the basis for further sweeping changes in the industry and substantial increases in efficiency. ANL has also been revitalised. When we came to office ANL was virtually bankrupt. It has been changed to a profit-making, taxpaying enterprise. We have initiated a series of studies and to bring about reform of the waterfront culminating in the Inter-State Commission's (ISC) report on the waterfront released last week. Contrary to what Opposition to speakers have been saying, totally incorrectly, in this debate, there has been no rejection of the ISC report by the Waterside deWorkers Federation or the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It is totally untrue to a say, as was said by the honourable member to for Richmond (Mr Blunt) and another Opa position speaker, that the report had been inrejected by those union bodies. They have been critical of a couple of the recommenbut they have not criticised the report as a whole. They have not rejected or the great majority of its recommenhas dations. I believe that we now have the a prospect of achieving major restructuring of . We have dramatically improved the effiof the Australian National Railways. is We have reduced by 60 per cent the $lOOm annum deficit which was being incurred by AN before we came to office, a mammoth reduction brought about by increasing the efficiency of that organisation. In relation to opthe road transport industry we have introduced for the first time in the history of the nation a regime of national uniform vehicle weights and speed limits for interstate trucks and so greatly assisted in improving the effiof the interstate road transport We have introduced a package of reforms aimed at deregulating the telecommunicaindustry in several important areas, thus providing competition and increased effiWe have introduced legislation today which sets a price-capping formula for Telecom and OTC which ensures continual annual declines in the real level of prices for their basic services. This is a very quick summation of major micro-economic reforms in the transport and communications area which have been or which are being achieved by the Hawke Government. Yet the Opposition says that little is being done. Is this really little? It is infinitely more than was achieved by the Fraser Government or in the decades of Liberal and Country Party government through the 1950s and 1960s. Major structural reforms have been achieved and are being achieved in the transport and communications area. The Bill now before the House is another step in that very commendable program of major structural reform of the nation.",142

288,Mr WILLIS,TRADE PRACTICES,"Gellibrand-Minister for Transport and Communications) (10.01)by leave-I move: (I) Clause 4, page 3, line 7, omit ""an incorporated association"", substitute ""a body corporate"". (2) Clause 4, page 3, after the proposed definition of ""authorised officer"", insert the following definition: ""'conference' means an unincorporated association of 2 or more ocean carriers carrying on 2 or more businesses each of which includes, or is proposed to include, the provision of liner cargo shipping services;"". (3) Clause 4, page 6, lines 13 to 16, omit proposed subsection (I), substitute the following subsection: ""(I) For the purposes of section 46, if the parties to a conference agreement together have a substantial degree of power in a market in which any party to the agreement provides international liner cargo shipping services under the agreement, each party to the conference agreement shall be taken to have a substantial degree of power in the market. "". (4) Clause 4, page 41, at the end of proposed section 10.90, add the following subsection: ""(2) The regulations shall not fix fees exceeding: (a) in the case of an application for provisional registration of a conference agreement-$300; (b) in the case of an application for final registration of a conference agreement-$175; (c) in the case of an application for the registration of a person as an ocean carrier's agent$20; and (d) in the case of an application to obtain a copy of, the whole or any part of, an entry in a register kept under this Part or a conference agreement file kept under this Part-$40. "". In putting forward these amendments, the Government is responding to comments on the Trade Practices (International Liner Cargo Shipping) Amendment Bill made by ocean carriers, Australian shippers and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The amendments are technical in nature and do not alter the thrust of the Government's policy to create a more competitive liner shipping environment. The definition of 'association' is being broadened to enable shipper organisations, such as .statutory marketing authorities, to apply in their own right to become designated shipper bodies. As I indicated in my second reading speech, designated shipper bodies will receive the necessary exemption from part IV of the Trade Practices Act to negotiate and enter into loyalty agreements with ocean carriers. In certain circumstances-which I explained in that speech-designated shipper bodies will also be empowered to negotiate minimum service levels with conference operators and to negotiate over arrangements for, and the terms and conditions of, carriage in Australia's export liner trades. The Government accepts the suggestion made by the ocean carriers that it would be helpful, particularly to people not involved in the liner shipping industry, to include a definition of 'conference' in the Bill. This will help clarify the application of the legislation and complement the term 'conference agreement', which is already defined in the Bill. The amendment to apply section 46, 'Misuse of market power', to conferences reflects the different organisational structure between conferences and corporations but avoids the possibility that collectively conference members are treated differently from corporations in the determination of a substantial degree of market power. Conferences operate as cartels, and the market power is derived from exemptions from restrictive trade practices regulations to permit collusion among parties to the conference agreement. Therefore, the test of market power must apply to the collective, not the individual, market power of the parties to the conference agreement. The provision ensures that, if parties to a conference agreement are found collectively to have a substantial degree of market power, then each party is deemed to have a substantial degree of power in the market by virtue of its membership of the cartel. Finally, an upper limit is being included in the Bill on the fees which can be charged for the registration of carrier agents and conference agreements and the provision of documents in response to public inquiries. The actual fees to apply will be prescribed by regulation and will reflect the recovery of relevant administrative costs incurred by the Department of Transport and Communications. I ask that the amendments circulated in my name be adopted. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; reportby leave-adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Willis)-by leaveread a third time. NA CORPORATION (CONVERSION INTO PUBLIC COMPANY) BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 April, on motion by Mr Barry Jones: That the Bill be now read a second time.",144
289,Mr MOORE,SNOWY MOUNTAINS ENGINEERING,"This debate, concerning the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC), holds a great deal of interest for the Opposition because it is one of the nominated companies on the list for privatisation. I am fascinated by the approach the Government has taken to the Corporation in this move. Just a while ago the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) went to some pains to talk about the new reforms. As a consequence of those things, I am flattered to understand that this is a major example of the review of micro-economic reform. What a task! Let us take a look at exactly what has been going on. The Snowy Mountain Engineering Corporation was established in 1970 as an independent consulting engineering organisation to retain and promote engineering skills required during the investigation, design and construction of the Snowy Mountains scheme. The Corporation is a government business which pays all the Federal, State and local government taxes and provides services to government and private organisations in Australia and overseas. The Corporation was established under the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Act of 1970. In 1986 the Corporation adopted a strategic corporate plan, which stated its commitment to: . . . undertaking engineering projects on a commercial basis in Australia and overseas in a manner that maximised its profit, enhanced its reputation and provided job satisfaction. I have quoted at some length because I will later go into the balance sheet of the Snowy Mountains authority to illustrate what is going on. In light of this Corporation objective, it is imperative that we now review whether the Snowy Mountains authority can still adhere to its goals under government ownership. The major provisions of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (Conversion into Public Company) Bill are as follows: Firstly, the Bill establishes the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation as a company registered under the Companies Act. The Commonwealth will own all share capital in the company, but will withdraw from day to day control of the operations and remove certain statutory controls. The proposals has no financial impact. So the Government has gone quite a way; it has really done something in micro-economic reform! I will now deal with the process. Step 1 of the process involves the creation of share capital and the application by SMEC for registration as a company-big deal! Step 2 involves the repeal of certain sections of the SMEC Act of 1970. Step 3 involves the transition of SMEC to a public company. Consequently, statutory control of SMEC will be removed by the repeal of most of the provisions of the existing Act. Step 4. ensures that SMEC maintains its legal personality all times. The Bill also provides that each staff member of the corporation will become an the track. employee of the company on the same terms and conditions. All entitlements will be served. The name of the company will be the Snowy Mountains Engineering CorporaSMEC tion. The amount of the paid up share capiof tal will be fixed at $5,207,870, which each represents the capital contribution by the Commonwealth as at 30 June 1988, less by losses. So we have written off the losses. capital will be divided into $1 shares. Really, as the Minister for Transport and Commuup nications walks out of the chamber, we are talking about a major step in micro-ecoten nomic reform! It is really quite laughable when one thinks of it. Mechanisms will also be set in place for sheets. strategic oversight by the Government of the new company's activities. So the GovernRevenue ment feels it cannot let it go too Jar; it make quite sure that the Corporation does what it wants. That is always a great way to make a profit! These mechanisms will also ensure that the company operates within the wages and industrial relations policies of Government. They have gone so well; I am sure that the Corporation will love to know that! The existing Board of Directors will continue unchanged, and the Commonthe wealth, as shareholder, will have the power to appoint and dismiss the directors. That a major step in economic reform. We are struction really going places I Although the controls individual borrowing requirements, investments and banking arrangements will be reon moved, SMEC will remain subject to the fees Loan Council global borrowing limits. In other words, it will not be able to do too much borrowing. It will also be liable for the Commonwealth borrowing levy on any ·borpetitive, rowings. In other words, it will have to that one half of one per cent if it uses government guarantees. It will, however, forgo all forms of government guarantees. That is some inconsistency! While the second reading speech alludes to the possible future sale of some of equity to employees of the company, it states only that the scheme is currently being sideredand will not be introduced without prior consultation with and agreement of at SMEC's staff and unions. Whacko! We are really going places in micro-economic reform. We are really going some steps down Consideration of the recent performance preof the Corporation may help us understand why we are going at such a pace to sell it. has struggled financially for a number years. Since 1985, revenue has dropped year. It has had poor profit results and accumulated losses have needed to be funded constant capital injections. For example, The it received $6m in 1986-87 and $2m in 198788. I referred before to the fact that the paid capital was a strange amount and that was the amount of the losses that were writoff; that was what was left of all the money that has gone into the Corporation. I will come later to an analysis of the balance Personnel numbers have been pruned back. per employee, however, has remust mained stagnant. This is quite a company. Return on equity in profits on sales only just reached positive' figures, still well below the private sector performance. The current ratio, however, is very strong. It should be the noted that SMEC is a consulting firm and, .as such, its balance sheet displays some abnormal features. For example, the number of consulting assignments or projects drives balance sheet. In this type of business there is usually no need to seek large ticket is finance as the clients involved. in the conare responsible for raising t-e funds. on Accordingly, SMEC liabilities and assets .fluctuate according to the number of projects its books. Revenue is largely derived from for professional services, while expenses reflect the costs associated with giving that particular advice. As the international market for consulting engineers seems .very comthere would seem little scope .to lift pay revenue through raising professional fees. Greater profitability will follow only if expenses can be further reduced. From the outside, more attention needs to be given to this aspect. I emphasise 'from the outside' because from government statements on its the corporate affairs, we never know exactly what is going on within these companies. I conchallenge anyone here to pick up a balance sheet, statement of assets and liabilities statement of income flow of a government corporation or authority and try to ascertain from that the true position in a commercial sense. I will come to that with respect to this company later. There is a need to look for the inside. It should be stressed that a large proportion of these expenses are a direct government ownership, including the required annual contribution of almost $lm the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. All the same SMEC would not have survived in recent years without continual governthat ment payments to finance its accumufated losses. SMEC will never be commercially viable in its present form. It now requires commitment to pruning back expenses; it needs to be released from the restrictions and costs associated with government""ownvious ership; it also needs the equity injection its employees, as the proprietors who run business are the only group with sufficient commitment to make it profitable., I just make those comments because it is most important that the House understand of the problems associated with the Corporation. I move on to look quickly at the annual cline, report of the company in the last few years. The 1985-86 annual report showed a 42 cent decrease in revenue, leading to a loss $3.7m. It also showed the setting up of an external board of directors and the adoption of a three-year corporate plan. We heard from the Minister that this is one of the new remedies of the Government. He said the Government must bring about a new corpothe rate plan; that it had done all these things to modernise such companies and that these reforms will lead us on to great things. Let us see what happened. The staff was reduced from 358 to 329. Seventy per cent of revenue was derived from overseas. Management lieved its inability to put together financial packages for clients restricted its competiprofessional tiveness. There have been declining work opportunities in Australia. SMEC was ranked 58 out of 200 top consulting firms in the world, yet was required to contribute same time almost $lm towards the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. In that particular year revenue was $64m, expendito ture $66.9m, and the operating loss before or tax was $3.7m. The capital position in that particular year was that SMEC received from the Commonwealth $8.6m. Its accumulated losses were $4.8m and it therefore had a remnant of$3.8m. Its total liabilities were $15m and its total assets $19m. Its revenue per employee was $180,000. Its return on equity was minus 100 per cent. That was an result of appalling performance. We will see what happened in 1986 with to this new corporate plan.' Revenue was $37m; expenditure, '$40m; and the operating loss before tax, $2.4m. The accumulated losses at stage went up to $6.6m, leaving a carried forward capital of $2m, with liabilities climbing to $17. 5m and total assets margina ally improving to $19.5m. A quick look at what occurred in that year showed that revenues declined by 25 per cent over the preyear. The loss for the year Was $2.4m, from and to maintain the working capital, the the Government injected $6m. There were further staff reductions, as the Government aimed to achieve a core staff. Seventy-five per cent of revenue was derived from oversome seas'. So the story goes on. In 1987 revenue again dropped to $27m; expenditure was $31m which, while a de\yas still significant; there was a loss of almost $6m. As a consequence of that, in per that year we had to see what we could of , manage to carry forward for the future. In 1988 revenue was down again, at $26.8m; expenditure was down to $26.9m, giving the Corporation a small marginal profit for the year. The notes that accompanied 1987-88 annual report showed that a further $2m was made available' from the Commonwealth for the deficiencies in working capital. Some of the prospects for major civil works in Australia in which SMEC could participate include the very fast train project beand"" the Tully Hydropower Project in Queensland. The report also notes a far more staff. So the problems continue. We have come to a stage now where enlightenment hits the Government, which, has decided it must do something about privatising at the the Corporation. With great skill, the Government has avoided saying in the Bill what it proposes do. But I will let the Government into a few secrets, because a truck that drove past dropped off a plan. What is envisaged under the scheme we are arranging? I will briefly outline what is proposed. The employees will be offered redeemable preference shares. Big deal! The Government is really going to do something about giving the employees a great hit! If the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation is to have any future, it will be governed by the ability of the staff and management to take over the Corporation. Then they will have the incentive to do something and to make the commitment necessary to this organisation to make it work. If one made an analysis of the balance sheet and asked, 'What are we going to do with this?' One would have to come to the conclusion that it should be either shut down or made profitable. Members of the Opposition are determined that when we come to government this corporation will be sold and the first placement of shares will be among the employees and management of the firm. If they cannot make a go of it, there is no reason why the taxpayers of Australia should be called upon annually to contribute millions of dollars to keep going a consulting engineering company when there are hundreds of them in Australia that can do exactly the same job. I go back to my proposition. Under the guise of this great micro-economic reform the Government is going to offer these employees some redeemable preference shares in order not to upset the left wing of the Australian Labor Party, but the employees are only to be allowed to have 20 per cent of the company. One cannot say too much. That is really quite enough of it. The minimum subscription would be not less than 15 per cent. On top of that, there would be a limit on the holding of each employee, related to a mixture derived from the period of service and salary level of each employee. How extraordinary. In most professional businesses of which I am aware salary levels are generally based on performance, particularly in private enterprise service industries, be they engineering, accounting or legal. All staff are paid some base figure and, as the corporation expands and does well, the profits ar-:, shared. The Government's proposal is a rather quaint way of going about allocating capital benefits in that regard. There is no point in a government continuing to run a loss-making consulting engineering business in which it proposes to offer an insignificant shareholding to some of the employees and retain a vast contributing and controlling interest. This is particularly so if the shares issued to employees are to be redeemable preferences in which capital growth or future capital benefits generally do not accrue. Because of those factors alone, the prospect of the employees themselves becoming involved in the management of the company are slim and lack of interest will probably set in. I cannot be very enthusiastic about the Government's proposals. The approach of the coalition to this matter is straightforward. It was outlined as early as 1987 in the housing construction policy and further put forward in a variety of statements on privatisation. We propose to convert SMEC to a private consulting firm and to give SMEC's management and staff first option to purchase the corporation outright. The objective is to have SMEC employees own and run the corporation as a private consulting company. The coalition is well down the track in the framework of such a . buy-out. The advantages of employee share ownership of SMEC include improved employee motivation where commercial success of the organisation has a direct effect on the employee. This new order fosters productivity and efficiency gains and leads to a better climate for industrial relations. The success of any management buy-out or employee share ownership scheme would rest on successful negotiation, with an acceptance by the management and unions before its implementation. The coalition proposals would involve the Commonwealth quitting the lot, not maintaining the majority control or owning all the ordinary shares and selling some number of redeemable preference shares to the employees, which would be no use whatever to them. The balance not taken up by the employees in such a float could well be offered outside to other consulting firms or to other employees or participants. Employee participation would have to succeed to a reasonable degree in terms of percentage of the scheme if the total buy-out is to be successful. The scheme would have to be totally non-discriminatory. Shares would be offered to the remaining employees upon leaving employment. It is possible in the early stages of such a scheme, in order to encourage the employment and development of the corporation, to give some incentive to employees to hold on to these shares while they remain with the corporation. These corporations which compete completely in the private sector, which are loss-making and call upon the taxpayers of Australia fairly regularly to replenish their funds, have no place in a competitive economy. They do not serve the national interest. They do not meet a professional judgment in terms of their worth. If they did, they would be making a profit. They do not meet any of the requirements of government. If they did, the Government ought to pay a fee to the organisation for the services that it performs. Having failed that test, the SMEC should be sold in total to its employees or to the public. I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Government should sell the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation to the private sector, with the first option to purchase being given to the Corporation's employees'.",145
290,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SNOWY MOUNTAINS ENGINEERING,"Is the amendment seconded? Mr Reith-I second the amendment. Debate (on motion by Mr Hollis) adjourned. NA Economy-1989 South Australian National Football League Season-O'Connor Electorate: Koorda, Wyalkatchen and Geraldton Regions-Nuclear Fusion Experiments-Health Care-Seizure of Schooner Orionia-Bounty on Australian Agricultural Tillage Machinery-Police Brutality against Aborigines Motion (by Mr HOlding) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.  day and today were historic days economically, with the debate on the Appropriation Bill and April statement, predictable as it was, of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). There is no doubt that families, the elderly and wage earners have suffered too long and will welcome the long-promised tax cuts that colleagues on both sides of this House have lobbied for. Unfortunate, and just as predictable, is the certainty that any benefits will soon be devoured by high interest rates and galloping inflation. I would like to speak about something that is seasonal rather than seasonally adjusted. It is an industry that started in 1897, is 92 years old, and cranks up again in Adelaide this Saturday, 15 April. On that afternoon, Mr Max Basheer and Mr Leigh Whicker, the executives of the South Australia National Football League (SANFL) will oversee the kick-off of the 1989 South Australian Aussie rules football season. On the eve of this social, cultural and economic event, I more than ever pay tribute. to the executives, club directors and advisers who, through their wisdom, have continued to resist those modern-day pirates, the Victorian Football League (VFL). I have spoken in this House before about the national league, which is nothing more than an expanded VFL competition with accrued losses spread around Australia of millions of dollars. It must be very reassuring to Messrs Hawke and Keating to learn that they are not the only ones who cannot balance the books. However for us to follow a national path in South Australia the very fibre and infrastructure of suburban football would be at risk and the flow chart shows a base from schools, country amateur and SAFA through to the league. The football industry supports employment, manufacturing, hospitality, food and beverage small business, finance, advertising, the media, clothing apparel and merchandising and provides a social exchange for millions of South Australians each year. Aussie rules in South Australia underpins this industry and represents a financial turnover of $70m plus a year. No wonder the pirates and pillagers from the VFL want to absorb us into its competition. It has already abducted our best players for years at the expense of its own suburban and country competition. It has neglected its own players. These takeover merchants want to convince us to join them but for that privilege we have to pay them $2m. It is called 'takeover in reverse'. The results of this plundering in other States speaks for itself. The VFL has the Brisbane Bears and the Sydney Swans. We now find that the once proud and strong Western Australian Football League is bereft of any credibility and we find the glamorous West Coast Eagles in $7m debt. Last Friday night, last year's premier teams in the South Australian competition, Port Adelaide and Glenelg, drew a crowd of 31,000 people. At the same time, in Perth, Subiaco and Claremont, last year's grand finalists, drew 5,000 people. That is an indictment of what the VFL has done. I have a vested interest in the health and well being of the South Australian football industry. Before my election as the Federal member for Adelaide, I was employed by the world famous Red Legs, the Norwood Football Club, as the senior marketing executive working for and with young men and women and travelling the length and breadth of the State promoting South Australia. Now that I am working actively in my electorate for all grades of football, the wise decision to resist the VFL is fully reinforced. Several months ago, a mutual agreement was reached with Adelaide radio station 5DN which has employed me as its 'around the ground' football commentator. This Saturday will see me joining its expert sporting panel headed by Ken (G.G.) Cunningham, Ray Fewings, David Hookes, Gary Bau, Andrew Pearce, David Wildy and Jenny Williams. I am proud to be part of the South Australian National Football League season and to start off at the historic and beautiful Adelaide Oval for the South Adelaide versus West Torrens clash. Unfortunately, my speech must now be tempered with a negative point. A constituent of mine from Hampstead Gardens rang me to say that he had recently been approached by the Australian Labor Party candidate who was quick to point out that I, the elected member, would not be around much as I would be at the footy every Saturday afternoon. This cynical and cheap attack was an attempt to discredit my work in the community. What the candidate did not divulge to my constituent was that for the last twelve months I have not been in my electorate office for two hours every Friday either. Instead I have been s-l1ing badges for the charity of the day at that well known landmark in the Beehive Corner in Adelaide's Rundle Mall. In keeping with this, my handshake deal with the management of Radio 5DN included an agreement that the fee for my football commentary would be donated to charity. My constituents and members of this House would be aware that I convened a drug forum in my electorate last year and uncovered a strong community law and order desire to fight against drugs. In keeping with this finding, I was happy to endorse the National Nine Australia-wide television appeal to aid the Learning for Life programs. I believe it is appropriate that the two charities will benefit from my work.",149
291,Mr KERR,ADJOURNMENT,"1 draw the attention ·of honourable members to two recent events in the sorry history of public administration of the State of Tasmania by the Gray Liberal Government. The first of these events relates to an application to the Tasmanian Development Authority (TDA) from a Mr Michael Tatlow to obtain a mining licence to develop a peat moss company. Honourable members should be aware that the responsibility for the Tasmanian Development Authority rests directly with the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Robin Gray. Mr Tatlow's attempt to develop this enterprise was ultimately unsuccessful and I understand that he may now be seeking substantial compensation from the Tasmanian Government for loss of earnings suffered as a result of the mishandling of his application by the TDA. I also understand that Mr Tatlow has incurred considerable financial hardship to the extent of losing his family home in defending himself during legal proceedings brought against him by the Gray Government. All charges against Mr Tatlow have been dismissed. This case is the subject of considerable and continuing controversy in Tasmania. Of particular note are the serious allegations that a Sydney based company had paid large bribes to the then head of the Tasmanian Premiers Department, Mr Andrew Tilt, and the then Chairman of the Tasmanian Development Authority, Mr James Rickard, in order to obtain the peat moss concession sought by Mr Tatlow at some $5m less than its apparent market value. Mr Rickard subsequently left his position as Chairman of the TDA following an inquiry into this affair which indicated substantial mismanagement by the TDA to the ultimate detriment of the people of Tasmania. It is significant that Mr Andrew Tilt has also left his position of Head of the Tasmanian Premiers Department ·amidst much speculation that he was synonymous with the centre of power in that State. The second event I refer to, which occurred at much the same time, relates to the forced sale of the King Island Dairies Pty Ltd, to a company which is alleged to have claimed close connections with the former head of the Tasmanian Premiers Department, Mr Tilt. Honourable members may be aware of the remarkable transformation that has occurred in the King Island dairy enterprise in recent years due to the considerable entrepreneurial talents of the former directors, Bill and Robin Kirk. King Island cheeses are now much sought after in Australian and overseas markets. . In what must be a remarkable parallel to the· affair to which I have just referred I understand that the Kirk family is also seeking compensation from the Tasmanian Government for losses it has suffered due to the actions of the Premiers Department and the TDA. I also understand that the Kirk family has been subject to legal action by the Premier, Mr Robin Gray, in order to suppress public discussion of the facts of this very similar case. Serious allegations have been made to the effect that the sale of the King Island dairy was made as a result of a political decision and that the purchasing company acquired this prize at considerably less than its true market value, after being invited to tender by the former head of the Tasmanian Premiers Department at a time when the business had begun to realise significant profits. It is clear from the circumstances of these cases that negotiations by the Tasmanian Premiers Department and the Tasmanian Development Authority for the furtherance of these enterprises have not been undertaken at arm's length, nor with the public interest in mind. Contrary to the intended purpose of a body such as the TDA, the obvious effect of actions taken by the executive government in Tasmania has been to deny the entrepreneurs in these enterprises rights of natural justice. I believe that these cases give rise to a strong and compelling suspicion the Tasmanian Liberal Government used its executive powers, through the Tasmanian Development Authority where necessary, not only to deny entrepreneurs the legitimate rewards flowing from their efforts but to also strip them of accumulated assets for disposal to those with whom it finds favour. I condemn the Gray Government for the serious loss of confidence in government instrumentalities that these actions have produced. I believe that this situation demands an open and fully independent inquiry into the nature of· the Tasmanian Government's handling of its affairs with the business community.",150
292,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"This week I have students visiting Canberra from my electorate who are here to see at first hand how the Parliament of Australia works and to see the new Parliament House and some of the sights of the national capital. They are Jocelyn Woods from Koorda, who attends the Wyalkatchem District High School as a year 11 student, and Jeremy Fisher from Geraldton, who attends the John Willcock Senior High School as a Year 12 student, and both are in the Speakers gallery tonight. This is the thirteenth time and they are the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth students that I have brought to Canberra since first introducing the scholarship scheme several years ago. I wish to thank Australian Airlines for its assistance this week. Jocelyn and Jeremy have prepared this speech which I am delivering in the Parliament tonight and Jocelyn has typed these speech notes. I welcome them to Canberra and the Australian Parliament. Koorda and Wyalkatchem are rural centres in my electorate and that region, with a population of approximately 1,200, is a major wheat-sheep growing area although other livestock and grain are also produced. Geraldton is a large rural-urban centre with a regional population of approximately 25,000 people and is a major port for the export of primary produce. It is also a major fishing boat harbour and the centre of Western AusHandling Ltd district office and a line terbest minal for Westrail wool transfer. The youth of Koorda are trying to establish a club for entertainment purposes are also active in the sporting and social entertainment fields. The secondary educaschool, tion facilities for Koorda students are ated in Wyalkatchem, 48 kilometres south of Koorda. Some students attend boarding schools in Perth. Wyalkatchem District High School, although being small, achieves many things competitively and educationally. It 87 students in the high school. The Principal of Wyalkatchem is Mr Don Boyd and there are 12 teachers in the high school who teach lower and senior grades, sometimes teaching two to three subjects under the unit curricproblems ulum as well as tertiary entrance examinament tion subjects. A student council, of which Jocelyn is a member, is active in the school. The student council is there to stress the students' views on different things that pen at school and also to raise money for camps and excursions. The school also many sporting facilities and its own farm, where interested students learn to do· everything that would be done in operating a farm. Medically, in Koorda, there is a firstI aid post where a doctor visits twice a week. The hospital, like the high school, is situated 48 kilometres away in Wyalkatchem. For the pensioners, there are fiats established in Koorda, plus a very appealing pensioner tel adjacent to the hospital. Jocelyn has in Koorda all her life and enjoys the rural atmosphere. The region of Geraldton was founded when Captain James Moresby completed a favourperature able report of the areas for the government of the day. Geraldton is situated on a large open coastal plain with the Moresby ranges taking up the eastern horizon. The GeraldBjelke-Petersen's ton port handles many thousands of tonnes of wheat each year and this is all grown the farms surrounding Geraldton. No doubt young Jeremy is interested in the debate so far. Most of the wheat is shipped straight overseas countries, while the rest goes Perth. Geraldton is now as much a crayfishdisposal. ing town as a wheat town, and therefore contributes millions of dollars to Australian export earnings. The Abrolhos. Islands, which caused the wreckage and sinking of many the early explorers' ships, is now one of. spots for crayfishing and is located just west of Geraldton. Geraldton has four major high schools, and two government and two private. The newest and youngest of these schools is Jeremy's. the John Willcock Senior High situSchool, which is named after a Premier of Western Australia who was in office in 1893. The school has 800 students and a staff of 63. The Principal is Mr Tenant. The school was opened in 1971 as a junior high school has and in 1984 was made a senior high school. John Willcock has a variety of different races and cultures within the student and staff population. The combination and interaction between these different cultures cause no at all and create a unique environas well. The school has a good mix of both academic and athletic students, although most students who finish year 12 wish to further their studies at a university hapor another higher education authority.",151
293,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,MrLeo has MCLeay) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,152
294,Dr CHARLESWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"Perth) (10.43)must congratulate the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) on his very interesting scheme. At Question Time today unfortunately I was unable to get the call but the question I intended to ask the Minhosister for Science, Customs and Small Busilived ness (Mr Barry Jones) was: Has the Minister's attention been drawn to two recent reports suggesting that nuclear fusion experiments have taken place at room temusing a relatively simple process? Can he advise whether such experiments have taken place or should the reports be treated with the same degree of scepticism as Joh hydrogen powered car? We all remember that along with Milan Brych on and many others. My interest is that energy is a very important and fundamental issue in this country, particularly with the focus that to it has been given through the greenhouse to effect and concerns about nuclear waste Earlier this week I asked a question on geothermal energy and the possibility of that abundant source being used in Australia. Acof cording to the Minister, we do not have the much of a future in that area but geothermal energy is environmentally sound. Perhaps it is the case that in Australia wind and sun may be a better chance for clean energy production. But let us get back to the question of fusion. It has always been considered a very difficult technology and one which required a massive amount of energy to produce the effect. Indeed, it was believed that the technology was beyond our reach in the next 50 years or that sort of time frame. So claims that cold fusion at room temperatures has been produced by two separate teams working in Utah are of interest. It was reported today that the division of mineral products of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Port Melbourne has carried out experimental work in this area. The Utah experiment under Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons claims to have induced nuclear fusion in deuterium. Of course, deuterium is heavy hydrogen, as honourable members who are seated behind would know. The induction of nuclear fusion used electrical chemical methods. Deuterium occurs in 1t parts per 10,000 in ocean seawater. So there is potential for such a process. The second Utah group at Brigham Young University, led by Dr Stephen Jones, observed fusion at room temperature between dueterons. Deuterons are hydrogen atoms with one extra neutron, again as honourable members seated behind me would understand. During low voltage electrolytic infusion in metallic or palladium electrodes the group observed fusion at room temperatures. Indeed, the CSIRO's findings on the Brigham Young work are very promising. It has been confirmed that an effect has been identified and there is some concern that . there may be another cause for this-possible alloy formation. The importance of this research is critical to us. This evidence has major geophysical implications in volcanic eruptions. There is research in respect of that and continental drift forces also indicate that this sort of force may be operating. The CSIRO's work is a very valuable contribution to an exciting area of nuclear physics. This advance will require further confirmation, but we could be on the brink of a very outstanding area of scientific development. Tonight on PM I heard that these experiments had been confirmed in Moscow also. So it seems that the body of evidence suggesting that we are on the verge of a new step in energy production may have some substance. I commend these reports to all honourable members of this House. I hope that, in the future, we will pursue such advances.",152
295,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,ADJOURNMENT,"Chisholm) (10.47)After Question Time today the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) added to one of his answers that he gave yesterday. In doing so he sought to attack me personally and, for some reason, professionally. Given that Question Time and personal explanations do not particularly allow a full discussion of the facts, I would like to do that now. When I asked the question yesterday I took heed of Madam Speaker's request and shortened my question; so some of the figures were left out. I was not attempting to be smart; I was simply trying to ask a question. I was somewhat surprised at the Prime Minister's nasty response this afternoon. But perhaps if one has developed a successful personal and public style one should not have to change it just because one is in this place. My question was whether two million Australians were without access to health. The document I referred to was entitled 'Health Insurance Survey, March 1983', produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. On the front page in the half-column headed 'Executive Summary', which is all anyone seems to read, it is stated that 1,826,000 people did not have insurance cover and were not identified as having access to special Commonwealth benefits. I am prepared to accept the fudge factor of 10 per cent. But if people do not have Commonwealth medical benefits and they do not have health insurance it does not mean that they do not have access to health care. If we look at a more detailed analysis of the figures we see that Queensland had over three times the average number of insured than the average of other Australian States. The reason for that is quite simple. In Queensland people have had access to shared public hospital wards for many years. While that is only hospital treatment, medical treatment has been available in outpatient departments or hospital casualty services. So even if people in Queensland do not have Commonwealth pensioner benefits, repatriation benefits or private health insurance they have still had full access to health cover for many years. The second aspect is that in that survey 153,600 people who were eligible for health care cards, repatriation benefits or pensioner health benefits had not actually applied for those cards. Had they been sick they would have had full access to health services through those schemes. If we remove 13,300 from that number so we do not double count for Queensland, we get 140,300. I am talking about contribution units here. I will deal with that at the end. The third thing in that survey is that 238,800 people said, 'I am healthy enough. I do not need health cover,' and they were making a personal choice not to have it. If we remove those people in Queensland114,900-we end up with 122,900. If one subtracts all of these one finds that 376,500 contributor units did not have access to health services. A contributor unit might be a single person or a family. The Australian Bureau of Statistics gets an average by multiplying the number by 1.770. By doing that one gets a figure of 666,400-that is, 666,400 Australians who did not have access to health cover. I am prepared to admit that that is a large number of people, but it is not two million. If we are to have honesty in this debate perhaps realistic figures should be used.",153
296,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"1 want to talk about an event that occurred in this country about three years ago when the schooner Orionia touched at the port of Albany on its way to Vanuatu for revictualling. It had hardly been in port before the Commonwealth police descended on the boat and apprehended it, and the crew was stranded in Australia. This apprehension was carried out at the behest of the Israeli Government under extradition legislation. The event was drawn to my attention. I had a good look at the documentation and it occurred to me at the time that the act was well outside the provisions of the legislation, as that legislation applies only to criminal proceedings and not civil litigation. I could not see how what had occurred could possibly be anything other than civil litigation. This saga dragged on for some time. I had a lot of correspondence with the responsible Minister about it. Eventually the matter went to court and, because of the way the extradition legislation is structured-and that is something which needs to be looked at-the people from the boat were deported. Because of the provisions of the extradition legislation they had to be incarcerated until their deportation. They were not the sort of people who would abscond. They could not do so because a large number of people were dependent upon them. Dr Hemple and Mr Etheridge spent 18 months in Australian gaols until they were finally deported. When they got to Israel the Israeli courts quickly granted them bail. The matter was dealt with by a judge in chambers, who said that there was no case to answer. He dismissed the whole case, confirming what was self-evident at the time; that is, extradition should not have been applied and there had been a mistake. It is open to those two men to litigate in the Israeli courts to regain their property. As they were 12 months ahead in their payments on the property at the time it was confiscated, they would have a very good case. I feel very sad at the treatment those people received. Although I am sure that they do not have a case against the Australian Government for compensation for their incarceration, I believe that they have a case against us for unlawful seizure of their property. I hope that the Australian Government will be big enough to grant them re-entry visas to Australia so this matter can be pursued. I want to mention an unforseen consequence of the statement made by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) last night. I think that the statement was an excellent document which will give a lot of hope to people in Australia. An item on page 54 ,passed without much notice, and that is that the Government is terminating a bounty on Australian agricultural tillage machinery. It isa bounty of 10 per cent, paid on the wholesale price. I accept that, by and large, that was a reasonable decision to make even though the agreement was supposed to run until 1991. However, in the town of Merredin in the electorate of O'Connor, there is a business in which I have had a long standing interest. This business is now the biggest employer in Merredin. It makes a unique piece of machinery called a rotary harrow. This machine is absolutely vital if we are serious about combating soil erosion and salinity problems, which this Government is the first government to recognise are serious and must be tackled. The implement allows for very low impact tillage· on the crop and ensures that the top cover is left on the ground. It also has very good export potential. This company can reduce its costs still further, but it needs an injection of capital. I hope that a way can be found to solve this dilemma because, if this company is forced to loose the grant of approximately $360,000, it will simply cease to exist. That would be a great tragedy for a uniquely Australian machine which has worldwide implications for the coming battle against salinity and soil erosion.",154
297,Mr DOWNER,ADJOURNMENT,"ln the adjournment debate last night in the Senate, Senator Irina Dunn, an Independent senator, made some appalling and unsubstantiated allegations against two policemen, Detective Russell King and Detective Kevin Jenkins, who live in my electorate. Senator Dunn alleged, on the' basis of information provided to her by an organisation called the Committee to Defend Black Rights, that those two policemen had been assaulting Aboriginal people. She went further and alleged that they had been involved in brutality against Aboriginal people. It is the normal practice in Australia, as it is in most Western democratic countries, for any such allegations to be dealt with in courts of ·law. In this case no-one has lodged an official complaint against either Detective King or Detective Jenkins, nor, for that matter, has Senator Dunn. Senator Dunn is probably proud of herself because she has managed to get her name into the newspaper, and that is, I suspect, the main objective of the exercise. She has made allegations against two men who have never been subject to official complaint either by those who were allegedly beaten or anybody else in the town of Murray Bridge. Senator Dunn has used the parliamentary privilege of the Senate to make allegations which have gained publicity. Senator Dunn was elected to this Parliament on the basis of the peace platform. Our Senator Dunn is very self-righteous and pacific, but let me remind honourable members of the consequences of her actions. The mother of Detective Jenkins heard the allegations made by Senator Dunn on Radio 5AD today. That woman was so shocked that she is now in hospital. I wonder whether Senator Dunn thinks that is very funny. What is more, Mr CAMPBELL - I suspect that he will be well known to the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Mr Holding), who is at the table-a well-known Aboriginal activist and friend of Michael Mansell, rushed to the media immediately. An Australian Associated Press report states that, according to Mr Campbell: Aborigines in the South Australian town of Murray Bridge have threatened to retaliate against local police after allegations of police brutality were raised in the Senate. That refers to the matter raised by Senator Dunn. Mr Campbell went on to say: We're prepared to fight, how long can we bend? We want the police to treat us like human beings. He warned of a violent protest if a call by Senator Dunn to charge two local detectives with assaulting Aborigines fell on deaf ears. Senator Dunn, elected on a platform of peace, is creating massive divisions in the relatively. small community of Murray Bridge. She is calling for Detectives King and Jenkins to be immediately suspended from their duties at Murray Bridge and tried for assault before a court, yet she does not have the guts to say any of this outside the privilege of parliament. She does not care about the implications for the livelihoods of detectives King and Jenkins. They do not matter. It does not matter what happens to their families as long as wretched Senator Dunn can get her name in the newspapers. This is a pathetic commentary on the performance of Senator Dunn. She should resign from the Senate if she intends to continue behaving in that way. I know that I will get the sympathy of the Minister at the table, who is a former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, because he knows about the activities of Mr Campbell. People such as Senator Dunn are really just hijacking the issue in order to get publicity.",155
298,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member for Mayo may not use unparliamentary language against a member of the other chamber. He should be aware of that.,156

300,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I am not going to fall into the trap of repeating the honourable member's allegations. There being no further speakers and it being approximately 11 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Tuesday, 2 May 1989 at 2 p.m., in accordance with the provisions of standing order 40, as amended for this session.

The following answers to questions were circulated: (Question No. 1194) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 27 September 1988: (I) What are the details of the Government's proposal to enable employers to apply for Commonwealth assistance in establishing and operating child care facilities for their staff. (2) What financial contributions will be expected from each business in establishing and maintaining a work-based child care centre. (3) What will be the financial contribution of the Government in establishing and maintaining each centre. (4) Will the Government's financial contribution be conditional upon each business meeting certain requirements of entry; if so, what are those conditions. (5) Will the employees of the centre be Government employees or employees of the particular business concerned. (6) Ha-e discussions taken place between Government officials and business leaders of the industries concerned, as part of the consultative process before the implementation of the program; if not, why not.

(15) Has the Government encountered any difficulties in finding appropriate sites for the establishment of those child care places; if so, what has caused those difficulties. (16) If difficulties have not been encountered, what has caused the delay in the Government's approval NA Child-Care of those child care places and in the subsequent establishment of them.",156
301,Dr BLEWETT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I), (2), (3) and (4) The attached booklet entitled ""Industry Initiative-Information and Guidelines"" provides full details on the Government's proposal to enable private sector employers to apply for Commonwealth assistance in establishing and operating child care facilities for their employees. [The booklet provided by the honourable member is too lengthy to be published in Hansard. A copy of the booklet is filed in the Table Office of the House of Representatives, where it may be read.] (5) The employees of centres established under this initiative will be employed by the management committee operating the centre (these committees are discussed in more detail in the attached booklet). (6) Discussions have taken place between Government representatives. (7) and (8) These discussions were held in confidence. (9) Yes. (10) The Australian Council of Trade Unions indicated strong support for the proposal. (II) I am not prepared to make correspondence available at this stage of negotiations. (12) and (13) Figures on the number of children on waiting lists for child care are not collected because waiting lists do not give an accurate measure of actual demand. (14) Notional demand for outside school hours care is estimated to be 190,000 places, and for formal long day care for below school-age children is estimated to be 210,000 full time places. These estimates are based on the number of families where both parents or the sole parent have work-related needs for child care and have indicated a preference for formal care. Also included are women not presently in the labour force who have stated that they would like to work if child care was available. (15) For the majority of centres, few difficulties were experienced in identifying suitable sites, due mainly to the high level of co-operation between the Federal, State and Local Governments. However problems have sometimes arisen in densely populated areas, due either to the lack of suitable land and/or the cost of purchasing land and building centres in these areas. In some cases, delays occur until a site can be found which meets the Department's criteria of being close to transport routes, is in an environment suitable for a child care centre or has sufficient space for outdoor activities. Delays have also occurred from long planning lead times caused by planning appeals, delays in getting planning approvals through councils, or a need to call for additional tenders or to negotiate with tenderers because the tender price was too high. Some are simply normal building industry delays. (16) Not applicable. Sale of Land at Lidcombe (Question No. 1502) Dr Woods asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (I) Did the Government in 1987 sell a 8.16 ha site known as the Lidcombe Industrial Estate in Birnie Avenue Lidcombe, to a Sydney-based developer, Condux Corporation. (2) Was the land sold to Condux Corporation for $6m. (3) Is he able to say whether in 1988, after subdivision and the erection of some site works on the estate, Condux Corporation sold the land in 4 parcels for the sum of $13.77m, $7.77m more than the sum paid to the Government in the previous year. (4) Is he able to say whether one of the existing tenants of almost 2 ha of the land, Hawker de Havilland Ltd, paid $2.4m for one of those parcels. (5) What offers were made to the existing tenants to purchase parcels prior to the sale to Condux Corporation. . (6) What proposals were discussed to achieve maximum sale value of the land prior to the sale to Condux. (7) Was subdivision of the land discussed prior to the sale to Condux Corporation. (8) Aside from the boom in Sydney property values in 1988, is he able to explain the significant increase in the sale value achieved between the time of sale by the Government to Condux Corporation and the sale by Condux Corporation of the 4 parcels. Mr West-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (\) Yes. (2) The property was sold to Condux Corporation but whilst the terms of the sale included a payment of $6m there was also a condition that the largest building on the site be leased back to the Commonwealth rent free for IO months. (3) Yes. (4) My Department was advised by the Australian Valuation Office that an area of 2 hectares was sold to AUSTAUR, a subsidiary company of Hawker de Havilland, for $2.4m. (5) Hawker de Havilland, the only tenant on the property, was given the opportunity to tender for all or part of the site but no offer was received. (6) In accordance with usual practice the Commonwealth sought advice from the Australian Valuation Office and a range of property consultants on the most effective method of marketing this property to achieve maximum revenue return. The advice received was that the property should be marketed as a large industrial complex. (7) Subdivision was considered but would have required significant expenditure before sale. (8) Tenders for the property closed on 15 December 1986. The purchaser, Condux Corporation, did not on-sell it until late 1988. During this two year period land prices in Sydney increased dramatically. There were also conditions on the sale that affected the price received by the Commonwealth. These included the Commonwealth's requirement that Hawker de Havilland be retained on the site to carry out essl(ntial Defence work, and that the Commonwealth continue to have access to a large storage facility on the site at no charge. This would have represented a cost to the purchaser of about $1 m.. In addition the substantial costs associated with subdivision, maintenance and development of the site, including demolition, relocation of services and the costs of constructing a sizeable factory building, would have amounted to some millions of dollars which would have significantly reduced the apparent profit received by Condux. . Senior Executive Service (Question No. 1509) Mr Reith asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (I) Will the Minister identify each Senior Executive Service or equivalent position within the Minister's department or authorities responsible to him which has been reclassified since I July 1988 and to which the occupant has been reappointed, indicating in each case (a) resultant increases in salary and other entitlements and (b) whether or not the reappointment followed normal selection procedures. (2) On what basis is it claimed that the reclassification conform with the national wage fixing principles. (3) How many Senior Executive Service or equivalent positions are there within the Minister's portfolio. Mr Barry Jones-The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) The only authority within the portfolio to reclassify a Senior Executive Service or equivalent position since I July 1988 is the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). The position is that of Director, Advanced Materials Program which was reclassified from Chief of Division, Grade 2 to Chief of Division, Grade 3 with effect from I January 1989. (a) The reclassification resulted in an increase of $6,202 in salary and $754 in expenses of office allowance. (b) The promotion followed the approved procedures applicable to Chiefs of Division. (2) The reclassification was approved on the basis of a significant net increase in work value. (3) There are 249 Senior Executive Service or equivalent positions in the portfolio. Senior Executive Service (Question No. 1522) Mr Reith asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (I) Will the Minister identify each Senior Executive Service or equivalent position within the Minister's department or authorities responsible to him which has been reclassified since I July 1988 and to which the occupant has been reappointed, indicating in each case (a) resultant increases in salary and other entitlements and (b) whether or not the reappointment followed normal selection procedures. (2) On what basis is it claimed that the reclassifications conform with the national wage fixing principles. (3) How many Senior Executive Service or equivalent positions are there within the Minister's portfolio.",157
302,Mr HOLDING,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Following approval from the Minister for Finance in April 1988, the top structure of my Department was reorganised, resulting in the reclassification of nineteen Senior Executive Service, or equivalent positions in 1988. However, the formal reclassification of six of these positions, those concerning the position of Deputy Secretary and the five First Assistant Secretaries, was completed prior to I July 1988. (In the event, with three of these positions-that of Deputy Secretary, and two of the First Assistant Secretary positions-the previous occupants were reappointed). The remaining thirteen positions were reclassified on 8 July 1988. Twelve of the occupants of these positions were reappointed following normal selection procedures (the thirteenth position being filled on a transfer basis). The twelve positions involved are as follows: From Senior Executive Service Level I to Senior Executive Service Level 2; Executive Branch in Victorian State Office. From Senior Executive Service Level I to Senior Executive Service Level 2; Economic Policy Branch, Migration and Ethnic Affairs Policy Division. From Senior Executive Service Level I to Senior Executive Service Level 2, Social Policy Branch, Migration and Ethnic Affairs Policy Division. From Senior Executive Service Level I to Senior Executive Service Level 2, Policy Secretariat Branch, Migration and Ethnic Affairs Policy Division. From Senior Executive Service Level I to Senior Executive Service Level 2, Settlement Planning Branch, Migration and Ethnic Affairs Policy Division. From Senior Executive Service Level I to Senior Executive Service Level 2, Legal Branch, Development and System Division. From Senior Executive Service Level I to Senior Executive Service Level 2, Systems Planning . and Management Branch, Development and Systems Division. From Senior Executive Service Level I to Senior Executive Service Level 2, Systems Development and Facilities Branch, Development and Systems Division. From Senior Executive Service Level I to Senior Executive Service Level 2, Regions and Overseas Operations Branch, Operations Management Division. From Senior Executive Service Level I to Senior Executive Service Level 2, Government Relations Branch, Office of Local Government. From Senior Executive Service Level I to Senior Executive Service Level 2, Resource Management Branch, Corporate Management Division. From Senior Executive Service Level I to Senior Executive Service Level 2, Corporate Services Branch, Corporate Management Division. The resultant salary increases in each case, at current salary rates, were from $52720 (for level I) to $57775 (for level 2), an actual increase of $5055. There was no change to entitlements. (2) All the reclassifications conform with national wage fixing principles. With the changes to the top structure of my Department, there was a reduction in the number of Divisions from six to five and an overall reduction in the number of Senior Executive Service positions in Central Office, which led to a significant net addition to work requirements for eighteen of the reclassified positions. For the other position identified, that of State Director, Victorian State Office, there was a similar net addition to work requirements arising from greater responsibility for the management of staff and resources and an increasingly complex migration program. The reclassifications were approved by the Minister for Finance on the basis of an overall decrease in the number of Senior Executive Service positions (below Deputy Secretary level) of 6.4%, with an associated reduction in Senior Executive Service salaries expenditure of 1.9%. (3) There are thirty-nine Senior Executive Service or equivalent positions in my portfolio. Racial Discrimination: Civil and Political (Question No. 1550) Mr Hollis asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 1 March 1989: (I) Further to the answers to questions No. 475 (Hansard. 3 November 1983, page 2360), No. 94 (Hansard. 4 November 1987, page 2043), No. 95 (Hansard, 18 November 1987, page 2357), No. 248 (Hansard, 18 February 1988, page 369), on what occasions has the Standing Committee of Attorneys General discussed the questions of (a) making a .declaration under Article 14 of the 1965 I nternational Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Racial Discrimination and (b) acceding to the Optional Protocol to the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. (2) Which States agreed to Australia making a declaration under the Article and acceding to the Protocol.",159
303,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) These matters were discussed at meetings of Ministers on Human Rights (which formerly were held as an adjunct to meetings of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG)) on a number of occasions including '14 December 1984, 2 May 1985 and 25 July 1985. Subsequently, human rights issues have formed a separate agenda item for the meetings of SCAG and these matters have been raised as part of that agenda item. (2) New South Wales, Victoria and Australia. Acts and Regulations (Question No. 1583) Mr Ewen Cameron asked the Attorney General, upon notice, on 1 March 1989: (I) Is he able to say whether persons requesting current Acts and regulations from AGPS bookshops are often supplied with obsolete Acts and regulations which may endanger a person at court; if so, what protection is available to AGPS customers who are provided with material that is not up-to-date. (2) Are the provisions of section 52A of the Trade Practices Act relevant.",160
304,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Minister for Administrative Services has Rights advised that he is aware of only one possible instance of obsolete legislation being sold to a customer requesting current legislation. He advises that procedures are in place for the replacement of obsolete legislation and the possibility of obsolete legislation being sold is negligible. (2) Section 52A of the Trade Practices Act relates to conduct, which is, in all the circumstances, unconscionable. In the light of (I) above, s. 52A would not appear to be relevant, but its relevance could only be determined having regard to all of the circumstances in any particular case. Citizenship Campaign (Question No. 1712) Mr Smith asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: Was Ms J. Hoskins, a media liaison officer, assigned by the Minister's Department to monitor and answer criticisms, which were published in the letters columns of newspapers, of the Prime Minister's citizenship campaign; if so, (a) how many newspapers did she write to in each State or Territory, (b) were any other officers in the Minister's Department or another Department assigned to assist her and (c) what costs were incurred by the Department in the performance of this task.",160
305,Mr HOLDING,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the South honourable member's question: Mrs J. Hoskins, a Media Liaison Officer, was assigned by her Director as part of her routine media monitoring responsibilities to correct factual errors on citizenship appearing in news reports and letters to Editors columns; (a) ten, viz. The Australian. The Launceston Examiner. The Daily Telegraph. The Sun News-Pictorial, The Melbourne Herald, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, The Courier-Mail. The Advertiser. and The Canberra Times; (b) no; (c) no precise records were kept as media monitoring and the provision of factual material to the media is an ongoing responsibility. The best estimate that can be made is that the time taken to prepare and despatch the letters would not have exceeded four hours. Mrs Hoskins's current salary is $20.08 per hour.",160
