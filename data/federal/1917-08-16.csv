BUREAU OF NATIONAL SERVICE. Mr BOYD.^-Will the Prime Minister state what steps he is taking for the tablishment of a bureau to get over the - hipping difficulty?",4
1,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have this morning appointed Mr Haldane, of the Postal Department, to he Director-General of a National Service Bureau. An office has heen taken and a staff is heing formed to carry on the work of the bureau. Mr. Whitehead, of the Victorian Public Service, haa been appointed Director for' this State, and I am expecting nominations for the position of Director for the States of New South Wales and Western Australia.

2,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I wish to address a T question to the Minister in charge of External Affairs. Will you, Mr Speaker, tell me who that is ?",4
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," The 4 question is not one which, strictly speaking, should be ad-, dressed to the Speaker; but .1 understand that there has been a re-arrangement of the Ministerial offices, and that the work which was formerly done by the Department of External Affairs has been distributed between the Departments controlled by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home and Territories.",4
4,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Then I address my question to whichever of those Ministers it may .concern. I ask why the prohibition on trading in respect of Wehrenberg and Co. and about 200 other German firms in Japan, and against Beer, Sondheimer and Co., and about 200 other firms in 'the United States of America has been withdrawn. I refer to the Commonwealth Gazettes of June and July last.",4
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I think that the question is one to which an answer has already been given. The prohibition relating to firms doing business in Japan was withdrawn at the instance of the Japanese Government, which has itself imposed a prohibition on the trading of the firms menser- tioned, making our prohibition unnecessary. As to the prohibition affecting the United States of America, if .the honourable member will put a question on the business-paper, I shall endeavour to give him an answer to ib tomorrow.",4
6,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,What possible objecestion can there be to the press of this country .publishing the statement that appeared in the Government Gazette to the effect that the prohibition orders had been withdrawn against these German firms ?,4
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I do not know what objection there can bo. Is the honourable member speaking of a prohibition that has been directed to the press i If so, I do not know anything of it.'",5
8,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"The prohibition is nob ou the part of the censors, who are willing to allow the' publication, bub it came froma member of the Government. . Mr HUGHES - I do not'know anything of the matter - It may be that the' journal with which, the honourable member is connected proposed to utilize this matter for the purpose cf reflecting on one of our Allies. Of course that could not be permitted.",5
9,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"B y way of personal explanation, 1 desire to say that the Prime Minister wishes to ascribe to me a desire bo reflect on one of our Allies, That statement is not correct. What I did wish to do was to make a reflection on the Government. NA PARLIAMENT HOUSE.  Minister whether auy military police wore at Parliament House yesterday I",5
10,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY POLICE AT,"In view of the statement of the honourable member for  quiries on this subject from the Defence Department, aud have been furnished with a report, in which it is stated that no military police wore in the vicinity' of liament House yesterday. Therefore there was no truth in the statement made here.",5
11,Mr FENTON,MILITARY POLICE AT,"B y way of personul explanation, I wish to say' I asked the Minister for the Navy whether the military police that were seen among the assembled crowd yesterday were there",5
12,Mr BOYD,MILITARY POLICE AT,Thu t is not - the way in which the honorablo member put the matter. He said that military police were there.,5
13,Mr FENTON,MILITARY POLICE AT,"Wheneve r I rise, l am subjected to unruly interruptions by the honourable member.",5
14,Mr BOTO,MILITARY POLICE AT,I want the honourable member to be liccuratft. . Mr Fenton --The honourable member is riot my censor.,5
15,Mr SPEAKER,MILITARY POLICE AT," The honourable member for Maribyrnons (Mr Fenton) has asked to be allowed to sta-be his question in silenceWhen an honourable member makes a request of, that kind, it is-the especial duty of the Chair to see that he is heard without interruption.",5
16,Mr FENTON,MILITARY POLICE AT,"Seeing that there were military policB in the crowd outside Parliament House, yesterday, I was anxious, to know whether they were there under instructions from the Defence Department, and, during the course of the reply of the Minister for the Navy, I said that they may have been merely sightseeing. I think that it was a perfectly reasonable questiou to put, because it is - generally understood that military police are merely to look after their own class, aud when I saw Ihcm among a crowd of civilians I wns anxious to know whether they wore there under instructions or not.",5
17,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY POLICE AT,"B y way of personal explanation, I wish to say that this is a matter to which I attach considerable importance, aud when I heard the statement of the honourable member I iimnediawly saw the Minister for Defence, and asked him whether he, or any of his officers, had given instructions for military police to ho in attendance. He said, that he had given no such instructions, but that he would iuquire whether any had been givon. The report that I have referred to is that which has been furnished as the result of that inquiry. The Government would view with the greatest possible disfavour the introduction of military police into what is a purely civil matter, in rePar- gard to which, there would be no excuse whatever for the introduction, of the military.'' That is the attitude and the policy of the Governmeut. PAPERS. The ' following papers were presented :Customs.

18,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Has the Minister for Works and Railways the return that he recently-promised to furnish in regard to traffic operations on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway?,5
19,Mr WATT,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have much pleasure in laying the return on the table. Ordered to be printed. AMERICAN FRUIT.,6
20,Mr FINLAYSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Has the Prime Minister received a petition from Sydney fruit, merchants requesting a modification of the embargo on American apples and other f r u it ; and, if so, does he propose grant the Tequest put fdrward?",6
21,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have not received any such petition. I have many times stated the position of the Government in regard to this matter. The policy of the Government, and, I understand, of Parliament, is to encourage Australian industries and the consumption of Australian products. The question of allowing importations of fruit will not be considered until it is found impossible to give effect to that policy. growers of this country have been consulted in reference to the matter covered by the honourable member's question, but they have not advised any relaxation of the restriction on importations, except possibly during December and January; and the Government - are now considering to what extent, if any, the embargo may be relaxed during those months. NA ACCOUNTS COMMITTEES.",6
22,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"Las week, the Prime Minister said that the ever, Government would give consideration to the matter of appointing the Committee of Public Accounts and the Qpmmittee of Public Works. Has any step been taken in regard to 'the matter?",6
23,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"Owing to the prestween sure of important matters, the Govern the ment have not been able to proceed ther in the matter referred to. I hope, however, that the Cabinet will be able direct attention to it shortly.",6
24,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"Will it not be necessary to an end? to amend the Public Works Committee Act and the Committee of Public Accounts Act before these committees can be appointed, because both measures state that the committees must be appointed the commencement of the first session of each Parliament, and this is not the first session of this Parliament?",6
25,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"Speakin g as a constitutional lawyer, I have to admit that the honourable member is perfectly correct. I can see very plainly that he has been using his leisure fbr a purpose which is very, far from frivolous, and I commend him for it. ZINO PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION.",6
26,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"I would like to. ask the Prime Minister whether there to are any regulations gazetted under any Commonwealth Act specifying and defining the scope, power, and control of an v association known as the Zinc Producers Association ?",6
27,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"I do not know whether, there are any regulations under any Act relating to this association. If the honourable member will give notice of this question, I can furnish a detailed reply tomorrow. The fruit- DEPORTATION OF UNDESIRABLES'.",6
28,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"Will the Prime Minister consider the advisability of issuing a regulation, under the War Precautions Act, enabling him to deport undesirables?",6
29,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"I do not know. If we commence deportation, it appears to me that the result will be that whoever happens to be in the majority will deport all those on the other side of Ihe House, and.that those who have the first opport tunity of so acting will hold office for . INDUSTRIAL CRISIS.",6
30,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"Is it the intention of the Government to take any steps towards bringing about a conference bethose who are primarily engaged in existing industrial disturbances in furNew South Wales-the Commissioners of Railways, on the one hand, and the railto way and tramway employees 'on the other hand-wit h a view to bringing the trouble",6
31,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,No .,6
32,Mr FOWLER,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"In view of the possibility of the present industrial troubles completely isolating Western Australia at from the other parts of the Commonwealth, with very serious results in regard to food supplies, will the Minister for the Navy take' precautions to maintain communication with Western Australia by sea, at any rate, until the transcontinental railway is completed ?",6
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,I do not q u i know what powers I have in the direction suggested by the honourable member.,7
34,Mr FOWLER,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,You have at your disposal naval forces which might man the ships.,7
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"I suggest to the honourable member that he should address his question to the Prime Minister. I believe that the Shipping Board is now controlled by Senator Russell. I should like to say in a general way, however, that the Navy Department is taking steps to see that the transports leave at their appointed time with their appointed freights,By freights I mean cargo as well as men. Whatever resources are at the disposal of the Navy Department will be exercised to the full in order to attain that object.",7
36,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"In view of the notification in the press and elsewhere that the. Government propose to employ, the Navy, so far as it can be employed, to overcome the difficulties arising through the strikes, does the. Minister for the Navy propose that those persons in the Navy who decline to assist in strike-breaking in any way shall be pub' on trial under the naval and military laws ?",7
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,It is quite unusual to answer questions founded on hypothetical circumstances.,7
38,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,In connection with the arrest of Miss Adela Pankhurst yesterday the newspaper reports - imply that many more arrests are to follow.. I ask the Prime Minister to assure me that there will be plenty of blankets available in the gaol when I am collared;,7
39,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"As parliamentary representative of the Castlemaine Woollen Mills, which produce blankets, I shall cer' tainly see that an order is placed with that establishment so that when the honourable member's time for imprisonment comes, he will have plenty of covering. SHARES OF ENEMY COMPANIES. that . Mr ANSTEY - In the Government public Gazette recently appeared a notice that number of shares were to be put into the hands of the public trustee on behalf Der Deutsche Bank, Der Dresdner Bank, and Der Disconto Gesellscbaft. Are those shares to remain in the hands of. the public trustee until after the end of the war; if not, what is to be done with them ?",7
40,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"To the best of my te knowledge, I gave the public trustee orders to sell all shares of enemy companies some three or four months ago. Yesterday when I was asked a question in reference to these shares I learned that they had not been sold, but the public trustee informed the Solicitor-General, from whom I obtained my information, that the matter of dealing with some thousands of .enemy shares involves a good deal of detail work. However, he has completed his arrangements, and he proposes to sell the shares forthwith if possible. That applies to the shares mentioned by the honourable member as well as others. BONUSES FOR INDUSTRIES.",7
41,Mr FENTON,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"As the ' System of bonuses has been helpful in stimulating some of the industries of the Commonwealth, is it the intention of the Minister for Trade and Customs to continue that system, especially in regard to industries that are struggling to keep their heads above water in competition with the products of cheap labour countries?",7
42,Mr JENSEN,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,Cabine t has now under consideration the question of bounties and bonuses for Australian industries. IMPORTATION OF LUXURIES.,7
43,Mr KELLY,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"Some time ago 1 received a circular from an association, and signed by Mr Mauger, with reference to the importation of luxuries. I made several inquiries of Mr Mauger, one of which was in reference to the quantities, not merely the prices, of goods imported. I have received no reply or acknowledgment, of my communication, and I should like to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs 'whether he can see his way to provide the House with that information, as all members received the same circular ?",7
44,Mr JENSEN,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"The circular was sent to me, and I wish to state emphatically the facts were not placed before the in their true light. It ' mentioned a merely the value of importations, and not the quantity of goods entering Australia. of I know for a positive fact that many imported articles have risenin price from 20 per cent, to 70 per cent., and that very few articles are how imported which do not show an increase of at' least 20 per centf. over the purchase value in 1915. Therefore, figures as to the value of importations are not a true criterion of the quantity of good's imported. I can assure honourable members that there haa been an enormous falling-off in the quantities imported. Mr TUDOR, - The honourable member for Wentworth asked the Minister to supply the particulars in regard to quantities .that are omitted from the circular. Is it possible 'to supply those figures until six or eight months after the close of the year ? .",7
45,Mr JENSEN,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,It is impossible to give a detailed statement of goods imported at this time of the year. STOCKHOLM CONFERENCE. REPRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIAN VIEWS.,8
46,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"Since the Prime Minister, uninvited, made representations to the Imperial Government in regard to Labour representation at the Stockholm Conference, will he see that the censorship in this country is so far relaxed as to enable organized Labour in Australia to make representations as to its desires in connection with that matter?",8
47,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,I shall consider the question. AUSTRALIAN WHISKY .,8
48,Dr MALONEY,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"I desire to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether it has been brought under his notice that Australian-manufactured whisky, which has a certain amount of protection from the Excise duty, is being blended with imported spirits and sold in bottles with labels purporting that it is imported whisky?",8
49,Mr JENSEN,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"The matter has been brought under my notice. In view of the fact that manufacturers of Australian whisky enjoy a good protection under the Tariff-the Excise being less than the import duty-and also the double protection afforded by reason of the enormous freight costs on imported' spirits, I think that they would be well advised if they recognised that their products should be sold as being of Australian manufacture. Australian spirits, once the Excise duty has - been collected, are released from any further control so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. It is a matter for the State [43] authorities to see that whisky,and other spirits made in Australia are sold as suchv Mr CONSIDrNE.^-Arising out of' the' answer which the Minister for Trade"" and Customs gave to a question in regard' to the prohibition or protection",8
50,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC," Order ! I would remind the honourable member that it is not in order to* address to Ministers questions arising, out of answers previously given by them to questions on the same subject. This practice, if permitted, would give rise tp s an irregular debate. PACIFISTS AND PEERS.",8
51,Mr KELLY,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he is aware that the pacifist influences in this country, have recently .circulated amongst members the speeches of three aged peers who, for some considerable time, have retired from their political inactivities, and whether he will make inquiries as to whether there is any close connection between those peers, with their - somewhat vague statements, and those bodies in our midst who appear to be against every form of war except industrial warfare ?",8
52,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"I am not to be regarded, even on my worse days, as a, peripatetic Burke's Peerage. My knowledge of the male peerage, at all events, is very small. I shall, make inquiries as to the alleged connection, illicit or otherwise, between the parties named. Nothing would surprise me in regard to what they have - been doing. Neither age. nor experience seems to affect either one of them. If I can discover anything tangible .I shall be glad.",8
53,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister if , in the interests of a better appreciation of the true position in this country generally, he will be goodenough, when looking up the names of the distinguished gentlemen associated with pacifists in the Old Country, to acquaint the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly)",8
54,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"Hon. W, Elliot Johnson).'- I regret to have to interrupt the honourable member, but he is now distinctly asking a question arising out of an answer given, a few moments ago, by the Prime Minister, to a question pnt to N him. by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly).",8
55,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"Not at all, sir. I think the honourable member for Went- - domain. worth must have been well aware that I contemplated asking this question, and that he rather anticipated me.",9
56,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"If 'the question which the honourable member desires to ask does not arise"" out of an answer given by the Prime Minister to a question relatstand,'is ing to the same subject he will be in order in putting it, but not otherwise.",9
57,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"The question that I desire to put to the Prime Minister arises entirely from the honourable member for Wentworth's well-known general want of tion Act? knowledge of this' subject, and has no necessary reference to his special exhibition of want of knowledge a few moments ago - I wish to know in these circumstances whether the Prime Minisorable ter would be gracious enough to acquaint the honourable member with the fact that one of these distinguished peers is Governor of Victoria, and another",9
58,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"Order ! The able member is not in order in putting such a question. It is a well-known principle that questions shall be put to elicit information, but the honourable member is now endeavouring to impart informa-. tion instead of seeking it .",9
59,Mr BRENNAN,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"On the point of order, sir, I shall content myself with the statement that I shall be very pleased give the honourable member for Wentdeavouring worth in private ihe information he sadly lacks.",9
60,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"Order ! I call the attention of the House to the fact an attempt is now being made to utilize in an irregular way the time set apart notices of motion and questions. That' eannot be permitted. Legitimate tions may be put to Ministers,, cannot allow the time of the House to be taken up in the putting of questions that are quite irregular.",9
61,Mr KELLY,PUBLIO WORKS AND PUBLIC,"B y way of personal explanation, sir, I wish to point out that the honourable - member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) suggested that I had dethe liberately anticipated a question he posed to put. I had not the slightest that he proposed to ask a question on subject, or that he regards himself as authority on the Peerage; but I can assure you, sir, that it was with no - that I trespassed upon - his particular NA DEPARTMENT : AWARDS.",9
62,Mr BRENNAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In the.absence of the Postmaster-General, who, I underi l l , I desire to ask the Prime Min-. ister if it is a fact that the Government have in contemplation a regulation-o r have passed a regulation-whic h will have the effect of giving to other than members of organizations the benefits of awards made' under the Public Service Arbitra",9
63,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"As locum tenens for the Postmaster-General, I am unable.to pump up an effective answer to the honmember. I do not even know what is the point to which the honourable member refers. I can only say that it has an exnorelation to his former question. honorDISTURBANCE AT RECRUITING MEETING.  ister noticed from today's newspapers that a wilful and wicked attack was last night made by pacifists, in a most militant manner, on ladies assembled",9
64,Mr BBENNABT,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I rise to a point of, to order. The honourable member is now ento do precisely what you, sir, so ih your wisdom, prevented me from doing just now.",9
65,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH," When , the honourable member for Batman rose, I was about to call the for attention of the honourable member for Calare to the fact that he was doing what questhe honourable member for Batman had but I been forbidden to do.  ister noticed from the press reports that a wilful and wicked attack was made",9
66,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Order ! The honourable member cannot ask"" a question of that kind. Under cover of 'asking a question, 1 honourable member is making certain prostatements, and expressing an opinion idea about the actions ' of _ people outside. this Strictly speaking, questions are not in an order which are based on paragraphs appearing in a newspaper, unless the memmalice ber makes himself responsible for their accuracy; and the honourable member .distinctly stated that his question had reference to something which had appeared in a press report.  aware that an attack was made on ladies, who were holding a recruiting meeting in Queen-street, by pacifists who sembled",9
67,Mr ANSTEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I rise to apoint of order. My point is that these people were not pacifists.,10
68,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I remind the honourable member that it. is distinctly not in conformity with the dignity of the House to raise points of order of a frivolous character. , ,  ister see that some protection is given to those ladies who, assembled at a recruiting meeting, are alleged to have been attacked by members of the Pacifists-Association?",10
69,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"As a humble and very abject belligerent in this great contest, I can quite appreciate the feeling of the lady friends of the honourable member who are confronted by these very determined pacifists, and I shall do what I can to protect them. Perhaps the honourable member will let me have further particulars, so that, in my anxiety to do good, I . may not protect the wrong ladies. NEW WORKS: ESTIMATED",10

As all the employees have to resign their present positions before joining the corps-and many of them have practically a life's service in the Department-wil l the Minister see that all rights accruing are preserved to them, and that the retiring age existing under the present regulations will be the same in the new corps in their cases? 5. Does the Minister,.in the light of past experience, think that the giving to the Military complete and absolute control in this matter will make for efficiency and economy in a Department that is practically a business institution ?",11
86,Mr JENSEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w :1. Yes. All permanent employees of the Ordnance Department have been invited to state whether they desire to join the Permanent Army Ordnance Corps, and, approximately, 90 per cent, have voluntarily expressed their desire to do so. 2. So far from this corps being hurried into existence, its formation has been contemplated since 1902, and probably earlier. The object of the regulation in respect to the formation of an <&rmy Ordnance Corps is to enable this branch of the service to take its correct place in the military organization, as in all other armies of the civilized world. main points aimed at ' in forming the permanent, corps is to enable a corresponding 'militia organization to be formed consisting of selected men who are employed on corresponding duties in business houses, and whose services would thus be available to augment the permanent staff and administer all ordnance services in camps on mobilization. The Chairman of the Royal Commission was informed, by the Minister of his intention to take action in this matter and offered no objection. It is not proposed to defer action. 3. Yes. 4. That all employees have to resign their appointment is incorrect. Only those serving under the Public Service Act-approximately , 20 per cent - woul d be affected. Provision has already been made in the regulations for the conservation of all rights appertaining to the present conditions of the service of these men. 5. The Ordnance Department in the several States have not been under complete military control at any time. Portion of nnder the control of the Public Service Commissioner and portion is serving under the fence Act. The regulations recently promulcrease gated will eventually abolish the dual control trade. now existing. 1149 INDUSTRIAL CRISIS. SYDNEY STRIKE.",12

96,Mr FINLAYSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Brisbane) [3.22]. - For some time past various questions have been asked regarding the embargo on the importation of apples from America.' To-day I sought to get a final reply on „ the subject from the Prime Minister, but unfortunately we are no further forward now that we have heard his answer. I asked him if he had received a petition - from Sydney. I had information yesterday that this petition was on its wav, and a copy of it reached me today. It is as follows:Sydney, 14th August, 1917. The Right Honourable W. M. Hughes, Prime Minister, Melbourne. Sir, We, the undersigned, distributors of fruit in New South Wales, hereby request that you reconsider your decision in prohibiting the importation of American apples into the Commonwealth. We are informed that you are to consider the matter at the end of September. This will be too late to allow of arrangements being ,made for shipments this season. At the present time, apples are realizing up to 16s. per case, and, owing to shortage of supplies, will be practically unobtainable in October, except a small quantity now being held by speculators in cool stores. We feel sure you have no wish to see the fruit trade exploited bythese speculators, and trust that you will consider this petition favourably, and give us your decision promptly, as all we ask is permission to import from the 9th October to 14th December, Duffy Bros. Co. Ltd., D. J. Duffy, manager. W. H. Price. Caddy, Lee, & Co., A. V. Caddy. W. Stoyles. P. S. Peters. Weymark & Son Ltd., J. Weymark, director. H. Beid & Co. M. J. Madigan. J. H. Trevarthen Ltd. Bart Allen & Son. P. Carroll. P. B. Reedy. Fred. Chilton. Mr W. P. Cooksley, writing to me on behalf of the Brisbane fruit merchants, under date 24th July, says^Dear Sir, As chairman of recent meeting of frui t importers, I desire to place before you our land position with reference to the proposed embargo on American apples'. As far as it is possible for us to see, the present supply of Tasmanian apples will be exhausted about the end of September. The present quality is far from perfect, and is in no wise free from diseases, which would in other years have prevented their admission into the States. From the month of October to the end of - the year, Queensland is very short of her own local fruits, which makes her dependent upon imported apples to supply the demand. In the western districts and inland towns the want of this class of fruit will be felt severely, as it practically is the only fruit that will carry satisfactorily. Tasmanian apples coming to Queensland out of cold storage late in the year are not a success, as the naif of them are decayed before reaching here. Trusting you will impress upon the Minister the importance of this matter. I have received letters on the same lines from various f r u it merchants in Brisbane. The Prime Minister has told us that the fruit-growers do not advise the relaxation of the embargo, unless possibly for the months of December and January. But I can quote opinions expressed by them which are an absolute contradiction of that view. The following is a report of the meeting of the Victorian Annual Conference of Fruit-growers in 1916. * which appeared in the F r u it World of 1st October, 1916' Mr Mair (Tyabb and Hastings) moved""That an increased duty be placed on American apples."" Mr Griffith spoke against this motion,, as he 'thought that if the duty on American fruit coming into Australia was increased, America would adopt the same attitude towards Australian fruit, and this would be detrimental to the working up of trade between America and Australia. On the motion being put to the meeting, it was lost. In the F r u it World of 1st December, 1916, .appears the following report of a meeting of the Australasian Conference of Fruit-growera which was held on the 31st October and 1st and 2nd November, 1916: Mr Tucker (New South Wales) moved"" That increased duties be placed on imported fruits."" He had been a fruit-grower for thirty-three years, and had an up-to-date orchard, but if protection were not secured, he intended to give up the industry, and go in for pigraising. (Laughter.) Australia could store fruit to keep up supplies throughout the year; but America had the advantage of natural ice, which gave cheaper storage.. Growers in Australia, should maintain control of the Australian markets rather than build their hopes on a problematical American market. Dr Benja-' field, (Tasmania) seconded the motion. The importation of American apples, he stated, Queenswould be ruinous to our cool stores. American Sturmers were now fetching 14s. per case on the Sydney market, because they were highly coloured-althoug h tasteless and inferior to the. Tasmanian fruit-wherea s he was now getting only 7s. a case on the Bame market for his finest Sturmers. Mr J. H. Lamb- (Victoria) spoke against the motion, and stated that this proposal had been turned down at State Conferences. The present protection was very high, as, including cost of production, freight, and other charges, apples could not he landed from ,San Francisco under 12s. per bushel. The imports of American apples, he thought, was showing a tendency to decrease. Mr G. Griffith (Victoria) stated that, with the opening of the Panama Canal, they were in a position to land fruit as cheaply in New York as in London. Mr Shoobridge (Tasmania) advocated Free Trade in fruit, and said their object, as growers, should be to cheapen fruit, so as to increase the consumption. Australia could grow every kind of fruit as well as any place in the world, and. should be able, to stand against all competitors. As to our cold-storage fruit being killed by imports, he instanced Doncaster, where the cost of storage amounted to only i d . per case a week. This left ample margin to meet competition. Mr Chilton (New South Wales) stated, that they should study reciprocity with other countries. The present duty, on citrus fruits was 4s. 2d. per central. He had received numerous' inquiries from America for Australian fruits. The motion, on being put to the meeting, was - lost on the casting vote of the chairman. ' i In the F r u it World of 1st May, 1917, there is this report of the council meeting of the Victorian Fruit-growers Central Association, held on 26th A p r i l of this year: A letter which had been received from Mr. H. H. Davey from the Fruit World, and published in our last report of the executive meeting, at which meeting a motion was carried in keeping with that carried at the Australian Conference of Fruit-growers, protesting against placing a prohibitive duty on American apples, was read. It was understood that the Prime Minister intended to prohibit the importation of apples during the period of the war. This action was being supported by the New South Wales and Tasmanian Fruit-growers' Association. A discussion took place as to whether the council should take any further action in this matter. Mr Mair moved' that no action be taken by the council. He thought that the reason. the Government intended to prohibit the importation of apples at the present time was because they required the shipping space for matters of more vital importance tb the carrying on of the war, also in keeping with the intention of the Government to prohibit luxuries during the war. Mr. Lang stated that recently the Prime Minister, speaking at Hareourt, said that it was the intention of the Government to prohibit the importation of American apples to assist the fruit-growing industry. He understood, however, that, before taking action, the Prime Minister intended to confer with an Advisory Committee. Mr Lawford stated that the question to be decided was, whether Victoria was in favour of prohibition or not. He favoured a reciprocal trade (Hear, hear!) Mr Hatfield questioned whether the action promised by the Prime Minister would be to the interests of the Australian fruit-grower, as Victoria could-certainly not compete with the American fruit when on the market here, as the quality was much better than the Victorian apples, which had to be taken out of cool stores. He thought it would be the same on the American market; Australian fruit would be more likely to capture the market than the American coolstored fruit. After further discussion, the following motion was moved by Mr J. H. Lang (Hareourt):-""That the Prime Minister be informed that this association, and also the Australian Fruit-growers' Conference, has always been opposed to raising any bar against the importation of American apples, 'even to the extent of increasing the duty. These associations have had in view the very great possibilities of America as a market for Australian fruit, and, therefore, have at successive annual Conferences favoured the policy of a practically open door. We further desire to say that we do not in any way wish to influence the Prime Minister in any decision he may make with the object of conserving freight during the war."" This motion was seconded by Mr Hubbard, and carried. I have now given chapter and verse for statement regarding the attitude of the fruit-growers of Victoria and generally in this matter. The statements that I have read are in direct contradiction of that of the Prime Minister The right honourable gentleman is interand, fering in a matter with which be is acquainted, and his evident knowledge is leading to a most nate position, so far as the fruit-growers and fruit-consuming public - of Australia Mr Finlayson. are concerned. .1I have been in almost continuous consultation on this subject with the Minister for Trade and Customs who, being himself an orchardist, is well acquainted with the position. Of course, I have no record of the honourable gentleman's! opinion, but I am disposed to think that he views rather favourably the request that has been made, particularly from Sydney and Brisbane, for permission for the importation of American apples for the latter part of the year. The M in ister for Trade and 'Customs,- who would naturally be expected to control this matter, is not allowed to give effect to his knowledge; the Prime Minister's veto overshadows his actions, and the public must suffer in consequence.. On the 26th July the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), drew attention, to the price of apples in Australia. One has only to look into the windows of retail shops to see apples ticketed at anything from 5d. to 6d. per lb., and information is readily obtainable to show that the wholesale rates for f r u it run f r o in 12s. to 16s. per case. To my knowledge, most of the f r u it now selling has been in cold stores for a considerable time. It was bought up by speculators at 6s. to 8s. per case, 'and is held by them in cold stores, and, as it is only allowed to be dribbled but to the public, an artificial shortage is created. The public are not only fleeced in regard to the price, but they are also limited ""in the matter of the amount of f r u it that is allowed to go into consumption. A rather peculiar commentary on that position of affairs is the fact that almost daily there is a statement in the' press by the Prime Minister, or by those who are advising him in this matter, pointing out how necessary it is thut the public should eat f r u it , and particularly how 'advisable it is that they should eat apples. For some time we were deluged with all sorts of suggestions in the press as to how beneficial, useful, and healthy my apples were as an article of diet, and as to how easily they could be prepared for Australia the table. I submitted a question to the Minister today. for Trade and Customs on the 27th July, in reply, he promised to have a renot turn prepared showing the amount of want of f r u it that is available in Australia. An y unfortudetermination as to whether apples should be imported should be based upon that in formation. No honourable member could put up an argument i u favour of the im.portation of apples from America or elsewhere i i there were sufficient f r u it availgrowers' Conference. able in Australia. The information placed at my disposal by the Minister for Trade and Customs has enabled me to form an estimate as to what fruit there is available in Australia. I understand that there are 200,000 cases in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. The returns from .Tasmania are not quite complete, but, according to such information as is available, there are probably 200,00.0 cases in that State^.,.",13
97,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,There is considerably less than that quantity in cold storage in Tasmania;,16
98,Mr JENSEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"For the information of the honourable member, I may state that there are about 400,000 cases of apples throughout Australia in cold storage and in orchardists' sheds. Mr FINLAYSON:- I thank the Minister for that information. I was bas'ing my calculations, on a rough estimate of 400,000 cases being available at the present time. On the average, the normal consumption of apples in Australia is about 40,000 cases per week. When fruit is cheap there is no difficulty in disposing of 60,000 cases per week, but 40,000 cases per week is the normal con, sumption, and, with fruit at its present price, I question whether the consumption now is over 30,000 cases a week. Taking the normal consumption at 40,000 cases per week, the quantity - of apples how available in Australia will supply us for not more than ten weeks. If the rate of consumption be reduced, the quantity should last for three months, but that can only be done by artificial restrictions, either through the imposition of higher prices or by limiting the quantity to be taken out of cold storage. In that way the supply.might be made tp last until the end of October. A request was recently made through the Prime Minister, to the , Minister for Trade and Customs.for permission to import 75,000 cases from America during this season. Last year, when^ there was a fairly good crop in Australia, _we imported 142,000 cases from America, and in order to show that this importation did not have any detrimental or disadvantageous effect on the fruit-growers of Australia, I have only to refer honourable members to the report of the FruitThey say that there should be an open door. They do not even suggest any limitation as to the number of cases to be imported or any increase of duty. Therefore, if , during a good year, Australia could afford to import 142,000 cases without any detrimental.'effect to the fruit-growing industry, it is an easy thing to show that when there is an admitted shortage of fruit, such as we have experienced this year, there should be no trouble in disposing of the limited quantity of 75,000 imported cases, which is all that the fruit merchants are asking to be allowed to import this year.",16
99,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Will the honourable member explain why tons of apples were wasted last year because they were not considered worth picking?,16
100,Mr FINLAYSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That was not due to the importation of frui t from abroad. It was due to the local fruit-growers having an extraordinarily good crop. . Mr EODGEBS - It was due to over production.,16
101,Mr FINLAYSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I do' not think there can be any over production in the matter of fruit.,16
102,Mr EODGEBS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It was the fault of our methods.,16
103,Mr FINLAYSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member is now modifying his statement. He is right in saying that the fault lies in our methods of distribution.. The: main trouble last year was to get the frui t to the people ab such a low price that they would be ready to purchase it .,16
104,Mr GREENE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,.Does - not the . main trouble lie with the retailers ? ' . . ' . ' ,16
105,Mr FINLAYSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"My experience is that the main source.of trouble.is.the-bad facilities provided by railways and shipping companies. If the honourable memr ber for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) would go down to the wharf and see. the .way ' in which oranges from Maryborough 'are handled, he would see a sight that would be enough to make him shed tears of blood. The accommodation that the shipping companies provide for fruit is simply disgraceful. But the fruit that is. now available in Australia is in cold storage, and the other difficulty, arises that, .when it is taken out of cold storage, it must be put into immediateconsumption or go bad. Witbin a month the fruit that is now available in Sydney and Brisbane will be absolutely useless, because it will not carry over a journey that will take more than a day by rail or by steamer. Neither Broken Hill , nor Bourke, nor any western town of New South Wales or Queensland can possibly hope to see an apple after the end of this month until February, when probably the new crop will be available. Between the end of the Australian fruit season and the. beginning of the new season, the only.way in which the supply of fruit to the outlying portions of Australia has been maintained has been by importing American fruit.",16
106,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Is it not subject to the same disabilities as Australian fruit, seeing that it comes in cold storage from America?",17
107,Mr FINLAYSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No ; because it is packed so carefully, and treated in such a way that, when it is landed here, it is capable of being carried to any part of Australia without danger of decay or loss. One of the happiest features of progress in Australia today is the fact that the fruit-growers are largely copying the American system of packing and preparing fruit for market.",17
108,Mr BAYLEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Would it not be possible to treat the surplus fruit in Australia in the same way, and make it available for transport? - Mr FINLAYSON . ^ I believe that the time .is coming when we shall be able to take our surplus crop, particularly apples, and treat it in such a way as to make it available as the Americans can make theirs available; but that time has not yet arrived. Furthermore, at the normal rate of consumption of fruit, the quantity now available in Australia will not last more than nine or ten weeks, and it can only be made to last longer by artificially limiting the consumption, either through increasing the price, or by reducing the quantity made available from cold storage. The Prime Minister suggests that he will review this matter at the end of September, but by that time our stocks in Australia will be nearly exhausted. It takes ships three weeks to come from America, so that, even if the Prime Minister is, favourably disposed, and arrangements are made immediately, there will be at least * a month or five weeks in which there will be no frui t available. The Minister for Trade and Customs knows that arrangements have to be made a very considerable time ahead with the fruit-growers, in America in order to secure space on the steamers. Any one acquainted with overseas shipping knows that arrangements have to be made months ahead; so that, even if arrangements were set in hand immediately, I question if it would be possible to land the first shipment of apples by the 8th October, Mr BAMFORD' - Wlit p should make the arrangements ?",17
109,Mr FINLAYSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The fruit merchants have their arrangements in hand. They are merely waiting for information from the Minister for Trade and Customs to the effect that the importation will be permitted. They suggest that only half the amount should be imported this year as compared with what came in last year. The reason for this is the fact that the vessels are not now available. There will not be the cold storage available to bring the larger quantity across from America. If arrangements are made immediately, and 75,000 cases are imported, they will only last, at the outside, from the 8th October to the end of December. The' fruit that would be imported could be easily absorbed by Queensland and New South Wales without a single case of American fruit being available for other States, and by Christmas there would not be an imported 'apple' left in Australia. There is no possibility of competition with .the local article, or detriment to the Australian fruit-grower, by allowing this'importation to take place. The Prime Minister says there must be' no importation, and the public are being misled-I . do not think, deliberately-by reports in the press regarding the difficulty fruit-growers are likely to have in regard to the disposal of their surplus crop, and there is talk of providing machinery to supply dried fruit to the British Government and the markets on the other side of the world. But that surplus is in connection with next year's crop, and, judging by the splendid rains which have fallen in the fruit-growing districts, and the present indications of the forthcoming season, the apple growers will have an extraordinarily good yield. Probably in those circumstances they will be wise in placing an embargo on importations which would deprive them of the Australian market, but that position has not yet arisen, and cannot; arise for the next six months. If the American apples which are now prohibited were allowed to enter the Commonweal ta, they would disappear before the end of this year. The Minister for Customs has been offered a guarantee that if American apples are allowed <bo be imported, not only will they be absorbed by Queensland and New South Wales alone, so that there can be no detriment to the fruit-growers of the other States, but ithe prices to the consumers will be limited.",17
110,Mr BAMFOSD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does the retailer agree with that?,18
111,Mr FINLAYSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I think' we can depend on the retailer. When there is any possibility of an .arrangement in regard to prices, it is not the retailers, but the wholesalers', who are responsible. That is true, not only 'of apples, but of every other commodity. It is much easier for half-a-dozen wholesale men to come to an arrangement with regard to prices than it is for the retailers.",18
112,Mr BAMFORD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The retailers have surmounted that difficulty in Melbourne and Sydney.,18
113,Mr FINLAYSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No , they have not. 'There are opportunities for the wholesale men to come to an arrangement with regard to prices, and that is being done at the present time.",18
114,Mr BAMFORD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"You are speaking with inside knowledge. J Mr FINLAYSON - Of course I am I have already referred to the face' that the apples now being supplied to the' public were bought months ago by speculators at less than half the price they are charging the consumers, today: In fact, a letter appeared in this morning's press from a retailer, who stated that he was paying 12s. a case for apples, and when he weighed up the f r u i the found that at the price at which he was selling he was actually making a loss.",18
115,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What quantity Australian apples is sold in America?,18
116,Mr FINLAYSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I have not the tity figures for America.,18
117,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No apples are there, because the American people will not buy them.",18
118,Mr FINLAYSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am sorry the honourable member makes that statement, because the Australian fruit-growers are not of his opinion. They are most anxious to cultivate trade with America, and one of the peculiar facts in connection 1 with bhis matter is that whilst, on the one hand, we are talking about the' advisability of appointing a Trade Commissioner in America to promote the sale of Australian products, we are, on the other hand, saying to Americans that we do not want their products to be sent' to Aus-' tralia. Fruit-growers have sent experimental shipments to America with gratifying success, and through the agency of the Panama Canal they are in as close touch with New York as with London. There are very good opportunities for promoting the sale of Australian f r u it in America. The seasons of the two countries are opposite. While the American f r u it season is on the Australian season is off, and so there ought to be a reciprocal arrangement.",18
119,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,But state how much Australian f r u it has been placed on the American market.,18
120,Mr FINLAYSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not think that question is germane to my argument, when I have been able to show that we have not enough f r u it in Australia to supply our own needs, and that we require to supplement Australian f r u it by importations from America. In a return placed on the table of the House on the 8th August, at the request of the Leader of the Opposition, these figures in regard to the export of apples occurr ' Cases. Far Case. Centals. Estimate. Value. Estimate. £ 1914 637,475 1,600,000 424,475 5s. 1915 217,587 540,000 138,706 5s. 1916 596,011 1,500,000 373,477 5s. 1917 113,403 284,000 96,090 6s. Honourable members will see that last year we exported nearly six times as many cases of apples as we exported this year. The decrease was not alone due to the fact that there was limited shipping space of available, but was equally due to the circumstance that we had not the same quanof f r u it available. There is a shortage of f r u it this year, and it 'is in order sent to make good that shortage that I appeal to. the Minister to remove the existing embargo on importations. I ask him to take that step now because it is necessary to immediately make-arrangements if the f r u it is t q be landed in Australia in time to be of any service, at all. If the Minis-, ter waits till the end of September the whole machinery of importation will be thrown out of gear, and instead of the fruit arriving here to supply the market when Australian fruit is exhausted, there will be two or three months of an interregnum between the exhaustion' of the local article and the arrival of the imported. In any case, if the importation of apples immediately began with' the first ship leaving America, which would be due to arrive here about the 8th October, we could notpossibly import more than 75,000 cases before the end of the year, . and that quantity could be absorbed without the slightest trouble, and certainly without any detriment whatever to the fruit-growers of the Commonwealth. Next year, when, we hope, a big crop will be available, we can deal with the importation question in the light, of the circumstances then obtaining. But today there is no reason or justification for a continuance of this prohibition. It is unfair to the people of Australia, and will tend to maintain the price of apples at the present rate, with increases as the season advances.",18
121,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What grower get in the Australian market at' the beginning of the season ?,19
122,Mr FINLAYSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"About 4s. or 5s. per case, and at one period it was almost impossible to get buyers. The responsibility - for. that lies with our inefficient methods of distribution. It is not the grower who is getting the' big prices now, but rather'the speculators, who have held the fruit ih cold storage and forced up the prices. It is all very well to talk about protecting the ""grower; the unfortunate fact remains that he is so much tied up with banks and other financial institutions that he is glad to take the best price he - can get, and, although the wholesalers are getting today 16s. per case, the growers from' whom they bought the fruit probably did not get more than 6s. or 7s. It is not fair to the consumers of Australia, or to the growers of America, that the prohibition of importation should be continued .a day longer.",19
123,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Has America surplus supplies to send here?,19
124,Mr FINLAYSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There is plenty of fruit available in America. The American crop is like our own-whe n it is available the growers desire to sell. They can hold - no their supplies much easier than we in Australia can, and thus insure a continuity of supply all through the year. Unfortunately, we in Australia have not reached that stage.",19
125,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is the honourable member speaking of the United States of America or Canada?,19
126,Mr FINLAYSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Of both. Of the 75,000 cases of apples to which I have referred, two or three shipments will come from Vancouver and the balance from San Francisco.. If those apples are allowed to land here there would be no competition with the Australian fruit, and our fruit-growers, if the reports of the annual conference are to be taken as a guide, are neither opposed to the importations of American fruit nor in favour of any additional duty, being imposed upon it. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will review this prohibition at an ©surly d.£it&",19
127,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Denison) [4.4] I trust that the Minister will give this question most earnest consideration before he removes the embargo on importations.,19
128,Mr WEST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member is speaking for the Tasmanian fruit-grower. Mr LAI RD SMITH - I am considerdid the ing the consumer as well as the producer, and. I nave yet to learn that when the American apple was allowed, to enter Australia free - of duty the* consumer was able to buy apples one cent, cheaper. In fact, prices were higher than they are at the present time. There are no American apples on the Australian market today, but there are to be seen in shop windows apples equal - to any that have ever been placed before the public. And this, notwithstanding that in Tasmania and other parts of the Commonwealth last season the moisture was so excessive as to give rise to a great deal of black spot, in consequence of which - apple-growers suffered considerable loss."" The honourable member for - Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) failed to inform the House that those for whom he was speaking in making this proposition wanted a fulcrum on which to place a lever to bring down and keep down the price of Australian-grown apples. The apple market has nob been cornered by any body of persons in Australia., Small growers in Tasmania have themselves placed apples in cool storage. We have there about 70,000 cases in cool storage, while a number of cases are also stored in orchard sheds. As the honourable member .has stated, at the beginning of the season it Was not possible to obtain more than 3s., 4s., and 5s. a case for apples. In such circumstances, many small growers refrained from rushing their frui t on the. market. Instead of doing so, they put it into cool storage, and they are looking to the prices prevailing today to save them from considerable loss. They are, after all, obtaining only a reasonable price for their fruit.",19
129,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What is a payable price?,20
130,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Speakin g from my own personal experience, I would say that a grower should receive for his apples at least 5s. a case in the orchard if he is to work his land to the best advantage.",20
131,Mr HEITMANN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That would be a low average price.,20
132,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It is a low price.,20
133,Mr BAMFORD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In that estimate of 5s., does the honourable member include the cost of cases and packing?",20
134,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Yes .,20
135,Mr FINLAYSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I think it is a fair thing.,20
136,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Quite so. I do not hold any special 'brief for the orchardists of the Commonwealth. There are not many apple-growers in my elec-„ torate, but I am anxious that the industry should be fostered. I have been informed by men who can speak with authority that it is impossible to get"" tralian apples on the American market. .That,being so, why should we give the American growers a preference over our own producers? Much has been done by private enterprise in Tasmania to establish cool stores, and these stores have been successfully employed by the small growers. I am informed that the owner of the cool stores in my State gives the growers better terms than can be obtained in respect of either the Victorian Government cool stores or the co-operative cool stores a little way out of Melbourne. In short, it costs more to put apples into cool storage here than it does inTasmania. I am hopeful that cool storage in Tasmania will be considerably increased, so that the small growers may have an opportunity to conserve their supplies, and, by placing their fruit on the market at regular intervals, be able to keep their industry going as a fairly payable proposition. The value attaching to fruit-growing land is given to it only by the trees thereon. I question whether any bank would advance a shilling an acre on orchard land except for the fruit trees upon it. Such land is of very little - value for other purposes. In ' the early days, what was known as third class land in Tasmania could be obtained for 10s., and even 5s., per acre, because its value for fruit-growing purposes was then unknown. To-day t i e position has changed, and large areas which were at one time thought to be of very little value are now devoted to apple-growing. I am prepared to show 'the honourable member for Brisbane a letter"" and a cablegram that I have received urging .that the Government should not allow the market to be flooded with - American apples to the detriment of Australian orchardists, who, during the . last two years, have passed through hard times.",20
137,Mr WEST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,There are on sale in Sydney today Western Australian apples which are better than those from Tasmania. N,20
138,Mr MASSYGREENE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The fruit merchants, who exploit both the public and the grower, are the worse possible menace to the industry.",20
139,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"And the honourable member for Brisbane has been, putting before the House the case for the fruit merchants of Sydney and BrisAus- bane. As to the interjection, made by the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) I would say that the apple production of Western Australia is very small compared with that, of Tasmania. Western Australian apples are carefully graded, and they colour up very well. Tasmanian apples may lack the colour of those grown in Western Australia, but their flavour is infinitely better. The Western Australian growers get their fruit on the London market a fortnight before the Tasmanian apples, and, catching the early market, thus ob- ' , tain higher prices.",20
140,Mr HEITMANN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member will find Western Australian apples being sold in Tasmania. Mr LAI RD SMITH - I realise that the honourable member is not quite in earnest. My chief concern is ""for the grower and the consumer in the Commonwealth. We, in the Commonwealth, hope next year to have a production of .6,000,000 bushels of apples, and i questionable whether we could ship more than 1,500,000 bushels, even if they evaporated, and place them on the Home market. v Mr TUDOR - That has not been posthe sible even in the best year.",20

143,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I disagree with the honourable member. If we have a crease crop of 6,000,000 bushels next year shall have to utilize the local market its utmost capacity, and what we cannot consume here must be evaporated - and sent to our men at the Front.",21
144,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"They would be of no use to the men at the Front. Mr Laird SMITH. - Is not the honourable member aware that the men at the Front at the present time are concost suming large quantities' of apples treated; in the way I have just mentioned? My desire is that the apple-growing industry shall be fostered. I object the attitude taken up by a number gentlemen who, at certain times, proclaim themselves Protectionists, but at he has named. other times are Free Traders.",21

146,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Not at all. .am not a geographical Protectionist; hope the Government will give very carewe ful consideration to this matter before yielding to the request that has. made by the honourable member for Bristime, bane (Mr Finlayson). The honourable member was careful to mention that request came from importers of apples Sydney. ' He named them, but I regret that he did not name the Brisbane porter to whom he also referred.",21
147,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Did not the Prime Minthing ister say this afternoon that the Governare ment had under consideration the visableness of allowing apples to be ported during December and January? Mr LAI RD SMITH - I think not. We have no objection to their coming once our own apples are off the market. , We strongly object, however, to the t is sion of American apples at the present time, seeing that small growers have conare siderable quantities in cool storage. The return which the Minister for Trade and Customs is having prepared will disclose quantity of apples in cool storage in the Commonwealth.",21

A' vast sum of money is to to be spent on silos for the protection of our wheat; why should we not assist our 1 orchardists by extending our cool stores ?",21

' However, I must revert to the speeches of the Prime Minister in the Old Country. There the right honourable gentleman was spoken of as' a strong man of action-as not only a man who could talk, but a man who could do things.

That is, German agencies We have purged every company of every German shareholder, whether he was naturalborn or whether he was not. There is only one way in which you can do this thing - d o .it with such thoroughness that the Germans will avoid this country as though it were the very plague itself. We have compelled the companies to"" buy out. We have robbed no man, German or Englishman, of his fair rights. Every share that a German held has been bought at market price. So much is their due. Let them have their pound 'of flesh; but, in God's name, 'let them be gone! Is it, or is it not, true'that every oompany in Australia has been purged of German influence, or are these shares still held by Germans who are profiting by them?",23

171,Mr HIGGS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But the point is that the v Prime Minister told the people of England that every German had been cut out, flag of and every German share sold. The honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Anstey), in. his publication Hughes and His ""Views, pointed out that these shares were still held by the Germans, and would be kept in trust for them by our public officials until after the war, when the Germans would resume their control.",23
172,Mr BRENNAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That would not apply to ordinary working Germans. Mr HIGGS:-Ordinar y working Germans employed on the wharfs at Rockhamption were deprived of work. In ternational law appears now to be a dead letter, but, prior to the present war, it was^ held that, although in former times private, as well as public, property went to the conqueror, private property in modern times in every case remained sacred. If , for instance, Japan had thoroughly beaten Russia, she *would have taken the public property of that country, but would have respected the rights of private ownership. I am not now discussing the ethics of ,the Prime Minister's proposal to sell these shares; I am merely pointing out that the right honourable gentleman told the people of Great Britain that the shares had been sold, whereas they are not yet sold. It is said, moreover, that the other day, when it was proposed tp sell them, certain persons went to the Government and got the sale put off. If the Labour party had failed to act in a matter of this kind, we should have been described by the Prime Minister as pro-Germans.

The Prime Minister has misled the people with an inaccurate statement. The sooner the general public gets to know that it can rely very little on what he says the better.,24
178,Mr COESEE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Wide Bay) [4.40].:Some time ago the producers of maize throughout Queensland approached the Prime Minister,, through me, among others, to see what could be done to stimulate their industry, and, on the 8th of this month, I received the following letter from the Prime Minister's Department :With reference to your letter of the 29th May, and previous correspondence on the subject of the maize crop, I am directed by the Prime Minister to inform you that, in reply , to representations in this connection, the British Government advised that, as there was insufficient tonnage for wheat and flour, they were unable to negotiate for the purchase of by-products of maize. I am to add that, so far, maize-growers have not availed themselves of the invitation of the Prime Minister to organize, and submit for consideration, a scheme for dealing with the problem, in view of the absence of oversea freight. Many of us thought that action would have been taken in this matter before the imposition of new duties on Eriday last. If the Excise duty on starch made from rice were increased to 2d. per lb.; and the Excise duty on starch made from maize left at I d . per lb., it would stimulate the use of maize. At least 1,000,000 bushels of maize could be used to make starch and other by-products. The rice used in this country is imported front countries in which it is grown by means of black labour, and when imported for the making of starch it is admitted duty free. But starch can be made of maize just as well as of rice, and 98 per cent, of the starch used in the TJnited States of America is made of maize. If the Government is desirous of helping the man on the land, it will give practical consideration to this question. In many parts of New South Wales, and in very many parts of Queensland, there are rich scrub lands on which wheat, barley,, and was. many other cereals do not do well, because in a climate like that of Queensland, with such rich land, and a big rainfall, the straw grows so thick that it is impossible to property dry it before stacking, and thus mildew spoils the grain. It is only after the ground has been cropped many times that these cereals can be grown on it profitably. Much of that land is consequently put under grass for the pasturing of dairy cattle. It is a waste of land, which is as good as that at Warrnambool, to use it only for pasturage, and if encouragement were given to the growers of maize by guaranteeing, through the Tariff, a reasonable price for their production, 'this < land would be - largely devoted to maize growing. In my electorate, maize has been sold, in small quantities for as little as Is. 3d. per bushel. The Maize Products Proprietary, of Footscray, has stated in writing that if it had reasonable protection for its' manufactures it would be able to give at least 4s. a bushel for maize, which would mean a price of more than 3s. per bushel to the growers, who are now getting from Is. 3d. to Is. 6d. per bushel. In Australia there is room for a population as large as that v of the TJnited States of America, where they have over 110,000,000 inhabitants, and grow over 3,000,000,000 bushels of maize a year, as against about 5,000,000 inhabitants here. Unless encouragement is given to the primary producer, good land will fall out of cultivation, and men will come from the - country to compete with the labour already in the cities and towns. There is an Excise of Id. per lb. on starch made from rice imported free, but when duty is paid on the rice, at the rate of 3s. 4d. per central, the Excise is not levied. I suggest that, to encourage the manufacture of starch from maize, the Excise duty on starch made from rice should be inr creased to 2d. per lb., or the manufacture qf starch from rice imported from black labour countries should be prohibited. Another anomaly in the Excise duties is the fact that, although in America and elsewhere the product of maize is used very largely in the manufacture of beer, it is specially penalized in Australia. The Excise duty on ale, porter, or other beers not made exclusively from barley malt and hops, is 6d. per gallon, as against 5d. per gallon on ale, porter, or other beers made from barley malt and hops. ' Mr TUDOR - Since then, the Tariff has been raised to 6d. and 7d. > , Mr CORSER - Yes , last Friday. But the difference of Id. is still there. Why should there be that difference? Why should the very product that is largely grown in Australia be penalized to that extent if it is utilized in the manufacture of ale or stout? Mr TT/DOR - In the same way, potatoes are prohibited from being used in the manufacture of spirit.",24
179,Mr CORSER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Probably potatoes do not produce a good spirit. If maize will provide a good material for the purpose of making ale and stout, why should it be penalized ? If the product is not good, it will not be used. At any rate, I do not see why it should not be put on an even keel with the other items. Then, again, in regard to glucose. Tho honourable member may say that I am up against sugar, but I do not support any particular industry. I support every industry that needs support. The glucose that is manufactured in Melbourne from maize is used by brewers and confectionery manufacturers, and why should it be penalized?",25
180,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is not. There Excise on glucose now. It was wiped out . in 1914. Mr..CORSER - There is an importation of glucose, mostly from America.",25
181,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Ver y little has been imported during the last year.,25
182,Mr CORSER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But , after the war, it. will come in again. If the factories know, that, after the war is over^ they will be protected to the extent that, through the war, they are now, they will manufacture glucose from maize. It is no encouragement to an industry, especially in a new country such as Queensland is, where there are very few things, that can be grown when the land is first cultivated except maize, not to provide in the Tariff that the local production shall have at least protection against articles that are imported. If these concessions were made, a firm at Footscray, which is now using 1,500 bushels of maize daily, could use 1,200,000 bushels per annum, which is equal to 4,000 bushels daily. That would be of immense assistance, and the means of settling large numbers of people on the land. We hear from the Prime Minister that no assistance can possibly be given to the shipping of maize. That is practically saying that it will be useless to put our soldiers on some of the richest land in Australia without alteration of the Tariff. It offers no encouragement to men to extend their cultivation in a new country, and it will operate as an inducement to them to go into , the towns and find occupations there. If for no other reason, the Government should, with as little delay as possible, make such alterations in the Tariff as will enable them to settle returned soldiers and others on the land of which. I have spoken, to make it more productive, so that more producers may be in a position to feed those.who are living in the towns. I trust that the Minister for Trade and Customs will go into the matter fully, and that it will not be long before .we can convey from this House some information that will encourage our young men to settle on the land, instead of harboring in the cities.",25
183,Mr ANSTEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Bourke) [4.55] - My object in rising is to place on record a few facts, and to express a few opinions on the situation confronting us today. We have is no heard the Prime Minister talk about cutting out the cancer of German influence, and we have heard him say that a number of us are identified with German interests. To day I asked the Prime Min: v ister a question, and, in reply, I was told that the prohibitions against German firms were no longer necessary because they had been imposed by the United States of America and Japan. A prohibition appeared in the Government Gazette on the 7th June last in connection with certain German firms operating in Japan, and it was removed because, as the Prime Minister has explained, a prohibition having been imposed by ..the Japanese Government, there is now no need for that prohibition on our part. In spite of what the Prime Minister has. told us, I say that there is no prohibition imposed by Japan on any German firm operating in its territory. As a matter of fact, from the beginning of the war the Japanese Government have not put up any prohibition against any German firm operating in its. territory. As long as any German firm operating in Japan conducts itself in accordance with the laws of Japan, it can carry on operations there. The removal of the prohibition here entirely due to the fact that Japan wishes to do a larger trade with us, and finds that her means of carrying on trade w i us is curtailed by reason of such a large portion of her . business being in the hands of German firms operating in her country who were affected by our prohibition.. The Prime Minister talks about eradicatterests ing German influence, and he prohibits any trading with the Aachen and Munich Fire Insurance Company, of Queen-street, yet one can carry on business with the same firm operating in Japan. We proflection hibit the importation of products .names of the Deutsche Apotheke, Weinberger and Cpmpany, Winckler and Comup pany, Fiecke and Company, Meier and are mixed up in it . Company, Berg, Werner, and Company, and so for t h , ""yet we can carry on spondence and business with those firms, withdraw it . in Japan. The same thing applies in regard to the United States of America. We have had a prohibition against German firms who carry on business in America. Suddenly, on the 12th July, that bition was removed. The prohibition applied, among others, to Bauer, Phillip, and Company, and Beer, Sondheimer, and Company. The latter was the firm nected with the metal gang operating Australia. The other day there appeared in Dvmn's Gazette a notice of the reconit. stitution of the Electrolytic Smelters. names of Seigfried Hirsch and Frank these shares. Snow appear as foundation directors. And while we were talking of cutting out the cancer of German trade the Hirsch people had a lot of concentrates at Port Pirie, and the Union Bank advances to Frank Snow, who was the agent handling these concentrates. thermore, the Prime Minister, while talkshares ing about cutting out the cancer of man trade, immediately opened the door BO that the Union Bank could open up negotiations with'the Aaron Hirsch pany through America. To-day I why these prohibitions had - been renot moved, and I was told that it was longer necessary to impose, them because Japan had imposed them. I maintain that Japan has not imposed them. In . regard to the shares held by enemy subjects, I also took the liberty of asking the Prime Minister a question. While the right honourable gentleman was telling the people of England that the whole of the German cancer had been eradicated, and on his return to this country made -' is the same affirmation, at the same time charging many of us with having been direct agents of the Germans, he placed t h the whole of the metal business, and a large amount of other industrial business, directly in the hands of W .

Baillieu and others who were the very instruments for^the introduction of the Germanic in - . in Australia, and right up to the outbreak of war were direct "" p a l s "" of that influence, and ever since have been the local controllers of Germanic interests.",25

The Argus published an article in which it was stated that it would be improper to sell these shares. . Why were they not sold? Because Rodgers and Company,' of the Sydney section of the metal gang, did not desire them to be sold. We do not know why, but one fact is evident, namely, that Rodgers and W. L .

The Metal Exchange was formed only recently. Several months ago the Prime Minister said that he.was going to have these shares sold immediately, and the statement he made today, that they would be sold forthwith, is merely a repetition of what we heard before. The moment he made that statement the metal crowd began to object. One would naturally ask, Would they not be pleased to get the possible crement of value between now and the end of the war ?

197,Mr ANSTEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I suppose they cheered because they appreciated the fact which the honourable member disclosed to them. The reason which the honourable member upon the facts. quoted is one of those to which I was leading, but it is not the only reason. the especial argument of Rodgers and Baillieu, and the other, members of the censorship. metal 'gang, that the flooding of the market with a large number of these German shares at this particular juncture would destroy the value of their shares. That would be a perfectly legitimate consideration for the Government to take into account, but if that is the reason. for not selling the shares, why do not the Government say so ? Do not make bogus excuses or pretences. Do not tell the people that you have eradicated' the last element of German influence when you have not. Say straightforwardly that the reason you are not putting the shares on the market is that the flooding of the market - with the property of Germans would depreciate the value of the shares of other large holders in the metal companies of' the Commonwealth. Those shares could not be put on the market without destroying the value of the shares of the metal gang, and they had to choose between the interests of their pockets and the interests of their country-whethe r they should lose money or should destroy the Germanic influence, and take away German interests in Australian industry. Faced with that alterin- native, they said, "" Let the Germans retain their interests rather than that we should lose any of the value of our shares."" After sixteen months the Germanic interest in these companies is still retained, Ger- and we have had the argument advanced that the shares are not put on. the market because that course would affect the interests of fJhe present British holders. On the other hand, we are now again told that they are to be sold forthwith.",27
198,Mr JENSEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"You did hot get the former - statement from the Government, Mr TUDOR But the interjection came from an ex^Treasurer. Mr ANSTEY,-The other day I attempted to publish to the people some of these facts that appeared in the Gazette, but I was debarred, from doing, so, and the people connected with the journal in which the information was to appear were taken before the Court and heavily fined. The matter had actually appeared in the Government Gazette, but the reason we were fined was that, without submitting the matter to the censor, we had published the construction which we placed To-day the Labour newspapers of It is the country are almost entirely the only papers which are subjected to the Those journals are not allowed i o publish what is allowed to be published in the daily press. If a Labour journal seeks to republish a paragraph published in the Age or the Argus, it must submit the matter, to the censor: . When the matter is. submitted, the paragraph is eliminated; and if it is not submitted, the Labour paper is prosecuted. In regard to the matter which we wished to republish from the Gazette, after we had been prosecuted, we submitted the matter to the censor. He cut out half of it , and said we could publish the balance. We could publish the essential facts, but we might not comment upon them. At the end of this Gazette notice, which was signed by the Minister for Trade and Customs "" by His Excellency's Command,"" there appeared the words "" God Save ,the K in g . "" So I wrote at the head of my article, "" God save theK in g . "" What could be more loyal? But - the official censored "" God save the K in g .

He was allowed to make that statement, was published throughout Australia.  ference between the two as things are ing today. . Mr ANSTEY - j l think the honourable . member is perfectly right in his interjection. Perhaps I shall save a lot of time and argument if I tell the honourable member that I think Australian unionism should be stamped out in the same way as German militarism. If it cannot be done by the ordinary processes of the law, we are rapidly marching to the stage when it will probably be done at the point of the bayonet. If the remark made by Brookes was not calculated to create discord, what was? .1 proposed to write, in reply, "" Brookes and his crowd want conscription, not to win the war, biit to smash unionism."" If Brookes could'make his statement, had I not a perfect right to make the other remark i h reply? I did nob object to the liberty given him . His remark did not help the enemy; it did not stop recruiting; but when I retorted that Brookes was not tryin g to win the war, but to smash unionism, the censor intervened. Where is the justice in that? These censors draw about £30,000 a year in salaries. The salaries . of the censors in this State would amount to about £8,000, but thei majority of papers'in Melbourne are not censored at' all. There are newspaper offices in this i g h t ; city which the censor never enters, and whose publications he never looks at; but any little Labour journal suspected of radical tendencies-whethe r it be the Bulletin, the Labour Gall, or any othermay not prin t a line that "" Brown is going to sell sausages tomorrow "" unless it submits the matter to the censor, and then he would probably delete the paragraph on the ground that it might refer to GerI have put before the House a few facts don't that the censor will not allow to appear in the press of this country. They will now appear in Hansard.

To-morrow the shares will be sold - I have a few pounds, and it and I want to buy some. In a letter addressed to me by the cendifsor, the statement appears, "" Y o u will gonot be prevented from saying, ' Hughes' is winning the war.' "" Why should I not be allowed to do that? If I bad posed to state that he was not winning the war, the position would have been different. I might then have been deyou clared to be guilty of treason, or something equally terrible. But can any one say that there was anything wrong in my probe posal to show "" How Hughes is winning the war""?",27

The're is only one sound ciple to be observed in any interference with the liberty of the press. The right to publish any statement should be termined by the question of whether not that statement is injurious to the .country, or is calculated to help the enemy, or to stop recruiting - In this article, I . 1 had not a word to say which would come under any of those headings. I merely proposed to show how the Prime Minister was doing his utmost to win the The censor, in this letter, went on to however, that the context was ""objecwas tionable,"" and that the same remark plied to another article entitled ""God save the King."" I was at perfect liberty, he said, to print those words as often desired, provided that they conveyed objectionable meaning. In other words, he said, "" Y o u are.at liberty to print words as often as you like, if you mean what you say, but I am not sure that do."" The deletion of the words "" Three any one else. cheers for Japan!"" was also held to be correct, because, read in conjunction with the rest of the article, the implication, ""whether sarcastic or not,"" was not perfairly missible. In other words, I must not lish anything that is sarcastic. The censor said, further, that I would not be allowed to state that the daily press of 15th June had announced that hundreds of pianos were about to arrive ""from Japan. An announcement had appeared in the daily press to that effect, and I desired print ,it. I wished to give the public benefit of the knowledge that they could get good, cheap Japanese pianos. Why proshould that knowledge be denied them? I wanted to make known the fact, but the censor said, in effect, "" We will not allow to publish it, because there is an objectionable context to the statement."" My remarks, apparently, were considered to ' satirical, and, therefore, could not be published. This, then, is the state of human liberty in Australia. What happened 'again yesterday?

I also wished to give the peosay, ple the information that a fire brigade close at hand with about a thousand apyards of. hose ready to squirt water on the people outside this building. I was not allowed however, to make known that as I fact to the general public. Why was my no question suppressed ? The answer is that the Government did not want the country the to know what was being done in that direction.. Such absurdities of suppresyou sion do no good to the Government or There are two fundamental facts with which I'have dealt. The first has reference to the outrageous censorship unand improperly exercised, and the pubsecond relates to the assertions which have , been made as to the extermination of German influence in Australia. That assertion is a fraud on the public. German ownership in the industries of Australia is as great as it was at the beginning of the war. I do not believe to rethat the Prime Minister- I shall say the nothing about his colleagues-ha s any real intention of eradicating German holdings in the industries of Australia. When the war is over those interests are going back to Germanic companies, and the talk that we have heard as to the eradication of German influence is the biggest flam that was ever perpetrated upon a great Democracy.",29
202,Mr RODGERS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Wannon) [5.27] - I regret that the Prime Minister was not present while the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) and the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) were addressing the House. It is just as well that his absence should be known to the public, since it will' explain why many statements made by those honourable members, and which will go into wholesale consumption, were allowed to pass unchallenged. Dealing first of all with the statements made by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), I may say at once that I do not approve of what I might describe as the almost vindictive spirit in which he approached the question of the German metal interests', and the action taken by the Prime Minister in regard to them. At the same time, I feel that he has raised a very grave issue, the importance of which has been emphasized by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey). As one who took a very keen interest in the efforts made to eradicate the German interests in the Australian metal industry, J feel that the country is entitled to. know whether or not any direct German interests will benefit in the use that has been made of our base metals since the outbreak of the war. The whole matter ought to be cleared up.",30
203,Mr HIGGS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member will admit that the companies to which reference has been made are making huge profits, and that the shareholders must participate in those profits.",30
204,Mr RODGERS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"As I pointed out while the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) was speaking, the market value of these base metals today is very different from what it was when steps were taken to eradicate the German interests in these companies. Immediately after the outbreak of war there was an almost complete dislocation of the trade, but soon after it was put on a different footing. And it is the position at that stage which ought to be definitely cleared up. If the statements which the honourable member for Capricornia and the honourable member for Bourke have made are true in substance, then we have not tackled this question as we should have done. The honourable member for Bourke mentioned a man in the public life of Australia who, he said, had, before the war, some association with German interests. The nature of that association or connection the honourable member did not tell us, but he went on to say that today this public man had resumed his former relationship with the' German companies. That is a very grave charge, and it cannot be allowed to rest where it is. If , in Australia, any man during the course of this the most bloody war in the history"" of mankind, has allowed himself to be associated with enemy interests, then the matter cannot be allowed to rest where it is. Those responsible for the statement, as well as the gentleman named, and the Prime Minister, who has handled this question from the first, cannot allow it to stop where it is. Coming to the question of the ownership and value of these shares, there must be something wrong'with the trusteeship which has been set up in respect of those shares if residents of Germany are still allowed to participate in the profits made by the companies concerned as the result of the base metal industries of Australia. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) made a clear-cut distinction between international policy with regard to territory taken, in war and the individual rights in property of the citizens of belligerent countries. Between the two he drew a clear line of demarcation, and I hold that in the trusteeship under discussion an equally clear line should be drawn. On the day on which these shares were taken over they should have been valued, and any subsequent increase in their value should go to the Empire, and not to Germany.",30
205,Mr KEIXY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Why not go back Btill further, and fix the values as from the outbreak of war?",30
206,Mr RODGERS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We could not do that, since for a certain time after the outbreak of war enemy subjects were allowed to hold shares in these companies. - Mr MATHEWS - We should take the date on which they had the least value.",30
207,Mr RODGERS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No ; we must deal honestly with them. All interests in these shares passed from these people as from a particular date. - Mr ANSTEY - Is the honourable member aware that the very substance of the litisession. gation between certain Germans, the Union Company, and Frank Snow was the question of valuation?",30
208,Mr RODGERS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I presume that that a defence system. would be the kernel of the whole matter. These enemy subjects should be. entitled to the market value of the shares on day on which they were dispossessed them, and from that date every increment resulting from the commercial relations between this country and the Imperial Government, who have used these base metals, should be for the benefit of Empire, and not for that of any German subject resident in Germany. This matter must be cleared up. I certain that the Prime Minister will have a full and, I hope, a satisfactory - ment to make. Having regard to the larders vigorous action taken by him",31
209,Mr HIGGS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Hi s vigorous talk of action ,31
210,Mr RODGERS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not want to adopt the trend of thought in which honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs) indulged when dealing with matter. A good case is often deprived all its merit when approached in the wrong spirit. I shall say no more connow cerning this matter. It is a big and a dangerous question to discuss as fearlessly earth. as the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Anstey) has done, unless one is sure of his facts. It is a serious thing to make recknot less charges against a public man as his having resumed business relations persons resident in a declared enemy country.",31

212,Mr RODGERS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I hope, though not alone for his own sake, that the honourable member is absolutely wrong in his charges. I now come to a subject that was in the House yesterday.

This is one the most valuable assets of the Old Counhas even seen. try, and it has taken not generations, but centuries, to. create - Unfortunately, owing to the war, the studmasters there find themselves placed under very reone stricted conditions, and they are compelled to disperse some of the studs in their posRecently, at the instance of yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, the House considered very carefully the question of blood horse breeding as a sound basis of Personally, I have taken much interest in horse breeding, arid I think I can, with , all modesty, say that the if we wish to perpetuate a high type of of animal, the foundation must be pure blood. Many of the great studmasters of the Old Country are men of landed estate; but, with a complete disregard of their life's work, and the work of their fathers the before them, they are prepared, in a patriotic spirit, to disperse their studs in order that the land may be put to the production of corn and other foodstuffs feel for the people. Our climate is, perhaps, even better suited for breeding than that state of Great Britain, and now, when our are full, we have, as I say, an excellent opportunity to lay the foundation of what ought, in the future, to be the greatest studs in the world. The French Government, I may point out, have paid the as much as £22,000 for one good sire in England; and though we do not wish to this take advantage of the studmasters at of Home in their present circumstances, we should awake to the opportunity that is presented, when these great studs are to be scattered to the. four quarters of the I should not appeal so strongly were it a fact that private individuals are, into a great measure, prevented, almost dewith barred, by the restrictions on shipping under the control of the British and Australian Governments, from themselves embarking on the project. The brains, business capacity, and foresight of the studmasters of Australia account for the high . standard of our own flocks and herds; and I am sure there is sufficient enterprise left to secure further improveraised ments. I suggest that the Government get quickly into communication with the 1 British Government, in order that we may . secure a supply 'of brood mares and sires with which to found what, as I have said, of should be the most famous studs the world",31
213,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Wentworth) [5.39] The question of German .financial interests in Australian mineral ventures is the discussion of which I do not think any honourable member regrets. When it was first raised, the proposal was to force a sale of German share holdings throughout Australia. I pointed out I was able to the Minister who was then acting for the Prime Minister that the action'proposed could* not help the Australian mineral industry, and must inevitably help the German shareholders. To force a sale at a time when the disturbance of the money market would detrimentally affect the Australian Treasury - to what extent I am not in a position state-and would give these German shareholders the capitalized value of the war values of' the minerals produced, would manifestly be. bad policy. I suggested that the proper course to adopt was for the Government to take some steps which would insure these German shareholders being absolutely debarred from exercising any influence in the control or governance of the companies in which they were shareholders. I have since suggested to the Government that they ought either to arrange to credit the public trustee with the values of these German holdings at the date of the declaration of war, or hold them until after the war, and then sell the shares and grant the proceeds to the German holders.",31

217,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not know that are compelled to make provision for these increases in dividends to - go to man shareholders.

So as the capital value of the shares is cerned, undoubtedly they are entitled by the name. only to what the shares were worth at African the time that we extended Australian is some magic hospitality to. them and their money. As priest. to subsequent increases in dividends, what right have these German shareholders to them, considering that their own Governturning ment has brought about the intense fering to the British and other peoples in the world, which the. metals produced as forcibly as help to avenge. I have risen this afternoon not so much to deal with the question of German shareholders as to draw the attention of honourable members to what I consider to be a false step either already taken- I am informed it has been gazetted, though I cannot find the noticeor proposed to be taken in connection to with' another aspect of German ownership. I refer to "" good-will "" in German trade. It is now a considerable time since I urged upon the Government .of the day, led by Mr Fisher, and subsequently on the first Hughes Administration, the desirableness of killing German good-will here by abolishing the use of German trade names and descriptions. The House was given to understand that that - course was to be followed, and, I think, with two exceptions it was followed. In one of these cases the persons who got the licence to produce under a German trade name have ceased to use it ; and now; to my intense astonishment and regret, I find it is actually proposed to abolish the German copyright in those trade names and descriptions, and allow any manufacturer in Australia, who deincresires to make immediate profit, to popularise them by using them indiscriminately. I cannot imagine any way better calculated to help German trade more good-wiU in this country. The more people we have turning out Gergoods under German names and descriptions, the more surely will Germany profit in Australia after the war is over. In the drug trade, for instance, the trade names are merely coined names for merdealing in certain well-known com-: pounds. The ingredients of thedrugs we are thoroughly well known, and there is no particular fetish in the trade names. GerBut these names have received a value because of the great commercial effishareciency of the German agents in this recountry and throughout the world. The far public have been led to believe there is consome particular magic in the drug covered There is no magic, but the public believe there is, just as an fetish worshipper believes there in the .fetish behind the We shall have a whole host of persons out, for instance, aspirin, and all sufcompeting in articles under that name. When the war is over, and the Germanscome here, they will proceed to sell the drug under the name which they have popularised. Their agents will say, "" Now we offer you the real original a r t i c l e "" ; and there is no doubt that the Australian public will flock to buy what is offered. As a very reason-able course, which the Government ought to have followed on its own initiative nearly two years ago, I have suggested that we get into touch with the British Government, and all the allied Governments, and arrive at a common list of synonyms for all these drugs.",32

In nothing has the public been so exploited to its detriment as in the selling of quack medicines, the misuse of which, in many cases, does more harm than the drugs properly applied could do good.. But I am not dealing with that aspect of the matter now; my aim is - the killing in this country of German goodof will in drugs. The only argument with I have been met is that the terms fact, of peace will decide these things. I wish the f u t i l it y of that argument, and to warn honourable members against being too optimistic about the conditions peace. ' It is ludicrous to say, when arrange engaged in a life and death struggle, "" P u t this matter off until we have the other side down."" We have a chance now, by mere secretarial action, to do lasting good to our own people, and lastGering damage to our enemies.. Why, then, wait for the conclusion of peace? I do not want my words to be exaggerated or misunderstood, but I venture to say that any concession obtained by agreement from Germany for the destruction of her .post-war trade will be the most difficult that we can extort from her. To talk of such things at a peace conference will be the surest way of consolidating German opinion against peace. I believe that, as the pressure of war becomes more and more intolerable in Germany, we shall, gain unofficial allies there in the great producing and manufacturing interests which are threatened with utter r u in . Those connected with such industries will shortly begin-if * they have not already started ' - to influence their Government in favour of peace. But we shall drive them into the other camp, and make them, for their preservation, implore their Government) to wage the war to the bitter end, if we try to get what we want in this matter by arrangement with Germany. - The best way to deal with the thing is and now, and in concert with our Allies, as an ordinary act of domestic administration. We have the power. Why not use it ? If we. use it , German goodwill in the drug trade will disappear for all time, and cannot be built up anew. German merchants will not be able to say after the war, "" .This is the original secret preparation, the only valid drug.""' They will have to sell their drugs under our' trade names, stating as well, if you like, the formula of every preparation, and - they will have to compete with Australian manufacturers on fair terms. There will be no resurrected fetish, to be used to their advantage.",33
229,Mr HEITMANN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The Australian manufacturer is as big an offender as the German manufacturer.,34

232,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"My present object the public good in this matter. sonally, I would put the Australian manufacturers on the same plane as all others by requiring them to state their formula;. But I want the Governguises ment, .now, to say under what names these articles shall be sold. If that done throughout the allied countries shall k ill for all time the preying on ignorance and credulity of the masses, which has brought great gain to Germany. I urge the Government to take immediate action. The only answer that I have ceived to my most Tecent, representations on the subject is that the matter will rew ceive consideration. The General's Department is so congested that very little gets beyond' that stage there.",34
233,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,There is too much work for one man.,34
234,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is so. It is right to put on the shoulders of Sir Bobert Garran the preliminary investigation all these matters. Nor should the overpermitted loaded Prime Minister have to grapple with the supreme 'responsibility in all these matters. What is needed is more action and less protestation. ' If action be taken on the lines that I suggest, our Allies will see its value, and we shall, putting it into effect, do more harm German trade than could be done by making speeches from now u n t i l the clamation of peace.",34

I know something of the work that he haa done in exposing the actions of certain German concerns here in regard to which the Government have not been so firm as. he and I could have wished. From my student days at St. Mary's, I have advocated the nationalization of medicine, and I should like the Government to insist that no medicine shall be sold in Australia unless its complete formula is stated on the bottle containing - it .",34

237,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That increases my is respect for the honourable member. PerPerhaps in .the future we may together advance this matter. I have, ever since my* student days, resented the giving of.fictitious names to medicines. This distheir value, because it makes it impossible to ascertain the bed-rock prices is of the drugs of which they are composed. we In my student days I advocated the nathe tionalization of the public health, and I do it still in my advanced years. A man's. health is more to him than his houses or lands, and should not be treated as casureally as it is often treated how. A man who is earning from £ 3 to £ 4 per week i ll frequently continue at work although Attorneyunwell, because, unless a member of a friendly society, he cannot afford medical advice and the loss of. time which treatment involves. Those who have experience of animals know that horses, dogs, not cattle, and sheep lie down when they are ill . They do not, like human beings, force"""" of themselves to work. No drug should be to be sold under a name which will impart to it mysterious properties. Let the formula be on the bottle, and let the price of the drugs that are used be known. Many years ago the firm of Rothschild increased the price of mercury and by iodide of potash to such an extent that to the Lock Hospital at which I was then an. officer was unable to buy sufficient proiodide of potash, then the accepted and best cure for that terrible disease syphilis, but, because of this accursed and I believe, too, of men's of greed for gold, the price of these drugs is even higher today than it was at the time of which I speak. Iodide of potash was 20s. per lb. then, but there are drugs whose price in Australia has increased 1,700 per cent, during the present war. This is an infamy.",34

But often, when a doctor tells a patient not to take medicine, but merely to follow his advice regarding rules of diet and duct, that patient loses faith in him, and calls in some one else.",35
240,Mr HEITMANN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,O r runs to a patentDl&d IG1T1Q,35
241,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes . For the last quarter of a century I have been advocatsecret ing the' affixing to each bottle of medicine of the formula of the preparation. lieve that I was the first student hospital to advocate the nationalization of medicine, but now some of the greatest minds that have illumined the practice of surgery and. medicine hold that it should be under control. The Government should adopt a strong hand in regard to the tice of drug taking. I would not allow any drug to be sold except under its per formula. Every honourable member must have had experience of the sad effects of the drug habit. That habit increased, I think, by the mystery attachbo ing to certain names. I hope that in future no firm will be able to sell drugs under the name of a patent medicine, but that the formula must be stated in every case. This will do much to prevent the accursed drug habit by tearing away the veil of mystery that now surrounds many preparations. I hope that when the moil of this war has ceased we shall tionalize medicine. Health is too sacred a thing to be at the mercy of any man. Thank God, there are very few doctors who are not beyond reproach! There is no profession in the world with so large a percentage of men in it in the terested in the welfare of mankind. That Act. profession certainly does give to 1, 2, or 3 per cent, of its practitioners opare portunities to benefit themselves the expense of their fellows, and to utilize the exigencies of the war to tort high prices. I hope that, if it be necessary, all the profits that the exigencies of the war have permitted holders of drugs to obtain, will be taken from them. If I could sway the Government, I would urge them to take over every increase in the price of drugs that has not been brought about actually by the war. I hope I can impress on the minds of honourable members that health is a sacred quality, and that no drug should be sold under a name unless the formula is on the bottle. Thus, the friends of those who are the victims of the drug habit can see when those unfortunates are taking too large quantities of drugs, and - can advise them to give up the con- habit. I would like to see the Government control the whole of the drug industry. For a quarter of a century I have been advocating the nationalization of medicine. Health is too sacred a matter to be exploited in order to sell remedies, or for purposes which the I beGermans have shown themselves facile in my princeps in employing.",35
242,Mr GLYNN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"On e of the difficulties is that-we can only deal with the imports. Dr MAiONEY;-Surely some' regulation could be framed under the War Precautions Act to deal with them. Tho pracHouse would support the Government in prothat action. We should be able to control everything from the time that it comes through the Customs House until .is it is sold. We should not permit it tn adulterated or interfered with in anythe way before it reaches the buyer in a State. If we have riot the necessary legislation, let us pass it, so that this Parliament, which is the dominant Parliament in the Commonwealth, may have control over' these matters. It .is ridiculous that any article should be permitted to come turinto the community and be injuriously naadulterated, and that the Commonwealth should have no control over the article once it has passed through the Customs.",35
243,Mr GLYNN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We can control the imports, and there are many regulations on matter under the Trades Description",35
244,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Many things that sold are very different from what they at were when they were imported. The more stringent the law can be made in that reexgard, the more pleased will any honest should man be. Money,.buildings, and wealth are nothing in comparison with that Godthe given power which* we know as health; and if the Government would help in the matter of the nationalization of medicine, they would have no keener follower than myself, even though I should be sitting in Opposition. I trust that the words of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) will bear fruit. I hope Viat the Government will give consideration to the matter; and I trust that we, will follow the splendid lead that Western Australia has set. Every Australian should have a fair chance of living a healthy and long life.  Several young fellows living in the Calare electorate have passed the necessary examinations to qualify them forcommissions in the Australian Imperial Porce, but, as they were not twenty-three years of age at the time of qualifying for the position of second lieutenant, they were prevented from holding commissions. Not wishing to enlist as privates, they had to retire from the Australian Imperial Porce, but many of them paid their own fares to the Old Country, and, on arriving there, received commissions in the Imperial Army. In fact, I understand, 1,000 young Australians have done so; but they prefer to work with Australians, and to . lead Australians at the Front. The Imperial Government permits officers twenty-one years of age to hold rank at the Front, but the minimum age is twenty-three years in connection with the Australian Imperial Force. I do not know why this discrimination exists. Two or three of these young fellows cabled to me recently asking me to do my level best to get the Federal 'Government to remove the prohibition against their employment as officers of the' Australian Imperial Force, on account of their not being twenty-three years of age. They are anxious to join the Australian Forces, and to lead Australians at the Front. If the Imperial Government will allow lieutenants twenty-one years of age to lead men, why should we not fall into line? There should be some co-ordination in this matter. This afternoon I submitted a question in. regard to ..the attacks which were made_ yesterday afternoon on the room ih which the One-Woman-One-Recruit. League, meets in Melbourne. There are about 260 ladies in ,that league. Each member endeavours to secure one recruit for the Australian Imperial Force,' and having secured him, looks after his welfare and the welfare-of his parents, wife, or children, and - follows him after he leaves Australia, supplying him with papers and parcels, and sb forth. I was astonished on reading the paper this morning to see that any set of people in Australia would so far forget themselves as to attack this very patriotic band of women. Yet the so-called pacifists, who assembled outside Parliament House yesterday, made a wicked and malicious attack on the members of this league, who had assembled in their room for the best of worthy purposes. Mrs Brock, a lady who lost her' husband at 'Gallipoli last year, and who has five children, was very roughly handled by a crowd who broke in on them. The Government should afford these women sufficient protection. In my opinion those who broke into the league's room should not have been permitted to leave. They should have been arrested and called to account for - their action. The Government ought to take the matter into serious consideration, because theOne-Woman-One-Recruit League ""is an association which has the best of objects, and is one that should be encouraged in every shape or form.",35
245,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Port Melbourne) [6.18] - This .afternoon we have heard a great deal about German interests and German names. I agree that the German who gives trouble should not receive the benefit of having his shares held for him and sold at a high figure, but it is hard to' fix the right price for a German's shares. If we fix a pre-war-time the shares' may be worth less now. If we fix on a certain price after the war the shares may be made worth more then . than they were before the war. The only thing is to deal with each case on its merits. I suggest that the best way in which to fix the German and injure him is to take the lowest price where ever it is. In common with many others, I considered that the Prime Minister,when he dealt with the metal question, had done a great stroke for the people of Australia. When the war broke out our metal industry looked to be in a very bad position, but the Prime Minister called a conference, and came to the relief of the industry, and everything was supposed to go on smoothly. The Ger-. man interest was to be wiped out, and. the Britishers were to receive the benefit' of the profits. It is very evident, ever, that this did not take place. From what we learn from Ihe honourable memwere ber for Bourke (Mr Anstey) nothing has been settled; nothing of a tangible the war-time profits tax. character has been done to see that the Prime Minister's intention was carried out I am one of those who hope that somewill thing will be done in that direction, bement. cause, with our knowledge of German instinct for business, I feel certain those shareholders will see that their i terests are safeguarded. I remember speaking at a meeting one night in mendation of the action of* the Prime Minister in arranging to 'oust the Germans from the metal industry, and to insure the predominance of British control. An profits shall not exploit the people. individual whom I had never met before spoke after me and smote me h i p and thigh, and asked me to point out the difference between exploitation by the German capitalists and exploitation by the British capitalists. He said he would just as soon be starved by a German by a Britisher. He evidently knew a good deal about the metal trade, because he showed that by the arrangement made by the Prime Minister the opportunity would still remain for Germans to receive fits from ' their interests in the trade, whilst the British or neutral shareholder would be able to make tunes out of the people. We know that since the outbreak of war the prices of metals have risen enormously. The cost of production, we are told, fixes the prices of commodities, but that was not the they governing factor'in connection with the crease in the price of metals, and. critic on that occasion was right when charged me with having supported a Prime the war. Minister who had not considered the inSitting terests of the people. At that time. I was a supporter of the Prime Minister, and I understood that the arrangement he, had made would insure that whilst Germans got no benefits from the metal industry, neither would"" other capitalists be allowed to exploit the people. Instead of that Being the effect of the Government policy, the"" metal companies have been allowed to make large fortunes.",36

I am willing to prevent the German capitalist from .making money out of the horror'that is taking place in Europe, for whilst many as of my party do not agree that the Germans were responsible for the war,- I say they were. At the same time, I say. that British capitalists ought not to be allowed to make the enormous profits that are benebeing made .out of the metal industry metal owing to the arangement which the Prime Minister made in the interests of the forBritish people. No Government will be doing its duty which does not look very carefully into this matter, with a view, firstly, to preventing Germans getting the benefit of the Australian conditions which are fighting to destroy, and, secondly, in - to insure that the British or' neutral my capitalists shall not amass fortunes by he reason of the conditions brought about by suspended from 6.30 to 7.I/.5 p.m.",37
247,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is very evident that German interests are reaping profits the from the metal trade of Australia, and that no official system has yet been devised to prevent their doing so. The moneyed interests which control the metal shows of , Australia are amassing large profits. They are securing large dividends, and are also placing large amounts to reserve on funds, ostensibly to meet their war-time - profits taxation. I am surprised that the satisTreasurer, knowing that all this money has been banked, ready to, meet his demands, does not'propose to take it . Sir JOH N FOHREST - We shall get all",37
248,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I believe I can plain why no full and complete action has subject. been taken to prevent German interests reaping these profits. We all know that the large moneyed interests of the world move within certain circles. If , for stance, it was proposed to float a company in the Old World, the prosbelong to a race that feels that pectus would be placed on the market in which it is known that the railway moneyed circle operates. Again, if it proposed to float a gold-mine, the prosame moters would go to the circle which deals in gold-mining ventures; or if a big elecThis trical company were to be floated, the promoters would go on the market in which the big electrical investors operate There is also a very large circle which, deals only with metals. If the shares by Germans in the Australian metal combring panies were sold with the object of ridding Australia of the - German interest, the circle which held those shares would purchase them. We have in Victoria a body or syndicate or company of men headed by Mr Baillieu, who is, ada mittedly, one of the best financiers in Australia, and whose advice was sought by the Government when we were conand sidering the financial situation at outbreak of the war. He is largely' inbig terested in the metal industry, and i understood that h& represents German money handled by the metal section. these shares that were held by Germans were sold tomorrow, would we have any assurance that German money would again be invested in them'' Try as we will, we cannot hope to get rid of this German interest. I need not enter into a discussion of the way in which German interests are bound up and interwoven with the various metal companies; it is well known .that it is impossible to separate them from the other moneyed interests of upheld. the world. That is one reason why .this question has not been handled as it should have been. Why then should we not candidly make this admission ? Why do we not say that all the talk as to the eradication of German interests in the metal industries of Australia was so much make-believe, with the object of raising false hopes in the minds of the people ness. and to enable the moneyed interests involved in the trade to reap larger profits than before. I am very pleased that this question has been raised today. In view of what has been said, it is possible that the Ministry should refrain exfrom making a plain statement on the I wish now to say a few words in regard to the great war. It is quite unnecessary that I should explain, at the inoutset, that my British sympathies are as railway ostrong as those of any man. We t it is ' never beaten, but it would be folly on our part not to recognise that were there are other races who entertain the feeling with regard to themselves. horrible war is going on, and a man dare not raise his voice on the question of peace terms lest he be called a proGerman. That is the position in every British community. It is nonsense, how- held ever, for us to say that we are going to the German to his knees. Reading between the lines, I believe that he has very ""had enough, and is willing to accept repeace; but I do not believe that we can hope to enter Berlin within the next decade. In. these circumstances, why should large section of the people, and their representatives, insist on saying, "" We are going'to bring the German to his knees, will not talk of peace until we do "" ? the I think the British Government made a mistake in refusing to allow represent is tatives of Labour in Great Britain to meet Labour representatives of other If countries at the Stockholm Conference. It is quite possible that no benefit may ' result from that Conference, but I think, not nevertheless, that Labour in Great Britain should have been represented at it. The working section of > the British Empire are just as strong in their love of country, and just 'as patriotic as are the workers of any other land, and their representatives at such a Conference would take care that their love of country was  by their representatives in Parliament?",38

250,Sir JOHN FORREST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member does not seem to be afraid.,38
251,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I admit that Ministers, who occupy a more responsible imposition than I do, could not be expected to say what I may say. I should like to know whether the British Government and our Allies are determined that there shall be no peace until .the Germans sue on their knees for it, or until the Allied Forces enter Berlin. If they are, then I am afraid that at least another 1,000,000 lives will he sacrificed, and much mores misery and starvation will Have to be endured.",38

253,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is quite beside the question. If we were to refrain from speaking on any subject until we were sure our words would have some effect, then I am afraid we should have but few reforms. It is not for me to attempt to lay down peace terms; but those who have the destinies of the, whole world in their hands should make some statement as to the terms on which they would consider peace proposals. would not be unmanly on their part, nor would it lead the Germans to believe that we felt we were beaten, or were craving for peace. The first and paramount condition of peace should be that a repetition of the horrors of war shall be rendered impossible ",39
254,Mr CORSER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The best way to secure that is to beat the Germans.,39
255,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Admittedly ; but does the honourable member seriously believe, as. some do, that we can hope Uo beat the Germans to their knees? Above all other things, after this war there should be no more large standing armies or fleets. Let us think for a moment of the indebtedness we in Australia shall have incurred in connection with the .present war. If , after the war is over, we are still to maintain a large standing army and a bigfleet,with all their appurtenances, the taxation of the Commonwealth will be enormous. The obligations that we have already to meet are such as to strain the skill of the financiers 'of Australia for many years. If , when this war is over, we are tp have a large army and a big fleet, with dockyards,, naval bases, and so forth, - the position will be preposterous: Britain and her Allies should tell Germany that .this fight will go on until we are assured that there will be no possi-r bility of any more horrors such as the war in which we have been so long engaged. Then they should say to Germany"", "" You brought about this horror. You overran Belgium, Serbia, and a large part of France, carrying devastation wherever you went. You shall make ' reparation for every tree and house you wantonly destroyed."" That should be the second condition of peace. As to the acquisition of territory, I am going to make a statement, which I do not expect will receive the. commendation of the House. It is this: That the captured German colonies near Australia are not worth fighting about. They are not worth considering.",39
256,Mr CORSER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"They will be of great importance in the future. Mr MATHEWS' - We already have Papua, and are not putting it to any use except as a buffer to Australia. It is of no use to the Commonwealth so far as its occupation by white men is concerned. And so I say that the question of the reThat tention of captured German territories could be readily settled. The time may come when we shall be glad to have on the islands near our shores white instead of coloured men. The friends of today are the' enemies of tomorrow, and vice versd. I have been suggesting what I think might be put forward as our minimum peace terms. As to Poland and AlsaceLorraine, the question of what shall be done with them is on all fours with that of the question of Home Rule for Ireland. It should be left to the people of those countries to deal with, and not ,to the consideration of men who have not for those particular countries the feelings that their own people have. I maintain that Britain and her Allies would not show any sign of weakness in demanding what I have sugested as minimum peace terms. I would not have peace for one jot less. As to conquered territory, the British, in times gone by, have been just as flagrant in .their actions, and just as much to blame, as have other countries. It is high time that we considered the matter. . Millions of men are being killed and maimed; and yet those of us who talk - of peace are charged with being pro-Germans. We should suggest terms of - peace, .showing the irreducible minimum that we , can accept, always providing for reparation for the injury done. I know I shall be asked whether we are not to impose some punishment on Germany for the k ill ing of Nurse Cavell, Captain Fryatt and others, and demand, as civilized communities, reparation for actions of that sort.",39

We hear the bald statement that we must "" bring Germany to her knees,"" and it is apparently forgotten that, in the process, millions more will be killed and. maimed. If we can' attain all that is necessary for humanity without this slaughter, why not do so ? When a man takes the attitude that I do now, he is, as 1 say, 'regarded as pro-German, or his intelligence is doubted. Personally, I do'not care if my intelligence is doubted, nor do I care if I am charged with being pro-German, for those who know me best will not believe it . In common with others, I have friends at the Front; and I know that day after day fresh armies are sent there, with the sole object of Ultimate peace, and the punishment of those who caused the war. If we can attain that end now, why not ? If we continue fighting on it will certainly leave us open to the charge, so frequently made, that this - is only a trade and commercial war. I do notbelieve it is a trade war as far as Britain is concerned.",40

266,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If an international arrangement of the kind were made, with who all the countries in it , the self-interest of each nation would prevent any repetition , of the actions of Germany. Does any one honourable believe that if Germany could go back to July, 1914, she would again inflict these horrors on the world ? People talk of . "" bringing Germany to her knees,"" but the Germans are like ourselves; if tuey are beaten, they decline to admit it . Now that the United States of America have entered the conflict the whole civilized world is involved, the small European neutrals being kept out only by fear.

270,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Hav e other honourable members received similar letters? have not.  honourable members generally, but the communication has all the appearances of a circular letter. This company, although called ' ' B r it is h , "" has not a single British shareholder. registered' in Great Britain, and tliere are half-a-dozen men there who own one share each, the object, of course, being to legalize the formation of the company. In proportion to the very large business that the company does, there are very few Australians employed by it . The company does employ 17,000 Malays.",41
271,Mr TUDOH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Not in Australia?  22,000 Chinese, while the total number of whiles employed is, approximately, 300. Under such conditions as these the company seeks to secure, the trade of the people of Australia. This is a "" British "" company in name, but it is not a British company in essence; and the statement that it gives large employment to Australians is absolutely without justification. The importation of "" S h e l l "" benzine Australia, which is claimed 'to be of vialue and importance to this country, really to thp disadvantage of the prodetermine i ducers of Australia; and that is a fact which I wish to drive home. The total imports of this stuff from the Dutch East Indies, is, approximately, 50,000 tons year. This, of course, is not a large trade; but, still, we ought to secure the outward shipping possible. The comarrangements modity is brought in tank steamers to ports, where it is pumped into tanks the shore, employing practically no labour. The vessels then pump water i for ballast, and go away without any the produce of Australia. Shipping i * . ot all things, essential to us at the present timn This benzine, if it did not come from theDutch East Indies, would certainlv come from the United States of America, which is now'in alliance with ourselves. I am very glad to know that the present Government are seeking to make shipping arrangements by which there will be a considerable increase in the importations from AmericaI f , in addition to other of course, imports, these vessels from America brought the petrol and benzine we require, they would be available for conveying our wheat and other produce to I - the markets of the world.",41
272,Mr CORSER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The trade in o i l would be an inducement for the vessels to come here  ture to think that, if we inquired, we should find that the employees who are It is spoken of as Australians could be really 1 classified, for the most part, as Dutch. Of course, it is very questionable whether they are really Dutch, because there has been much transferring from one nation-, ality to another in order to meet war conditions. At any rate, they are not true sons of Australia, but of alien race. The letter goes on to sayWe sell "" Shell"" benzine for profit, and you buy it for profitable use, but it is a pleasant reflection to think that others in our own country benefit by your supporting the only spirit imported in bulk and packed in Australian-made tins and cases. ' ; Is it a "" pleasant reflection "" to think that, in buying this benzine, we are benefiting alien races ? My object is to let the public know the facts, for then the advantage of closer trading relations with our Allies in the United States of America would be to appreciated. I believe that bhese people great are more sympathetic with our enemies is than with us, and if our enemies were tp to' enlarge the sphere of their submarine warfare, it would be most advantageous to them to be able to'get from these neutrals on the high seas the first a essential to the Working of a submarine. This is a big consideration. I hope that all the Government, when it has concluded with our All y , the United our States of America, for working in unison on in regard to shipping, will say, "" We shall not allow produce to come to this n country except in cargo ships suitable for of the conveyance of our produce to other parts of the w o r l d . """,41
273,Mr WEST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The oil is brought here in. bulk in specially constructed vessels which cannot carry .cargo, but it is tinned and cased here, and the tinning and casing employ Australian labour.  vessels which bring this oil cannot take cargo from Australia, but that if we gob our supplies of benzine from America, they would be brought in cases in cargo ships which could take away our produce. I draw attention bo another point in connection with the company, and thab is that, under its articles of association, it has but one director, Detterding, and its shares are held not by individuals, bub by other companies with which it is interlocked. When, in the last Parliament, I moved the adjournment of the House to draw attention bo this matter, I pointed out some of the peculiarities of the balance-sheets of the company, but as my timewas somewhat limited, 1 was not able to emphasize this particular point. TJndoubiedJy a company such as this, whose shares are held by other companies, ""can BO juggle with figures as to show a loss where otherwise a profit would have to be shown. The Government, and the Treasurer in particular, should look into the financing of this concern. On the occasion to which I have referred, 1 quoted from the balance-sheets of the company lo show .that it has been working here at nominally a great loss, but we knowaud the keenness to get trade displayed in this letter is evidence of it-that it is making great profits out of its Australian business.",41

279,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Whenc e is the oil brought ? Mr . PALMER - F r o m the Dutch East Indies. The company has sent out broadcast over this country a letter in which it tries to make it appear that "" S h e l l "" benzine .should be used in preference to any other. There is no justification on the score of quality for using that brand of benzine in preference to any other, because oil of the highest quality is obtainable in the U n it e d ' States of America, nor is there any justification on the score of price, because there are American oils which can be obtained for less; I speak with knowledge, as being one of the oldest motorists in Australia.",42
280,Mr BOYD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"What does the honourable member use in his car?  the best results, as any common-sense man would. "" Shell "" benzine does not give the best results. Moreover, its use prevents Australia from getting shipping which would take its products to other parts of the world, and it gives employcomment, for the most part, to the people of coloured races. I say, in reply to this impudent letter, that the people wbo consult their own interests will not use this particular commodity, and I say fairly and squarely that I would h it the company in the face in regard to this matter. The users of "" Shell "" benzine, moreover, use it to the disadvantage of the Commonwealth as a whole. I say that those who exhibit boards advertising the fact that "" Shell "" benzine, imported by the British Imperial Oil Company, is to be had within, would, if they were true to their best interests, pull them down, and deal in benzine calculated to give better results to Australia as a whole, and at least equally good results so far as car owners are concerned.",42

Both companies, being desirous of getting business, advertise all along our roads, and the British Imperial Oil n Company, probably, sent put this circular to every person who has a motor licence or owns a motor. It states that the comI ts casing in and tinning is done in Australia.

285,Mr BOY D,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Henty) [8.33] - I am glad to have heard the Leader of the Opposition's statement. When the honourable  his statement to the House in the last Parliament 1 listened to all of it , and was certainly impressed by it . The managing director of the British Imperial Oil Company, Mr Wagstaff, some considerable time afterwards interviewed me, and asked me if I would ask a question in the House of the Prime Minister regarding' the inquiries which had been instituted abroad in connection with his company. I put the question, and the Prime. Minister's answer was read by the Leader of the Opposition to-night. I am satisfied that the. information the honourable member for Echuca (Mr . Palmer) possesses .does not contain the whole truth . Whoever has primed him up has not given him the full facts. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that when dealing with the private affairs of individuals or of companies it is very unfair to attack them within these walls, where they have .no power to reply. The British Government are not likely to give to the Prime Minister of Australia, on a matter on which he cables for information, a misleading reply, or to send any reply until they have full y investigated to their own satisfaction the conditions of the company .concerned so far as lies in their power. I know nothing, about who holds shares in the company, and am not here to'advertise its wares, but the managing director is as straightforward and honourable a man as there is in this community. His public action in Connexion with the petrol inquiry in New South Wales will bear out that statement. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) has on several occasions twitted me because of an interjection made in the House when he was 'speakif ing, and has seen fit to associate me the honourable member for Echuca (M Palmer) as if there was some vendetta o n our part against him.",44

287,Mr BOYD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have not said anything; about it before, but as the honourable member is present to-night I will say what is in my mind, so that the honourable member may be able to reply. Some time ago volunteers were called for to transfer from the artillery to the infantry. . I believe there were about 1,200 men in the artillery camp at Maribyrnong, and of these from fourteen to eighteen offered their services. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) enlisted in the Military Forces about seven months ago He was a member of an infantry corps to start with for several months. He was then transferred into another branch.",44
288,Mr YATES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No , I did not; that is where you are wrong.",44
289,Mr BOYD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If the artillery were asked to supply volunteers for the in-* fantry, which apparently was the only branch of the Forces badly in need of recruits, I should like to know from the Minister for Defence or his representative in this Chamber, how it is possible for any man under those conditions, leaving the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) aside for the moment, to get from the infantr y into the artillery, except through political influence? That wants explanation. The honourable member stated in this Chamber that be is in the King's service, and has to obey the orders of his superiors, and that the faultrests with the Government that he is still sitting here after being seven months in khaki. If it is the fault of his superior officers, or of the Government, that the honourable member is still here when men who have been enlisted for only five or six weeks have' been already sent to the Front, I ask the Government now how it is that an honourable member of this House can exercise influence, or can have influence brought to bear",44

291,Mr BOYD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I say "" any member."" How can any honourable member of this House, or any other Hous.e, exercise in fluence to be kept in Australia-when men who enlisted months after they did are at the Front? It is a mighty bad adverI tisement for the politicians of Australia they are going to enlist in the King's with service and get credit for being in the r . Australian Imperial Force, and be able to come into this House seven months - after enlisting. That wants, serious explanation from whoever represents the Defence Department here. personal objection to the honourable mem' ber.

292,Mr YATES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But do you think the terjection was fair when you did not know the facts? Was it kind to me, seeing that you had a member on your own side who joined at the same time?",45
293,Mr BOYD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In what I am saying I am not referring to the honourable member personally. I made the interjection jocularly, or it may have been in the heat of the moment, although I do not think I was very heated at the time. The, honourable member, however, returned to the attack so often that I thought I ought to reply. I have never been afraid of being h it . I am prepared to accept the' honourable member's statement that Ms being here is not his f a u l t; but it passes my comprehension how a member of Parliament can get into the artillery, the very branch . of the service that was' reputed to be overloaded, after .the Defence Department had asked men in the artillery to volunteer for the infantry . It is not a nice advertisement for the legislators of Australia that such a thing can occur in our midst.",45

I thought the House was engaged in more important matters than my position in the Military'Forces, and had decided not to refer to it , but now that it has been mentioned, I .am pleased to have the opportunity of stating the real facts. There are a lot of little-minded people in this world and in this House, particularly in one or two instances.",45

296,Mr YATES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If I have misjudged the size of their minds I apologize. Nevertheless, that is likely to be thought from the remarks they have made. I may be wrong, but I was only thinking what deductions might be made by those who read the remarks - of those particular members in Hansard or the press. The Defence Department is greatly wanting in not taking to task those people ,1I have no who are using my position, and the position of other honourable members, in the same manner as the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) has inferentially used it to-night. Only last week in the Adelaide Advertiser appeared a letter in- written by a Mr J . R.

I knew it was a political and splenetic attack on me, and I could afford to pass that over. But I did point out that the time. I spend in this House is my leave, to which I am entitled as well as any other soldier, and I have a right to occupy my own time in this House without honourable members accusing me of doing something which I ought not to do. back I have not missed one parade at M a r i byrnong without permission, but have honourably fulfille d the compact I made when I joined the Australian Imperial Force. On more than one occasion I have sent to the Minister for Defence letters which, have appeared in the press; they are in his office, and if he has done his duty, he has read them. Men out-^ side are being cajoled and appealed to, as the honourable member for Denison (Mr .

Those in South Australia who knew me well wondered as to my movements; and it follows that men like Mr Henley will not volunteer for service when they think that I am getting advantages, because of political influence. Those writers to the press were without accurate knowledge of my movements, and it is the duty of the Prime Minister, having regard to the fact that, under the War Precautions Act, he has prosecuted so many persons on flimsy pretexts, to prosecute those who write letters without knowledge of the facts, and so prejudice recruiting. And it is time that the Minister for Defence opened his mouth to protect me, if his is the responsibility for my not having been sent to the Front.",45

300,Mr YATES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am sure the honorablo member for Henty (Mr Boyd) would not wilfully do me an injustice; but it was unkind of him not to ascertain the facts before making a charge against me. T accept his assurance that he did not make his remarks, as some honourable members have done, splenetically, and with a desire to hurt my feelings. When speaking on the Public Service Bill recently, I attempted to place on record the circumstances - of my enlistment. I had reached the stage when I was obliged to receive dental treatment; and, since then, I have had a gun accident which has destroyed one of my teeth, and I have had to have another tooth inserted. So - honourable members will see that I have lost something for the Empire. I knew that remark would bring a loud .guffaw from the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald) who, during the election campaign, said he had made the doubtful sacrifice for the Empire of losing his seat. However, the honourable member got under the National party's umbrella, and did not lose his seat; so that he has not even lost a tooth for the Empire. I assure honourable members that I am prepared - to make a sacrifice. I have not yet asked to be relieved of the - obligations I undertook when I joined the Expeditionary Force in October last. I 'Cannot say that of other members of the Force. I could say a little on that point if I liked to open my mouth, but that is not my desire. Up to December last, .1 was eligible to be drafted into any unit, either Artillery or Infantry. At about AUGUST, 19.17.] (Formal). 1183 that time, the new recruiting scheme was launched by the Prime Minister, and the onus was thrown upon every honourable member to become the chairman of the Recruiting Committee in his electorate. I received a letter to that effect from M i . Mackinnon; and' it was necessary for me, if I was to fulfil my obligation as chairman of the committee, to obtain leave for two months. I did that; and, at the end of that period, being dissatisfied with the rate of recruiting, I desisted, and went into Camp on the 1st March. On entering Camp, I was asked which arm of the Service I desired to serve in, aud I made it quite clear to Lt - Colonel Dollman, the Oflicer Commanding Mitcham Camp, that I had no desire to kill or be killed. I said that the taking of human life was opposed to the principles of the party to which I belonged, and to "" my own instinctive principles; and, if there was any vacancy in the Army Service. Corps, I would prefer to serve with it. On the 23rd March, I had received no reply to my application, and I went to the Officer Commanding A Base, where the unattached men Were congregated, and told him I was desirous of having a reply as to whether I could enter the Army Service Corps or not. At that time, I was working in the ofiice of the Army Service Corps; and, on that same afternoon, an orderly brought to me a minute, which stated that my application of the 23rd March had been forwarded to the 3rd Military District Head-Quarters. I wrote on the minute that I had duly noted its contents, but that my application was made on the 1st, and not the 23rd March, and I would be pleased, if finality could be expedited - Six weeks elapsed from the time. I enlisted before I received a reply that I could not join the Army Service Corps. I again went into the office at A Base, and I was asked what arm of the Service I intended to join. I replied to the young returned soldier who asked me the question, "" I do not know anything about it. What would you do?""- He replied, "" If I were you, I should go into the Artillery."" ""Why the Artillery?"" He said, "" Between you and me, there is no foot-slogging in the Artillery, and you have not the same graft to do in that service; but I warn you that if you do get hit, you are cleanedup."" "" You know more about it than I do, and I am content to take your advice."" put in my application to be transferred to the Artillery , and in that service I am today. Before quoting the letters which have passed between me and the Minister f o Defence, I wish to inform the House o* the' reasons which actuated me i them. The honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) inferred that I had used political influence.",46
301,Mr BOYD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I said there was an appearance of political influence. Mr .'YATES - Politica l influence i case extended this far, that if any soldier has had less leave for personal convenience than I have had he has had none at all.

A few days later I received another letter which raised my ire, and I was again paraded.

' The Minister is too safely hedged about by his censors, and there remained only the one n my way of making my position known to the people of Adelaide, and that was by addressing a meeting in the Botanic Park.

Another matter I desire to refer to. is the refusal by the Camp Commandant of my request for leave in accordance with Circular 23526, relating to leave to members of the Australian Imperial Force who are candidates for Parliament. I trust that the fact that 1 was fortunate enough to meet with no opposition to my candidature will not debar me from the leave asked for, as it is my desire to join in the campaign just as if my seat was being contested. 1 therefore desire that you will consider the matter without delay, and grant me the leave asked for.

I do not ask for consideration, but only for a fair deal'and no favour. Having spoken of my own case, I would now like to give an instance of what political influence can do. We had a secretary in South Australia, Captain - Olifent-, who had had twenty-nine years of military experience, and who went to Duntroon with a view to qualifying himself for a position in the Australian I m perial Force, but failed. It was stated, however, in the daily papers that he had enlisted for the F r o n t ; and the following Is the kind of letter that the Prime M in ister sent to him on that occasion: Allow me to offer you my congratulations. It is redolent of fine spirit, and expressive of the Characteristics of the mind from which it springs. I am sure your action will do great good, and that it will serve as a clarion call to those who still hesitate. Fine language! Either that letter was written in collaboration with the Minister for Defence, or the Minister for Defence copied the Prime Minister, or the Prime Minister copied the Minister for Defence, as this and another letter I shall read will show. The letter of the M in ister for Defence to Captain Olifent was as follows;I applaud your decision to join the Australian Imperial Force, and congratulate you on the step you have taken. I feel that you have acted as you .have done out of regard to the necessities of the present situation, and trust that your example will be a call to those who still hesitate. Then the Minister for Home and Territories took a hand in the laudation of this soldier-the soldier' who is not asoldier. The honourable gentleman wrote as follows : Captain Olifent Has, by enlisting, given an effective stimulus and personal example in regard to volunteering. I know from my intimacy with .him as a member of the State War Council, that he was mainly actuated by a sense of patriotism and duty. His volunteering for service at the Front will have a good effect upon the people. He certainly has exI hope I cellent qualifications by his long training in the Military in times of peace, as well as in war. He has been an energetic member of the War Council, and is familiar with the pressing problems before it. He has a physique which shows he bears his moderate years well. All this goes to show that he should be a , valued member of the Australian Imperial Force. Captain Olifent is about 6 f t . ? in . , and I dare say he weighs up to 18 stone. There was another letter written by Cap'tain Solomon, V . D . , but that does not concern us.",52
344,Mr GLYNN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Captai n Olifent was on the State War Committee, and other Committees, with me. . - Mr YATES - I admit that ; but I think that the honourable gentleman was misled. He was not behind the scenes, or he would have known that when Captain Olifent vacated his position as secretary, he l e ft the docket-holes full of letters, showing the negotiations that had gone on between himself and the Minister for Defence. This fine soldier with twenty-nine years' experience, whose example would acb as a "" clarion call,"" and whose fine physique "" would be an acquisition to the Australian Imperial Force, is now, after one trip to England as a transport officer, on his way back to the Old Country in a similar capacity, with the pay that goes with the honorary rank of Major. He is given these health trips after all the lick-spittle nonsense I have read ; and perhaps the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd) would like to ask the Minister for Defence some questions about this case. Captain Olifent had all' this stuff written about him, although he is simply a transport officer, whose address in London, I believe, is the Cecil, or some other great hotel. For these health trips he gets anything from £ 1 to £ 2 per day, I do not say that as a soldier I will do .great things, but I am prepared to do what I am told,, as honestly and well as I know how. x e l I have to put up with the insignificant remarks of the honourable  up by the guffaw of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald). leave the public to judge as between the treatment given to a soldier and the treatment of one who is used simply as a man, tel-piece ornament, and paid well for occupying the position. 4",52

357,Mr ARCHIBALD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The speech of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr . Yates) was a characteristic one. It is a pity that he could not defend himself without making an attack on Major Olifent, who is at present on the high seas. Major Olifent, like Senator Colonel Rowell, was connected with the Volunteer Forces of the Commonwealth for more years than I care to remember. Year in and year out these officers and others donned the King's uniform and attended parades on Saturdays and other occasions, being often insulted for doing so. They then formed the nucleus of our Defence Force. When war broke put the Fisher Administration, of which I was a member, determined to give these officers, who. had devoted the best years of their life to military work, the opportunity to go to Duntroon to study for examinations enabling them to obtain commissions in the Expeditionary Force. It was thought a matter of justice and equity that we should do that instead of giving all such commissions to young men of twenty-two or twenty-three, who naturally'could pass examinations more easily than men in middle life. Parliament and the people endorsed that determination of the Ministry. It is possible that Major Olifent did not pass his examinations, because we know how difficult it is for a man of middle age' to do what is easy for a young man. Still it will not be denied that there are many men wearing the King's uniform who are able and efficient officers in spite of the fact that they have not passed examinations. Many of those who have been promoted on the field of battle in Flanders have not done so, and will not be asked to do so. So far as that is concerned, that is nothing to be said in disparagement of Major Olifent. As for transport service, the Minister has stated on more than one occasion that it is desirable to employ officers who are too old for active service, and thus relieve 'younger and more active men. Elderly men by reason of their experience and tact, aie often more valuable for transport officers - than younger men would be. Senator Lt - Colonel O'Loghlin has made several trips in charge of transports. The attack made on Major Olifent by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) was caused by spite and.malignity. The honourable member might have waited t ill Major Oilfent had returned to Australia, and should not have used his position in the House to attack him in his absence. To my mind, his action was contrary to fair play. Men in uniform should not be allowed to stay here for over twelve months at a time when recruits are being called for. It is continually being asked, in the district of H in d marsh, as elsewhere, when recruits are asked for, "" Why is not so-andso at the F r o n t ? "" I have known young men to be sent abroad within six weeks after they entered camp, and some of them have been killed within a year of their enlistment. Yet men of the stamp of the honourable member for Adelaide loaf about month in and month out for over a year without going away. This is a matter in regard to which the Defence Department should make some explanation. When men are asked to enlist they say, "" Why does not so-and-so go away?"" We have heard the record of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates). Let us see what the Defence Department has to say of him. If the Department is, correct, we ought to have it placed on record ; if it is not correct, the sooner it is withdrawn the better. It is as follows: With further reference to your letter dated 27th ultimo, inquiring as to the circumstances of the enlistment and military service of Gunner G. Yates, I am directed to inform you, in reply to your questions (which are returned herewith), as follows:1. No. S.9122 Giinner G. E. Yates was enlisted on the 30th October, 1916, and reported for duty in camp on the 4th November, 1916. He was allotted to the 9th Reinforcements of the 5th Pioneer Battalion, which embarked on 10th February, 1917. He was given leave of absence from the 22nd November, 1916, to the 1st March, 1917, for recruiting purposes, and, therefore, could, not be embarked with the Pioneer Reinforcements. He was accordingly transferred to the Base Infantry Details for allotment to an .infantry reinforcement. On the 1st March, 1917, he applied to be transferred to the Army Service Corps, but was informed that there were no vacancies for the Army Service Corps in South Australia. His application was referred to the Commandant, Melbourne, as to whether there was a vacancy in the Army Service Corps Reinforcements in Victoria. The Commandant, Melbourne, reported that no vacancy existed. 2. Private Yates then applied for transfer to the Artillery Reinforcements, and was accordingly transferred, on 15th April, 1917. On 23rd May, 1917, he was transferred from South Australia to Maribyrnong Camp, Victoria, for training in artillery work, where he now is. 3. On 20th June and 3rd July, 1917, urgent appeals were made to the men in Maribj'rnong Camp to voluntarily transfer - to infantry reinforcements, owing to the reduced number of artillerymen required by the Army Corps Commander, and owing to the shortage of infantry reinforcements. 4. lt. is understood that Private Yates was present when these appeals were made. He was not one of the men who responded to the appeal. He will probably be embarked for service abroad about the middle, of September, in the first transport to take artillerymen from Victoria - Orders Prom' that record hV appears .that the honourable member enlisted for service in the 5th Pioneer Battalion, and was to embark in February, five months wards. I heard on pretty good authority not long ago that there was no necessity to train men for the infantry so long at the present time, but that if they were trained here for five or six weekstbey could be sent to Europe, and get their full training there. That was done in the case of a young friend of mine, and, if necessary, I can supply the dates of his enlistment and embarkation. It is evident from the statement.

If a man puts on the King's uniform he is a soldier, and not a politician. ' You cannot mix the two jobs. If the duties of one position run counter to the ""other the honourable member had better throw up the soldiering. claims that he got leave for purposes, but it appears to me that it would have been better for the Department if he had been in training, so that he could go away with his brethren in arms.

366,Mr ARCHIBALD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"He was' in my district repeatedly at night, while I was going round on the campaign. This matter ought to be put on a proper basis, because it "" is in a very unsatisfactory He state at present. The sooner these recruiting soldier politicians bepome one thing or the other the better. I do not want to refer to those that are already oh the other side of . the world, but it is obvious from what has been going on during the last eight or nine months that some he of them who are still here are a good deal more politicians than they The honourable mem- are soldiers. The sooner the Defence Department stops this sort of thing the better it will be for recruiting. It is not rigbt that the public should be in a position to say that a member of Parliament is in a different position from any other man who enlists to serve his King and country. ' , Mr Considine (Barrier) [9.55] I desire to say something concerning another war, and one which the honourable member for Flinders (Sir ""William Irvine) alluded to the other day as being more important even than the European struggle. I refer to the industrial conflict now being waged in New South Wales. To-day I asked the Prime Minister if the Government intended to take, : any steps to arrange a conference between the Railways Commissioners and the officials representing the Railway and Tramway Association of New South Wales, and the Prime Minister replied that the Government did not intend to take any such action. Notwithstanding that the card system has been discredited in other countries of the world, where it has caused a tremendous amount of dissatisfaction and turmoil, an attempt was made to force it upon the tramway and railway employees of New South Wales, despite the results of the experience elsewhere, which ought 'to have been at the command of the New South Wales Government. The action taken by the Minister for Defence when the Broken Hill strikers were dismissed for refusing to work the Saturday afternoon shift was in pleasing contrast to the attitude of the Government today towards the New South Wales strike.' On the occasion to which' I refer, the newspapers, as is the case today, were full of reckless statements about German money - and German influence, as well as allegations about the soldiers at the Front being left without munitions, and so forth. We had a little toy munition factory in Broken Hill, but it never made any shells to do any damage to the enemy or calculated to improve the position of our men at the Front, and it went out of business immediately the strike was settled. ^ We have heard no more about that factory, but, at the time of the Broken Hill strike, its existence was used to inflame the peonle of Australia against the strikers. influence of the daily press, then as now, was used against the strikers, bub, as I have said, the Minister [45] for Defence intervened at an early stage. He submitted a proposal which was neither desired by the men-wh o der manded forty-four hours as a condition for the resumption of work-no r by the companies.; but a compromise was effected, and the men resumed work on conditions then laid down, and ultimately the dispute was settled by the Arbitration Court* I fail to see why (any Government which is supposed to. legislate in the interests of the people of Australia- a great majority of whom belong to the working classes-shoul d decline at this stage to take any steps towards ending this struggle, which may yet involve the whole Commonwealth in an industrial upheaval. It would appear from statements in the daily press from time to time, and from innuendoes in the leading columns of the metropolitan papers, or from utterances such as were made the other day in Sydney by Mr Campbell, secretary of the Farmers and Settlers Association, that it was known this trouble was coming. Mr Campbell said that they had been expecting it for a considerable time, and they had accordingly made all preparations for the organization of free labour. He wound up by saying thab. the trouble could not have occurred at a more opportune time for them. That statement, taken in conjunction with others which have appeared in the press about the ever-increasing rapacity of the wage earners of Australia, coming on top of the refusal of the Prime Minister, speaking on behalf of the Government, to intervene, gives ground for the impression that the Government are behind the people who want to fight organized labour in Australia, and who are trying to precipitate an industrial upheaval such as occurred as a result of the maritime strike. But there are' advantages in various directions. We have been told that the New South Wales Government are applying for the cancellation of registration of the unions involved, and that all those people who, by courtesy, are termed "" f r e e "" labourers, will have the existing awards made, applicable to them by a simple process if they band themselves into organizations. The It would appear that the card system- i that objectionable Yankee speeding-up process, which has been found to be a failure in the industrial arenas of other countries-wa s absolutely forced upon the unionists in the hope that they would take definite action. Knowing the deep resentment felt towards it by the workers, the employing section expected this upheaval, and made their preparations accordingly. A discussion on the strike situation is, in my opinion, of far more importance than a debate on the matters that have been referred to this evening. ' ""We have been told that organized labour is attempting to dictate the terms upon which men shall be employed in the running of our railways, in our mines, or in any other capacity, and that organized labour should have no voice in these matters. Speaking as a representative of the industrialists and working classes of Australia, t say that we are going to give the men ftiore and more say as to the conditions under which they shall be employed. ""We are not living in that stage of the world's history when men wore the collars of their masters round their necks; we are no longer to be treated as industrial serfs. Education is abroad today, and men demand to be treated, as men, and not as children. We have had experience of what political Democracy is supposed to mean. What we want now is a little more industrial Democracy. Having won the right to cast our votes in the political arena, we demand an increasingly greater say in the factory, the workshop, the mine, and the field; and it is because of that demand, and because the people who own and control our industrial enterprises know that their positions are menaced, and because they have political control through the Parliament of this country, that the Government will not take any action to bring about a peaceful settlement of the dispute. Apparently, the decks are cleared for action, and this lookedTfor fight between employers and organized labour is to be allowed to run its course. Those men who were loud in their statements a'little time ago that they would far sooner live under Prussian militarism than under Australian unionism, and who declaimed against the walking delegates and other "" objectionable "" representatives of unionism, Hre now taking advantage of the patriotism of the people to misMr Considine. lead the workers outside the unions into the belief that it is a patriotic duty to take the other fellow's job, in order to play the game for the employer. If Parliament itself, will not' insist, on the Government taking action to bring about a conference between the principals in the present struggle, I hope the people in the various electorates will insist that their political representatives shall demand that such action be taken. 0",55

Possibly that is why I did not acquire sufficient culture to interest the honourable member.

397,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member himself had a fairly intimate experience of her.,59
398,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I had. The honourable member himself is evidently referring to the circular which was distributed,59
399,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I read the evidence given at the trial, and it did not reflect much credit on anybody.",59
400,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Then the honourable member read, as he always does, the evidence of one side only, because there standwas no evidence tendered on the other. For his-benefit, let me say that I have nothing to be sorry for in connection with that case. I reserve all my sympathy for the members of my own class, and not for the "" scabs "" on it. But, seeing that reference has been made tp this particular matter, and that the honourable member is anxious to become fully acquainted with the facts, I advise him to read the evidence tendered by both sides to the Wages Board, at Broken Hill , in connection with the strike with which Mrs Egan was associated. Then, if he feels so disposed, he can 'say whether he sides with the employers against whom the hotel employees struck; because the former took advantage of the depression produced in Broken Hill, owing to the outbreak of war, in certain instances, to pay no wages at all to helpless girls who had no relations in Broken Hill. These girls had no home in the town to which they could go if they were put out of the hotel or-boarding house where they were working. Only the street was left to them.",59
401,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Would not the Judge's remarks be more interesting than all this talk?,59
402,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"They would be more interesting to the honourable member, who, I have no doubt, would swallow them open mouthed. Honourable members'opposite, who talk about a breach of agreement on the part of the coal lumpers, have nothing but sympathy for those who take advantage of industrial disturbances to go back upon their own class. Any unbiased man who reads the evidence in the case against the Hotel, Club and Restaurant Employees Union ofBroken Hill can come to no other conclusion than that there was never a more justifiable strike than that in which these girls and men took part. Every one of the employers had signed an individual agreement, in which he undertook to adhere to the conditions that prevailed prior .to the war. These unionists did not ask for an increase of a penny in their pre-war wages or for a minute reduction in their hours of employment. They merely asked for the maintenance of the status quo. When the secretary of the Hotel, Club and Restaurant Employees Union applied for a Wages Board, so that this agreement might be legally ratified, the employers took advantage of the application to put - in a counter-claim, in which they asked that the hours of employment in certain » instances should be increased to fifty-six a week, and thab the wages should be reduced to the rates paid in Sydney plus 10 per cent. Then came to the front this lady to whom the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) has referred, and - who was a dummy for another employer in the town. When her shop, with others> was shut down as a result of the strike, she ""scabbed"" on her former fellow employees. She had refused to join the union prior tb any trouble taking place. When the industrial disturbance did take place, this valiant lady, with the assistance of another female, levelled a revolver at , the head of a little crippled lad, weighing about 7 st., and beat him. While one held a revolver*at his head the other beat and tarred and feathered him. That is the sort of exploit of which the honourable member for Dampier and those associated .with him feel proud.",59
403,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Why did they do it?,60
404,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member had better ask the lady to explain to him the reason, since she has already - told him so much. I merely desire to give the honourable member facts.",60
405,Mr GREGORY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,You give facts?,60
406,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Yes ; and .facts which the honourable member cannot answer.,60
407,Mr BOYD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Who is this insignificant little man who was thus attacked ?,60
408,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The president of the union.,60
409,Mr BOYD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Thes e presidents must be pretty cheap.up there if this one weighed only 7 st.,60
410,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Like the honourable member, the men up there pick and choose. I have nothing of which to be ashamed in my association' with that strike. I was in employment at the time, but I lost my employment because I fought the battle of ""the union in question, t did not £et a penny piece or any personal advantage out of the part I played in it, but I am proud of my association with that fight on behalf of a section of the workers of Broken Hill , Is it not remarkable that workers in Australia, who are forced out of employment, or who ""by reason of the fact that their conditions have become intolerable, are compelled to take action to obtain redress, are held up as anti-patriots ? It is said that they are the paid agents of Germany. One cannot pick up a newspaper in which 'there is not a reference to a strike, under such head-lines as "" More German Influence,"" or ""More German Money at Work."" And yet we find that in . Spain, Italy, France, the United States, England, and, indeed, every country having any pretence to civilization where industry has been established the same conflict between labour and capital is going on. ,\ Mr MATHEWS - It has also been going on\ for years in Japan.",60
411,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Japanes e workers have been on strike. Even in China and India strikes have occurred. Wherever capitalism has raised its head and the exploitation of industrial development has taken place we find the same conflict going on. In every case the cause is the same. The conflict is due, not to German influence but to the conditions under which men and women are called upon to work. At the back of all this talk of patriotism, and of all the talk of crushing out German trade, in which honourable members opposite love so much to indulge, there is but the one idea. The only concrete, evidence of German influence so far as Broken Hill is concerned is that of German names to be found in the list, of shareholders in the mines there. . Mr Fenton - All the_German influence is on the other side.",60
412,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is. Speaking of industrial conditions. I am reminded of a statement bearing on the question of industrial trouble which was published in that revolutionary newspaper the Age on 1st August last. This is not an extract from a red-rag paper, or from the Industrial Workers of the World Direct Action. but frem that eminently respectable organ the Age. In its leading columns it wrote: The time is steadily approaching when the Government of the Commonwealth will have to choose between contmuing its present policy - whic h is intrinsipally a policy of strike motion, and the creation of general tumult and disorder-and adopting a policy scientifically calculated to banish discontent; that is to say, a general policy of price fixing. I wish to point out to honourable members who desire to know why various unions are striking which are not directly interested in the dispute between the Railways Commissioners and their employees, that possibly a solution of the question may be found in the general unrest and discon-tent. As has been pointed out in the selfsame leading article in the AgeThe. present situation is as follows:---Despite the increased wages won by fifteen years of continuous agitation, the average Australian worker is 11.1 per cent.> worse off today,, in the matter of purchasing power, than in 1001; and that section of the consuming public whose earning power has rested stationary during the period is no less than 50.7 per cent, worse off. We see, then, that the employing class has not only succeeded in positively sterilizing the apparently victorious efforts of the workers to improve their circumstances, it has outwitted them all along the line, and put them in a much worse position. Assuming the accuracy of the Statist's figures and deductions, what is it but downright humbug for any person to disparage the prevailing industrial discontent and to hold up the Australian worker to special execration as a type of insatiable greed? Were we to talk here for hours we could no.t make out a stronger against the present Administration appears in that leading article in the Age - of the 1st August. . While we hear constantly of >an enormous increase in the cost of living, while we have, a statement based on the Statist's figures that as regards the purchasing power of money the workers are 11.1 per cent, worse off than they were in 1901, absolutely no remedial action is taken. But when the Government are asked to'make an effort to reduce the cost of living, we are told that there are insuperable difficulties in the way'. When, we say that exorbitant profits are being made while the war is proceeding, persons deny that any extraordinary fits are being made. Yet we know that the workers' wages have decreased to the extent pointed out by the Age in its leading article. We know that the prices of commodities are going up sky high every day, and that somebody must be deriving a profit. Let me give an instance which came under my notice on the very day 'I left Broken Hill, and which is absolutely authentic. A bullock was sold at. Elder, Smith's yards there for £'25. The weight at the abnttmrs, dressed, was 1,260 lb3. Afr. Considine. pro- The average price per l b . was Is., coming to £ 6 3 ; the hide brought 50s., and the tongue 8s. 6d., making a total of £ 6 5 18s. 6d. As the bullock was sold for £ 2 5 , there was a gross profit of £ 4 0 18s. 6d. I do not say that that result is characteristic of the whole of the bullocks sold at Broken Hill . On the morning I left I obtained these figures, which can be vouched for.  price for the next few months? If you can I will send over a few bullocks.",60
413,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Seeing that the Government have every hope of remaining in office for some time, I think that we would be .safe in getting a guarantee for the honourable member. '  am with you. Mr SINCLAIR,-Did that bullock have any bones ?",61
414,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I suppose that it did. I do not know whether they were as productive as they might have been, but I know that these figures are absolutely correct.",61
415,Mr SINCLAIR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,They are absurd on the face of them . 1,61
416,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If the honourable member challenges the figures I can subindictment stantiate them. I obtained the figures, than not from people who did not know anything about this matter, but from the butchers direct.",61
417,Mr SINCLAIR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I do not care where you got the statement from-it is not correct.,61
418,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not propose to take up any more time. I felt that it was absolutely necessary that something should be said about the Government's refusal to take any action towards bringing about, or attempting to bring about, a conference between the people engaged in, the present industrial upheaval. Instead . of any attempt being made on behalf of the Government who are interested, in prospite of the statements made that the strike is absolutely ruining any chance of Australia effectively participating in the war, any help is absolutely refused' by the head of the Government to bring . about a peaceable solution. I hope that honourable members will not be put off with the statement of the Prime Minister, but will see that some efforts are made to. bring about an amicable settlement. Debate (on motion by Mr MASSYGREENE) adjourned. House adjourned at 10.44 p.m.",61
