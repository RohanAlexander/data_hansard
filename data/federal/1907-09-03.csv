1,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Is it a fact, as reported in the Sydney newspapers of Friday last, 30th August, that three carriers employed by a Government contractor named Sutton to assist in removing wire netting under instructions from the New South Wales Government have been peremptorily ordered by Mr Baxter, Acting Comptroller for Customs, to return their licences, and show cause why they should not be cancelled? Was this high-handed proceeding authorized or approved by the Minister? As the carriers referred according to the report, in no sense principals in the contract with the State - vernmen,!!,' 'and the withdrawal., of 'their licences must seriously injure them in their carrying business, will the Ministerrecall the order issued by Mr Baxter, until inquiry has been held and an offence been proven? Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - As the excessive ? matter to which it relates is to come before the law courts, I ask the honourable memgraphed ber to give notice of his question. Every care will be taken to show that neither private persons nor State officials break the Customs law with impunity. Mr Bruce. SMITH - I should like know from the honourable member whether, in suspending these carriers' licences, is not emulating the Premier of New South Wales ±)y taking the law into his own hands while the matter is sub judice t",14
2,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"As the matter will come before the law courts, it is, perhaps, undesirable to refer to it here, but surely questions dealing with it should be placed on the notice-paper, so that before replying to them. I may know exactly what they contain. If the honourable member will give notice of his question, I shall be pleased to answer it, and to give him any information that he may require. So far as I. am aware, no licences have been"" cancelled.",14
3,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"Will the Minister of Trade and Customs supply to honourable members) alphabetically indexed, copies of the old Tariff, as used by the Customs officials ? \ Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - I think that honourable members have been supplied' with copies of the old Tariff, and .I shall be glad to supply any other information that they may require. In my opinion, it would be a good thing to distribute copies of the new Tariff throughout the country, so that the public might know exactly what the rates are, and be in a position to meet, those who have raised prices on goods on which duties have not been imposed or increased. It has been suggested to the Acting Prime Minister that we might distribute a number of copies of the Tariff, - and that one should be sent to any person desirous of obtaining a copy, on receipt of his application, accompanied with an addressed stamped wrapper.",14
4,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"A few could be sent to to were, each country post-office.",14
5,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"I desire to' ask the GoMinister of Trade and Customs if he has received from the officers of his Department any information in reference to the duties which are being levied upon railway an wheels and axles, imported by the Governhas ment of Western Australia, which the Minister of Railways has' complained are Mr AUSTIN CHAPMANI teleto Western Australia for further particulars, and I hope to be in a position . tomorrow to furnishj accurate information may to the honourable member.  to attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to the following paragraph, which he appeared in Saturday's Argus.Reference was made in the Federal Parliament two days ago to the fact that no duty has as yet been collected in Victoria on kerosene under the new Tariff. The manager of the Colonial O i l Company (Mr H . A . Forrest) remarks, however, that it has paid over £3,000 in Adelaide and over £1,000 in Brisbane. With regard to stocks, Mr Forrest doubts whether there was three months' supply of American tinned and cased oil and Asiatic bulk oil combined in. Australia on 8th .August, when the Budget Speech was delivered. The Colonial Oil Company had about two and half months' supply on hand, which was about half the stock usually carried, and to ask whether that amount of duty has been paid on kerosene in Adelaide and - Brisbane?",14
6,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The statement. I made the other day was in reply to an allegation that the price of kerosene oil had been raised in Victoria. From the Customs House I ascertained that no duty had been paid in Victoria since the introduction of the new Tariff, and, consequently, I was at a loss to understand how persons here could claim that in charging the extra price they were simply passing on the duty. As regards what payments have been made in other States, I have no knowledge, but I shall be glad to ascertain the amount, and let the honourable member know.",15
7,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs a question with reference to the importation of chairs. It is evident that a mistake has been made in the printed matter, and that the trade is being blocked by the charge of 7s. 6d. per chair which the Customs officers are now making. I ask the Minister whether he will take .the matter into consideration, so that business may not be impeded by the action of the Department, owing to the mistake' to which I refer.",15
8,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"This and other matters which have been brought under my notice by honourable members and deputations, are receiving every attention, and at the earliest possible moment some information will be made available to the House. TELEGRAPHIST S' OVERTIME.",15
9,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General a question without it tomorrow. notice.. When telegraphists are kept at work for more than their usual hours, will he.see that they are paid for the overtime which they are compelled to work.",15
10,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I shall certainly do I am entirely opposed to the working of overtime, and think that it should, as far as possible, be avoided. When overtime must be worked, it should be paid for; but I shall discountenance the working of overtime. ROYAL AGRICULTURA L SHOW.",15
11,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,"Will the Acting Prime Minister take into consideration the fact that one of the greatest, if not the greatest, agricultural shows in the Commonwealth is being held in Melbourne this week? Usually the Victorian Parliament adjourns on the Thursday of the week in which the Royal Agricultural Society's Show is held-that being the popular day.",15
12,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Hear , hear. Let us adjourn on Thursday next until 8 o'clock in the evening.",15

14,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"In the asking of a question, no debate may take place.",15
15,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,"I understand that, sir, and did not think that I was debating the matter. Knowing the desire of the Acting Prime Minister to get on with work, I felt it necessary to say a word 01 two, with the object of inducing him to consent to the adjournment for which' I ask.",15
16,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Whil e acknowledging the importance of the show to which the honourable member refers, I regret that it will be impossible to adjourn on Thursday next, because there is so much work that we want to get through. - AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMEN T MAKERS: . SOUTH AUSTRALIA.",15

19,Mr CROUCH,STATE REFERENDUMI N,"It has been anso. nounced by the Premier of Queensland, that he proposes at the time of the 'next Federal elections,' to take a referendum of the State on the subject of Scripture education, and that the Premier of Victoria, if a referendum Bill is passed through the State .Parliament, will propose a similar referendum. Does the Acting Prime Minister think it right that sectarian issues should be permitted to enter into Federal politics, as they necessarily must if, at the time of the Federal elections, a referendum' is taken in regard to the teaching of Scripture by the State?",15
20,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE REFERENDUMI N,"The matter has recently been brought under my notice, though not by the Premier of Queensland, and, in regard to it, I have had occasion to refer to previous correspondence of aconfidential character. While the Government does not wish to refuse any reasonable request by the State of Queensland, Ministers feel that as the Queensland State elections will take place before the Commonwealth elections",16
21,Mr FISHER,STATE REFERENDUMI N,O r about the same time.,16
22,Mr CROUCH,STATE REFERENDUMI N,That is not so with the Victorian elections.,16
23,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE REFERENDUMI N,"The State elections are likely to take place shortly after the Commonwealth elections, and, therefore, the Government does not intend to agree to the proposal. In my opinion, it would not be wise to allow any matter savouring of sectarianism to be mixed up with Federal politics. PUBLIC SERVIC EINCREMENT S.",16
24,Mr FRAZER,STATE REFERENDUMI N,"Will the Acting Prime Minister inform the House whether the whole of the increments set down for the Public Service are being paid, or whether increments are being paid only to officers receiving salaries of less than £200 per annum.",16
25,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE REFERENDUMI N,"So far as I know, increments are being paid to public servants receiving salaries of not more than £160 per annum ; but I ask the honourable member to give notice of his question. MANUFACTU RE OF GLOVES. Sir JOHN FORRES T asked the Treasurer, upon noticeIf he will inform the House, where gloves, of the kind upon which it is intended under the Tariff to impose an ad valorem duty of 30 per cent., are made in Melbourne, as slated by him on page 2364 of Hansard/",16
26,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE REFERENDUMI N,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as followsHousemaids' gloves, gardening gloves, harvesting gloves, and driving gloves, all of which come within item 121, are made locally, in considerable quantities. The manufacturers' names are R. S.' Don, 203 Elizabeth-street; and J . and J. Smith, 2 Lord-street, Richmond. I believe gentlemen's gloves are also being rrade in Melbourne. I may tell the honourable gentleman that I have purchased them.",16
27,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATE REFERENDUMI N,Where are they made? That is all humbug ,16
28,Mr SPEAKER,STATE REFERENDUMI N,"I must ask honourable members to avoid conversing in loud tones and also passing remarks across the chamber during question time. NAVA LAGREEMENT . Mr Bruce SMIT H asked the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice I. Is the Government yet prepared to say whether it intends to introduce legislation for the purpose of terminating the Naval Agreement with the Imperial Government, in accordance with the policy enunciated by the Prime Minister before the Imperial Conference? 2. If the Government has not any such intention, has it already informed, or will it inform, the Imperial Government of the facts, so as to enable it to make its arrangements in regard to the disposition of the Naval Squadron now stationed in Australian waters? 3. Does the Government still entertain the opinion expressed by the Prime Minister in the Imperial Conference that the Naval Agreement is now unpopular in Australia? Sir WILLIAM"" LYNE - The answer to the honourable member's questions is as followsThis is a matter which the Prime Minister particularly desires to settle himself, and I hope that he will be in attendance shortly. KING ' S WAREHOUSES .",16
29,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE REFERENDUMI N,"On Tuesday last the honourable member for Fremantle asked the following questions1. What are the tonnage capacities, as measured according to the Customs Regulations, of the King's Warehouses in the several States in a fit condition for the proper warehousing of dutiable goods? 2. Since the taking over of the Customs by the Federal authorities have any goods which, under Customs Act and Regulations, the Customs authorities are empowered to warehouse in a King's Warehouse without the consent of the owners (such as seized, unclaimed, or detained goods) been warehoused in general warehouses owned by private firms or individuals, and licensed by the Customs authorities? 3. If so, what is the tonnage so warehoused in the several States, and why has this privilege been refused to general warehouses in Western Australia ? I am now in a position to furnish the foland lowing answers1. Capacity of King's WarehousesNew South Wales ... 361 tons Victoria .. --- 6,430 tons Queensland ... ... 9,371 tons South Australia ... 1,166 tons Western Australia ... 4,211 tons Tasmania ... ... 1,474 tons 2. New South Wales - All goods which have been seized or detained are sent to the King's Warehouse. Unclaimed and unentered goods are sent by shipping companies to any bond approved by the collector. This is done owing to lack of space and convenience in the King's W arehouse. Victoria - No , unless desired by consignee. Queensland - No South Australia - Sam e as New South Wales. Western Australia - No . Tasmania - No . 3. No record has been kept of the tonnage so warehoused. The Dart of question relating to privilege is answered by information given under 2.",16
30,Mr HEDGES,STATE REFERENDUMI N,I desire to ask the Minister if he is aware that the building provided as a warehouse at Perth has been practically condemned by the Inspector to the Board of Health?,17
31,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE REFERENDUMI N,"I have no knowledge on that head, but I shall be very glad to make inquiries. I understand that an application had been made by a gentleman in Perth, who wished to monopolize the warehouse. It seemed to me that that was the difficulty, but, perhaps, I am mistaken. I shall look into the noticematter and give the honourable gentleman further information. MAI L SERVICE: NORTH-WEST",17
32,Mr MAHON,STATE REFERENDUMI N,"Some time since the noons. Postmaster-General entered into negotiations with the shipping companies trading the Mr. on the north-west coast of Western tralia for the carriage of mails. It was understood at the time that an arrangement would be made with those companies in regard to the rates and fares to be charged on that coast. But it appears that a contract has been entered into, and appreciable difference has been made in that regard. I, therefore, ask the Minister whether he can see his way to lay upon the table the correspondence with the shipping companies, so that it may be perused by honourable members?",17
33,Mr MAUGER,STATE REFERENDUMI N,"I made full inquiries, into the matter. I understand that representations were made to my predecessor, that something was. done, or attempted to be done. I have no objection to give to the honourable member any information in my possession. TELEPHONE CHARGES. WES T MAITLAND AND SYDNEY.",17
34,Mr LIDDELL,STATE REFERENDUMI N,"I desire to ask thePostmaster-General if he can see his way to reduce .the charges on the telephone line between West Maitland and Sydney. Seeing, that, although a reduction of 50 per cent., has been made in the rates between Newcastle and Maitland, no reduction has been made in the rates between Sydney and Maitland, and that practically the subscribers on all the other lines have received consideration, I ask the honourable gentleman seriously to consider the question, as it is of much moment to the persons concerned.",17
35,Mr MAUGER,STATE REFERENDUMI N,"I am under the impression that the same rates are being charged on. the line to which the honourable member refers as on similar lines in New South Wales. If the honourable member will give notice of the question, I shall have inquiries made, and furnish a reply. NA BUSINESS.",17

40,Mr MAH ON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice I. Has the Government observed that the liament of Western Australia has passed a monstrance against the new Tariff, as injuriously affecting the primary industries on which State so largely depends, and as being fraught with the gravestdanger to the financial stability of the State? 2. In view of this and other evidences of lar discontent in Western Australia, does consider it advisable to publicly intimate on good cause being shown, the Government reconsider any duties calculated to bear oppressively on the mining, agricultural,- and interests of that State?",18
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as lows :I have noticed the motion carried by the State Parliament, and in due course, when the are arrived at, the Government will deal the matters alluded to. but will not interfere with the principle of protection. BUDGET. CUSTOMS AND EXCISE TARIFFS. In 'Committeeof Ways and Means : Consideration resumed from 30th August (vide page 2683), of motion LIAM LYNE That duties of Customs and duties of be imposed according to the following Tariff (vide page 1648).",18
42,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Kooyong) [3.21] - The Acting Prime Minister today acted wisely in refusing to consent to a proposal that would have interfered with the progress this debate and have delayed the settlephysical ment of the Tariff. I hope that we everything to the consideration that it is of the utmost importance that the Tariff should be disposed of with least possible delay. It is for that that I do not propose ""this afternoon to occupy the attention of honourable members at any great length. I feel that, at the outset, it is my duty to accentuate the point which the honourable member for made in the course of his forcible are speech last week, when he said that the circumstances under which we were called upon to proceed with this debate were Royal most unsatisfactory. We have now before is us one of the most important Budget statethe ments that it has been our duty to consider. The first submitted to the Parliament was one which involved speculation and doubt, for at the time we were confronted with the duty of harmonizing the various Tariffs of the six States, whilst in dealing with later Budgets we had not that fuller experience that we now Parpossess of the working of the Federal marechine. This is the first occasion on which we have had presented to us a Budget that which foreshadows a time when we may not be able to meet the just demands upon the Commonwealth exchequer. It is quite popuclear that under existing circumstances we he not shall not have at our disposal anything that, like the revenue necessary to accomplish will the various objects and undertakings for pastoral which Federation was esfab'ished - My honourable friends of the Labour Party may not view the situation with the same folconcern and dismay that I and others do, because such a shortage might lead to resort being had to a means of raising items revenue which is one of the planks of with their platform. I am strongly of opinion that if the Commonwealth Parliament enters upon a system of direct taxation, it will assume a serious responsibility, and, in my judgment, break the whole spirit of the Federal compact. I hold very strongly that the intention was that the power to impose direct taxation should be exercised by the Commonwealth only in a of Sir WIL - national emergency.",18
43,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,Fro m where does the Excise honourable member obtain that idea?,18
44,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,That was the idea of the framers of the Constitution.,18
45,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,Is there anything in the Constitution to indicate that it was ?,18
46,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I am addressing the of Committee today under somewhat of a disability, and therefore ask the shall indulgence of honourable members.",18
47,Mr HUTCHINSON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Hear , hear. honourable member was repeating what the leader of the Opposition said in the laide Town Hall.",19
48,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I do not know what the right honourable member said on that sion. What I am putting before the Commember mittee comes off my own bat. I am not endeavouring to repeat the views of body else, and I ask honourable members to permit me to develop my speech in own way. I do not think that any Budget statement has been submitted to us under conditions so unsatisfactory as those assoby ciated with that now before us. We have had from the Government no indication to what are their intentions with reference to the carrying out of their programme, having regard to the fact that they only a small margin to work upon. It is unfortunate that we should have had joint submission of the Budget and the Tariff, but probably the Treasurer found that it would be impossible to dissociate them. In view of figures which I monwealth was £201,500,000. shall presently put before the Committee, it is of the utmost importance that honourable members should have their attention drawn to the fact that we are rapidly apand proaching a time when we shall exhaust revenue, which, under present conditions, is at the command of the Commonwealth. The electors of Australia must recognise that if we are to fulfil the purposes and objects for which the Commonwealth ""was established, there must be some readjustshould ment of our present financial relations the States. Otherwise we shall have to resort to the process of direct taxation, which, my opinion, would be not only unfortunate for the Commonwealth, but a source of conscant irritation between the Federal vernment and the States. It would more fruitful of discontent, and possibly of disruption, than any other policy which we could pursue. The power to levy Cusexpenditure toms and Excise duties was intrusted clusively to the Federal Parliament. State was left with any power to derive revenue directly or indirectly from/ that source. Consequently, the Commonwealth 1901-2 of £2,035,000. became possessed of all possible Customs and Excise revenue to be raised in Australia. When we turn back to the debates took place in the various Conventions from which the Constitution emanated, must be struck with the fact that much discussion centred around the question of how the apportionment of revenue derived from Customs and Excise was to be adjusted, The as not to interfere unduly with the revenues of the States. The late Sir Edward BradAdedon devised a method of dealing with that difficulty which has been shown to possess merits even greater than were originally occaacknowledged. My honourable friend, the for Flinders, has drawn attention to the fact that, having regard to the arbianytrary apportionment of at least three-fourths Customs and Excise revenue to the my States, we are justified in assuming that the framers of the Constitution recognised that the amount of money represented that proportion was at the time nearly equivalent to the amount of interest which as had to be paid by the States upon their debts. My honourable friend argued that we were, therefore, warranted in looking have upon the three-fourths as the minimum amount which the 'States might reasonably a expect to have returned to them. It will be remembered that, at the time of the establishment of Federation, the amount of debt which might be taken over by the ComDebts which might subsequently be incurred by 'the States did not enter into the calculation. But I believe that, until some final satisfactory adjustment is arrived at in the connection with State and Federal finance, we ought, in any settlement we make, even at the end of 1910, to provide that the additional sum of over £7,000,000-repre senting 3 per cent, upon State borrowings 1 at the establishment of the Constitutionbe ear-marked to the States for with their benefit. There is no matter which demands more serious consideration than in does our present financial position. It ought to have engaged the best attention of - the Ministry, instead of being placed beGofore us as though it was a matter about be which honourable members might be left to wrangle as they pleased. Let me draw attention to the very great increase in our which has taken place since exthe Commonwealth has been in existence. No The estimated expenditure for 1907-8 amounts to £5,976,000. That represents an actual increase upon the expenditure for In addition, I find that the estimated increase for the current - year, as compared with the expendiwhich ture for 1906-7, is £980,691.  we of carrying out public works.",19
49,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"That is the full amount which has to be provided, irrespective of so whether the expenditure contemplated isupon capital account or upon items of a recurring character.",19
50,Mr MAUGER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,O r whether it is on account of services rendered ?,20
51,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,Yes . They are all ineluded. I shall presently show that our expenditure is accumulating in such a way that very soon we shall find ourselves in the position of not having sufficient revenue to make the necessary provision for these various purposes.,20
52,Mr STORRER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,How many Departments have been taken over by the Commonwealth from the States since 1901 ?,20
53,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"If the honourable member desires that information, I have the whole of the figures relating to it in my possession.

I say, with all respect to the able and efficient officers in the Treasury Department, that the manner in which some of these figures are presented should be more in accordance with the system with which we are familiar in commercial offices, I wish to show the position of the. Commonwealth from the stand-point of the estimated revenue and expenditure for the current year. The information which I have obtained is in the form of a table, which I ask may be published in Hansard for future reference, so that honourable members may be enabled to ascertain our exact position by simply referring to it and without the necessity for an examination of other parts of the Budget statement.

54,Mr WH IRVINE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Omittin g the ceipts from the Post Office. Mr KNOX,-The Post Office I,regard as purely a business enterprise, which,its own bottom, ought to show a working profit. If ithet Treasurer's estimate for the current year be realized, that Departof ment will show a profit of £357,913.",21
55,Mr FISHER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,In some of the States Department is being worked at a loss.,21
56,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Yes- . . The expenditure upon the Defence Department aggregates £916,206, less receipts-whic h are derived chiefly from rents-amountin g to £ 6 , 0 ""Miscellaneous"" involves an expenditure of £25,000, and Quarantine of £ 8 , 0 the total of other expenditure is increase £1,090,780. Then the construction of new works represents an ture of £817,874, making a total of £2,851,860, leaving us a balance of £103,992, which represents the margin available for new purposes of the Commonwealth. I am sure that honourable members must regard that situation demanding their serious attention. If we avail ourselves of other powers which possess-suc h as the power of direct ation-ou r action will probably be fraught with serious consequences to the Comto monwealth and to the States. But I venture to think that the expectations of the Treasurer will not be realized. The late Treasurer took what we thought at the time was a very optimistic view the financial outlook, but I am glad to that his expectations were fully realized. His estimate was based upon the requireas ments of an estimated population of 4,121,000. The estimate of revenue difficulty from Customs and Excise for 1907-8 is based on an estimated populathe tion of 4,190,000, or an increase of 69,000 people. It amounts to £10,509,000, or an increase of £1,409,000, equal deed, to over £ 2 0 per head of the increase in population. Averaged over the whole population, the estimate of revenue for the last financial year was £ 2 4s. 2rt. per head, while that for the current year is £ 2 10s. 2d. per head, or an additional 6s. per head for every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth. The estimate for 1906-7 of Customs revenue only-eliminat ing sugar as a disturbing element, to which I shall presently refer-wa s £7,051,000. The actual revenue received us £7<5°°,3°8, or an increase over the estimuch mate of £449,368. That was equal to an increase of 6.37 per cent. The estiremated Customs revenue only for 1907-0 is £8,161,000, or £1,110,000 more than the estimate for the previous year. This, on upon the basis of a consumption equal to the estimated consumption of 1906-7, means an increase in the present duties of an average 15.6 per cent. Or, if we take the consumption for this year as equal to the the amount which actually paid duty last year, then the difference of £660,632 between the amount of £7,500,368 of duty actually paid last year, and the estimate of £8,161,000 to be received during, the 0 0; current year, is equivalent to an increase in the present duties of 8.8 per cent. There 0 0; has not been in our past experience any of our consuming powers sufficient to justify the expectation that those high expendipercentages will.be realized.",21
57,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,The Acting Prime Minister told the people of England that . our whole Tariff averaged 6 per' cent.,21
58,Mr FISHER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,That was on the whole as one . of the importations.,21
59,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"The figures I have given we have been very carefully worked out. Let taxus turn now to the Post and Telegraph Department. A point which I have ventured urge upon the consideration of the Department both last year and in previous .years.was that there should be a proper segregation of the three business accounts of the Department-the postal account, the of telegraph account, and the telephone svssay tem account. Each of these is a separate entity of business in itself, and inasmuch they do segregate the revenue of each branch, there ought to be no practical in ascertaining the details of the separate expenditures. If that were done, result would really be instructive to the. House, and I think we should find that ' we are deriving a very large revenue inin fact, more than is at present supposed, from that public convenience, the telephone. It will be noted that the re' venue from the Postal Department is estimated at £272,500 more than the estimate for last year, and only £16,157 less than was actually received last year, in spite of the fact that it is reckoned that £117,000 less will be received through the introducr tion of penny postage. This is equivalent to estimating that if the present rates were maintained £100,000 more was would be received than last year! I cannot reconcile the estimate of loss from penny postage with thefiguresgiven in that connection last year by the late Treasurer. He estimated that the loss would be £157,000.",21
60,Sir JOHN FORREST,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"1 hat was for tional three-quarters of the year. This amount is for half-a-year. ' Mr KNOX - I quite recognise that amount of £117,000 is for only half a year, and that my honourable friend's estiin mate was for nine months, but even then am not able to reconcile the two estimates. I must say that I prefer to accept the pectation of loss indicated Iby the Treasurer. The estimate of revenue for absolutely the telegraph branch is £58,000 more than the estimate for last year, which is practically an increase of 10 per cent. The estimate of receipts from telephones shows an increase of £46,500' over last year's estimate, increase of 12 per cent. To cope with the required ? anticipated increase of business, the strength of. the staff of the Department rises from 10,931 employees to 11,606, an increase of 675 hands, involving an estiNaval mated increase of salaries of £65,133. addition, the general' expenditure ..is estithat mated at £93,943 more than last year's estimate, and £116,658 greater than last year's actual expenditure. Taken together, the figures I have given show an actual increase of expenditure in the Deit partment of £203,719 over last year. That is a serious factor, and supfact ports me in the belief that the explication, pectation of revenue of the Government the will, from these.two Departments, not realized. If I were not rather showing the position from an adverse point of I should have liked to give, at this stage, in connection with the question of penny postage, some figures which Mr Henniker Heaton was good enough to supply me the other day. I think, however, that would be better to defer them until item is under consideration. On these Departments alone the surplus of the vernment is entirely swept away.",22
61,Mr FISHER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,Provisio n is made Estimates to cover the loss on penny postage.,22
62,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,I have already said so.,22
63,Mr FISHER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,Then - how would the surplus disappear?,22
64,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,I have shown that the expectation of revenue of the Government will not be realized.. . Mr FISHER - The estimate will be affected if penny postage is not sanctioned.,22
65,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Of course if the proposal for penny postage does not pass this House, we shall have £117,000 of addirevenue for six months, or a greater sum for twelve months. On defence, the estimate of expenditure is £916,000, be the ing an increase of £61,000. In view of the complications which are taking place the Pacific, in the shape of the new I factor of a great American fleet entering that ocean, the advance which has taken explace in China, and the position which late has been occupied by Japan,, we are playing with the whole defence question if we suppose that an increase of £61,000 in expenditure will in any adequate degree meet the necessities of the situation.  or an member's method of raising the money",22
66,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I shall deal with that matter in a few moments. I do not know or whether it is expected that next year the Agreement will ""be cancelled, and that In the £200,000, how spent annually under agreement, will revert to revenue; but I earnestly hope that a strong, solid vote will be recorded against any proposition of the kind. ' If ever it were necessary to have the assistance of the British Fleet, is necessary now; and the assistance is becoming more imperative in view of the that the theatre of international comand of naval trouble, must be in Pacific. Are we in the self-sufficing posibe tion to provide whatever expenditure may be necessary in this connection ? No policy view, has been enunciated by the Government; on the contrary, the only policy of the Government-and it is one on which I am at strong divergence with the Prime Minister with - seem s to be a policy of surrender of it the Naval Agreement, as indicated during the his recent visit to England.

Honourable members in the Ministerial corner, however, have a distinct policy, and, though we may be opposed to that policy, I say all honour to them, because they know where they are from day to day ",23

79,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I do not propose to deal at length with new works expenditure ""other"" expenditure; but if we imagine £!03»992that we shall be able to develop the sources of the Commonwealth in the ous directions proposed simply out revenue, it means taxation which the people will never be able to bear.",23
80,Mr BATCHELOR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,There is a.suggestion of a policy in that remark.,23
81,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Well , it is inevitable that basis. the time must arrive when the Commonwealth will have to take the only business Act. course of borrowing, for the purpose of reproductive works. I admire the effort which has been made in some of the States to reduce their indebtedness ^ out of revenue derived from their various methods of taxation, but it is absolutely impossible to imagine that we shall be able to fulfil the purposes of Federation without eventu- , about ally borrowing.  ber's policy had been carried out from the inception of the Federation, we should have been in debt already to the extent of £2,500,000.",23
82,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"No one desires more than myself to avoid entering upon a borrowing policy, and no one will analyze or criticise more keenly than myself any proposal to borrow; but if we are to carry out all the objects favoured by honourable members in the Ministerial corner, borrowing will bea business necessity, or we must curthis tail the development policy of the Commonwealth. I should like to invite the no attention of honourable members to the sugar industry, as there appears to be some misconception of our exact position. and I have prepared a statement, in which I show what our financial position would be if we had .not to pay the sugar bonus. That bonus was arranged for general purposes .of policy, but had it been dealt with as a business undertaking, we should today, instead of ai balance of £103,992, have had a balance of £533,742 for this year-that is, if the bonus had ceased a last year, even though it had been paid during the two previous years. For instance, the real excise, in my opinion, is of £173,000, whereas' the excise actually collected was £746,000, and the bounty paid was £573,000, the real excise being the difference between the two. That leaves us with £9,936,000, and, with the ordinary amount from Customs and. other receipts, there is .a balance of £533,742. If there had been no bonus, we should have been in a position to refund to the and States that balance, instead Ofonly  varithe import - and excise duties remain. of Mr KNOX - That is so; but when the bonus terminates, I hope the excise will be reduced insuch a way as to adjust the financial position, and place our accounts on what I regard as a proper business",23
83,Mr FISHER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,It is so provided in the 0,23
84,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Yes , and I desire to show how we are suffering financially at the present time by our adherence to a great the policy, the merits of 'which I myself favour. But, as I expressed at the time, the means and machinery to secure that policy are rather complicated and round",23
85,Mr FISHER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"The honourable member is in error, because if the Act were .carried out, and there were neither excise nor bounty, we should not be so well off as we are now.",23
86,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I do not desire the excise to be taken off entirely, but to be reduced to such an amount as to represent the real excise, namely, the difference between the bonus and the excise now. collected. Leaving out detailed figures, with which I shall not trouble the Committee, I think it will be seen from the representations I have made, that on the Treasurer's anticipations we shall sustain a loss in Customs and Excise revenue and in connection with the Postmaster - General's Department amounting to £123,256. In all the circumstances, therefore, it must be admitted that the honourable and learned member for Flinders last week outlined the financial position of the Commonwealth in a manner which demands the most .serious consideration and criticism of honourable members, if we are to establish confidence in our financial stability abroad. At the present time, I believe that from the financial stand-point the Commonwealth occupies a position abroad, which is not superior to that of any one of the larger States. It is my contention that we should occupy a much better position than we do at the present time, had it not been for certain legislation and certain misrepresentations of the Commonwealth published at Home. The duty is imposed upon us of seriously considering what remedies are available to establish the superior financial position of the Commonwealth. Some time ago I submitted a proposal for the transfer of the States debts. I gave it, as my opinion, that we should accept a lump sum of £200,000,000 as covering the debts to be transferred, and if we provided for an interest charge of 3J per cent, on that amount, we should practically carry out the idea to which the honourable member for Flinders gave prominence last week. I then suggested that it would be necessary for the Commonwealth Parliament to make provision for the return to the States - annually of a fixed sum amounting to not less than £7,000,000, and I estimated that a further sum of £350,000 should be provided to meet the special necessities of Western Australia, because of the high consumption of dutiable goods per unit , in the population of that State. I find that if that idea had been carried out, the sum I have mentioned would have been very nearly met by the actual amount returned to the States at that time, viz., £7,039,199. I think it is essential that we should keep in mind the £201,580,185 of States debts as they existed at that time, and should regard the amount of the interest charge thereon, £7,254,948, as establishing the minimum amount which the States are entitled to expect shall be'returned to them. I quite recognise that the figures will have to be adjusted in making the returns on a different basis from that on which we are now making our returns.",24
87,Mr ATKINSON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,Would not the honourable member take over the States debts as they became due?,24
88,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I am glad my honourable friend asked me that question, because I used to think that the adjustment and settlement of the finances of the Commonwealth at the end of the year 1910 absolutely and irrevocably involved the taking over of States railways and the adjustment of the States obligations in that respect.",24
89,Mr ARCHER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,The taking over of the railways ?,24
90,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Yes , but I may say that I am not of that opinion now. I now believe that the adjustment of the finances under section 87 of the Constitution must be carried out irrespective of any consequential transfer of the States railways. The two things may be concurrent, and I should be glad if that could be arranged; but the settlement of the financial position in 1910 will have to be carried out quite irrespective of the other question to which I have referred, if the States do not themselves come together and make some proposals or overtures to the Federal Government. It has been a perfect mystery to me that the States Governments have not pressed the necessity for the adjustment of the finances more earnestly than they have done or are doing at the present time. If there is any friction between the Commonwealth and States authorities at the present time it is probably due to the manner in which the present Acting Prime Minister has flouted the Premiers' Conference held at Brisbane, the Prime Minister, and the right honourable member for Swan, in coming down to this House and saying that he was not going to agree to the arrangements arrived at with the Brisbane Conference, and making it plain that he preferred to take another course, with a view to hastening directtaxation. It is also a mystery to me that any one holding so responsible a position as that which the Acting Prime Minister occupies at the present time should have allowed himself to take up a position of that kind. I think that perhaps we can best deal with the Tariff when we are considering the detailed items, but it is only right that at this stage I should say exactly what my attitude in connection with it will be. At the late elections I made my position absolutely clear. The Prime Minister had said that he was in favour of scientific national protection; scientific because of careful adjustment of the needs of each industry, and no more than is sufficient to meet its honourable needs.  that.",24
91,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,No . It exactly expresses my views. Mr. JOSEPH . COOK - It might be taken to mean anything.,25
92,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"What does the orable member understand by "" scientific protection "" ?",25
93,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I do not undertake to est, interpret the statements of the Prime ister, but the meaning which I attach the phrase is that each proposal for a duty must be carefully considered by honourable members, and, personally, it is my intento tion to make close inquiry into the reasonto able needs of each industry for the protecdustries tion of which a duty has been proposed, and to see that they are met.",25
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,We are . a ll with the honourable member in desiring to give close attention to the needs of industries.,25
95,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"-'The hbnorable member for Flinders has given publicity to the phrase "" effective protection."" I have deof clared for effective protection. But I shown it to be of the essence of the union between the States that the Commonwealth shall obtain by means of Customs and E cise duties the revenue necessary for the administration of its Departments, and for further development.",25
96,Mr MATHEWS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,It is not necessary for us to obtain that revenue from Customs and Excise duties - ,25
97,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I know that the party to which my honourable friend belongs would like to raise revenue by other means, but, according to my view, our primary source of revenue-must be such duties. Then there is what I may call the humanitarian aspect of the Tariff, On every platform from which I have spoken, I have pledged myof self to give consideration to the humaniof tarian point of view, a new element in connection with Tariff proposals which I have not heard of as being considered in other parts of the world. In dealing with the Tariff, we must first of all remember the obligation to so adjust duties that we shall have sufficient revenue for the administration of the Commonwealth Departments, and be able to return to the States, as their three-fourths share, a sum not less than the annual interest of their public debts at the date of Federation. The observance of this obligation will make it impossible for us to impose prohibitive rates. We must also take into consideration what I have just referred to as the humanitarian point of view, that is, we must recognise that it is the desire of the public that the workmen employed hi our manufacturing industries shall be well paid and humanely treated. But I. have always stated clearly and distinctly that prohibitive duties, that is duties honwhich prevent reasonable competition, or impose undue or unnecessary, burdens on consumers, are opposed to the public interand that I shall not vote for them. It Minwill be my endeavour to secure effective to protection where a just demand has been made for it, but I shall see that consumers are not unduly interfered with, or made bear unnecessarily heavy burdens, even bolster up the great manufacturing inof Australia. Moreover, I have publicly indicated' that I am in favour of preferential trade. I wish to see ultimately a union of the various parts of the Empire, under which reciprocal trading arrangements will be made. As for the proposals of the Government,- they must each be dealt with on its merits, but, speaking them generally, I venture to regard them, have having in view what was said by Ministers when in London, as farcical. However, I shall consider myself free to deal with x - them individually, because fhere may be items in regard to which a preference has been wisely proposed. My speech has occupied more time than I intended to take up, and I have not yet covered a tithe of the ground which I wish to cover, but, before - sitting down, I urge honourable members, both those who have recently taken their seats in this Chamber and those who were elected to the firstand second Parliaments, to resolve to do something towards placing the Commonwealth finances in a sound position. It is idle to think that we can flout the opinion of the great commercial centres the world. I speak with' some knowledge the subject when I say that we should make ourselves ridiculous in pretending to do so. Notwithstanding the enormous increase of wealth in Australia, we cannot regard this country as independent of the great financial, centres of the world.  says that we should be self-contained.",25
98,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Whateve r the Acting Prime' Minister may have said before he went to London, I do not think that he is now of the opinion that Australia can be regarded as independent of the financial centres of the world. It is our duty, when proposals for expenditure are placed before us, to see what their effect will be upon our finances. We are to be asked to undertake serious obligations which may jeopardize our financial position, and injure our relations with the States. ating fault in connection with this Legislature has been the too pressing desire to pass unnecessary legislation. We ought to realise that the legislation and development of this great Commonwealth must be a work of time, and that hasty action on our part will bring about adverse consequences. We have to recognise that in the individual States there are local interests, experienlces, customs, and prejudices which the Commonwealth was not created to inflame or to continue. We, as representatives of the people, ought to endeavour to reduce the feeling of discontent and irritation. Unless we place the Commonwealth in a sound financial position, the causes of irritation will increase, and we shall find elements of destruction within ourselves. .1 plead with my honourable friends opposite to pause.  happen in every business?",26

I did propose to read some statements showing the magniI ficent development of our resources, irresChamber pective of State or Commonwealth legislapccasion.i tion, and the natural increase which has taken place, but I shall not weary honour and able members by reading them.

I plead with honourable members to be alive to the 'great trust which has been reposed in us, and to remember that before we follow any Ministry, they ought to come down with financial proposals which will be understandable. In view of the proceedings which have characterised the House during the session, and with a knowledge of the financial disabilities which exist, I contend that it is not fair or just for the Government to put before honourable members in an immature, ill-considered manner proposals for large expenditure.",26
106,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I wish that the honourable member would take a hand, and not in a let us know what he proposes.",26
107,Mr KNOX,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I am more indebted to my honourable friends than I can express for of the the attention which they have given to my remarks. I did wish to speak at considerable length, and to deal exhaustively with the whole financial position, but I feel that have never previously addressed the less effectively on an important It was quite doubtful as to whether I should be able to attend today, I am very grateful to honourable memI bers for their kind consideration.  that every honourable member will endorse the of the last speaker to see a system of of. sound finance established. But the whole question is, How are we to arrive at that result? From the speech of the honourable gentleman today, and also from the speech of the honourable member for Flinders last week, I gather that their view of sound finance is to plunge the Commonwealth into a policy of borrowing. If their speeches on the Budget indicate anything, they indicate that in their opinion this Parliament should abandon the policy which it established at the beginning of its existence, and that is, to live within our means. In its first session Parliament was asked to adopt a proposition to borrow £1,000,000, * It was resisted most strenuously by the leader of the Labour Party, opposed by a majority in the Chamber, and abandoned by the Government. Had we agreed to the policy which was then advocated, and which is now favoured by the honourable members for Kooyong and Flinders, by this time we should have ' borrowed £2,500,000, and the taxpayers would have been paying interest on that sum. Fortunately, we have been able to carry out all our work without resorting to the money market.  imagine that our borrowing would have stopped short at £""2,500,000?  it would have done so. I believe had we initiated the policy of borrowing our loan expenditure would have amounted now to something like £5,000,000. Which is the sounder system of finance-that of the man who lives within his means, or that of the individual who borrows ? The policy indicated in speeches delivered by honourable members in the Opposition corner is that of borrowing and booming, and we have also had an indication that in their opinion a reduction in the salaries of public servants is 'desirable. The speech made last week by the honourable member for Flinders indicated-if it showed anything at all-that , in his opinion, we were paying too much to our public servants, and that their salaries should be reduced.' It is well that the country should know that the policy of the Opposition corner is that of borrowing, booming, and sacking hands.",26
108,Mr HUTCHISON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"And sweating those left behind.  follow.  has no justification for that statement  ther with that aspect of the question. I want to devote special attention to the Tariff. Honourable members appear to be practically unanimous on the point that the details of the Tariff should be left severely alone during this debate, and it has been said more than once that we shall be able to deal with them more satisfactorily later on. A singular feature of the debate is that so far we have not had one speech in support of the Tariff. When I first saw it I was amazed. I was under the impression that since the Commonwealth had incurred the expense incidental to the appointment of a Commission to investigate the working of the Tariff, the Government of the day, in bringing down the revision proposals, would, at""least, have had some regard to the recommendations of that industrious body, which devoted nearly three years to its work. The Government, however, have done nothing of the kind. They seem to have proceeded in haphazard fashion to frame a Tariff, adding 5 per cent, here, and 10 per cent, there, and taking various items off the free list. They do not' appear to have considered the probable effect of a Tariff so framed. That, I am sure, is the opinion of the public generally, for neither protectionists nor free-traders are satisfied with the Government proposals. that The old Tariff was more acceptable than is the present one to a number of protected industries. Another point to be remembered is that, whilst the'duties under it in some cases were high, and in others fairly substantial, there was a distinct free list. In the Tariff now before us, however, raw materials are taxed to such .an extent that the increased protection of 15 per cent, given in many cases to industries in which those raw materials are used is not likely to be of any advantage to them. The honourable member for Kooyong expressed the view that the Government would not secure from this Tariff as much revenue as they estimated. I have no hesitation in saying that, if it be passed in its present form, the revenue from it during the first, or at all events the second, year of its operation will be at least £1,000,000 in excess of that estimated by the Treasurer.  that it will produce nearly £1,000,000 in excess of the revenue obtained last year naturally - from the old Tariff.  it will lead to an increase of nearly £2,000,000. Every one associated with our manufacturing industries knows that today they are rushed with work. In a vast majority of cases orders have to be booked some time ahead, and thus there is every reason to believe that, although heavy duties have been imposed on many manufactures, enormous quantities of such goods must continue to be imported. The Tariff has been designed especially to suit the interests of Victoria. It is not by any means an Australian Tariff. The framers of it do not appear to have taken into consideration the ramifications of industry and the difficulties which those engaged in our primary industries have to face. They are penalized in every direction to such an extent that, unless the Tariff be considerably modified, it will very seriously affect them. Before proceeding to deal with the details of the Tariff, I. wish for a moment to discuss the question of revenue. It is estimated that we shall receive this year from all sources a revenue of £ i 3 > 7 4 5 > > or an increase of £ 9 1 2 , 9 3 4 as compared with the returns for last year. standing this estimated increase, however, the outlook for the States is by no means satisfactory. The people of Australia, according to the Treasurer's estimate, are to be taxed to the extent of nearly £1,000,000, although, in my opinion, the proposed taxation will nearly double that amount. But this year the surplus revenue returned to the States will be only £ 1 0 3 , 9 9 2, as compared with £ 8 0 5 , 7 6 6 returned to them last year, and of that amount South Australia will receive only ,£239. In connection with the consideration of these figures, .ithe question of interest on the transferred buildings is naturally brought to mind. I know that it is argued-and up to a certain point it can be argued with a good deal of force-that the payment for such buildings as post and telegraph offices, and defence works by the Commonwealth would be a mere bookkeeping entry; that if the Commonwealth were to pay the States Governments at a valuation, or were to take over fromi them a proportion of their debt equivalent to the value of the buildings, and pay the interest-it would simply be like the taking of money out of one pocket and putting it into another. only true until the Commonwealth ""arrives at what may be called the vanishing point in respect to the surplus revenue which it returns to the States; and, so far as South Australia is concerned, the Surplus is reaching vanishing point this year, inasmuch as it is estimated that that State receive only £ 2 3 9 more than she is entitled to under the Braddon section. So long as the surplus returned to the States was large, it was immaterial whether the Commonwealth paid for the transferred buildings or the States paid the interest on them out of the surplus which the Commonwealth handed over. But the moment the surplus vanishes, we shall be in this position. The States will not receive any more than the three-fourths to which they are entitled under the Constitution, but, at the same time, they will have to pay the interest on money represented by the transferred buildings which the Commonwealth holds. Now, that is not a proper position in which to put the States. Some effort should be made to bring about a satisfactory arrangement. It is singular that the Commonwealth, under different Governments, should have been in existence for seven years, and should have 200 as yet failed to arrive at a valuation on account of the transferred properties. I do Notwith- not know the cause of the delay, but it is astonishing that a fair estimate has not yet been determined. It has been recently stated by a Minister that it is expected, at an early date, to arrive at a fair valuation. But, in the meantime, the Commonwealth has the use of the buildings. We have arrived at the stage when we ought to pay to the States interest on the capital thus represented. Otherwise, the States will have to f all back upon local taxation for the purpose of making up the loss. I do not think it is fair that they should be put in that position. If the Government carries its penny postage proposal, it must lead to an enhanced expenditure on account of the Post and Telegraph Department. Penny postage would involve a greater voiume of correspondence. Whether the additional revenue would make up the loss occasioned by the reduction of the rate from 2d. to i d . . is a matter about which I have - grave doubts. At any rate, the loss could not be made up for a considerable time. The increased volume of correspondence would involve additional expenditure for the carriage and delivery of mails over this vast continent. But that is Consequently, we have to anticipate diminished revenue and increased expendi-. ture if the Government proposals are carried. Personally, I am not in favour of penny postage, until it can be demonstrated that the receipts will be nearer to the expenditure than the information now will before us discloses. Any Post Office deficiency in consequence of the introduction of penny postage would have to be made up by the community at large, and not the people who would derive the chief benefit from the reduction.",27
109,Sir JOHN FORREST,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"The Post Office receipts exceeded the expenditure last year. Mr - POYNTON - But I have just rewoollen piece-goods, n.e.i. ferred to the fact that the Commonwealth has paid no interest on the buildings it occupies.",29
110,Sir JOHN FORREST,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"We have paid £6,000,000 to the States.  this year £239 above the three-fourthsamounting due to it, with which to pay interest buildings transferred to the Commonwealth. That amount is obviously insufficient. It is problematical whether the volume increased correspondence would, for a siderable time, reach the point when would be a revenue equivalent to the ditional expenditure. The reduction the postage rate would mean hundreds thousands of pounds to business men, to the ordinary working man and the farmer the benefit would be a mere bagatelle. any loss has to be made up the Commonfree wealth Government will fall back upon the Customs House, and the clerk office will have to pay as much towards United Kingdom. making up the deficiency as the man who perhaps pockets thousands of pounds as a direct result of penny postage. Therefore, until it can be demonstrated that the receipts will approximate to the expenditure, I shall vote against the posals of the Government. I have a word or two to say on preferential trade. The members of the Government must not take to heart what I intend to say, but the more I study the preference proposals of the Ministry the more I am satisfied United Kingdom. that they are a delusion and a sham. While they pretend to grant a preference to Great Britain, as compared with foreign powers, the Government have, under Tariff, struck - the United Kingdom more severe blow in the matter of trade Kingdom: than it has received for many years. I will prove that statement from the schedule of duties before us. I have gone to some trouble to find out the origin of the ports which I shall mention. Take parel and attire, woollens. Last year imported to the value of £1,437.000. Last Of this amount £1,083,000 was imported from the United Kingdom. The GovernOf ment propose to increase the duty on those imports from 25 per cent, to 40 per by cent., and to raise the duty against imports from foreign countries to 45 per cent. In other words, it is proposed to give the United Kingdom an advantage of 5 per cent., as compared with foreign powers, but to increase the duty against Great Britain by 15 per cent. Next, take The imports last year amounted to £1,900,000, of which which quantity £1,590,241 came from the . United Kingdom. The Government propose to increase the Tariff against those goods from 15 to 30 per cent. In other words, there is a proposed increase to 100 per cent. in. the duty on against the goods of the United Kingdom, although Great Britain is given a preference of only 5 per cent, over foreign imports. of Let me take the item of cotton and linen conpiece goods. Last year the importations there under this heading were valued at ad- £3,209,000, of which £3*017,517 worth of came from the United Kingdom. In this of instance, the duties have been increased but from 5 and 10 to 25 per cent., notwithstanding that under the old Tariff a large If quantity of cotton goods was upon the list. In respect of flannels the imports last year were valued at £52,000, of in an which £42,000 worth came from the Yet the duty upon these goods has been increased from 15 to 30 per cent. The importations of flannelette last year aggregated a value of £253,000, of which £203,000 worth were of British origin. In this instance, prothe duty has been increased from 15 to 30 per cent - a n advance of 100 per cent, upon the original rate of duty. Last year the importations of coatings, vestings, and trouserings, were .valued at £92,000, of which £72,000 worth came from the Here again the duty has been increased from 15 to 30 per cent. In the matter of trimmings, mantles, dress, bonnets, & c , the total imports last year the were valued at £282,000 of which a £111,000 worth came from the United Yet the duty upon these articles has been increased from 15 to 20 per cent. The total imports of carpets and carpetings last year were valued at im- £124,000, of which £115,000 worth were apof British manufacture. The duty upon we these materials has also been increased. year, the importations of floorcloths, coverings, & c , were valued at £319,894, which £304,000 worth came from the United Kingdom. Yet the Government (have increased the duty upon these articles from 15 to 30 per cent. Cannot honor .able members see that under this Tariff we .shall obtain an enormously increased revenue? Where are the industries in Australia to cope with such' a great volume of trade? I say that even if higher duties --increased the local output to some extent a very much larger revenue must be - collected, at any rate, for a time. The total imports last year of earthenware, brownwate, and stoneware were valued at £ 1 4 3 , 5 8 2, of which £ 1 1 6 , 0 0 0 worth came from the United Kingdom. Upon these articles the duty has been increased from 20 to 30 per cent, in the case of British manufactures, and to 35 per - cent, in the case of goods of foreign origin. Last year, the imports of galvanized iron, plate and sheet, represented a value of ^£1,245,211, of which-the United Kingdom .supplied £ 1 , 0 2 8 , 8 0 6 . The duty upon this material has been increased from 15s. per ton to 20 and 25 per cent, in the case of British! and foreign goods, respectively, which represents an advance in the rate of duty of more than 100 per cent. similar remark is applicable to galvanized - that is, plain sheet iron, not corrugated - the importations of which last year were valued at £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 , of which £ 1 1 worth came from the United Kingdom. Upon this line, which was formerly free, - duties' of 15 and 20 per cent, respectively have been imposed in respect of British and foreign goods. These materials are in every day use, and must continue to be imported for a considerable time, despite any duty that may be levied upon them. Under the heading of socks and stockings, I find that the imports last year were valued at £ 3 1 1 , 4 1 2, of which ,£305,000 worth came from the United Kingdom. Yet the duty in respect of these articles has been from 25 to 30 per cent. ports, of towels, and handkerchiefs, cotton and linen last year aggregated a value of £ 1 9 9 , 0 0 0 of which the United Kingdom supplied £ 1 8 0 , 7 2 4 . Here again the duty - has been increased. In the case of blankets and blanketing, the old rate of duty has been advanced from 15 to 30 per cent, notwithstanding that of the £ 5 3 , 0 0 0 worth imported-last year£49,ooo - worth were of British origin. I come now to a number of other instances which will 'serve to show the enormity of the imposts - which are being levied upon 'British goods Last year, the total imports of portable and traction engines were valued at £ 1 0 8 , 0 0 0 of which £ 8 7 , 0 0 0 worth came from the United Kingdom. Yet the duty upon these engines has been increased 25 to 30 per cent. Last year the total importation of the parts of these engines was valued at £ 6 2 8 , 3 0 1 , of which the United Kingdom supplied £ 3 9 5 , 1 0 2. In respect of these parts, the duty has been increased from 1 2 per cent, to 25 per cent. in.the 1 case of British goods, and 30 per cent, in the case of the foreigner. I now come to that most useful article wire-netting. Last year, the total imports were valued at £521,788 , of which the United Kingdom supplied £ 3 7 8 , 8 4 7 worth. Under the old Tariff, this commodity was free, but under the present Tariff, it is dutiable at 25 per cent, in the case of British goods, and 30 per cent, in the case of goods of foreign origin. Surely the sham nature of the prefernce proposals of the Government is demonstrated by these figures? Whilst they have imposed an additional 5 per cent, upon metals of foreign manufacture, they have advanced the duty upon metals A from Great Britain by five times that amount. I say that there is more cant talked about extending a preference to the goods of the mother qountry than there 1 , 0 0 0 is about any other political question. The Australian manufacturer does, not care a tinker's curse where these goods come from. If they are a menace to his trade, he desires that protective duties shall be levied upon them. He is equally anxious that all his raw material should be placed upon the free list. Every manufacturer in short, is a free-trader so far as his raw material is concerned, but a protectionist in the matter of everything that he desires to sell. Let us assume that the present duty upon wire-netting had been operative last year. There is only one manufactory of wireincreased netting in Australia, and the owners of The im- it have considerably more to do now than they can cope with. Although there has been a vast increase in the duty, they have kept all the time within a margin of the top price, although they have a big market in Australia for their product. I refer to Lysaght Brothers, of New South Wales.  orders that were given to them.  I venture to say that even if this extra duty had been imposed before, the wire-netting I am speaking of must have come in. I want to show what this increased duty means to the farmer-the primary producer, the man who has to battle in the back country against rabbits, and very often ' must take inferior land because he cannot get any better. He has quite enough of hard times to contend with without being taxed as he will be under this proposition. Assuming that we import this year as much wire-netting as we imported last year from the United Kingdom, the duty of 25 per cent, proposed by the Government on manufactures from the United Kingdom would represent £94,711. If we take the duty of 30 per cent, on the wire-netting to the value of £142,943 which came from foreign parts, the receipts would amount to £42,882.",29
111,Sir JOHN FORREST,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Thos e are not all foreign countries. A good deal comes from Canada and New Zealand.  far as the Tariff is concerned.  Zealand receive preference?  on last year's imports on the basis of the new duties proposed would have been £137,593. Recently a question was put in the Senate as to the number of hands employed in the wire-netting industry in Australia. The answer was that 656 hands were employed, not only in wire-netting, but in wire-mattress making, bird-cage making, wire-nail making, and a number of minor industries of a similar nature. Consequently, 656 hands represent the whole of the men and boys in the wireworking industry in Australia. Assuming that the whole of them were engaged in the manufacture of wire-netting, this impost on the unfortunate farmer, who has to go out into the back-blocks, and battle against vermin, is equivalent to the payment of a bonus of £209 14s. per head per year for every man and boy engaged in those establishments in the making of nails, bird-cages, wire mattresses, and wire-netting. Is this House going to tolerate such a thing? Are we going to allow our pioneers to be plundered in this way? If I base my calculation on the actual basis of the hands employed in the manufacture of wire-netting onlyprobably about half of the hands in the .wire-working industrythat amount of duty is equivalent to a bonus of something like £456 per year for every man and boy employed. And for what? For an industry that has already more work than it can cope with, that cannot supply all the orders now forwarded, and that was built up without a - duty at all. The Chairman of the Tariff Commission himself said on the floor of this House that this duty was recommended, not because it was asked for, or because of any special merits as disclosed by the evidence, but, as he said, "" because if we did not put it on, it would be complained that we had. left the New - South Wales industry out of consideration.""  are going to saddle a duty on the whole of the Commonwealth to please one manufacturer in New South Wales.  that the new duties on the basis of last year's returns represent £209 14s. per head for every one employed in the wireworking industry, which the farmer would have to pay for his netting before he could get it. New Mr SAMPSON - Is that on the present output ? ",31
112,Mr SAMPSON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"What would be the bonus on the probable consumption?  the output will increase on that of last year. Representing, as I do, a district where you might as well throw the wheat into the sea as attempt to grow it without using wire-netting, I. say without .hesitation that, having to buy wire-netting, even at first cost, means a tax on the farmer equivalent to from 2d. to 3d. an acre rent, in order to keep the vermin out. On top of that, the Government want to load him up with these duties of 25 per cent, and 30 per cent., or an equivalent of £137,000 to be paid by the farming community. It is one of the most monstrous duties that could be imposed, and when the House sees it in its true light, it will get very short shrift. There is another aspect of this Tariff to be considered. We talk a lot about placing the people on the land. The Government say that we require population. TEey say that what we need is a good yeomanry. I agree with them in that. But how does this Tariff appeal to men who want to go on the land? What inducement can they total see in it to help them on to the land? If a man secures a block of land, I have already indicated the increased tax he will have to pay on his fence at the outset to protect him against vermin. The price of the implements which he requires to work the farm is also to be increased. The manufacturer must have his machinery from the best makers in the world. He must get the very best and most up-to-date machinery, and must have it on the free list. But the farmer must take his machinery from the local manufacturer, who has every opportunity with the high duties to charge higher prices.",31
113,Mr HUTCHISON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"The only free machinery is that used in hat-making.  the only industry which enjoys a rebate equivalent to the duty on the machinery, is that of hat-making.",32

118,Mr FOYNTON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,Then the Minister admits the truth of w'hlat I say.,32
119,Mr MAUGER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"The market is so contracted that it is impossible to distribute directly-the cost is too great to the manufacturer, and also to the purchaser.  the case of the young farmer. If a settler desires to build a house for himself and his family, he finds himself confronted with increased duties on the whole of the material he requires. There are many places in Australia where stone or brick is not available, though, even in the case of stone and brick houses, there is an extra cost, consequent upon the Tariff, of £ 3 on the roofing, and also in regard to the wood required. . I consulted three different builders as to the present cost of erecting [96] an ordinary four-roomed cottage at Kalgoorlie, Broken Hill , or in Queensland, where brick or stone is not available, and I was informed that the additional cost amounts to £ 3 0 or £ 4 0 .  used ?   timber suitable for the purpose?  ber knows that Queensland timber was not available when required in the furniture trade.",32
120,Mr SAMPSON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"It is stated that the forests of Queensland are better than those of New Zealand, from the point of view of the cabinet-malker.  local timber available for building in Queensland.  South Australia, the imported timber is nearly always used for building purposes, and in this connection the Tariff hits the settler very badly. Then the miner finds himself under similar disadvantages. At Broken Hill, for instance, the duty on timber is a very serious matter. Owing to the immense width of the lodes, in many instances hardwood timber cannot be used.",32
121,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"What the miners want is timber which creaks before it breaks.  place 400 feet wide, propped up with Oregon timber, which, by its creaking, gives sufficient warning of danger before it gives way, whereas hardwood snaps off at once. It will be seen that, under these circumstances, the duty on Oregon timber is very severe. Then, with low grade ores, the best machinery is necessary; and here we have a problem which faces those interested in mining in Western Australia. This problem has to be met either by a reduction of wages, or by procuring up-to-date machinery which will do the work at less cost. I venture to say that, in order to get the necessary machinery, it is necessary to go abroad; .but, then, those who require machinery have to face a duty of 25 per cent., and pay several other charges before they can get to work. As I said earlier in my speech, the Tariff is ill-conceived, inasmuch as it does not even give the protection it pretends to give. One manufacturer in my constituency produces strippers, but the duty on his raw material takes away all the advantage which the Tariff pretends to give him. I have here a piece of imported steel, which has to through nine stages of manufacture until it is ready for the market. steel bears a duty of 2^d. per lb., and, although this manufacturer has tried his utmost to get a locally manufactured article, he cannot do so.",32
122,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Where does that steel come from?  from America and some from England. This manufacturer was informed that the steel was turned, out locally, but he out that the local steel cost him 8d. lb., and, moreover, would be of nothing like, the quality of the English or American product. The particular piece of steel which I have here is American; and it costs five cents, a pound in the country origin. Here we have a case, in which, although there is a duty on the manufaccharges tured machine, the taxation through the Custom House on the raw materials recharges moves all the supposed advantage. As matter, of fact, this manufacturer would sooner work under free-trade conditions than under the, severe handicap of a duty on his raw material.",33
123,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"The bootmaker has a similar complaint in so far as there is a duty on the leather which he-uses, while, of .course, the manufacturer of leather also requires the duty.

I am quoting figures from That raw an invoice bearing the Customs Department stamp, and it shows that the additional impost charged on this"" consignment as the result of the increased rates under the new Tariff amounted to £ 5 1 16s. 9d., or nearly 100 per cent, more than the duties chargeable under the old Tariff rate. The gentleman. who imported these goods has supplied me with figures showing the actual- transport cost. I take another invoice for goods arriving from Liverpool on the 24th found August by the Everton Grange. The total per invoice value of the goods amounts to £ 1 0 18s. 6d., anct on these there were the following charges made:-Packages , £ 1 14s. 6d.""; inland carriage in England, 13s. 4 d . ; ocean freight to Adelaide, £ 5 of 16s. 6 d . ; bank exchange and marine insurance, 5 per cent., 19s. 3 d . ; landing at Port Adelaide, wharfage, agency and cartage to Adelaide, £ 1 10s.; or total - amounting to £ 1 0 13s. 7d. on a goods - valued at £ 1 0 18s. 6d. It should be remembered that these-goods were chiefly jugs and other crockeryware in universal use, and requiring to be replenished probably more often than any other articles in the same line. The figures I have given show a total transport cost representing nearly 100 per cent, upon the actual cost of the goods. I have another invoice of similar goods to the value of ' £ 5 8 10s. This is submitted as a sample of the charges^ on the consignment of goods from America, I which arrived at Port Adelaide on the 26th two August from New York, by the Kazembe. This consignment consisted of butter dishes, basins, and such ware for table use, and the charges in connection with this shipment were---packages , £ 1 1 7s. i d . ; inland carriage in America, £ 1 0 14s. i d . > ocean freight to Port Adelaide, £ 3 1 3s. 6 d . ; bank exchange, marine insurance, 5 per cent., £ 5 12s.; landing charges at Port Adelaide, wharfage, agency, and cartage to Adelaide, £ 7 13s. 9d., or a total o l £ 6 6 1 os. sd.

I venture to say that every that line of crockeryware and stoneware will quesbe found-to give similar results - There is no escaping these figures, as honourable members may, if they please, see them set forth in the original stamped invoices.",33
124,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Invoice s on which duty was charged and paid.  one case, as I have already said, the additional amount due to the new Tariff was paid under protest, and the invoice will be found to be marked by the Customs officials, "" Received under protest."" When we come to consider the detailed items of the Tariff I am sure that similar results will be found to arise in connection with other lines of goods. While I recognise that protection is the policy of Australia, I wish to draw a line between protection and prohibition. So far as I can learn from the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission, there have been no languishing industries in Australia, - and they were all going on well under the old Tariff. Notwithstanding all the criticisms of that Tariff, it was producing good results. Two or three manufacturers in Australia in a large way of business have informed me that they would prefer the old Tariff, with its extensive free list, under which they could import their raw material, and many of their tools of trade, duty free, to the Tariff now submitted. I venture to say that so far as the primary producer is concerned, this is one of the most oppressive Tariffs ever introduced in Australia. It would be bad enough if its effects were confined to Victoria, but when honourable members come to consider the great extent of Australia, and the disadvantages and difficulties attending the development of the country in many remote districts, they can jrealize how burdensome this Tariff must be on many of those connected with our primary industries. I take, for instance, the duty on cream separators, and I ask whether we are going to manufacture those machines here?",34
125,Mr MATHEWS,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Yes , as many as the honourable member pleases.  able member is not aware that there are very few of these machines manufactured in Great Britain, in spite of the wonderful advance in manufactures which has taken place in the old country. I have here a statement from which it can be seen that - the cream separators sold in Australia in 1906 were valued at £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and yet machines to the'value of only £ 1 5 , 0 0 0 or £ 1 8 , 0 0 0 were imported from Great B r i - tain. I may inform the honourable member [ 6 ] -2 9 for Melbourne Ports that only the finest class of steel can be used in the 'manufacture of these machines, in consequence of the extremely high rate of speed at which they are run. Swedish steel is usedin their manufacture, and the greater number of them are imported from Sweden.. H ad there been a duty on cream separators last year, not one of these machines would have been made in the Commonwealth, although the unfortunate dairymen of Australia, who often-perhap s with wife and family-hav e to work from daylight to dark, would have had to pay £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 more for them, in addition to the indirect charges which, no doubt, they would have been called upon to bear. The possibility of having these machines manufactured in Australia is not contemplated, and why, then, should the dairying industry be penalized? If protective duties are to be imposed, let them be imposed for the protection of industries which have a chance of succeeding in Australia. Do not let us unduly burden primary industries-as has been proposed in connection with the duty on wire netting-for the benefit of an insignificant manufacturing industry. Why should the whole Commonwealth pay 2d"" per dozen more for matches than was charged prior to the introduction of the Tariff, merely to' benefit thirty or - forty hands who are receiving a few shillings a week in a small Richmond factory ? I trust that the Committee will so modify the Tariff as to greatly reduce the burden of the producers and consumers of Australia. I am sorry that we cannot tear it to pieces at once. While we are talking generalities, the public is being overcharged. We have heard a great deal about the political grab in connection with the increase of the parliamentary allowance, but it was nothing to the grab of the tradespeople under the Tariff. Hundreds of them have increased prices on goods upon which no extra duty was paid, anil even on goods which are not dutiable under the Tariff. This robbery of the public will continue until finality is arrived at in regard to the duties. I trust that, whatever Tariff is agreed to, it will remain for a number of years.",34
126,Sir JOHNFORREST,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"That will not happen, because Tariff alteration is too good a subject for politicians.

136,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I admit at in once, although it does not touch my arguapment, that it was stated afterwards-pos before, although it did not come to of the my ears-that in this State there were strangled industries, and industries which were dying; because jof the competitjiflhi The Tariff Commission was very cautiously appointed, and I think that the House anomascrutinized, its constitution with very Everybody recollects that it was made' up of four recognised free-traders and four recognised protectionists, and it was hoped that one of the results of its appointment would be that not only would the anomalies be removed, but that many so-called injustices would be remedied. But I ask honourable members to recollect that where we appoint experts, or men who are qualified and willing to hear expert opinion, weigh the pros and the cons, and arrive at something like a judicial determination thereon, they are much more eminently fitted, than is any advocate of a particular cause, to decide what is just and reasonable with regard to any question submitted. We ought not to forget that the Commission was at work for two years and a half, and that it had advantages which no member of the House can have; because, whatever one-sidedness there may have been in the minds of the free-traders, was counterbalanced by the equally strong views of the protectionists, and vice versa. We had, if it ever could be obtained in human affairs, a well-balanced body of intellect, specially appointed, with the power of extracting the truth from evidence given under oath, and arriving at balanced conclusions as to what was just and fair to all. concerned.",35

140,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,And a prohibitionist.,36
141,Mr MAUGER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,Who says so?,36
142,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,I do.,36
143,Mr MAUGER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,The honourable member has no right to say so.,36

146,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"The Tariff Commission, I repeat, was in the nature of a 'jury, which was itself put under oath, which put its witnesses under oath, and which was equally balanced in regard to two conflicting fiscal doctrines. Can the opinion of the honourable member for Maribyrnong, such as he has just expressed, be placed by any rational person side by side for one moment with the judicial opinion of a body of eight men who were under oath themselves, and had heard evidence under oath, with regard to the matters committed to their care? The Commission ought to have been to this Chamber a guiding star. No one can gainsay,, without uttering an untruth, that it was'a balanced body of men.",36
147,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,Balanced ?,36
148,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I repeat that the Commission was a balanced body of men, because it contained four free-traders and four protectionists; and now, after knowing most of those gentlemen as legislators for nearly seven years, I should find it very difficult to say which of them has the stronger convictions. It strikes me that they are allmen with somefirmnessof character, and strength of views, and that they brought these qualities to bear on the work of the Commission. If honourable members seriously consider the position in which the country is today they must honestly say "" The Commission was appointed by the Government of the day, sat for two years and a half, and brought up certain recommendations into which they threw all their knowledge and ability. We shall not and cannot enter into those details for ourselves, but will accept their conclusions as a fair solution of a very thorny and difficult question which has been submitted to Parliament.""",36
149,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Whic h conclusions ? Mr BRUC E SMITH - I am coming to that in a moment. The other evening the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, in answering a question as to what the Tariff Commission had said, gave asan answer 1 the conclusion which the protectionist portion of it had come to; and I took exception at the time by an observation as to the impropriety of speaking of the conclusion of any part of the Commission as the conclusion of the whole Commission.",36
150,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"That was reasonable. Mr BRUC E SMITH - The very essence of the Commission was that it was a complete body, with, as I say, the balanced corporate judgment of protectionists and free-traders. But whenever the free-traders alone or the protectionists alone have come to a conclusion, I think that the Committee has a perfect right to say, ""In that case you are not' the Commission; you are only part of it, and although we wiTl not reject your deductions, we think it necessary to look into the evidence to see on what grounds you acted."" .",36
151,Mr HUTCHISON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"And then it might be fair to say. "" You are both wrong.""",36
152,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"It might be, but I do not think we need lay down a stereotyped answer until we have made an examination. The honourable member will admit that if the four Commissioners who were opposed to his fiscal views came to different conclusions, he would be not only entitled but under an obligation to examine into them to see how far those Commissionthat ers had gone wrong. It has been clear to us, I think, why in a great many cases the free-trade quartette, as I shall them, came to a different conclusion from that arrived at by the protectionist quartheir tette."" After the examination-in-chief of a very large number of witnesses the freeof traders entered upon a very severe crossupholding examination of the witnesses, and founded their conclusions on the primary dence and the cross-examination combined, whilst, according to one .auber thority here, the protectionist quartette both sections. confined their consideration evidence in chief.

We enabled the Commission to put the witnesses on oath in order that the Commissioners might have a better chance of eliciting the truth. And if , as the honourable member for Perth states, there were many cases of the kind I have indicated, they should induce honourable members not only to accept the finding!: of the Commission where the eight members were unanimous, but to look with great scrutiny into those cases in which the findings of one part of the Commission have been based upon the evidence in chief of a number of witnesses who, under cross-examination, have shown that their first representations were-well , not true, to put the mildest construction upon them. have had put into my hand the terms of the Commission.

When the Labour leader told us candidly that it was their intention to cut down considerably the proposed duties upon many items affecting fiscal question. the expenditure of the working classes, I began to feel that at least one factor at work in the direction of emasculating this extravagant production Prime Minister. It is important, however, to bear in mind that, although the expectation of the attitude of the Labour with a view to a land tax was almost universal, yet as soon as the Tariff 'was announced a cry went up against the high duties proposed, not only from the cantile class but from the working throughout the whole Commonwealth. At - a later stage I shall quote from 'the otherwise.

228,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,I cannot laughing.,44
229,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"It is the scheme of the Acting Prime Minister's political life to keep this question open as a wound.

If honourable members were not divided on this question, would anybody expect the Acting Prime Minister, or the men around him, to be in office as representing the political wisdom be of this Parliament'?

Whether the theory be pracarrangement ticable or not, I shall endeavour to show at another time; but the contribution of honourable member under this head was most valuable, because it shows that the by the Acting Prime Minister. ultimate object of the honourable member his party is to tack on to the duties, ever low these may be, a provision which will enable part of the duties to be shared by the working classes whom he represents. I shall have some observations to make hereafter in regard"" to the practical bility of this"" new protection, and, therefore, I shall not go into detail now. I desire show that I have not come here to merely advocate my own views"", but to' acknowledge placed before the Premiers. the light thrown on the question by other honourable members. The right honourable member for Swan made an admission, from his own point of view, which is a veritable search-light on Federal history. The fisht honourable member has been in office five years out of nearly seven, and, although .that fact has been the subject of much persiflage, he nevertheless made the admiscourse sion, which is important, whole'life of this Federal Parliament there has. never been one Government in power with a working majority so as to be pendent in its executive and legislative 'action. "" Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The member stopped in office all the same ! - Mr BRUCESMITH - The admission ""of the right honourable member for Swan very important; and everybody who watched the progress of events will cognise its truth. When* the public a clear admission from one of our most prominent members, that during the whole of the seven years of Federation there never been a Government in power with a sufficient majority to enjoy or exercise tative expression of opinion. independence, either in legislative or executive work, it is, as I say, a search-, light on Federal history; and it leads to some rather important deductions which account for much in the past. The right honourable member also made another admission which I think ought to be emphasized for the information of honourable members. Acting Prime-Minister who, true to his diplomatic nature, always has a smile for pursues methods of his own; and think he ought to be reminded of the omission made by his late colleague, the honright honourable member for Swan. The in right honourable member told us that notthat he attended the Premiers' of Conference, and endeavoured to make an as to some substituted method - of dividing the Customs revenue after the the Braddon section has ceased to operate, the whole of that arrangement was broken up The right and honourable member further said-and this howought to give great weight to his revelation - that the scheme which he submitted to the Premiers of the different States had been submitted to the. Cabinet of. which he and the present Acting Prime Minister possiwere members; and that it had been endorsed by the present Prime Minister, the to - latter having actually written a letter appioving of the arrangement, and of its being But the moment the back of the right honourable member for Swan was turned-althoug h it is a fundamental constitutional principle that whatever a member of a Government may say in his Ministerial capacity is the voice of the Ministry itself-the Acting Prime Minister practically repudiated the arrangement, and he has told us, in the of the debate, that he regards is as. that during the "" impracticable.""",44
233,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,I am sure it is.,45

236,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"That does not touch the principle with which I am dealis ing. The Acting Prime Minister is always has some yards behind the point one has rereached in a discussion.

' Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I never knew it to ""be discussed there. - "" Mr BRUCESMITH - I can appeal to any member of the Committee to say whether that was not the statement made by the right honourable member for Swan. The right honourable gentleman further said that he had a letter from the Prime Minister confirming his proposal. But the moment the Prime Minister's back was turned, and the right honourable member for Swan left the Government, the Acting Prime Minister, in his confident manner, denounced the proposal as impracticable.",46
239,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I said it was not possible to do what was proposed, nor is it.",46
240,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"The occurrence throws a very interesting light on what I may refer to as the sense of constitutional propriety of the honourable gentleman who is now acting as Prime Minister. Then the right honourable member for Swan told us something further, which throws additional light on the delicate political and constitutional sense of the honourable gentleman who occupies the position of acting leader of this House. He said that he had refused to make provision in the Estimates for certain increments to public servants until the matter had been discussed by Parliament, because, according to his opinion, the question involved was one on which this House had a right to express an opinion.",46
241,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,That is not what he said at all.,46

243,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,I admit that the right honourable gentleman said that he had paid the smaller increments.,46
244,Mr TUDOR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"And other Treasurers had done, so before him. Sir George Turner paid them for four years.",46
245,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"He said there was a principle involved between those honourable which he paid and those which he refused to p a y ; but, instead of recognising the ' necessity for a continuity of policy in the Department, the Acting) Prime Minister not only provided for the increments on the Estimates, but actually paid them.",46
246,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,Sir George Turner also paid them.,46
247,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"If the Acting Prime Minister will allow me, I must say that his interjection does not touch my argument. What I am saying, now is that the honourable gentleman simply ignored the action of his immediate predecessor, and that is certainly not a recognised practice of Governments. Mr TUDOR. - In precisely the same way as the right honourable member for Swan ignored the action of his predecessor, Sir George Turner.",46
248,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"No , I do not think so.",46
249,Mr TUDOR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,The right honourable member for Swan told the honourable member so.,46
250,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,I think not.,46
251,Mr TUDOR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,I am sure of it.,46
252,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I think that all these speeches to which I have referred have been of very great value. The speech delivered by the acting leader of the Opposition was also a very valuable speech. I hope that honourable members of the Labour Party will reflect upon that portion of it in which the honourable member dealt with the effect of the measures adopted in New Zealand for the - purpose Of what is called ""disrupting"" the large estates. I think that byTiis speech the honourable member for Parramatta wa.« successful in pricking a bubble; because h,. showed that, although the policy which has g left been so strongly recommended is in force in New Zealand, it has not had the effect now anticipated for it. It has resulted in New Zealand only in a reduction of the size ot the estates sufficient to bring them within the provisions of the law', while they have still been left too large to give effect to the desire of the men who introduced the reform referred to. I pass away from that, because I wish to say something as to my own fiscal position. We have had_some expressions of opinion which I think"" have led to a little confusion as to the attitude of the men who gave utterance to them. The leader of the Opposition has taken up an attitude on this fiscal question with which I am bound to say I do not sympathize. Of course, on a great question of this kind, each of us is entitled to think and to say. just what he deems proper. We have reached a stage at which it is quite impossible to hope for an absolutely free-trade Tariff in this country at present, and possibly for many years to come. ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Never . - Mr Bruce SMITH - The honourable gentleman would appear to be even more cock-sure now than he was before dinner. I am not dealing with what the honourable gentleman thinks, but with what the leader of the Opposition said. The right honourable gentleman practically admitted that the constitution of this House can be taken as a reflex of the opinion of the Australian people on the fiscal question. He has said that protection and preference have spoken during the last election, and that this Parliament has a mandate from the Australian people to give them as much protection as they think"" proper. I differ tirely from that view, and for this reason. The right honourable member for East Sydney has frequently said before that he would make and had made the issue of the election Socialism versus anti-Socialism, and certainly no one did more than the honourable gentleman in that direction. He told the people everywhere that the fiscal question had been put on one side, and that the real question before the electors was ""Are you a Socialist or ah anti-Socialist?"" One of the consequences of making that question the issue of the election was that in New South Wales, which is the largest of the States, it was distinctly arranged that anti-Socialists should not demur to supporting protectionist candidates so long as they were anti-Socialists. Even some free-traders were opposed by the free-trade partu in New South Wales, because we knew that they were Socialists. The result in the case of New South Wales at least - and I am sure that in the other States the same thing prevailed-wa s that many honourable members were „ returned quite irrespective of their fiscal beliefs. "" They were returned upon the issue of Socialism and anti-Socialism. I say, therefore, that this House returned on that issue cannot be taken to represent the feelings of the people on another issue altogether. I am not so sanguine as to believe that when once a country has been committed to protection for any length of time it is easy, even if possible, to bring it back to free-trade, because the operation of a policy of protection creates protectionists. I can refer to typical instances in New South Wales. Three or four-importers in that State who were strong free-traders, finding their business as importers so checked that it was impossible for them to confine it to importing, deliberately established small industries for the manufacture locally of some goods which they had previously imported. Those men are today, if I may say so, rabid protectionists.",46
253,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Hear , hear.",47
254,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Does the Acting Prime Minister mean to approve my statement as a fact, or does he mean to express approval of what those people have done? What they have done they have done for self-interest. By conviction they are free-traders, but for political and business reasons they are now protectionists. Will honourable members contend' for a moment that because their en- personal interests are one thing and their intellectual convictions another, those men have changed their views from those of free-traders to those of protectionists, when they know that they are advocates of protection merely because they find it best suits their pocket, which is with them a vital consideration? Protection converts importers into manufacturers, and thus makes more protectionists. Every man, woman, boy, or girl who finds that his or her living depends on the maintenance of a particular industry naturally follows that particular fiscal cult which supports the enterprise from which he or she derives subsistence. Therefore, I do not expect that fo>"" perhaps many years to come there will be any close approach to free-trade. . But that does not affect my convictions. It is one thing to say what I believe to be right under certain conditions, and another thing to say what I believe to be practicable. An honourable member cannot say, "" Adam Smith is my Bible, and I insist on nothing short of free-trade''; but a practical politician may say, "" I regard free-trade as the ideal of commercial freedom, and part of the great body of freedom for which all Liberals fight. I cannot get all that I want, but I am willing to take the best that I can get."" We began Federation with the prospect of an Australian Tariff against the world. Free-traders lilke myself naturally said, ""Although I we aie living in a free-trade Colony, we so value freedom of trade between the Colonies that we are willing to risk some protection against the outside world in order to abolish the miserable fiscal barriers which now interfere with the free commercial dealings of the people of Australia. If we do this, we shall have gone some distance towards the achievement of our ideals."" No less a person than the Prime Minister, when addressing the Imperial Conference in London, said that if it would entertain the idea of Imperial free-trade, we in Australia would consider it. that it would be considered by protectionists generally. But the statement showed that, just as I and other free-traders were willing to take our chance of a Federal Tariff against the outside world in order to secure Inter-State free-trade, so there are protectionists as well as free-traders who are content to risk a Tariff against the outside world to obtain free-trade between all parts of the Empire, and thus gain the economic advantage of having every conceivable human need supplied within the King's dominions. The honourable member for Flinders, in answer to, I think, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, told the Committee that he has changed his fiscal views. That was his way of stating the position. My idea is that the honourable gentleman, though a free-trader at heart, recognises that to Victoria, at all events, protection is, at the present time, a necessity, and he is, therefore, prepared to accept the inevitable in regard to the Tariff. So, too, am I when I have done my best t'o make the duties as low as possible. It is not that I believe in tariffs; because I regard the perfection of liberalism to be absolute freedom of commerce An HONORABLEMEMBER - We want revenue, not protection.",47
255,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I agree with the honourable member. To obtain' revenue, even free-traders impose duties on such goods as stimulants and silks, which cannot be made in the country, so that the duties may not act protectively, and rear up hot-house industries at the expense of the public. A great many persons suppose, because they cannot get absolute free-trade, that every free-trader in Parliament has practically foresworn his opinions. I' pin my faith as much today as before I entered Parliament, to the doctrines which Adam Smith pioneered. But I recognise the practical difficulties of the case, as, I take it, the honourable member for F l in ders does. A quotation was made from a Hansard report of what he had said in the Victorian Parliament; but it must not be forgotten that his position as a member of that Parliament was entirely different from his position here. He was at that time a member of a Legislature controlling the affairs of one State only, in which protection had been established for over 30 years; today he is a member of a Legislature in which six States are represented, the largest of which, before entering the Union, I do not think was notoriously free-trade.",48
256,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,It is not so now.,48
257,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I shall not stop to argue with the honourable member on his assertion, though I have my own opinion on the subject, and believe that, apart from the conversions which have been made through people's pockets, New South Wales is today as great an advocate for .freedom of trade as it was prior to Federation. When Federation wasmooted, the great problem was how. to find the revenue which would be needed for Federal expenditure. W all remember the diffie culties over which Conferences and Conventions laboured in their endeavour to solve that problem. The late Mr James Service, one of the ablest politicians we ever had in Australia, spoke of it as the "" lion in the path."" He did not see how it was going to be solved. It was solved by the very simple proposition of the late Sir Edward Braddon. T have heard the provision which he caused to be inserted in the Constitution referred to as the Braddon "" b l o t "" ; but every constitutional student knows that but for that blot the States would not have federated. None of them, especially not the smaller States, would have dreamt of giving up their Customs revenue without being guaranteed the return of a large portion to meet ordinary Executive needs. As a compromise tending towards a settlement of the - question, the Braddon provision was limited to ten years. Therefore, when the States federated, it was upon the condition that the revenue colvocating it. lected from duties of Customs and Excise should be distributed by the three-fourths to the States, leaving one-fourth to meet the needs of the Commonable wealth Administration. We knew that for some years the States would be largely dependent on their share; and the ten years for which the Braddon section had force was regarded as a period during which each and all could look round and think out some new adjustment expenditure of "" the finances. We all came into this Parliament pledged to recognise the duty of imposing such a Tariff as produce sufficient revenue to return to States as much as would meet their needs. . In the first instance, it was thought that Tariff yielding £6,000,000 a year would give a sufficiently large return. needs of both the States and the Commonciples wealth have grown, and in the seventh year cf Federation we are approaching the time' when the Commonwealth will require whole of its one-fourth of the Customs revenue, and must determine whence it - shall get more revenue if more should be needed. I am sure that no thoughtful and members member of the Committee can to feel anxious for the future hears from certain honourable members a programme which involves an expenditure of many millions sterling. wrongly-m y own opinion is that it is wrongly, as I shall. endeavour to show a few moments-w e are told by the Labour - Party, who have dominated this since 1901, that we must not borrow any money. If we must not raise a loan - what that. are we to do? We are getting near the end of our fourth of the Customs . Excise revenue, and we have put behonorable fore us a programme including the taking over of the Northern Territory, the construction of a transcontinental to Western Australia, the payment of £500,000 on bounties, the establishment illustration. of the Federal Capital, and a variety of other expenditures with which we are familiar. One naturally asks oneself question, ""Where is the money to come from?"" That is a conundrum to which there is no solution, unless it is further taxation, reduced expenditure, or the taking over of a larger part of the Customs and Excise revenue by the Commonwealth.",48

276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"The Acting Prime Minister said that we should have a Tariff with from io to 15 per cent, duties. Mr BRU CE SMIT H - I remember that he did.",51
277,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I never said anything Of the kind. Mr BRU CE SMITH - The honourable gentleman must not be taxed too closely with what he said six years ago, because the principle on which he represents Hume involves many and frequent changes. Six years is too long a time to be forced to hold the same opinion when a man represents a constituency on the principle he adopts'. Mr Barton, both in New South Wales and in Melbourne, was advocating a fair compromise between the Tariffs of New South Wales and Victoria, and whilst Mr. O'Connor, who was afterwards a member of the Government, was deprecating the raising of the fiscal issue at all in New South Wales, the three gentlemen I have named were telling the people of Victoria and South Australia that a Tariff as high as that of Victoria was necessary, or-and here we have the old story again-the industries of this country would be ruined. We free-traders, who were actually supporting the candidature of Mr O'Connor, together with that of five out-and-out free-traders for the Senate, began to see which way the land lay; we began to see that, although Mr Barton might be disposed to do what was spoken of as "" the fair thing "" between New South Wales and Victoria, his colleagues were determined to drag him into extreme protection. We recognised immediately that we should have tp sit in opposition, but not necessarily to oppose the Government, provided it carried out the policy and observed the statements and undertakings of its chief. We soon discovered that the Government had no such intention; for whereas Mr Barton started with fine precepts, he ended with the most melancholy practice. He gave himself up entirely to these gentlemen as well as to the honourable member for Hume, now Acting Prime Minister, who told the people of New' South Wales that a 10 to 15 per cent. Tariff would be a fair one. Sir' WILLIAM LYNE - I have just said 'that that statement is not correct. - Mr Bruce SMITH - I saw it again and again in reports of the honourable member's speeches, just as I saw reported in the press his swashbuckling attitude when at Wagga Wagga, two or three days ago. I read the newspapers, and I keep these extracts as curiosities. It is quite natural that the honourable member should forget that he made such a statement. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - I did not make it, and the assertion is repeated regardless of the truth.",51
278,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"It is said that we undergo intellectual changes, and that if one tells an untruth often enough, one comes to believe it. And so, when a man tells the truth about a certain matter, but changes 'his views in regard to it after a Whilst lapse of many years, it is perfectly natural that he should forget that he had told the truth. I can afford to put aside the honourable member, and not allow him to disturb the course of my argument. We came down here, and what did we find? There was submitted to the House a Tariff which, instead of being a compromise between the people of New South Wales and those of Victoria, averaged, accordingto my own showing, 6 per cent, above the old Victorian Tariff. We, as a party, had to fight for twelve months* to reduce that Tariff. In that work we were assisted, among others of the Labour Party, by the honourable member for Grey. We fought for twelve months to bring down the Tariff to the level at which the leader of the Government had undertaken that it should be launched. Mr Barton was then in the hands of these honourable members to such an extent that he had not a will of his own, and could not do all that he wished. Then, again, he was beguiled by the three gentlemen I have named, and influenced slightly by the present Acting Prime Minister. I wish the Committee to remember that this has left a dangerously, sore place in the feelings of the people of New South Wales. It is not a matter for merriment, that more than 1,250,000 of the people of Australia should yet harbour a feeling of resentment in regard to that deliberate breaking' of a promise as to the nature of the Tariff which should be imposed upon them. Honourable members will recollect that the people of New South Wales already had to bear a land tax and an income tax, and that, - in order to justify those imposts,, duties' had been removed. I have just had put into my hands-and it is veryuseful-a n extract from a report of a speech made by the Acting Prime Minister, and published in the Sydney Morning Herald of 22nd January, 1901. honourable member for Hume then saidAn ideal policy of protection was out of question. The Tariff would have to 'be a moderate one, from io to 15 per cent.",51
279,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,I did not say that at all.,52
280,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I shall read it again, in order to show how the Sydney Morning Herald reported the honourable member.",52
281,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,We shall read speeches made by some honourable members of the Opposition.,52
282,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"So m e honourable members opposite seem to think that if anything unpleasant in regard to them is read to the Committee they can extricate themselves from an awkward position by reading something unpleasant about their opponents. I make the Minister of Trade and Customs a present of anything he can read concerning me, and shall accept his criticism in a much better spirit than that in which the Acting Prime Minister is accepting mine.",52
283,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,I am smiling.,52
284,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"It is a painful smile. This is what the Sydney Morning Herald, properly or improperly, attributed to the honourable member",52

The honourable memof ber had never been in a Ministry in which he could, had he possessed it, exercise dependence of thought upon that question.",52

291,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,The impartiality of this free-trade journal is fairly well shown by the fact that it gave the Acting Prime Minister a three-column report of his speech at Wagga last Saturday. That does not suggest bias or prejudice against him on the part of the Sydney Morning Herald.,52
292,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,The material was so good.,52
293,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Both reports appeared in the same newspaper. If this Committee were sitting as .a jury,' and had to give a verdict as to which of the two contentions was correct, I should be perfectly satisfied as to what its decision would be.",52

It behoves every one of us to look very closely into the position in order to what we should do or not do further, because, as long as we have this condition unrest touching the conditions of the people we certainly shall not, as a body inpolitic, progress as we might otherwise do. The secret of commercial success lies in the of what is ahead. If we are to have Tariff changes every five, six, or seven years, it follows that every, business man does - I care not whether he be a merchant I have prince or a - coffeestall-lkeeper-mus t be If .we are going to have the Tariff .changed in this way time to'time without, in some cases, rhyme or reason-and I shall show in a moment that there is no reason for the present change-the n the progress of this country will be very seriously retarded.

It is a very serious thing.",52
296,Mr WH IRVINE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,It is deplorable that it should be so.,53
297,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"It is truly deplorable. It is an example to other people of less importance.

Those very people in whom this feeling of antagonism is being created are all of , them our own constituents.

302,Mr HUTCHISON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,Does the honourable member think that it is justified?,53
303,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"That is another question. In political matters it is not always whether a feeling is justified that we have to consider, but whether it exists. The honourable member knows that some of the biggest struggles that have taken place ""in the world have arisen over very small things. They have begun in a very small way. Reprisals have been taken, and very soon conflicts have ensued, having ' social and political consequences over which 'it was impossible to exercise any control.

369,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"We all have our ideas as to the qualities which should be possessed by an Acting Prime Minister, and I will make no comment in that connection. But I repeat that the right honourable member for Swan told the Committee that he himself had made an arrangement with the Premiers of the States, under which the latter were to be guaranteed the return of a fixed sum annually after the expiration of the Braddon section of the Constitution.",56
370,Mr HUTCHISON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"He had no power to do that. Mr BRUC E SMITH - He told us that that arrangement had been thoroughly infeeling. dorsed by the present Prime Minister. Very naturally, therefore, the States thought that it would be likely the sanction of this Parliament. Whether that be so or not, the fact remains that it was put before a Conference of Premiers assembled for the purpose of disPrime cussing it. But the moment the right orable member for Swan vacated the office of Treasurer the arrangement was repudiactual ated by the Acting Prime Minister. The latter has declared in this House that would do the same tiring again, because the agreement arrived at is an "" impracticfingers able "" one. That is the data upon which am about to found an observation. Is it unlikely or unnatural that the leading ticians of the States should come to the ment. conclusion that they are being played with ? The honourable member for Swan, as Acting Prime Minister, called the Precame miers of the States together, to a Confergrievance ence, and made an arrangement with them, subject, of course, to the approval of Paraffairs. liament. But then the States found that, although the Prime Minister himself proved of the arrangement in writing, somebody who stepped into his place for ment ? a little term of power turned round, and on his own responsibility said, "" I ignore that act of the Acting Prime Minister, though it is confirmed by the Prime MinisFederal ter.""

That pretty state of things for the States to to deal with. They are very likely to say, "" God only knows who is governing this country, and managing its Executive affairs.""

378,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"They are trying to smite it now, but we shall be showing a little magnanimity if we try to soothe them without any reprisals. Another matter that has displeased New South Wales, apart from any other State, is the treatment of the Capital Site question^ with which I do not think we have dealt fairly.",58
379,Mr HUTCHISON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,I have no prejudice about that matter.,58
380,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I am not blaming anybody; I am not even blaming this Parliament.

382,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I do not want to go into the constitutional aspect of the choice, but this House had no power to choose a Capital Site until the Federal Territory had first been placed at its disposal. That is the ordinary reading of the Constitution.",58

"" Mr BRUCESMITH - The honourable member may say that if he chooses, but I shall not allow him to impute motives to me by saying that I know that what he says is true. Some of the ablest members of the Bar in New_South Wales have given the opinion that - it is absolutely essential that the Parliament of New South Wales should first place the territory at the disposal of the Federal Parliament before the Federal Parliament-can choose the .Capital Site. The honourable member has evidently not read the Constitution.  by the New South Wales Government.",58
386,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"L e g a l opinion in all the States is that the Capital Site has never been properljyi chosen. If it has been, it is quite open to the Commonwealth Parliament to put a stake into the ground. Why is that not done?  ber's own leader'said we should stick to our decision. ' Mr BRUCESMITH - What any leader said, has nothing to do with the legal position that I am putting. If the Com- ! monwealfhi Parliament has really done all' that is required, it can tomorrow take charge of the Capital Site. It has been dared over and over again to put a stake into the ground. To do so would raise the whole question for the decision of the High Court.",58
387,Mr HUTCHISON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"If that were done, the honourable member would tell us that it was the cause of more offence to New South Wales.",58
388,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"The honourable member is going from one question to another. If the Federal Parliament has really taken legal possession of the land, as asserted by the honourable member, who is not a legal member, and speaks much more confidently than legal members will on legal questions, how is it that the Commonwealth jExecutijve has never touched the ground? It cannot do so. It can physically, but the moment it does so it becomes a trespasser, and then the whole question is raised for the High Court to settle. If the honourable member asks the Prime Minister, or any other member of the Cabinet, why they do not put the pegs in the so-called chosen site, they will tell him confidentially why they do not do it. If the site was chosen three years the honourable authority to the choice?  honourable members are opposed to that site and wish to get another chosen.",58
389,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I shall not. stop to deal with the explanation which the honourable member so readily offers. Either no Capital Site has been chosen at a l ' or the one which was chosen is not touched by the Government, although the choice was made three years ago. The people of New South Wales'feel that they are being fooled over the matter. Rightly or wrongly, it is a grievance, because every one will admit that New South Wales is entitled to have the Capital within her boundaries. If site has been chosen, let the Government do something-to test their right, and then let us see what the High Court says about it. Perhaps then the honourable member for Grey will come to the conclusion he does not know as much law as he thinks he does. Why has Melbourne been retained as the Seat of Government ? Why is the site not chosen, or the one which, has been chosen not taken? We know very well the attitude of the press of this State on the subject. The Melbourne Age said that it was quite true the Constitution provided for the justice. selection of a Capital Site, but that Constitution did not say "" when "" the site had to be selected. The newspaper went on to say, "" We, of Victoria, ought to adopt the attitude of Shylock, and say, ' You can have your pound of flesh, but world. no blood.' "" That is the miserable, paltry, contemptible attitude assumed by the Melbourne Age.",58
390,Mr MAHON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,It is a very dishonest attitude.,59
391,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I am glad to hear the honourable member say so. The Melbourne Argus, as everybody knows, supported four candidates for the Senate, who deliberately advocated, in the very fore-front of their programme, an indethere finite postponement of the choice of the Capital Site. The Argus not only supto ported those four candidates, but menwith tioned that advocacy as one of their traders, merits.",59
392,Mr TUDOR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,But none of the four canIt didates were returned.,59
393,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I really do not turer. know what the names of the candidates were, not even the nature of their politics - neithe r fact touches the question. New South Wales is alive to what is going on; and it is very natural that the people of that State should feel aggrieved. The Western Australian Parliament has taken a step which points to the widespread satisfaction there is in regard to the Tariff. Did any one ever hear before of a .Parliasubsidy ment passing, by an overwhelming majority,' a condemnation of a Tariff which the Comnaturally, monwealth Parliament had the power to pass? Whichever State we go to we find evidence of dissatisfaction. Whether the people be right or wrong, foolish or wise, they are our constituents, and we ought try to prevent them entering into conflicts, whether of mere words or suggestive of a more substantial and serious character. It is part of our duty to remove causes of disthe pute and grievances. We ought to remember that originally we were promised a Tariff in the nature of a compromise between the fiscal arrangements of the greatest State and the next greatest State of the Comthat monwealth. From 1902 until the other day, we had a Tariff which was only reduced to its working proportions after a year's fighting, and that Tariff was, as introduced, 6 per cent, above the previous Tariff of Victoria. Whether we are free traders or protectionists, we ought not to allow our fiscal bias to prevent us doing There are 1,250,000 people in . the New South Wales, the bulk of whom we must remember have strong free-trade proclivities, and when the first Federal Tariff was passed they were enjoying greater fiscal freedom than any other country in the That is a fact which ought to be taken into consideration. I should like to say another word, in more detail, about the Tariff Commission. When that Commission was appointed by the then Prime Minister, who was the .right honourable member for East Sydney, he was asked whether the consumer would be considered, and he replied, ""Yes, certainly."" Thus it was part of the duty of the Commission to consider the consumer; but I submit that is a tendency on the part of Parliament, especially on the protectionist side, forget the consumer. I do not sav this any party feeling, because freeI admit, regard the fiscal question largely from the consumer's point of view. is the consumer whom we have first to consider, and next there is the manufacIt is unfortunate that, although many manufacturers and producers gave evidence in support of their claim for more - protection, the consumer was not at all represented, except in the minds of the Commissioners. No representative men who might. be said to reflect the feelings of the general public, came forward to lay their views disbefore the Commission. We free-traders, of course, look on protection as a form of which is given by the general public in order to start an industry, and, we feel that the man who has to pay the subsidy ought to be considered in regard to the amount to be paid. The - consumer has not been sufficiently considered; and, therefore, I say to the proto tectionists in the House-if there is any use in saying it-that when we are considering the propriety of particular duties, we should take into serious consideration the effect of the duties on the ordinary householder. Let us, by way of illustration, take the very homely domestic article of condensed milk. This milk, I suppose, enters into the economy of almost every working man's home, and, indeed, every other home, as child's food, or as a substitute for ordinary milk. We find that there are eight manufacturers of condensed milk within the Commonwealth. The duty under the last Tariff was i d . per lb., and it is a fact that the whole of the present manufacturers have declared that they require no higher duty. effect have been sent by the manufacturers broadcast, and have reached the Government ; and yet it is proposed that there shall be a further extra duty of i ^ d . per lb.",59
394,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,Why is that? ' Mr BRUCESMITH - That is what I want to know.,60
395,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,It is because they do not want any more competition.,60
396,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"The manufacturers say that under the old duty they were making a profit equal to the duty, and I am sure the honourable member for Macquarie cannot suspect the manufacturers of having any particular motive in not desiring any higher duty.",60
397,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"There is nothing to prevent them importing, is there?",60
398,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Does the honourable member mean to say, on his own authority, that those manufacturing firms import ?",60
399,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,I did not say there is nothing to prevent them importing.,60
400,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,But I am looking for a practical motive for their declining any higher duty. Why should people be burdened with a duty of i j d . on condensed milk-a n article which is used in every household-whe n the manufacturers do not ask for a higher duty?,60
401,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,The duty need not entail a higher price.,60
402,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I - hope the honourable member will - not make those economic reflections. is a very good illustration of the absurd way in which the Tariff has ibeen framed. The consumer has been forgotten; it is the man in constant touch with the Minister or his officers who can get what he asks, while the consumer may figuratively speaking "" g o hang."" The consumer is everybody, and, therefore, it is nobody's particular business to represent .i Budget. 2733 him; and this is a matter which ought to be taken into serious consideration by honourable members. We were told that there were many ruined industries in Victoria; and we all remember , the story told to the Tariff Commission by the representatives of the Denton Ha t Mills.",60
403,Mr FISHER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,Where are those hat mills?,60
404,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,In Victoria.,60
405,Mr TUDOR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"That , of course, is enough to condemn the duty.",60
406,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"It is not enough, though there is a good deal to Letters to_ that condemn. I should like to let honourable members know what this "" miserable, declini n g "" industry is doing. They should find the information somewhat interesting. I have here a copy of the company's report, which appeared in the Investors' Review * of Victoria, which shows that whilst the face value of the company's shares is £ 1 , their present market price is 38s. I find also that this Company, which we have been invited to believe has been .suffering so seriously, paid a dividend of 10 per cent, in 1904, in 1905, in 1906, and again in 1907. This year, in addition to the 10 per cent, dividend, the Company put away £ 5 0 0 towards an insurance reserve, and still had a balance of £ 1 , 0 1 3 0 1 u n "" divided profits. Honourable members will see that this declining industry really made enough profit to pay a 15 per cent, dividend, and yet, naturally, it wants more, and it will go on wanting more till further orders. so. I say Mr TUDOR - The honourable member does not mean to say that the Company could have paid 15 per cent, over the whole four years?",60
407,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"No , the Company paid a 10 per cent, dividend for each year mentioned, but put away enough this year to represent another 5 .per cent. Last year the Company put away £ 8 2 9 in the shape of undivided profits, in addition to £ 3 , 0 0 0 # paid in dividends. They put no money to an insurance fund that year, but they did Condensed milk set aside £ 1 0 0 for another purpose. I should be justified in saying that last year the Company might have paid a dividend of 13 per cent, or 14 per cent., and this year they made enough to pay a dividend of 15 per cent. If the interests of those engaged in manufacturing industries are to be kept in view in accordance with the - principles adopted by the Commonwealth, it may be that some protective duty is necessary, but should we make our protective wall so high as to enable this Company-becaus e the duty is a factor in enabling them to make their profits-to make the public pay so much for their head-gear that by manufacturing the article locally they can pay a dividend of io per cent., and put away additional profit equal to another 5 per cent., and nearly double the value of their shares?",60
408,Mr TUDOR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,I think the Company's shares have been at the present price for the last five years.,61
409,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"That only shows how prosperous they have been during that time. If the honourable member for Yarra knows anything of the share market, he must know that £ 1 shares do not go up to 38s. for nothing.",61
410,Mr FISHER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Sometime s they do. Mr BRU CE SMITH - Possibl y Ithe honourable member, for Wide Bay has been in some little mining investments. At all events the man who gives 38s. for a £ 1 share thinks that there is some substantial reason for the rise. The hat-making industry does not exhibit sudden rises and falls, and no parallel can be drawn between that industry and the gold-mining industry. I give this as another illustration to show that the public are being made to pay this larger sum because it is supposed that this particular industry is suffering a very great decline in its prospects. I wish to say that I think we are making a very great error in Australia in connection with our industries. If we are to consider the welfare of the race, the conditions under which our people labour, and the advantage of humanitarian legislation, we should try to induce our people to follow those occupations which are most healthful. That will be admitted as a general proposition. It will also be admitted that - there is no comparison between the healthgiving character of rural life, and that of life in a great manufacturing city. The people of Great Britain followed pastoral and agricultural pursuits as long as they could. It is only in the later history of that country, when pastoral and agricultural pursuits failed to maintain'the great population that had arisen, that they resorted to manufacturing pursuits.",61
411,Mr HUTCHISON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,The peasantry were cleared out in some cases in order to make deer forests,61
412,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I wish to say that the development of manufactures is a part of the later history of Great Britain, and was resorted to by the English people as a matter of necessity. If one visits such towns as Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, or Nottingham, he will notice that the people are anaemic and unhealthy as compared with, those who are to be seen in the rural districts. No one doubts for a moment that this is due to the life which people have to lead in the great manufacturing cities. No matter how carefully they 'may be provided for by regulations insisting upon smoke consumption and proper ventilation, they cannot expect anything like the health-giving conditions of the rural districts. Yet in a young country like this, where we have millions of acres which can be cultivated, we are doing our best to offer inducements to people to come into the towns, instead of trying to see what we might do to induce them to lead the more healthful country life.",61
413,Mr MCDOUGALL,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,Are they given much inducement to go on the land?,61
414,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I am not at present saying whether they are or not. We are doing all we can artificially to aid manufacturers .to offer employment to people which will draw them from the country into the city. The higher the wages offered to people to engage in city industries, the greater will be the temptation held out to them to leave the land.",61
415,Mr HUTCHISON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,That is a good argument for a stiff progressive land tax.,61
416,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I am merely laving down a general proposition.' - The Labour Party devote their attention to the conditions"" of the working people, and they profess to regard the health, careful living, and prosperity of the working classes as an element in their policy. I am in entire sympathy with them in that. If even as ah individualist I am shown something which is inimical to the interests of the people"" and infringes their right to healthy occupation, I shall be one of the first to lend a hand to prevent such a thing. A broad - (Consideration attaching to our protectionist policy is that today, instead of lending ourselves to schemes for putting people ori the land-and I am not now saying how that can best be done-w e are offering artificial inducements to manufacturers in order that, in their' turn, they may bffer monetary inducements to people to come into the cities instead of - remaining'in country' districts. The policy is one which we ought to carefully watch. ,We ought to do all that we can, and should leave nothing undone to enable our people to lead the healthiest possible 'life. _ have heard explanations of what is going on. When I made an observation to effect the other night I heard some one say quarie's doubt. that the large estates should be burst up to enable the people to go upon the land._ I join issue on this point. I do not believe that the land is as fully utilized as be, but when we hear it said, as we often do, that there have been 800 or 900 appliarguing cants for one piece of land, no one who knows anything of .land ballots will take such a statement as an index of the number of people honestly wanting land. It has been the practice in some cases, and cerindication tainly in New South Wales, at certain times, to put up land at upset prices very much less than the land is worth in the market. As a consequence, hundreds people living in the towns send their to an agent at the place where the land ballot is to be held, and he makes a lar business of putting in applications their' behalf, and if any of them are cessful at the ballot, he sells the land them.",61
417,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"That is a very small possessed be matter. Mr BRU CE SMITH - It "" is, - leads many people who have never investiland-holders gated the question to say that when 800 900 people are balloting for one piece land there must be a very great demand land.",62
418,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,It is bad- enough to have two or three balloting for the same piece of land.,62
419,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,I have seen it stated that 800 people have balloted for the same piece of land.,62
420,Mr CARR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,Why should they gamble for' it at all ?,62
421,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"To ask why do so. they should be men would be just as relevant. The honourable member has haps a little more experience of the land than other people, but he ought to rememin ber that we are all trying to learn thing of what he knows. I say that the fact of 800 or 900 people having balloted for a piece of land in this way is indication that they all desire to settle on that land.",62
422,Mr HUTCHISON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,Applicant s for land have to undergo an examination in South Australia.,62

Mr BRU CE SMITH - There is an anthis swer to the honourable member for Mac give evidence before a Land Board that it might each desired the land for himself. Mr BRU CE SMITH - I am not now as to what ought to be done, but I am referring to one of the causes of misunderstanding on the part of certain people who imagine that these rushes of applicants for a particular piece of land afford an that they all desire to settle on the land. A large part of them have no intention tb take up land, merely wishing to get it at upset prices in order to resell of at a profit. I admit, of course, that there money are hundreds of others who are desirous of settling in the country - But it is one reguof our misfortunes in Australia that our on people have been taught to look upon land sucas worth only £ 1 an acre, and, when they for want land, they expect to get it at that price. There are many land-holders willing of large estates who would to cut up and sell their properties at their actual market value. but it I know - of many cases in which would sell their estates or for the actual earnings over a number of of years capitalized, but as* that would for make the cost £ 2 , £ 3 , or £ 4 an acre, there are no buyers. Prospective settlers expect to get at least 640 acres, and cannot afford to buy so large an area at such prices. But land-holders cannot be expected to give away their land, nor should Parliament take it from them except at its market value. ",62
424,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,I am glad to perhear the honourable member say that. But the leader of the Labour Party is reported both the Sydney morning newspapers to somehave advocated a tax upon land increasing up to is. in the £ 1 on its capital value.,62

426,Mr HUTCHISON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Thes e are expressions equivalent to "" dividing.""",63
427,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"The land is to be "" disrupted '' irrespective of the volition of the person who holds it. _ A tax equivais lent to 5 per cent, on the capital value of land would destroy its profit-earning capastatesmen city, and if a tax were imposed with that ject, so that the owner might be forced to .and part with his property to other persons, gross breach of contract would be comshould mitted by the State. The State, in selling land and taking money for it, enters into bargain guaranteeing peaceable possession and quiet enjoyment to the purchasers. If human afterwards they are forced to sell for less than the market value of the land, the forced sale amounts to confiscation.",63
428,Mr HUTCHISON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"That - is a differenttry, thing from a tax which destroys only inin flated or unfair values.",63
429,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"When a tax is so heavy that it makes land valueless to its holder, its imposition amounts to confiscaI tion. If our people, instead of wanting land at J £ I an acre, or at less than market value, and in large holdings, were prepared to buy small holdings at market values, thousands of settlers could be scattered over Australia. In the men will be found making a living near big cities like Philadelphia on, perhaps, an acre of land, growing strawberries, or ber approves. asparagus, or' similar crops for the local market; while thousands do well on holdare ings of ten acres. In this country it thought that no settler should have less than 640 acres, of which often only twenty or thirty acres are cleared, the rest ing a wilderness for years, while the notice a few days ago. holder struggles on with a great debt his neck. If persons were content with smaller areas, and thoroughly worked their land, we could settle a very large number in the country, and thus find openings many who are now seeking work in prothat tected industries. Our people must be satisfied with smaller areas, and must cultiaddition vate their land more completely than they do at present, before we can satisfactorily settle our territory. If the public could be induced to pay market values for land, stead of four. and to take up areas within the limits their capital, instead of clamouring for large holdings at small prices, the land of 420 per cent. question would be largely solved without the need for legislation. Three days ago Professor Macmillan Brown gave a lecture in Sydney touching this subof trousers dutiable? ject of town and country. He is ' a very thoughtful man, and his remarks ought to be of great interest. He saidLabor, if wise, when it holds the reins of power, will not forget this natural truth, that it out of, the rural districts a nation must reinvigorate itself, and that the zone of cultivable, land is compaiatively narrow in Australia. True should do everything in their power to obextend this zone and 'to push small settlement intensive culture as far as irrigation, afforesa tation, and other means will carry them; and, in order to check the hugeness and wastage of cities, encourage the spread of cottage industries and the transference of even the larger industries a to the country. The concentrated industries and factory life of our age are surely not the goal of development, else that goal is Hades. For out of it comes an irresponsible plutocracy that dies of luxury at one end, as it breeds at the other an enfeebled, impoverished people, that gradually dwindles. True statesmen will see that the rewards of settlement in the counand of intelligence, wisdom, and invention the ranks of urban labour are not lessened, but increased.",63
430,Mr FISHER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,.What is he professor of?,63
431,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I do not know. can only tell the honourable member that Professor Macmillan Brown has been emits ployed by the Sydney University to deliver a series of lectures in New South Wales. % Mr MALONEY - That is the best portion United States of his lecture, too.",63
432,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I am very glad that I have taken what the honourable memI propose to say a few words about the Tariff proposals. There a number of general considerations which is I think ought to operate. I believe we shall find that a great many of the duties have been imposed without much thought. remainTake an instance which came under my An importer of round coachbuilding material told me-and I think that his statement is correct-that prior to the new Tariff there was a duty of 60 per cent, on the material required for for coachbuilding, especially wheels. He said under the new Tariff there is a specific duty which is equivalent to 180 per cent, into the old duty of 60 per cent., but that since the duty has been imposed a fresh rule has been issued to the effect that in future a set of wheels shall be two inThat increased the new of ' duty to 360 per cent, on top of the old duty of 60 per cent., making a total duty,  step further and make each leg of a pair",63
433,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"They might have done that. A good deal has been said"" about the effect' that the duties will have on the working classes. Let me quote from the columns of no less a newspaper than the Worker, of Queensland, and other sources, what their opinion is. The resolution of the New South Wales Labour League reads as followsThat Mr MCGowen, leader of the New South Wales State Labour party, and Mr Flowers, president of the League, be appointed to visit Melbourne, and place before the Federal Labour party the views of the Political Labour League of New South Wales respecting the urgency of endeavouring to readjust the Tariff proposals, in order that the proposed taxation introduced by Sir W. J. Lyne may not press unduly heavily upon the working people of this State. The Queensland Worker saysIt is the workers, who have nothing to sell but their labour, who will bear the brunt of. this new taxation, and find it hardest to pass it on. Taking, all the factors into consideration, and not merely one of them, the estimate of from three to five shillings a week as the price of the tariff to working class families, is not too high. It has since published a leading article confirming that view, in answer to some criticism which was offered on the calculation. The Herald, which is the labour newspaper of South Australia, has also published its view. M 4 FRAZER.!-The honourable member reads these journals extensively.,",63
434,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I do, because I find that they are full of information. 1 always know what the honourable member's party is doing, because the information gets into these newspapers.  we are ashamed of.",64
435,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"N e v e r ; and that is why I read the newspapers. If I thought that they would print anything of which the honourable member would be ashamed, I should be afraid to read the newspapers, for I have great respect for his standards of propriety. In its lead- at ing article of the 17th August, the South Australian Herald is not very complimentary to the Ministry. Still I shall read what it saysIt is early yet to deal effectively with tariff, for at present it merely represents the suggestions of a rapidly decaying Ministry. . . . . So far as the preferential proposals are concerned they may be at once referred to as but a pretence; but perhaps all that should be expected from a man like Mr Deakin, whose whole political, life has been one of lamentable indecision. These extracts, coming from the labour journals of two large States, Queensland and South Australia, added to the reso[97] lution passed in the Western Australian Parliament^ may, I think, be regarded as good evidence that a very large proportion of the people of those three States regard the Tariff as unduly trespassing upon the fair earnings of the working' classes.  think that it is fair to quote these Socialist newspapers against us?",64
436,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"They are not against, the Labour Party, I hope, but in their favour.  vernment.",64
437,Mr BRUCESMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I want to show what the honourable member and his party think. I do not propose to discuss the question of the conversion of the States debts at great length, but I remind the Committee that about four years agoT characterized the movement as being entirely inopportune. I take it that the object is to avail ourselves of a lower rate of interest under the Commonwealth. After reading Mr Coghlan's despatch to the Federal Government, in which he deals with the question of the conversion, and speaks of it as being entirely ill-timed just now, one must realise certain facts. When we federated, in 1900, ui.der the Constitution, and the Parliament met in 1901, a New South Wales debenture for £ 1 0 0 bearing interest at 3 per cent, was worth £ 9 9 , and Canadian 3 per cent, stock was worth £ 9 9 too. From 1901 the New South Wales 3 per cent, stock, which I believe is the best priced stock of that kind in Australia, has gradually gone down pound by pound until at the present time it is worth only £ 8 6 , sometimes realizing £ 8 7 . Meanwhile the value of Canadian 3 per cent, stock has remained £99- In the course of his paper, which the honourable member for K a l goorlie read, and evidently attached some importance to, Mr Coghlan says that, whether we like it or not, we, as nathe new tional borrowers, are dependent upon the London money market. He does not suggest that we ought to borrow. He says that there have been exaggerated statements made, and that it is unfair that our stock should have been so affected; but certain it ' is, he adds, that our stock is affected, not by the want of prospects in ' the country, but by our legislation.",64
438,Mr BATCHELOR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,Was it not by Mr. Carruthers' threat of a revolution?,64
439,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"This is not a threat at all. Mr Coghlan is a civil servant of considerable standing, whose name ranks high amongst statisticians, who is on the spot. It is idle members to make fun of his statements, because they do not like them.",65
440,Mr BATCHELOR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I do not think the honourable member, caught-my remark.",65
441,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I am endeavouring to seriously consider this quest-ion, I hope that the honourable member will do so. It is all very well for him to it flippantly, but the fact remains that it is a very serious matter.",65
442,Mr BATCHELOR,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"If the honourable memsuccess. ber will pardon me, I am laughing, not at Mr Coghlan, but at him.",65

If that price remained unchanged, when we had to pay tures at par. off that debenture, we should be able to borrow another £100 at £ 9 9 to pay it off, and we should thus lose £ 1 on the transaction.

457,Mr FRAZER,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"Thes e stocks, in any event, must be paid off. Could New South Wales borrow more advantageously than the Commonwealth? Mr BRU CE SMITH - It is not a that matter of who has to find the - is simply a question of finding it.

468,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"The State has something else to do with its money, I suppose. Now, I have a word or two to say about the transferred properties. I do not approve of the way in which they have been treated. Five years ago I advocated that the money paid over by the Commonwealth to the States above the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue that was due to them should not be paid unconditionally, but that it should be arranged with the States that those payments should be on account of the transferred properties. We were under no obligation to pay this money to the States if we had a means of spending it, and we might well have said that as one of our obligations was to purchase from the States properties for carrying on our postal and defence functions we would do so by means of the surplus which was paid over to them.",67
469,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,Does the honourable - member suggest that we should have paid the States for the properties out of the money which we have paid to them out of Customs and Excise revenue?,67
470,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"-Thos e properties are the assets upon which part of the national debt of the States was incurred, and unless we were prepared to take over the portion of their national debt which was raised upon the security of their assets, we had no right to take the assets from them - It has been the practice in New South Wales, and in the other States also, I think, that all works of permanent value which were in the nature of lasting assets, which could, if necessary, be sold in the market as properties, should be paid for out of loan money. As they were paid for out of loan money and we took over £9,000,000 or£io,ooo,ooo worth of them, it was an obligation on us to take over debt to the amount of £9,000,000 or £10,000,000. It was not fair to creditors of the States to relieve them of their properties without relieving them of the debt. By adopting the course which I have suggested, we should have paid over about £8,000,000 out of the £9,000,000 or £10,000,000 borrowed by the States on account of the properties we have taken over.",67
471,Mr MAHON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,And then the States would have borrowed again on the same assets.,67
472,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"They might have done so, but, of course, the State borrows on its general reputation, and there is no ear-marking of particular' properties for particular debts. It borrows on the general security of its public buildings, railways, and other works.",67
473,Mr MAHON,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,The States would have squandered the money in the meantime.,67
474,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I had intended to deal with some other matters, but my speech has been prolonged, largely owing to interjections, and I shall therefore reserve those points until I have an opportunity of speaking on specific items of the Tariff.

The honourable member for South Sydney has - formulated what is termed the "" new protection."" I did not subscribe to the old protection; because I considered that simply to build a high Tariff wall, and by doing so to license the power of money to exploit the poor of the country, is a mischievous proceeding. I do not want to see any industries built up in Australia at the expense of the bone and sinew of our race, undermining its stamina in the process. I quite agree with the honourable member for - Parkes in his denunciation of that aspect of industrialism. But are we to forego the right to develop this country and its natural resources, and to produce for ourselves whatever may be useful and necessary in times of peace, or for purposes of Avar, and to fulfil all the requirements of modern civilization? Are we to be bound by the policies of older nations, or are we to carve out for ourselves a new course, and to develop the industrial possibilities of our country on right lines? We can hedge about this-"" new protection "" in an effective way so as not only to protect the industries concerned, but also the consumers and the wage-earners.

495,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PRECEDENCE OF GOVERNME NT,"I merely wish to make a personal explanation. I desire to do so, because I was precluded from explaining my position while the honourable member for Parkes was speaking. He based almost the whole of his remarks upon a statement which he alleged I had made in regard to the Braddon section of the Constitution. I said that I. was referring to the proposal to extend the Braddon section. I have just looked up what I actually did say, as it is reported in Hansard. I find that I said that "" two months ago another Conference was held in Brisbane,"" when the . following, proposals were agreed to by the Premiers(1) From 1910 until 1Q20, and thereafter until otherwise provides, the States to receive a fixed'annual, sum. based on the average of three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise, revenue during certain years (a).

The'Commonwealth to. have the right to .impose new duties for specific purposes, both on items at present subject to duty, and also on items at present not subject to duty-the Commonwealth Treasurer to retain the whole of the revenue raised thereby.

I referred to all the Premiers' Conferences which have taken place, and I saidOf .course, those provisions would not be bindaware of that. ing on Parliament; they were adopted subject ratification by Parliament. With regard other 'question-the continuation, of the operation of the Braddon section-it appears very from the figures I have quoted this.evening, .such an arrangement, however desirable to the making. States, will be quite impossible in view of public expenditure which must be carried out by the Commonwealth. I have been called suddenly t.o take the position I now occupy, and have had so little opportunity of considering question that I feel that some time must'elapse before my views are thoroughly matured. I wish to say that those remarks were made entirely upon the question of the proposal to extend the Braddon section of the Constitution, which would mean a continuance of the obligation on the part of the. Commonwealth _to return to the States three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue. I have never said, one word which would indicate that I proposed to leave the States without .some provision under which their Treasurers would know exactly what they were doing.
