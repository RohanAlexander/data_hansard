1,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It was stated in Saturday's Argus that the Postmaster-General proposes to-communicate with the Commonwealth representative in London, to obtain the best expert advice as to whether tenders for the erection and equipment of wireless telegraphic stations shall be sought for only from the Marconi firm, or left open to all. I ask the honourable gentleman whether he cannot obtain from Captain Collins simply a statement informing the Government if there' is a contract between the Marconi Company and the Admiralty, ' requiring the latter to use only the Marconi system in itswireless communications. I ask him, too, whether he will endeavour to show' the bona fides of his Department, which has professed anxiety to institute wireless telegraphy in Australia, by calling for tenders for installation at an earlier date than January, 1911.",14
2,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I have given instructions to my officers for tenders to be called for, but delay has been caused by the necessary work of settling the conditions and the form of the specifications. All possible information is being obtained from the Admiralty and from Captain Collins. I shall be pleased to act on the honourable member's suggestion as to the advisability of ascertaining whether the Admiralty is bound down to any particular system of wireless telegraphy. It is my desire and intention to carry out the will of the House in this matter without the least unnecessary delay. I shall not' tolerate, formal objections or. technicalities, but there must be preliminary inquiries', and I must take the advice Of professional men.",14
3,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Will the Postmaster General, in dealing with the question of wireless telegraphy, give consideration to proposals which, I believe, have been submitted to him by a company recently formed for linking up the Pacific, known as the Radio-Telegraph Company?",14
4,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,I have received from the Prime Minister a communication from the company in question. At present it is under consideration. SUGAR PRODUCTION: WHIT E AND BLACK LABOUR.,14
5,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Minister, representing the Minister of Trade and Customs if he will lay on the table a return which I understand was issued on the 15th of this month, showing the amount of sugar produced by white and by black labour?",15
6,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Is not the information contained in the Budget papers?,15
7,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member is referring - to a specific return which I have not seen. I shall communicate with my honourable colleague on the subject, requesting him to make available the latest information he possesses. SUEZ CANAL.",15
8,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"As the Suez Canal Company is attempting to extend its lease for another seventy-eight years from 1935, will the Postmaster-General take advantage of the opportunity to make representations on behalf of Australia, with a view to obtaining a reduction of dues on Australian vessels and produce passing through the canal ?",15
9,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I understand that an extension of the lease has been granted.,15
10,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Accordin g to ihe cablegram, the matter is being considered, and the transaction has - not yet closed.",15
11,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The transaction is a business arrangement between the Egyptian Government and the Suez Canal Company. The former has no interest in Australian concerns, but our desire for reduced rates has been represented to the company as strongly as possible on several occasions, but without success. The plea is that the reduction of rates on Australian steamers cannot be considered until the the canal now in progress is finished. No opportunity to press our claim on the pany will be lost, but this transaction affords no special opportunity to repeat i QUARANTINE. ADMINISTRATION.",15
12,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I ask the Attorney-General whether there is any Commonwealth law which will prevent the banning of the importation of agricultural ducts by one State from another. If this continues, reprisals may be made which will be detrimental' to the interests of",15
13,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The honourable member, I think, refers to the prohibition of the importation of potatoes into some of the States.",15
14,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,And of tomatoes.,15
15,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Answer s to similar questions have been given by me and by the Minister of External Affairs for the. Minister of Trade and Customs. I have pointed out that any person or State affected has a remedy at law. If an import is stopped by the New South Wales Government, and the importer considers that action an abuse of the police powers of the State, there is nothing to prevent him from raising the question in the Courts.",15
16,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Canno t the Commonwealth intervene in the public interest?,15
17,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The Commonwealth, except so far as legislation is concerned, is impersonal in this matter. It cannot interfere as a litigant unless directly affected. We have quarantine laws which can be applied.",15
18,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Then why are they not applied ? - Mr Glynn - To apply them would be to substitute one kind of restriction for another, and it is doubtful whether our legislation would completely override the police powers of the States in this matter. The transactions are being carefully watched by the Minister of Trade and Customs, and if the time came when something had to be done, I suppose intervention would take place. INVALID PENSIONS.",15
19,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Is .the Treasurer in possession of particulars upon which he can base an estimate as to the amount of money which will be required for the payment of invalid pensions when that part of the Actwhich relates to them widening of is put into operation?,15
20,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I do not care comto give an estimate off-hand, but I may say that I think that the payment of int . ' valid pensions will involve an expenditure of at least ,£250,000. PETHERICK COLLECTION.",15
21,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I do not know whether I should address the question I desire proto ask to you, Mr Speaker, or to the Prime Minister. As the Prime Minister is the first citizen of Australia at the pretrade. sent moment, I think I shall ask him whether his attention has been drawn to the following short article which appeared in the Herald of last eveningNA RUINE D. The way not to do it is being by the Library Committee of the Federal Parliament in connection with the collection of books  to the Commonwealth. This magnificent library of early Australian and Colonial history, an attempt to scatter it among thousands of books in the general library had been resisted, has been consigned to the vaults at therear of the House of Representatives. Here, the priceless manuscripts, charts, and books, had not been out of glass cases for years, are on ordinary deal shelves, open to dust, liable to rapid destruction. For four months question of finding suitable accommodation for servation. the works has been under consideration, and today this simple matter of buying some cases with glass doors appears to be as far off settlement as ever. It is a poor compliment one who has spent a lifetime in the collection of historical records, and who now regards them almost with the love of child, that his gifts should apparently be unappreciated in this way. I may say that I hare not seen Mr sity Petherick himself for a number of weeks.' I wish to ask whether, in view of the Committee. great benefit derived by citizens of Melbourne and visitors to this city from the exhibition of the Petherick collection in the Queen's Hall, the Prime Minister will not when ? take steps to enable all who desire to inspect the collection to do so?",15
22,Mr SPEAKER,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,"-I think that as a to member of the Library Committee, it spect would, perhaps, be better that I should reply to the honourable member's question. I am sorry that the statement that Petherick collection has been buried in the vaults of Parliament House should have been repeated.",16
23,Dr MALONEY,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,"Why , they have been placed in the cellar ",16
24,Mr SPEAKER,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,Nothin g of the sort.,16
25,Dr MALONEY,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,It is a cellar.,16
26,Mr SPEAKER,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,"Order ! The repreFederal sentatives of the press have been invited by the Library 'Committee to inspect the premises in which the collection is kept, order that they may be assured that the statement to which I have referred is correct. The collection has on the ground-floor of Parliament House in a place specially fitted up for the purpose, and the greatest possible care being taken of it.",16
27,Dr MALONEY,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,That is nonsense.,16
28,Mr SPEAKER,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,"Order ! The honourable member, having asked a question on the subject, might allow me to answer his question.",16
29,Dr MALONEY,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,"Evidentl y you, sir, have shown at present not seen the place.",16
30,Mr SPEAKER,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,"Order ! I might say that portions of the collection that are of especial value are taken special care of. after They are preserved in a strong room which has been erected for the purpose, and which is being made fire-proof. With respect to other portions of the collection which which might be injured by exposure to the and atmosphere, special cases are being manuthe factured at the present time for their preI ask honourable members fo visit the premises in which the collection book is kept, in order to assure themselves of to the care which has been taken.",16
31,Mr WILKS,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,"Hear , hear. The place is a father for a well lighted, too.",16
32,Mr SPEAKER,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,"The greatest care is being taken of the collection, and the necesfor taking care of it is strongly impressed upon every member of the Library",16
33,Dr MALONEY,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,"I should like to ask you, sir, if the public are at liberty to inspect this valuable collection, and, if so,",16
34,Mr SPEAKER,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,"In answer to the honourable member, I am very glad to be able say that the public are at liberty to in the Petherick collection on the mornings of sitting days of this Parliament and during the ordinary hours when the Parthe liament House is open on other days. FEDERAL CAPITAL SITE.",16
35,Mr JOHNSON,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,"I desire to ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether he has seen an article published in the Age newspaper in which it was alleged that the rejection of Dalgety as the site for the Capital was prompted by the in- tense jealousy of the Sydney people, lest the acquisition of what is described as the in "" land-locked harbour"" of Twofold Bay would result in Sydney losing its prenot eminence as the principal shipping port been placed of the Commonwealth.",16
36,Mr MATHEWS,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,That is quite true.,16
37,Mr JOHNSON,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,"Will the Minister is have a map of New South Wales sent to the persons conducting the Age newspaper in order that their geographical knowledge may be supplemented, and in order that they may not err by the publication of similar misstatements in the future.",16
38,Mr FULLER,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,I did see the article referred to by the honourable member for Lang. I take it that it is no part of m\< business as Minister of Home Affairs to provide maps for the information of persons conducting newspapers in Australia. BORDER RAILWAYS.,17
39,Mr CHANTER,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he has noticed the anti-Federal feeling disclosed by the New South Wales Government in the reply to a deputation that waited upon them in connection with the proposed construction of a railway from Finley to Tocumwal, and the statement by the New South Wales Minister of Works that the Government objected to railway construction wh'ch would give facilities for trading with Victoria.",17
40,Mr DEAKIN,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,"I can only confess to a very general ""knowledge that some such statement was made. One has been accustomed to hear propositions of that sort dealt - with in the same manner, on - sundrygrounds, Federal or anti-Federal. Whether the case referred to by the honourable member for Riverina is specific I am not in a position to say.",17
41,Mr CHANTER,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,"I should like to ask the Prime Minister if he will make it his business to read the reply given to the deputation by the New South Wales Minister of Works, and then decide whether the matter is one in which an expression of Federal or un-Federal feeling is involved?",17
42,Mr DEAKIN,A PRICELESS COLLECTION BEI NG,"I shall be happy to enlarge my knowledge of the sentiments of the New South Wales Minister of Works, but cannot undertake to decide anything in a matter between State and State. NA FORCES.",17
43,Mr CROUCH,BAYONETS FOR VICTORIAN,"I should like to ask the Minister of Defence a question concerning a matter to which I directed his attention about a fortnight ago. I refer to the fact that the Victorian infantry have not, for the last twenty months, been supplied with bayonets. As about two-thirds of the men have never had bayonets, it is impossible for them to be instructed in bayonet drill. I wish to know if the Minister is able to make any statement as to when the bavonets will arrive, so that the men mav receive necessary instruction.",17
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BAYONETS FOR VICTORIAN,I am sorry that I am unable to say when the supply of bayonets will arrive. All I know is that they have been ordered.,17
45,Mr CROUCH,BAYONETS FOR VICTORIAN,How many ?,17
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BAYONETS FOR VICTORIAN,"I think, about 28,000. I hope they will shortly arrive.",17
47,Mr AGAR WYNNE,BAYONETS FOR VICTORIAN,I wish to ask the Minister of Defence whether the bayonets required could not be made in Australia.,17
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BAYONETS FOR VICTORIAN,I am afraid not at present. FINANCIAL RELATIONS : COMMONWEALTH AND STATES.,17
49,Mr HUTCHISON,BAYONETS FOR VICTORIAN,I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether the House is likely to be given any information regarding the secret arrangements still going on between the Government and the State Governments in connection with the agreement arrived at at the recent Premiers' Conference. Does the honourable gentleman not think it is time he left it to this House to do justice to the people of Australia ?,17
50,Mr DEAKIN,BAYONETS FOR VICTORIAN,"I should have thought that the honourable member's nationality would have prevented him from suggesting that a secret arrangement could be public. So far as I am aware the intimations given to the press by the Premier of New South Wales conveyed the purport of the further negotiations. PAPERS. MINISTERS laid on the table the following papers:Audit Acts-Treasur y Regulation No. 96 (e) Amended-Statutor y Rules 1909, No. 107.

In Committee (Consideration resumed from 15th October, vide page 4649): Clause 4""The Northern Territory"" means that part of Australia which lies to the northward of the twenty-sixth parallel of south latitude and between the one hundred and twenty'-ninth and one hundred and thirty-eighth degrees of east longitude, together with the bays and gulfs therein, and all and every the islands adjacent to any part of the mainland within such limits as aforesaid, with their rights, members, and appurtenances. . . . . Upon which Mr DUGALD THOMSON had moved by way of amendment-That the word ""twenty-sixth,"" line 3, out, with a view to inSert in lieu. thereof the word "" twenty-second.""",17
51,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wentworth) [3.19] Shortly before the adjournment on Friday last, the Minister told the Committee that a serious consideration which must weigh with honourable members in approaching this agreement with South Australia is the particular clause in the agreement whereby South Australia, in consideration of our assenting to the agreement, gives us permission under the Constitution to proceed with the construction of the trans-continental line to Western Australia. It is suggested that it is right from the point of view of the Commonwealth, when arranging for the construction of a line in the Northern Territory, to make some arrangement with regard to a similar Commonwealth project towards the West. But if this is being held out to us by the people of South Australia as a sort of ultimatum to compel our acquiescence in the transfer of the Northern Territory, as one would understand from the Minister's remarks on 'Friday last Mx. HUTCMSON - Who suggested that?",18
52,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am afraid I am myself guilty of drawing that deduction from what the Minister said.,18
53,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I made no such suggestion.,18
54,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have a distinct recollection of a statement by the Minister on Friday that one of the strong points about this agreement was that it secured us permission to build the line to Western Australia, if we should ever think fit to do so.",18
55,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I simply mentioned it as one of the conditions of the agreement.,18
56,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Was the Minister's object in mentioning it to show that if we refused to adopt this agreement, South Australia would probably refuse its consent to the construction of the line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie?",18
57,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I did not say so by hint or suggestion.,18
58,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Why else did the Minister make the suggestion to the House?,18
59,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Because it was necessary to give all the contents of the agreement. Mr - KELLY - The honprable gentleman picked out that one condition.,18
60,Mr FOWLER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,An amendment will be proposed to safeguard the interests of the Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie line.,18
61,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member be left for Perth proposes, I know, to put his fellow members from Western Australia in a somewhat difficult position.",18
62,Mr FOWLER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am asserting the correct position.,18
63,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It may be a correct one, according to the views of Western Australia, and I think that State has a right to consider its railway proposition as more important than this.",18
64,Mr FOWLER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Wester n Australia has a prior claim.,18
65,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not think they have any prior claim to Australia taking ""over a proper proportion of the Northern Territory, and developing it according to its own views, but the honourable member is perfectly correct if he means that Western Australia has a prior claim in regard' to railway construction. I am glad to learn that this condition of the agreement, to which the Minister of External Affairs referred with such extraordinary innocence on Friday afternoon, is not intended as a bait for Western. Australian members. If it were, it would be the surest way of putting this House out of sympathy with the whole proposal, because this is the last legislative body in Australia to consent to dictation-to blackmail-of this type. I would suggest that, even in the temporary, absence of the honourable member for N^rth Sydney, the abundant merits of his proposal should receive the endorsement of Ministers. It is quite useless to think that this Parliament can be led, against its own better judgment, to adopt the proposals arrived at by the Prime Minister, when head of a former Administration, in agreement with the then Premier of South Australia. It is transparent that this Parliament will not accept them. I hold that it should, therefore, show South Australia exactly what it is prepared to concede. That is the least that we owe to that State. The right honourable member for East Sydney suggested that we ought to signify, by speaking, what our intentions towards South Australia arej but to refrain from endeavouring to alter the agreement by a vote.",18
66,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Onl y as to this proposition. - Mr KELLY - Then my right honourable friend would not object to altering the agreement in any other essential ?,18
67,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I consider that the question as to whether she should take over the portion of territory indicated in the amendment is one for South Australia alone, and not for u?.",19
68,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Would my right honourable friend adopt a similar attitude towards the question of whether the Commonwealth should take over the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta?,19
69,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is a matter for us, as well.",19
70,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"For once in his life, the right honourable member is on rather i l logical ground. I can see no difference between a refusal on our part to take over certain property-to wit, a railway in South Australia-o r certain real estate, in the shape of portion of the Northern Territory, which we do not wish to receive. Unless we show definitely by our votes what we mean to do with regard to the agreement, our attitude will be misrepresented outside. A number of people in South Australia will say that we have refused to sanction the agreement, not because the most that we would assent to is contained in the honourable member for North Sydney's amendment, but because we do not like the agreement itself, and they may try us by making an offer a little higher than the honourable member for North Sydney suggests. That would lead again to endless delay, and to an increase of the irritation so markedly expressed on Friday afternoon by the honourable member for Grey.  orable member go?",19
71,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Exactly to the length proposed by the honourable member for North Svdney. His proposition is absolutely fair.  Government constructed a line to that point, would the honourable member agree to the Commonwealth meeting it?",19
72,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"On a question of railway construction, I should be bound solely by the views of experts. If , after South Australia had completed the line to the twenty-second parallel, our experts advised that, in the interests of the Northern Territory, we should connect with that line, T should give my vote most heartily, accordingly.",19
73,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Provide d that the honourable member picked the experts.,19
74,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am afraid the honourable member is not serious. Honourable [167] members on the side of this question that I am advocating are taking a national view, pure and simple.",19
75,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is the most comical thing the honourable member has ever said.,19
76,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I should .not like to charge the honourable member with ever having said a comical thing. As the successor of the late honourable member for Adelaide, the honourable member seems almost to feel as if the mantle of that gentleman had fallen upon him, and to think that every remark of his should be taken with the greatest seriousness. We can claim in all sincerity that we are concerned purely with Australian needs. If , after we have taken over such portion of the Northern Territory as we think advisable-the tropical portion that South Australia cannot more capably develop-the experts advise us that the route through the centre of the Territory is in the best interests of the Territory and Australia as a whole, I shall be delighted to record my vote for it. But, in the absence of such information, this Parliament would be false to its duty, and to all business principles, if it consented to an agreement compelling it to build a railway through a certain portion of the Territory, and connecting with a certain oity in Australia, without regard to the necessities of Australia as a whole.",19
77,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wilmot) [3.30] - I intend to support the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney. It appears to me that it is infinitely preferable to the proposed agreement, and its adoption will convey to South Australia an indication of what she may expect this Parliament to sanction, because it is abundantly clear that the tentative agreement has no possible chance of being ratified. If the Territory were handed over to the Commonwealth from the twenty-second parallel the railway construction which we should have to undertake would be comparativelylight, and from that stand-point I am decidedly in favour of the amendment. It seems to me that the proposed agreement is rather Of a one-sided character. I quite recognise that South Australia is entitled to everv credit for having struggled with the administration, of this huge area since 1863, and for having maintained it ns a white man's country. Nevertheless, I scarcely think it is fair that the other States should be burdened in. the way that they would be burdened if this agreement were accepted. The taking over of the Territory would involve an outlay of £10,000,000, and a much larger expenditure would be necessary to develop it. From that stand-point it seems to me that the amendment is very much preferable to the clause in the Bill. If it is what it has been painted to beand I have no reason to believe that it does not possess the large and fertile areas which have been claimed for it-it seems to me that South Australia should be permitted to develop it as far as the MACDonnell Ranges in the best way possible. That would necessitate the construction by South Australia of 200 miles of railway to connect the line which now terminates at Oodnadatta with the point mentioned. From every standpoint I regard the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney as preferable to the agreement embodied in the Bill - Mr FRANK FOSTER - I hope that",19
78,Mr FRANK FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"New England) [3.40] - I hope that the amendment will not be carried. As long as I can remember, doubts have been expressed as to the development of what has been called the "" dead heart of Australia."" This Territory comprises hundreds of millions of acres, and no one possessing a truly Federal spirit would say that the burden of developing it for the good of Australia should be left to one State. It is to say the least peculiar that certain honourable members should argue that it should not be borne by all the States. A problem like this should surely be solved by the federated people of Australia.  ing regard to the speech made by the Minister of External Affairs in moving the second reading of the Bill. Mr FRANK iFOSTER - I hope that the Government are not going to support the amendment.",20
79,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I have announced that we are not going to do so.,20
80,Mr FRANK FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am glad, to hear it. As guardians of the interests of the Commonwealth, are we going to refuse this opportunity to secure control of an enormous stretch of country?",20
81,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,At a cheap rate for cash.,20
82,Mr FRANK FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am surprised that the honourable member should indulge in such cheap sneers. We should be guilty of absolute meanness if we shirked the responsibilities of the Commonwealth in connection with this Territory. South Australia with a comparatively small population has for many years guarded this door to Australia from coloured invasion. She says today, "" We find the financial burden of developing it too pressing, and think that the Commonwealth should relieve us of it . """,20
83,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But the chief question relates to the conditions that she desires to impose.,20
84,Mr FRANK FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am not prepared to accept all the conditions sought to be imposed, but the question now before us is whether we should take the whole or only part of the Territory. South Australia has not withdrawn her offer to hand us over the whole of the Territory, but perhaps the honourable member for North Sydney thinks that the acceptance of his amendment would be beneficial to her.",20
85,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Hear , hear. is the spirit in which the honourable member has proposed his amendment.",20
86,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,If the honourable member does not agree with the railway conditions imposed in the agreement he will assist South Australia by supporting this amendment.,20
87,Mr FRANK FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The railway conditions will have to be fought out. It is absurd to say that it would be unwise for us to own a railway running through State territory. Such an argument has been advanced either in the House or in the press; but to my mind we could not do better than extend our ownership of railways in the States. As a matter of fact, in time of war we should have to assume control of the whole of the railways of the States. It would be advantageous for us to take over the Territory and construct a railway through it ; the more sections we build the better. We should be able to control the gauge and perhaps make a better job of the work than any State could do. On the other hand, if we allowed South Australia to carry the present line as far north as the MACDonnell Ranges, she would construct it in accordance with her present gauge.",20
88,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The line already built as far as Oodnadatta will determine the gauge of any extension.,20
89,Mr FRANK FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Perhaps the South Australian gauge would be found suitable; but the suggestion that we should not own a railway running through a State is quite opposed to the Federal spirit. I reject the suggestion that this amendment would be beneficial to South Australia. That part of the Territory which it is proposed shall continue in her possession may contain great mineral possibilities, but many years would elapse before South Australia would be able to promote settlement and development in the north.",20
90,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Has not the honourable member seen the publication Territoria, which contains beautiful views of wheat growing country in that part of the Territory which it is proposed shall remain under the control of South Australia?",21
91,Mr FRANK FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But a mere handful of people could not develop that country. For the safety of Australia, settlement should proceed as rapidly as possible in the north, and the Commonwealth can most effectively promote that settlement. That is one of the reasons why I favour the transfer of the Territory; but I shall vote against every clause of the agreement of which I do not approve.",21
92,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We have been told by representatives of South Australia that to vote against even one clause in the agreement will destroy the whole.,21
93,Mr FRANK FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That statement cannot be taken seriously. I am sure that South Australia is as patriotic as is any other State, and that its Legislature will be prepared to consider any reasonable proposition made by us. We are not to be influenced by the bluff that some people may indulge in.",21
94,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Representatives of South Australia say that if we reject this offer, we shall not get another chance to take over the Territory on such easy terms.",21
95,Mr FRANK FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That may be so; but at the same time honourable members are not to be bluffed into the acceptance of conditions with which they do not agree. We must fight for the interests of the Commonwealth.,21
96,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,And must not be influenced by bluff on either side.,21
97,Mr FRANK FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I hope that no representative of South Australia, in fighting for his State, will resort to bluffing. I trust that the amendment will be rejected, and that honourable members having regard to the future good of Australia, will agree to the transfer of the whole of the Territory.",21
98,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Boothby) [3.50] As the right honourable member for East Sydney has said, the proposal now under consideration should have come from South Australia, if it is to be considered at all. If , as has been represented, the suggested variation of the agreement would be better [167]- 2 for South Australia, she should decide that point for herself. The proposal is, as I understand it, that there should be no railway conditions, and that the whole of the territory north of the twenty-second parallel should be handed over to the Commonwealth unconditionally, except in regard to the portion of the debt chargeable to the territory taken over.",21
99,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Pas t indebtedness should be met; there should be no conditions as to future railways; and the Commonwealth should not take over the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta.,21
100,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I would ask .honourable members not to spend much .time over this proposed' modification', because there is no possible chance of its being accepted by South Australia. I do not know whether it would not be better from a South Australian point of view if the Commonwealth were to take over the area down to Hergott Springs, so long as the other conditions stipulated for were complied with. South Australia might consider such a proposal as that. But it is absurd for us to place the suggestion now made before the State. It has been stated that this proposal was put before the South Australian Legislature. The proposal made to the South Australian' Legislative Council by Mr Duncan was in the following terms :"" Provided-(a ) That the southern boundary of the portion of the Northern Territory to be taken over by the Commonwealth be fixed approximately at the twenty-second degree south latitude. (i ) That the Commonwealth Government agrees to construct the transcontinental line from the proposed southern boundary to the present terminus at Pine Creek, (c) That the line of route of the proposed railway shall be from the terminus of the railway at the South Australian proposed new boundary to the terminus of the northern section of the line at Pine Creek, and within 100 miles east or west of the present overland telegraph line, (d) That the work of construction of the railway shall be commenced by the South Australian Government from Oodnadatta, and by the Commonwealth Government from Pine CTeek, within twelve months of the passing of the necessary Acts by the State and Australian Commonwealth Parliaments."" I read that proposition to give the Committee an idea of the conditions that the Legislative Council thought ought to be super-imposed on the agreement. Nearly half the Council voted for Mr Duncan's amendment.",21
101,Mr WH IRVINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is not a very conclusive argument. They had the agreement, and they thought that it would be as well to get as much more as they could.",21
102,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I would remind the Committee that there is a considerable section of the South Australian people who are strongly opposed to the transfer of the Northern Territory on any conditions. Some of the members of the Legislative Council who were of that opinion sought to vary the agreement with the real object of killing the Bill. They did not want to have the Territory taken over.,22
103,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That was practically the only object which the supporters of Mr. Duncan's amendment had.,22
104,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think that was their object. It has never been seriouslysuggested in South Australia that the northern boundary of the State should be extended to the twenty-second parallel, and the remaining portion of the Northern Territory handed over to the 'Commonwealth without conditions, a proposition to that effect has never been formally laid before the Legislature; nor has it been seriously proposed to the public of the State that South Australia should abandon the railway conditions. I am certain that it would be useless to make such a .proposition, because it would not be ac- cept. cepted. The country which it is proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney that South Australia should retain has the smallest rainfall in the whole Territory.",22
105,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We were told that the railway would pay if it were extended to the MACDonnell Ranges.,22
106,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Who said that? I would not father anv such statement. The extension of the railway to the MacDonnell Ranges would help to make the line pay, or rather it would develop try in the vicinity of the Ranges. It would enable the desert to be bridged, and the good land to the north of the Ranges to be opened up.",22
107,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It would open up a big mining field.,22
108,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I believe that the MACDonnell Ranges have a magnificent future from a mineral point of view. When I speak of the MACDonnell Ranges, I do not mean 'merely the country in which the Ranges are situated, but also that which is watered by the streams which flow north from the Ranges. But the proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney is not one which South Australia could seriously consider as an alternative. She now controls the whole Territory, and she is asked to accept responsibility for the worse tion of it, with the exception of a piece of mineral country pertaining to the Ranges.",22
109,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is not that the best portion of the Territory? If not, the books have misled us.",22
110,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; the books say that the MACDonnell Ranges country is good, and capable of carrying a considerable number of sheep. But, because of insufficient rainfall, the land between the northern boundary of South Australia and the MACDonnell Ranges is inferior. The proposal now under consideration is simply to extend the border of South Australia, so as to include the inferior portion of the Northern Territory, with the exception of part of the MACDonnell Ranges, without any compensating advantage. It would be very much better for South Australia, if she is going to extend her boundary, to extend it to the ocean and retain the Territory altogether, and I feel'quite certain that that is what it will do. I ask honourable members not to vote for the amendment. It is not a fair proposal so far as the State is concerned, .and, further, if is one which its Parliament will not ac",22
111,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Hindmarsh) [4.1]. - It seems to me that the honourable member for North Sydney and several supporters of the amendment have simply been trying to find a way to destroy the agreement without actually rejecting it.,22
112,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,No .,22
113,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The very moment that the honourable member for Wakefield made this suggestion, they seemed to think that it was an entirely new one; whereas, coun- as I pointed out in my speech on the second reading, it was made fifteen years ago by a member of the State Parliament, the late Honourable J. Langdon Parsons, who, however, proposed to fix ihe boundary at the twenty-first parallel, so that the matter has been well thought out and considered in the State. There is no doubt that the State will not agree to the amendment. A very pertinent interjection was made to the honourable member for Wentworth by the honourable member for Grey when he asked this question, "" If the Commonwealth were to take over ihe northern part of the Northern Territory, and leave South Australia with the country up to the MacDonnell Ranges, would the honourable member vote for the construction of a railway connecting with the State railway system?"" por- I think that if this amendment were carried, South Australia would require an assurance that that railway would be joined with its system and constructed when its own line was built, for the simple reason that the Commonwealth would be in the position of having a railway up to the MacDonnell Ranges to bridge over a very difficult part of the country, and then develop Commonwealth territory at the expense of the State. I do not think that there is any use in discussing the amendment so far as the State is concerned. I have been astonished at the scepticism which has been shown by a number of honourable members in regard to the value of the Northern Territory. They seem to think that honourable members for South Australia have been painting rhe country in too rosy colours. I want to quote two extracts in addition to what has been supplied by Mr Lindsay, who knows the country so well, and the literature which has been distributed. I propose, first, to quote the opinion of a man who knows more about the value of the Northern Territory, and what it can produce, than, I suppose, any other man alive*. I refer to the curator of the Adelaide Botanical Gardens, Mr. M. W. Holtze, because apparently a few honourable members do not know what has been done. In a paper on "" The Capabilities of the Northern Territory for Tropical Agriculture,"" he wrote in these termsThis I have proved to the satisfaction of every visitor able to judge in the Botanic Gardens at Port Darwin, the soil of which is decidedly not superior to the average soil of the Northern Territory, and have done so on an expenditure per acre less than that generally considered necessary on properly conducted plantations. If I had not done this, how could I have obtained the numerous distinctions for my exhibits at the Calcutta Exhibition, where I competed against the best efforts of India, Ceylon, and Queensland, and where I was awarded eight certificates of merit, together with two gold, one silver, and three bronze medals for produce grown in the Botanic Garden, produce prepared without proper appliances, simply with domestic implements by Mrs Holtze and myself? I do not think that honourable members could get any greater evidence than that supplied by Mr Holtze, because he gave practical proof of being able to compete against the world and get gold and silver medals for products, a. list of which is included in the article. Regarding the mineral wealth of the Territory, the Rev. J. E. Tenison Woods, who lived there for many years, is just as emphatic. In a report on "" The Geology and Mineralogy of the Northern Territory,"" he said I confidently assert that the Northern Terri-tory is exceptionally rich in minerals, only a small part of which has been made known to the public. I do not believe that the same quantity of minerals, veins of gold, silver, tin, copper, and lead will be found in any equal area in Australia. In fact, I doubt if in any provinces will be found any country so singularly and exceptionally favoured as Arnheinvs land is in respect to ""mineral riches. What the honourable member for North Sydney wants to do is to let South Australia take the territory up to the MacDonnell Ranges. I admit that it is very, rich country, because there we have had a battery running almost continously for, I think, twelve years, which has never put through stone that produced less than i j ounces of gold to the ton, though we have not a mine in the MACDonnell Ranges. That work has been going on from year to year, so that there is no doubt about the mineral wealth of the country. I may mention that the better class of country extends much further north than the twenty-second parallel., I think that the honourable member for North Sydney must see that it would be very foolish indeed for South Australia to agree to retain the country up to that point, and have no guarantee as to what the 'Commonwealth will do with the country north of it. For that reason I hope that the agreement will be rejected.",22
114,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"North Sydney) [4.7] - I had no intention of again speaking on this question. I have not tried in any way, except by speech in the Committee, to influence honourable members in favour of the amendment. I took the action which I thought was right from my stand-point, leaving honourable members to act as they saw fit. I object to the statement just made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, and that is what brought me to my feet. He stated that my amendment was intended to defeat the agreement.",23
115,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I saidit looked likethat.,23
116,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member said that it was intended to defeat, without going directly against the agreement.",23
117,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Hear , hear.",23
118,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"What courage does an honourable member require to go against the agreement, I ask the honourable member?",23
119,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Oh , plenty of reasons could be assigned, no doubt.",23
120,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If I were against any agreement I should have no hesiattion in saying so, nor would I see any difficulty in taking that course. What I adopted was the course which my own opinion favoured. South Australia quite right in asking to be relieved of the Territory, the troublesome portion of which is that within the tropics, and, to my mind, the Commonwealth has the right to concerned, sider the request a fair one for reTerritory, lieving the State of the Territory and its deficiency. But when we come to the conproviding ditions of the agreement, whilst I hold that South Australia should be recouped its expenditure, and even a fair portion of accumulated deficiency-for although I not think that it recouped the British GoStates. venment any potion of its accumulated deficiency when, it took over the Territory, I am willing to concede that.",23
121,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I did not know that there was any deficiency.,24
122,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I know The that there was.,24
123,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There could not have her been very much.,24
124,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I know sent that the British Government made a ber of costly experiments, which resulted in failure. I am not saying that South Australia should be called upon to refund that deficiency, nor am I objecting to the State asking for consideration as regards its own accumulated deficiency, because I consider that any reasonable proposition in that direction ought to be assented to. I am also willing that all liability which the State has incurred in the way of loan for the development of the Territory should be recouped. In that case the State receive practically all that it had spent, in addition it would be relieved from yearly loss which is heavy now, and which will increase for many years with the greater effort to develop and settle the country. The people of South Australia, as well as those of the other States, must benefit any development of the Northern Terripay. tory; but if there be a transfer South Australia alone will not be responsible for the cost of that development. being so, the Commonwealth must take over the Territory free of conditions which would prevent its settlement and development by whatever means might be considered most desirable. I assuming a State attitude in this matter, nor do I think that the State attitude should be recognised even so far as South Australia is concerned, except in respect to the refunding of her past expenditure the Territory. I do not advocate the struction of any particular line of railway, developed. not even a line through the back country ' is of Queensland and New South Wales, connecting the present lines which run inland from the coast. Those lines will be connected eventually by the States confor the development of their own by facilitating the removal of stock from drought-stricken districts, and other conveniences for the carrying on of the pastoral and other industries.",24
125,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The idea has been exthe pressed that they should be made by the ' do Commonwealth for the development of the,24
126,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have not heard it expressed here. I should oppose such a proposal were I a member of the Parliament when it was brought forward. What I now propose is not unreasonable. Commonwealth will refund to South Australia all her expenditure, and take over liabilities, reserving to itself the right, if the very expensive extension of the preline from Pine Creek to the MacnumDonnell Ranges is found not to be the most desirable way of developing the Territory, to follow some other route. When the Commonwealth becomes directly responsible for the Territory, its object will be to develop it as quickly as possible, in order to reduce the annual loss. If the construction of the line which representatives of South Australia advocate is considered best, it will be done, but if it were thought that another line or lines would better develop the Territory, the Commonwealth, would should be free to make it or them. and I propose the advancement of the north a boundary of South Australia to beyond the MACDonnell Ranges because it has been stated that the line from Port Augusta north has not yet reached country from which the traffic can be profitable, and that by when it taps the MACDonnell Ranges it will If South Australia contends that the transfer of the Northern Territory as at present bounded would make it impossible That for her to extend her railway to a goal which she has in view, it would be unfair to insist on the retention of the present boundary. Of course, if South Australia is content to have the boundary remain where am not it is, that is another matter.",24
127,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have not heard it stated that the present railway would pay if extended to the MACDonnell Ranges, on though it has been said that the MACDonconnell Range country could be profitably",24
128,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The statement to which I refer has been made, and has been supported by figures regarding the number of sheep to be carried, and probable rates of freight.",24
129,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,And byfiguresrelating to wheat.,25
130,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In a number of speeches, reference has been made to the value of .the MACDonnell Range country. I do not wish to force territory on South Australia, but I have gathered from the statements which have been made that it would be an advantage to the State to have the MACDonnell Range country included within its borders. In giving this extra territory, the Commonwealth should not accept any obligation to construct any particular railway, or to take over the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. If this Parliament is not prepared to do those things, it would be an advantage to South Australia, according to the statements which have been made, to obtain the extension of territory which my - amendment would give. The amendment has been moved in the interest, not of the Commonwealth, but of the State, and on the assumption that the Commonwealth willnot accept the conditions regarding the construction and taking over of railways. The right honourable member for East Sydney said the other day that he did not think that there should be an .attempt to amend the agreement.",25
131,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I did not say that. On the contrary, I said that in Committee we should indicate our views as to what the Commonwealth should accept. I look upon this as a matter for South Australia, not for us.",25
132,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We can indicate our views clearly only by making amendments. Speeches have been delivered entirely in favour of the agreement, partly in favour of it, and against it. Some honourable members have indicated one line of difference, and others another. Unless we materialize our views in an amendment, we cannot indicate to South. Australia the conditions which we are prepared to accept. I do not wish the Commonwealth to refuse to undertake the responsibility for the annual deficit, past expenditure, and future loss in connection with the Northern Territory, nor do I object to its undertaking the cost of developing that Territory. The development of the tropical portion will prove most difficult, and for many years will cause a very heavy loss. What I object to is the binding of the Commonwealth by conditions regarding the taking over of an existing railway and the making of another, which I do not think should be in the agreement. If the Committee is with me, it will support the amendment. If not, it will accept the agreement as it stands. I do not think that the conditions regarding future railway construction should be insisted on by South Australia. If they are, they should not be accepted by the Commonwealth. In taking over the Territory, the Commonwealth pledges itself to do its best for the development of the Territory, not in the interests of any State, but of the Territory, and, consequently, of all Australia.",25
133,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Adelaide) [4.20] - The words of the last speaker might lead one to believe that he is overwhelmed with love, and a desire to do the right thing, for South Australia. We must give him credit for the purest motives. But the Committee is concerned, not with the motive power of the honourable member, but with where we are likely to stop if he be permitted to move us. If I were driving a motor, the motive power would be a matter of very little concern to me so long as the machine continued to progress in the direction. I desired. The honourable member for North Sydney will see that whatever his motives in submitting his amendment may be, he ought to consider the result should honourable members permit themselves to be influenced by his proposal.",25
134,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I think I made that clear.,25
135,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Althoug h he has said that he is not opposed to the agreement, the honourable member must admit that the effect nf his amendment would be to break it.",25
136,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am opposed to the agreement, as it stands.",25
137,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the amendment were accepted, the proposed transfer of the Territory from South Australia would be a thing of the past. The honourable member can* hardly expect the people of South Australia to favour his proposal. Whatever be his motive in submitting it, his amendment, if adopted, would result in the rejection of the agreement, and the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth would not now. take place. Whether honourable members desire that the Northern Territory shall ever be. taken over by the Commonwealth, I do not know; but the project is one to which, I think, serious attention should be given, even if the agreement includes some small ditions which do not meet with the entire approval of honourable members.",25

141,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We want an areasouthern which, compared with the area of the Northern Territory, may be described as flowerpot-full of earth. South Australia is offering to the Commonwealth a terriit tory as large as that occupied by many nations. We have certain powers, as Commonwealth Parliament, but under the Constitution we cannot exercise supreme control over one square yard of territory in the whole of Australia. Under this agreement, we are offered millions of acres, hundreds of thousands of square miles, of excellent country, embracing climatic conditions to be found in almost every other part of the Commonwealth. On compliance with a few comparatively trifling conditions, the Federal Parliament would be in a position to exercise supreme Territory should be taken over. control over this territory, to do with as it thinks fit, and to exercise, within boundaries, full powers in the matter government. Notwithstanding the possibilities of the Northern Territory, the desire expressed in this Parliament a territory of our own to develop, we haggling over the conditions in a ^manner which, I venture to say, does not reflect credit upon us. ' South Australia has control of this Territory fora number years. During that period, the people South Australia have held the Territory for Australia, and not for a small section of the people of the Commonwealth. They have .not done, as I venture to say Wen done in New South Wales and take Queensland, misused a portion of their ritory in such a way that the Federal liament would now be only too glad them out under any conditions. The request made now is that the Northern conTerritory shall be accepted by the Commonwealth, as it stands, with its few pounds of debt.",26
142,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,How many,26
143,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"A few pounds only. South Australia - is asking about twopence been per acre for the Northern Territory, inof cluding improvements in the shape of harbors, jetties, railways, and other public meet works. The South Australian people are offering, to the Commonwealth the Northern Territory, with all its resources, on condition of the payment of a few pounds debt incurred in connection with it, and the construction of a railway, over which to give the Commonwealth would have complete control, connecting the northern with the sea. If the Territory is taken over on the terms suggested by one or two honora able members, however plausible their statements to the contrary may be, no portion of will ever be developed unless the trade with it is directed to one particular city - The a curse of Australia up to the present time has been that, in every State, country has been opened up and developed only if it increased the trade and importance of the capital city of the State. As this Parliament is at present constituted, and is likely to continue, no power will be able to move the it to construct the railway referred to in any but one direction, irrespective of the interest of any State in the construction of the line. Some honourable members aver that South Australia is asking that the I hapit pened to be in the South Australian House its of Assembly when the agreement was apof proved by the Parliament of that State. I great was in daily conversation with the late and Premier of the State when these matters for were under consideration. I wish to say are that, while there was an impression among public men that the Commonwealth Parliament, with its greater powers, and finanhad cial strength, would be able more quickly ot and profitably for the whole of Australia of to develop the Northern Territory; yet, so far as the people of South Australia were concerned I did not know, and do not at present know, of,any overwhelming desire on has their part that the Commonwealth should over the Territory. There was an intertimation to the then Premier of the State Parthat, were he able to secure an agreement to buy of a reasonable character, he might only depend on the Parliament of South Australia to support that agreement. He came here and entered into a conference with the Prime Minister, and was supported during the whole of that conference by one of the leading daily journals of Victoria. As a result, an agreement was arrived at. I should like to contrast the treatment of that agreement and of another recently arrived at by the Prime Minister and certain other persons. This one was subsequently ratified by the South Australian Parliament. Consequently it is now an agreement between the Prime Minister-act ing for his Ministry and for his side of politics, at any rate, in the Federal Parliament-and a State. Yet some honourable members are about to break it, apparently with the lightest of hearts, and with an utter disregard for the interests of the whole of the State which stands behind it. At the same time the same members are urging others to stand fast to the agreement upon the financial question, which up to the present has been made only between the Prime Minister and certain ephemeral Premiers of the different States. I cannot understand the change of front. The one agreementmade between the Prime Minister and certain Premiers who come and go, one of whom has already gone, and three others of whom are in a distinctly parlous conditionis of such a binding character as to force the whole of a particular party behind it, and the Prime Minister stands or falls by it, asserting that his Ministry must live or die with it. But in the other case, where the agreement is between the Prime Minister and the whole of the people of a State, and has received the unanimous approval of the Parliament of that State, the same honourable members seem to believe that they can break through it as lightly as air, with an utter disregard for all its provisions. I respectfully submit to honourable members that, whatever may be their immediate view, the fact that an opportunity is offered to them of being supreme masters, through this Parliament, of so huge a territory, with all its possibilities, ought to have some influence in determining them to accept the comparatively small conditions which stand in the agreement. I have no authority to - speak either for South Australia or for any of its representatives, but I say distinctly that, if this amendment is carried, what is left of the agreement cannot possibly have my support. I regard the amendment as fatal. If it is approved of, the agreement might just as well be thrown out. Indeed, it would be better if honourable members would say at once that they will not accept the agreement, and leave it open to South Australia, if she so desires, to offer further conditions or to undertake the development of the Territory herself. I do not know who first suggested that the southern portion of the Territory should remain under South Australian control, and that the part north of the MACDonnell Ranges should be taken over by the Commonwealth, but, whoever the individual was, he made the suggestion purely on his own initiative, and so far as I can find, without authority. He must have been acting entirely upon his own responsibility. It finds no favour in South Australia, and, so far as I can gather, it has no possible chance of acceptance there. I had no overwhelming desire that the offer embodied in the present agreement should be made. Had I consulted my own personal wishes, I should have preferred that South Australia should retain the Territory. A time will come, probably within a very few years, when the Federal Parliament will ask South Australia to hand over to it that portion of the Commonwealth. Even earlier, perhaps, this Parliament will keenly regret that it did not accept the agreement with its limited conditions. Although the motive of the honourable member for North Sydney may be as pure as a motive cam possibly be in a public man, I hope that his amendment will be beaten.  honourable member for Hindmarsh has suggested that honourable members must be sceptical as to the value of the Northern Territory. But we cannot well be sceptical on that point, in view of the very glowing picture which has been painted of its merits and possibilities. I , for one, am not at all sceptical. I place a good deal of reliance upon the statements of the honourable member for Grey, who has seen a large portion of the country, and knowsa great deal about it, and who had no hesitation in giving his personal testimonyas to the value of the Territory. But I am sceptical whether the Commonwealth can develop it better than could the State Government. The development of Australia can be best achieved within the strict lines of the Constitution. The Commonwealth may advantageously carry out its more legitimate functions, leaving all internal development to take place under the' aegis of the States. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Surely the honourable member does not call this an i l legitimate function?  proper function if South Australia cannot possibly develop the Territory herself. But South Australia takes up a very strong position in saying that if the Commonwealth will not accept the transfer she is prepared to retain the Territory, and that this is our last chance of getting it. She must therefore have the intention as well as the means to develop it. The honourable member for Adelaide said that the Commonwealth Parliament ought to take it over, because we could then do precisely, as we liked with it ; and in fact, be the supreme masters of the situation. That indicates to me an intention on the part of some honourable members that the Commonwealth Government should, in addition to exercising its proper Commonwealth functions, take possession of the Territory and undertake work which the State Governments' are essentially designed to perform. That would be altogether a mistaken mode of procedure. If this Parliament should ratify the agreement and take, over and become the supreme masters of the Territory, we can only properly retain the mastery of it while its development remains in its initial stages. As soon as it becomes sufficiently developed, the necessity will be cast upon us of giving it some sort of Constitution and making its position analogous to that occupied by the other States.",26

Inasmuch as it is repeatedly asserted that the Territory contains a large area of good country, and that it is wealth producing, surely South Australia should be allowed to develop it. These are the views which prompt me to support the amendment. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [4.45] - I recognise that for years South Australia has maintained the Northern Territory as a white man's country. It has prevented the boodleier from intruding into that immense domain.

150,Mr FRAZER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The way in which the Government vary the order of business and, whilst professing anxiety to expedite the consideration of a Bill, drop it as soon as an opportunity occurs to push on with it, certainly does not appeal to me. I have not spoken on the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, but think that the people of South Australia are entitled to have without delay the decision of thi« House with regard to it. The Defence Bill was considered so urgent about three weeks ago that the closure was applied to expedite its progress. It has been urgent indeed for several years, and the Government now think it of such pressing importance that they have adjourned the further consideration of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, although they have obviously a majority in favour of it.",29
151,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is why its further consideration has been postponed. .,29
152,Mr FRAZER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No doubt. The Government have present today a majority ready to pass the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill ; but they are not prepared to put them to the test. It is nece'ssary that the people of South Australia should know without delay what is to be the fate of the agreement; but apparently some honourable members opposite have said to the Government, "" We will vote with you against the - amendment proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney, provided that you do not proceed further with the Bill . "" If that is not the position, Why did the Government report progress when they had in attendance a majority apparently prepared to pass the Bill. Whilst the Defence Bill deserves every consideration, whether it is proceeded with today or tomorrow does not seriously matter. But why not settle the agreement with South Australia as to the Northern Territory while honourable members are fully acquainted with the facts? If the Government are not in favour of the agreement, why not let the people of South Australia know? Why continue to adjourn the matter? In my humble opinion, the Government are humbugging with a most important question, and bringing the Commonwealth into contempt in the eyes of the South Australian people. I have no sympathy with the attitude which they are adopting.",29
153,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wentworth) [5.2] - If the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is so much concerned about the passage of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, he should have expressed his opinion to that effect while the measure was before the House. If I recollect rightly, however, he did not raise his voice in favour of the Bill. I do not know whether it was his modesty that prevented him from saying anything, but he did not even object to progress being reported. I am glad to learn that the view of the Leader of the Opposition as to the urgency of'the Defence Bill is not shared in by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. I understood the Leader of the Opposition to ask for a postponement of the measure because a member of his party is ill. I rejoice that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie desires to proceed with the Bill, .and am glad that the measure will be dealt with while he is in such an amiable frame of mind.",29
154,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wide Bay) [5.3] - The honourable member for Wentworth has either misunderstood me, or placed a wrong construction on what I said. The point which I put to the Prime Minister does not affect me personally, but, if there is a member of this House whose attendance would be desirable when the Defence Bill is under consideration, it is the honourable member for West Sydney. I have a telegram from him stating that he has been medically advised to remain at home for a week. While not urging the Government to delay the Defence Bill, T think I was justified in bringing that point under the notice of the Prime Minister.",29
155,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am sorry that the honourable member is ill .,29
156,Mr CARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Macquarie) f5-4-l-- I protest against the postponement of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill.,29
157,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The matter was arranged on the floor of the House last week.,29
158,Mr CARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I know of no such arrangement. While the matter of the Northern Territory may not be so important as the Defence Bill, yet it is really a part of our fence policy, because no effective defence of Australia can be devised until the Commonwealth is in possession of the Territory. It is possible that the opportunity to acquire it may disappear if we do not grapple with the question at once. To say that the Defence Bill is more important is simply to say that the whole is greater than its part, which we all admit.",30
159,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Boothby) [5.5] - I understood that the Government intended to proceed with the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill until the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney was disposed of. ' I desire to repeat what I urged upon the Government last week, that the question should be settled as early as possible. It is useless to delay a settlement until we approach the end of the session, because the Senate must have time to consider the subject. Furthermore, the question should be settled one way or the other, in order that South Australia may know what position she occupies in relation to the development of the Territory. It is useless to talk about lack of population and settling people on the soil of the Northern Territory if we delay dealing with the matter. I feel confident that, had the Government decided to proceed with the Bill further this afternoon, we could almost have disposed of it at today's sitting. Of course, I have no wish to take business out of the hands of the Government, but I impress upon them the desirableness, and, indeed, the urgent necessity, of arriving at an early decision if the spirit of the agreement is to be carried out. Mr KING O'MALLEV (Darwin) [5.6]. - In my opinion, the Northern Territory question should be settled before we proceed to deal with the Defence Bill, because the northern coasts of Australia are in most need of defence. In saying so, however, I may state again that I am opposed to the whole defence policy, because it is unnecessary. We no more require such a policy than it was required as between Canada and the United States, which settled questions at issue between them as far back as 1817, and have never since had a warship on the lakes.",30
160,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There are warships there now. Mr KING O'MALLEY - But what kind of warships? The vessels there are merely little schooners. We must base our dedefence scheme upon a recognition of the importance of defending the Northern Territory. We should not dilly-dally with the question. But procrastination is the fundamental basis of the British Constitution; and it seems to me that procrastination is also the fundamental basis of the Fusion, or fungus, organization which supports the Government. The further postponement of the Bill is to me an evidence that the Government have neither confidence in themselves nor sincerity. I - want the people of South Australia to know what this Parliament proposes to do in the matter. Let the people and the Parliament of South Australia know where they are. Let the Treasurer of that State know whether he has to go onfinancingthe Territory or whether the Commonwealth intends to do so. The agreement is a business proposition. Surely no one will deny that a European or an American, syndicate would very quickly grab the Territory if offered?",30
161,Mr MCDONALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Coul d it not be financed through the National Postal banking system? Mr KING O'MALLEY - If I speak on one side I am told that I am wrong, and if I try to speak on the other side I am checked. There is a standing order to stop me at every point. We are stopped at every turn from the cradle, and at last we are kicked into the grave. It seems to me that it is the same when I try to speak here. I am trying to show why the Government ought to ask the House to dispose of th-i Northern Territory Acceptance Bill today. When the Prime Minister and the late Premier of South Australia, Mr. Price, entered into the agreement, it seemed to be satisfactory to both sides, so why should we postpone its consideration? Is not today the day of salvation ? To-morrow we may meet with damnation.",30
162,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Robertson) [5.12] - It seems to me that we do not know where we are. We have been called here repeatedly to discuss the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, but the debate had not been more than begun, before the consideration of its provisions was postponed.",30
163,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That was done to-dav pursuant to an arrangement specificallv made on the floor of the House last week.,30
164,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That makes the position worse. It shows that last week the Government wished to postpone the consideration of the Bill and did all that they possibly could to prevent honor-' able members from expressing an opinion. If the Bill is a part of their policy, let them go on with it to a finish, otherwise let it be defeated and thrown aside. The question of the transfer of the Northern Territory has been dangled before the House for many years. been described as part of the policy of the Government, but it seems that the consideration of the Bill is not to be pushed on, and that it must once more go under the table. I do not think that that is fair to the House. When we come here prepared to discuss the Bill the Government wish to postpone its consideration. Presently the next Bill on the notice-paper will be served in a similar way. If the Government wish to go on with the consideration of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill to a finish, let them do so independently of whether that means putting it under the table or carrying it into effect. I hope that when it is again set down for consideration the Government will proceed to a finish.",30
165,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yarra) [5.15] - It is simply marvellous that directly the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydneywas rejected the Government, although they had a majority,- decided to postpone the consideration of the Bill.. In view of the fact that it cannot be more than sevenweeks to the end of the session, and that this measure has to go to the Senate, does any one think that there was any sincerity about the proposal to postpone its consideration to-dnv? We have had before us an agreement which is being treated very differently from that other agreement which the honourable member for Adelaide referred to this afternoon. It does not matter how members of the Fusion party vote against this particular proposal, but they must swallow the other agreement. Apparently the Government fear that if the Bill is proceeded with it will be carried. Finding from a division that they were in a majority they immediately asked the Committee to report progress for the purpose of having the Bill thrown under the table. Th'e Prime Minister interjected recently that last week there was an arrangement made with the Opposition for the purpose of adjourning the consideration of this proposal.",31
166,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I was no party to any arrangement. I objected to any postponement.,31
167,Mr WILKS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honourable member think that the majority today was a solid majority ?,31
168,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is the business of the Government to know how the majority was created.,31
169,Mr WILKS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member voted with them to save their face. It has Mr TUDOR - I voted with the Government to adhere to the agreement and against the amendment of. the honourable member for North Sydney. It is rather strange, by the way, that an honourable member who is retiring from Parliamentary life was put up to move it. As soon as we supported them the Government became afraid and dropped the Bill. If a division is called-for on this motion I shall vote for the Government proceeding with the consideration of the Bill, believing that it should be disposed of as scon as possible.",31
170,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Would the honourable member vote for the transfer of the Northern Territory ?,31
171,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the Bill is proceeded with the honourable member will see how I shall vote concerning this particular agree-, ment.",31
172,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That will be a great satisfaction to South Australia. Mi. TUDOR - Whateve r opinions I express here I am prepared to stick to, and will not desire to explain themawav.",31
173,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Order ! That is not the question before the House. - Mr TUDOR - I admit that, sir, but I was drawn off the track by the irregular member for Wentworth, who has no right to interject. Apparently the Government reckon that they have the numbers, and are, therefore, anxious to adjourn the consideration of the Bill. If they say that it will be proceeded with at a later date I trust that it will not be a very far distant date, and that we shall have an opportunity of keeping faith with the people of South Australia. They should know whether or not we mean business, and this question should not be kept dangling before the country from Parliament to Parliament, as it has been.",31
174,Mr DEAKI N,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [5.18] - This is one of the most unfair debates which I have ever heard in this House. The conduct of business was arranged by the Government, as far as it could, to meet the convenience of honourable members who have been taking an active part in discussing these measures. We have pressed on this particular Bill, although it has occupied an inordinate share of the session, taking into account the business to be transacted, because it was represented that - if the vole on the second reading or upon the important amendment just dealt with were adverse to the Government, either contingency would cause a reconsideration of the agreement as a whole. In order that we might ascertain whether any radical alterations would be required, we brought the measure forward at a time which did not suit the convenience of the Government, and meant a sacrifice of time that ordinarily would have been devoted to the consideration of the Defence Bill. The latter measure was expressly set down on the notice-paper for today, to meet the wishes of some of those, including the members of the Opposition, who have a right to be heard on the question. Then, again, in order that we might arrive at a decision on a critical amendment which might involve further consultation with the Government of South Australia, we agreed to continue the consideration of the Bill until such time, not later than the dinner hour today, as would enable that amendment to be disposed of. The - Government have met the House frankly and fairly, have not considered their own wishes, but have arranged the business to meet the convenience of honourable members, who have a title to be considered in this matter. As soou as the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney was dealt with today, then, in accordance with the arrangement, made apparently with the consent of the whole House present, for no one objected on Friday last",31
175,Mr FEAZER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,No . The honourable member is wrong.,32
176,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Perhaps the honourable member objected.,32
177,Mr FRAZER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There were only two members who spoke, and they both opposed the arrangement.",32
178,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It met with the consent of all those whom I consulted except the honourable member. Of course, the honourable member for Boothby pressed on the House generally the importance of the measure, with which we quite concurred. As a matter of fact, the Defence Bill was set down for consideration today by request, to enable the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney in the Northern Territory Bill to be decided.",32
179,Mr FRAZER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Why not go on with the Bill now? ,32
180,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Because the consideration of the Defence Bill was fixed for today, to meet the convenience of honourable - members specially interested in defence, and of the House as a whole.",32

Question so resolved in the affirmative. DEFENCE BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 14th October, vide page 4575): Clause 3 (Amendment of section 2 of Principal Act).  we should hear from the Minister on this clause, which is vital to the Bill.",32
182,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Surely the honourable member does not desire another second-reading debate on the clause ?  to know what I am being asked to votes upon. Mr. JOSEPH 'COOK (ParramattaMinister of Defence) [5.31] - The honourable member is being asked to vote on a clause outlining some additions to the existing Act, providing for compulsorytraining as set out in the Bill, and enlarging generally the scope of the Defence Forces. The clause is really an explanatory clause, and the matters with which it deals will require to be discussed separately on other clauses of the Bill.",32
183,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Adelaide) [5.32] - As it is proposed to change what previously were known as "" M i l it i a "" and ""Volunteer "" forces into "" Citizen "" forces, and the clause covers practically the whole of the Defence Force, I suggest that the Minister might make it his business during the next few months to delve into the question of the Central Administration. When the Estimates were before us last year I ventured in a few words to direct attention to the ever-increasing cost of the Central Administration, and according to the reports of experts the ever-decreasing efficiency of our forces from a war point of view.",33
184,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is ihis relevant to the clause ?,33
185,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think it is. The clause refers to the alteration of the "" M i l it i a "" into ""Citizen"" forces. Presumably the Central Administration at present existing will continue to be the Central Administration for the 'Citizen Forces.",33
186,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The clause refers to the character and designation of the forces and not to questions of administration.,33
187,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The clause proposes an alteration in the name of our forces, and covers a universal obligation in respect to naval and military training; exemptions from personal service; and registration and enrolment for naval and military training. It must necessarily have tion to the persons who will have control of those who are registered and enrolled.",33
188,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think it is convenient that at this stage I should ask whether the honourable member is in order. It teems to me that this clause has nothing to do with administration. It refers to the persons who will be included in the different forms of service. It deals with an alteration in the name of the forces, with a matter of designation ahd not of administration.",33
189,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I shall deal with the matter to which I wish to refer when we come to the proposed new section 32.,33
190,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Wentworth) ^5-35]- ? should like to ask the Minister of Defence whether he does not think that it would facilitate the passing of the Bill if he were to postpone this clause until other clauses of the measure have been dealt with. The proposed headings for the various Parts of the Bill cannot remain as they are set out in this clause unless the various clauses included in those Parts are later agreed to by the Committee. I am myself proposing the insertion of a few additional clauses dealing with the training of officers and it would be convenient to include them in a separate Part-of the Bill.,33
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,This clause could be amended if necessary.,33
192,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Why should we go to the trouble of recommitting the Bill for such a purpose? There is nothing controversial in the clause, and we cannot at this stage say what the designations of the different Parts of the Bill should be until we have considered its various clauses.",33
193,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"East Sydney) [5.36] - The ' headings of the various Parts of the Bill must depend on the form in which it leaves the Committee. I remind the Minister that it would be very inconvenient to have a general debate on (he main question under there headings. The honourable gentleman will do well to postpone the clause. Unless that course is adopted, should it be necessary later to alter these headings we should have to recommit the Bill to make the alteration.",33
194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If it b? the wish of the Committee lhat the clause should be postponed I shall have no objection. - Clause postponed. Clause 4Section 31 of the principal Act is amended by omitting the word ""Garrison.""  very pleased with the proposed amendment relaof the existing Act. Nothing ever gave me more surprise than to find that the garrison artillery were not acauainted with field gun drill. I considered that one of the greatest anomalies in the service. When the first Defence Bill was introduced by the right honourable member for S'wan, the honourable gentleman said that the Permanent Forces would be the skeleton of a militia force in time of war. I know from my own experience in the Imperial sen-ice, that whether artillery men belonged to field, garrison, or horse batteries, they were capable of handling either siege or field guns. When the honourable member for Richmond was Minister of Defence, I was surprised to learn that the Royal Australian Artillery were garrison artillery, and did no field gun drill. The honourable gentleman promised that when the time came for a revision of the Act he would bring the matter before the Cabinet, and I understood that the Cabinet decided that the word "" garrison "" should be deleted, so that the Royal Australian Artillery might be used in any branch of artillery work. I am glad that the amendment is proposed in this Bill. Clause agreed to. Clause 5Section 32 of the principal Act is repealed, nnd the following sections are substituted in lieu thereof32. (1) The Citizen Naval Forces shall be divided into Militia Forces, Volunteer Forces and Reserve Forces. (2) The Naval Militia Forces shall consist of officers, petty officers, and sailoTs who are not bound to continuous naval service, and who are paid for their services as prescribed. (3) The Naval Volunteer Forces shall consist of officers, petty officers and sailors who .are not bound to continuous naval service, and who are not ordinarily paid for their services in times of peace (4) The Naval Reserve Forces shall consist of(a) members of Rifle Clubs who are allotted to the Naval Reserve Forces; and (J) persons who, having served in the Active Naval Forces or otherwise scribed, are enrolled as members of the Naval Reserve Forces. 32A. (1) The Citizen Military Forces shall consist of Active Forces and Reserve Forces. (2) The Active Citizen Military Forces shall consist of the Militia Forces, the Volunteer Forces, those undergoing military training under the provisions of paragraph (c) of section one hundred and twenty-five of this Act, and officers on the unattached list. (3) The Military Reserve Forces shall consist of Citizen Forces, and shall include the officers shown on the Reserve of Officers' List, the members of Rifle Clubs who are allotted to the Military Reserve Forces, and all those liable to serve in time of war under section fifty-nine of this Act who are not included in the Active Forces.",33
195,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wilmot) [5.40] - I should like to ask the Minister of Defence to outline what is meant by Naval Volunteer Forces, in sub-section 3 of the proposed new section. Is it intended that we shall have naval forces who at times will be paid and at other times will not be .paid? Is there to be on the naval side a similar distinction to that which exists on the military side between the ordinary paid militia and the volunteers?",34
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [5.41] - This clause makes no such differentiation as the honourable member suggests. All it does is to continue the Naval Forces as they exist at present, simply separating them, for purposes of definition, from the Military Forces. Nothing is yet settled as to the future of the Naval Forces. That will very likely be determined by reports which we hope to receive from London regarding what is requisite for manning and officering the new units about to be created. My own idea at present is that we shall require a new Naval Bill to deal with that matter. All I am doing for the present is to continue what is already in existence, separating it from the military side for the purpose of clearer definition. For instance, the subdivision of the Naval Forces is quite different from that of the Military Forces. ^ Mr ATKINSON - What is the difference between the Militia Naval Forces and the Volunteer Naval Forces?",34
197,Mr JOSERH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,On e is paid and the other is not; that is the principal difference. This clause re-enacts the old section with such definitions as are requisite.,34
198,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wide Bay) [5.43]--As I intend to afford the Government every facility to pass the measure, and not to debate the principles if that can be avoided, as is pre- I shall simply move That the words ""Volunteer Forces,"" line 5, be left out. T cannot understand what advantage we can derive from having a Volunteer Naval Force. I am afraid that there has been a tendency recently'to have what I call display Naval Forces. People who have yachts of their own form special contingents  referring to the "" yatsmen.""",34
199,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If we are to have an effective Defence Force we may as well face the question at once, and recognise that a Volunteer Force in the Naval Forces is of no use.",34
200,Mr WILKS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Dalley) [5.45J - The amendment might have some force if it were moved on a Bill dealing completely with the naval branch of the service, but this cl.'.use only sets out again the names of the different parts of the existing Naval Forces. There is no naval volunteer force today in New South Wales such as there is in Victoria. The Sydney Naval Brigade is composed of men who have led a deepsea-faring life at some time or other. Some of them have even been in the British Naval service. They are officered by men who have mainly passed out of the ranks of active sea captains, and others who have been Naval Reserve men. A few years ago there was formed in New South Wales what was called a Naval Volunteer Force, which had the same relation to the Naval Brigade as the land volunteer force has to the land militia. The honourable member f i r Maranoa seems to ridicule the idea of a Volunteer Naval Force, but on further examination he will find that it is not open to so much ridicule as he thinks. There are numbers of young men whom he calls yachtsmen, but who often earn their livelihood as fishermen or on ferries, or in other ways, in Australian ports and harbors. They are debarred from entering the Naval Brigade because they have not had deep-sea experience, although accustomed to handling boats inside, and even outside, harbors. The idea of the Naval Volunteer Force was to obtain recruits of that character.  who ""want to don a uniform and do no drill ?",34
201,Mr WILKS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am not referring to that class. I am pointing out a class of men that can be obtained for our Naval Forces. Too much attention has been given in the past to the land Volunteer Force, at the expense of the Naval Volunteer Forces. There are numbers of young men in the various ports who have never been to sea, but who earn their livelihood, or spend a great deal of their time, on the water, and who would make admirable material to train for the Naval Forces. I am not prepared to say whether it was wise to differentiate between the Naval Brigade and the Naval Volunteers, but, while the conditions for admission to the Naval Brigade are so stringent as to preclude those young men from joining it, their only opening is to associate themselves with the Naval Volunteer Force. It would be far better to abolish the Volunteer Force, and, at the same time, to remove the embargo, which prevents men, and particularly young men, who have never been outside the waters of a harbour, from joining the Naval Brigade. If the honourable member for Maranoa is prepared to agree to that, the difficulty be got over. But those young men should not be shut out.. In the past, the Naval Brigade has, unfortunately, been culled only from a select few.",35
202,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,This Bill shuts one out.,35
203,Mr WILKS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Bill does not deal with the matter at all, and, as the Minister said, a new Bill dealing with the naval section of the defence scheme will be required. This is simply an introductory clause, reiterating the conditions that exist today, and, whether the Leader of the Opposition strikes out the words "" Volunteer Forces"" or not, the Naval Volunteer Forces will remain, because provision is made for them under the existing Act. In the early days, the Naval Volunteer Forces in New South Wales were recruited from the desirable class of young men to whom I have referred, but, after a while, there came in the commercial clerk and others, who probably went aboard a yacht only on a Saturday afternoon, or even once a quarter. Today, the yacht has been supplanted to a great extent in that regard by the motorlaunch, but, in any case, it would be absurd to compose our Naval Volunteer Forces of such men. The Naval Brigade that we ought to build up is a body-of men who in an emergency could take, the place of trained men on war vessels, and be a sort of auxiliary force. While the Leader of the Opposition may be right in his view, this is not the proper Bill in which to give effect to it.",35
204,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think we should declare the principle here, and omit the words.",35
205,Mr WILKS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But this clause does not repeal the existing Act, and the Naval Volunteer Forces would continue to exist in spite of the amendment.",35
206,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Hindmarsh) [5.51]. This is a Bill which provides for compulsory training, and, therefore, no class distinctions. The Minister has stated-ver y properly-that the Government intended to merge the volunteers into the militia. If the words are retained they will merely enable a few yachtsmen to swell around in uniform without rendering any adequate service to the Commonwealth. Mt: PAGE (Maranoa) [5.53] - The honourable member for Dalley made out a fairly strong case in favour of the establishment of a Volunteer Naval Force. But from information which I have received can the idea underlying it is that yachtsmen about Sydney Harbor",35
207,Mr SINCLAIR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They are after the plumage.  no above all party consideration. So far as I am concerned, no hard-and-fast rule has been laid down. The Labour party recognise this question is a national one, and are prepared to vote upon it accordingly.",35
208,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Corio) [5-59J-If views coincided with those of the honourable member for Maranoa, I should be prepared to vote with him.",36
209,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The adoption of the amendment will not prevent the establishserve Forces, ment of naval cadet corps.",36
210,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is it proposed that "" every cadet shall be paid ? ",36
211,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is news to .me. As the clause stands, a man who is not in the Permanent Forces or in the militia will be a volunteer.",36
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"""Volunteer"" means a man who is not paid for his sernaval vices. - Mr CROUCH - We may say that he is forces. a compulsory volunteer.",36
213,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is the farce of the Bill.,36
214,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Minister says that the word "" volunteer "" applies to a man who is not paid for his services; so that are going to have compulsory paid and paid men. The honourable member for Wide Bay would do away with the Volunteer Forces altogether. There are certain conforce. ditions, however, that must be met, and would be unwise to cripple the Department which, in administering the Act, might it desirable to have volunteers, either in form of junior cadets or pilots,",36
215,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The pilots can be atpelled tached to the naval militia.,36
216,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Then the honourable member proposes that they shall be paris tially paid? ,36
217,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Because they do not have to undergo the drills that are necesclasses sary in the case of the militia. If thought that, as the honourable member for Wide Bay has suggested, yachtsmen would join the Naval Forces only because they would thus be enabled to wear a naval uniform and pass as officers, I should in view this*question very differently.  will do so.",36
218,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Har d cases, make bad laws, and we should not omit a useful proNaval vision because of the fear that it may be abused. It may be necessary to have a force of naval volunteers.",36
219,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Gippsland) [6.4],-There are one or two points on which I need to be enlightened, more especially in view ofW the statement just made by the honourable member for Corio, that ur.der this Bill we are to have compulsory volunteers. This clause provides thatThe Citizen Naval Forces shall be divided into Militia Forces, Volunteer Forces and Reand that the Citizen Military Forces shall consist of active forces and reserve forces."" I am puzzled to know why there should be this differentiation-wh y the Citizen Naval Forces should be divided in this way, whilst the Citizen Military Forces are to consist of active forces and reserve forces. Then, again, it is provided that the Naval Reserve Forces shall consist ofPersons who, having served in the active forces or otherwise as is prescribed, are enrolled as members of the naval reserve There is no previous reference, however, to "" active Naval Forces."" I could understand the provision if the Naval Forces had been divided, as are the Military Forces, into active forces and reserve we forces, but, as the Bill stands, I am at a unloss to account for it. As to the other point which has been raised, a man is either a volunteer or is compelled to join some If he is compelled to join, he at it once ceases to be a volunteer; the question of compulsion is not affected by the fact find of whether or not a man is paid for his the services. It is absurd to say that a man is a volunteer because, although he is comto join a force, he is not paid for his services.",36
220,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wentworth) [6.6] - This another clause with which it seems to me we are dealing rather prematurely. We are now. proposing to provide, before we have the Naval Bill before us, into what our naval defenders shall be arI ranged. This House has shown a desire, of recent 3'ears, to have more efficiency in our Defence Forces, and when the Naval Bill is before us it will probably insist that the Naval Forces shall be as efficient - personnel as any they are likely to meet. ",36
221,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Certainl y ; otherwise, ' they are worse than useless, since they give us a false sense of security. When the Bill is before us we may decide that the principal Act, which we are now amending, shall be further amended, in order to do away with what may be described as mere flummery. We may, for the sake of argument, decide that our Naval Defence Forces shall consist of permanent men and naval reserves. I am speaking only of the possibilities; but I ask why we should now set about amending the principal Act, since, when the Naval Bill is before us, we may have to further amend it, ",36
222,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Thes e words proposed to be left out may be held to apply to the Military Forces if they, are not eliminated.",37
223,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I amr confining my attention to the naval question, and suggest the postponement of this clause until we have disposed of the remaining clauses. The Minister of Defence may then be in a position to tell us what his naval proposals are.  teer naval forces.",37
224,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,In pre-Federation days the States had Naval Brigades. ,37
225,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Some of the States had Naval militia and others Naval volunteers.,37
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There is nothing new in this.,37
227,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But I thought we were trying to get away from the volunteer system. ' Mr KELLY - The postponement of this clause will avoid a great deal of discussion that may otherwise have to be repeated. It does not affect the essentials of the Bill, and cannot be satisfactorily discussed in the absence of the naval measure which we are all so anxiously awaiting.",37
228,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Wide Bay) [6.8] - This is not an abstruse question. All that we have to determine is whether or not we are going to continue the application of the volunteer principle to either arm of our defence system. Are we going to create little privileges for privileged people or are we going to establish a defence system on the basis that we need men capable of defending Australia irrespective of what their position in societv may be? The Minister will be well advised if he agrees to the omission of these words.,37
229,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"What , and have no volunteers? A volunteer is better than a pressed man.",37
230,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have been a volunteer, and have always been in favour of the volunteer system, but know that it has absolutely broken down. The young men of my birthplace are much disturbed because the volunteer system is to be done away with, and their corps is to be disbanded. But that is not the point. We are entering upon the serious business of the defence of the Commonwealth, and should eliminate from the system anything suggesting that there are privileged people who are entitled to privileged positions. It is for that reason I hold that these words should be omitted.",37
231,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Look at the Scottish regiments ! They are not privileged.,37
232,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have just said that I have always favoured the volunteer system, but that after twenty-five years' experience it has absolutely broken down. I do not say that volunteers are useless, but they are not of themselves competent to defend the country. Mr J. H. CATTS - Is the Ministry divided on this question?",37
233,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not know. If the Minister will not agree to the omission of the words, this Bill will be no more effective than is the present Act.",37
234,Mr WILKS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Dalley) [6.10] - I am in accord with the position taken up by the honourable member for Wide Bay, because my desire is to obtain an effective defence system. In my previous speech I tried to explain the history of the volunteer system in New South Wales, but it has since occurred to me that a good deal more could be said about its experience of Naval Volunteer Forces, which I may explain were naval only in name. In Sydney the men used to dress as sailors and parade the streets. After being trained for two or three years on a hulk or a boat they would march through the streets with bands playing ""Sons of the Sea"" and "" A life on the Ocean Wave,"" but that is about all that they knew. A good many of them did not get out of Pitt-street, Sydney. Our object should be to secure effective defence. More opportunities should be afforded to young men to associate with old sea dogs and form a Naval Brigade or Reserve or Militia. If the deletion of the words ''Volunteer Forces"" would get over the difficulty, and secure the existence of only one force, well and good. If the Minister will - refer to the Central Administration he will find that, whilst originally the Naval Volunteer Forces of New South Wales were composed of men with long seafaring experience, they were afterwards composed of men who merely received a limited amount of cutlass drill and who should have been in the land forces. There are thousands of men located on our coast line who, if offered a choice to join, would fer the Naval to the Military Forces. If the deletion of the words "" Volunteer Forces"" will not shut out those men I shall support the amendment. I think that in a maritime country such as ours is the Naval Reserves should be much stronger than they are. It is only eighteen months ago that"" I fought from the other side of Chamber for the strengthening pf our Naval Reserve Forces. The honourable member for Ballarat, who was Prime Minister then, as he is now, said that there was no necessity for reserves, as they had enough men. But now he says that what we require are better trained men and more of them. The incident shows the difference of opinion which will take place in the course of a few months. I think that there is a good deal in the contention of the honourable member for Wide Bay.",37
235,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Werriwa) [6.i6] --I have been anxious to hear what the Minister has to say in defence of this differentiation between Naval Volunteer Forces and Naval Militia Forces. From his speech in. introducing the Bill I understood that his purpose was to do away with the Volunteer Forces on the land.,38
236,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is so.,38
237,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It has been admitted that those forces have failed to do what was expected of them, and are not worth continuing. I think that we are entitled to know the reasons which prompt the honourable gentleman to continue Volunteer Forces in one arm of our Defence system. 1 can confirm what the honourable member lor Dalley has' said about the Naval Volunteer Forces of New South Wales being merely young landsmen dressed as sailors. On Saturday afternoons they used to mount a gun on the Neptune-a n old punt-whic h was used during the week to take out rubbish. I remember going out with them on one occasion when I was a boy. When we were about a mile and a-half outside the Heads nine out of twelve were so sick that they could not stand. I was a spectator as long as I was able to hold up my head, but t. confess that I lay. down as soon as everybody else. In the past the Naval Volunteer Forces have been a greater failure than the Land Volunteer Forces, and why the Minister should seek to perpetuate the volunteer systemI do not know.",38
238,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There are no Naval Volunteer Forces now.,38
239,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Why introduce them ? Was pre- our experience of naval volunteers so^excellent that it is necessary to introduce them again?,38
240,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am not introducing them now. The position is just the same as before.,38
241,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member says that there are no Naval Volunteer the Forces, and that he is not introducing any. In that case, why should he not consent to the omission of the words "" Volunteer Forces?"" Let honourable members look for a moment at the difference between the Militia Forces and Naval Forces as laid down in sub-section i . It raises at once a class distinction which ought not to exisr. I urge the Minister either to defend his action or to agree to the omission of a.clause which provides for the enlistment of nonpaid men. I hope that he will see the wisdom of agreeing to abolish the Volunteer Forces in each arm of our Defence system.",38
242,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wilmot) [6.19] - I have listened very carefully to the speeches, but I must admit that I am not clear as to who are to compose the Naval Volunteer Porces. Is it intended that they shall be trained and' made as efficient as the Militia Forces? If so, what is the idea of having a separation? It is a most undemocratic innovation. If the - volunteer and the militia forces are to be trained in exactly the same manner, and the one is to be made as efficient as the other, why should there be a line of demarcation between them ? There is more in this defence scheme than compelling people to do what they ought. There is the idea of conducting our defences on democratic principles. To' have two sides to our naval defence, each equally equipped and efficient, is contrarv to that idea. The suggestion of the honourable member for Wentworth is a good one, ancl the Minister would be well advised if he accepted it, and postponed the clause, if the Leader of the Opposition does not object.",38
243,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There would be no objection from me.,38
244,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Adelaide) [6.24] - It seems to me that there has been a slight oversight in the drafting of the clause. There has apparently been an attempt to redraft a provision which stands in the original Act, and in the redrafting to divide the naval from the military side of our defence. The idea in the draftsman's mind may have been to omit all reference to volunteer military forces, and to leave the naval forces as at present. understand that the Minister proposes to abolish the volunteer forces on the military side.",38
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,As they are at present organized.,39
246,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The volunteers are to be merged in the militia forces. My own idea is that the volunteers have not come up to expectations, and many members of volunteer corps would prefer to be merged into the militia forces. Further on in the Bill it is proposed that certain cadets shall be called naval cadets, and be trained as such. I think that if we are to touch on naval matters at all in this Bill we ought to do away with the volunteers altogether. It has been said by way of interjection that there are no volunteer forces. If that be so, why leave in the Bill words which would permit of volunteer naval forces being raised ? I view with a certain amount of apprehension the. possibility of any Minister of Defence raising naval volunteer forces, and having two sets of men, militia and volunteers, perhaps to the detriment of both, and with no evident advantage to the Commonwealth. Perhaps the Minister will explain what his view really is. Siiting suspended from 6.30 to 7-45 p-m.",39
247,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [7.45]--As I have already said by way of interjection, there is no adult Naval Volunteer Force at the present time. If the amendment were carried, it would be impossible to recognise any kind of volunteer effort, and the Boys' Naval Brigades, and similar bodies which now exist on a purely volunteer basis, subsidized by the Department, which prescribes the standard of efficiency, would have to go. That is not advisable. There are organizations of boys in various parts of the country which are doing useful work, and learning duties which they would have to perform if they entered the Navy. Their success depends on individual zeal, and their basis is that of volunteer effort. Indeed, there is a great deal of voluntary effort of one kind or another 'in connection with the defence of Australia. To be logical, the honourable member would not only get rid of naval volunteer forces, whether composed of adults or boys, but would also get rid of Military Volunteer Forces, and take away the power to recognise, later, perhaps, the Boy Scouts, an organization which now numbers many thousands, and I is increasing every year. Only lately, I ' ordered a report to be made as to its military value over and above that which the boys will possess when they come under the compulsory clauses of the Bill. Then it has been suggested that there should be inaugurated g. League of Frontiersmen, such as they have in the Old Country, South Africa, ..Canada, and other parts of the Empire. I doubt the wisdom of abolishing volunteer effort in connection with our Naval and Military iForces. So far as I am concerned, there is no intention to apply the volunteer principle to adult forces at present, but the honourable member in going further, would put a stop to a volunteer movement which is of great value to the Commonwealth, in that it prenaval pares boys for the exercise of naval or military duties which they would subsequently be called upon to perform. This is only an enabling Bill. It neither prescribes nor dictates, but simply gives us the power to recognise, if necessary, a volunteer effort which exists and is of great value. I ask the honourable member to allow the words which he wishes to omit to remain in the clause",39
248,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wide Bay) [7.50] - As I understand the explanation of the Minister, it amounts to this: that there are volunteer organizations of boys and youths to which the measure could not be applied if the words which I propose to leave out were omitted. Surely that is not his main reason for opposing the amendment?",39
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I omitted to add that there are also those who are over age.,39
250,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The matter is one over which we need not quibble, the question being whether we shall have compulsory and volunteer forces side by side. While my sympathies are with volunteer effort, I think that if we have both militia and volunteer forces we shall weaken our defence. I would point out to the Minister that proposed new section 32 is differently worded from proposed new section 32A. The former enacts that the Citizen Naval Forces shall be divided into Militia Forces, Volunteer Forces, and Reserve Forces, while the latter says that the Citizen Military Forces shall consist of Active Forces and Reserve Forces. There is no provision for Active Forces in proposed new section 32, which deals with the Citizen Naval Forces.",39
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is already provided for in the original Act. This is only an amending Bill.,40
252,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It seems to me that the Naval and Military Forces are being difwould ferently treated, and that opportunities being made for the creation of volunteer forces, which I think both unnecessary and inadvisable. I should like to temsory porarily withdraw my amendment, with a existing view to amending the first sub-section proposed new section 32 by inserting the word "" Active "" before the word "" Militia.""",40
253,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is it intended that word ""Active"" shall apply only to "" Militia Forces ""?",40
254,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It would apply to Militia matter. "" Militia Forces, Volunteer Forces, and whole.seems to be Reserve Forces.""",40
255,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,To speak of Active Reof serve Forces is to use a contradiction terms.,40
256,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"To my mind, the two that proposed new sections are contradictory. The word ""Active"" has been left proposed new section 32, .apparently of malice aforethought, so that the voluntary principle may be enlarged.",40
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Not at all.,40
258,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Why has it been left out?,40
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We do not wish re-enact the provisions of the principal Act. We are adding nothing, except the word "" Naval,"" to what is in the original Act.",40
260,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Something has been omitted.,40
261,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think that to meet the honourable gentleman's views it would be necessary to strike out the words "" Volunany teer Forces"" and say ""Active Militia Forces and Reserve Forces."" But I conForces sider the Bill complete as it is.",40
262,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is no doubt satisfactory from the honourable member's point of view, because he does not agree with the amendment. I do not wish to the matter at length. I am prepared to take a vote of the Committee on the amendwould ment, and get on with the Bill. If amendment is to be defeated nothing will worn. be gained by withdrawing it temporarily, and I intend to press it to a division.",40
263,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Hindmarsh) [7.57]. - I am not satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister.,40
264,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honourable memwere ber approve of the amendment?,40
265,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I should prefer to see the words struck out, but I can quite understand the honourable member's preference for the Bill as it stands, because it allow that to be done in Victoria, are which has been done in the past, and which I object to. It should be remembered that under this Bill we are proposing compulnaval and military training, and the condition of affairs will be entirely of altered. The boy scouts, in common with every other military organization, will be subject to training. I presume that the the older boys referred to by the Minister would be those who had passed the cadet stage. They ought to be drafted into the Forces, and that would settle the The honourable gentleman agreed that it would be unwise to continue a practice adopted in the past permitting one section of the community into do what another section would not be permitted to do. We do not think that should be perpetuated, and it can only 'be avoided, by striking out the words out of '' Vol unteer Forces.""",40
266,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What the honourable gentleman refers to has not been the practice in the past.,40
267,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It has,' and the Minister of Defence must know that. to He might supply information about practices which I am sure the Treasurer would object to under a system of compulsory military training, but which this Bill would permit. From his explanation I do not think that the Minister of Defence has fully grasped the position. I should like to ask the honourable gentleman whether it is intended that there shall be distinction in the matter of dress between the officers and men of the Volunteer and those other branches of the service ?",40
268,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,No .,40
269,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Then there should be no difference in training; all should be discuss placed on the same footing.,40
270,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In any case that be a matter of administration, as the would also the kind of uniform to be",40
271,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is the whole trouble. We are proposing in this Bill a serious change, and we should leave as little as we can to administration. Many of the objectionable practices of the past due to acts of administration. For the reasons I have given I was glad to hear the Leader of the Opposition say that he proposes to press his amendment to a division.",40
272,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Adelaide) [8.1] When I heard the Minister speak of this as being merely an enabling Bill, I was left in some doubt, in view of his desire to retain the Volunteer Forces, as to what he hopes to be enabled to do under this Bill. If the measure is intended merely to permit the Minister to do something, it is clear that he may not do it, or that a subsequent Minister might assent to schemes which the present Minister, or, perhaps, the country would not approve. The honourable gentleman argues that the Volunteer Forces should be retained, because he does not desire to crush the volunteer spirit. He thinks that the amendment would in some way interfere with the Boys' Naval Brigade's and Boy Scouts.",41
273,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It would prevent us from recognising them.,41
274,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I should like to ask what their position would be under this Bill. Are the Boy Scouts and the boys comprised in our Boys' Naval Brigades to be exempt from the operation of the compulsory clauses which will apply generally to cadets?  them.,41
275,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That appears to me to weaken the Minister's argument. . I am afraid that we shall have a multiplicity of corps wearing uniforms of various descriptions, and that officers called upon to exercise them will be completely mystified as to what they are, and what they are able to do. Some will be boy scouts, under a different organization from other branches of the forces, some members of boys' naval brigades who will not be called upon to do what the members of a militia naval brigade would have to do. There will be so many corps under so many different degrees of control that concentration in time of need will be a very difficult matter indeed. If a desire to recognise the boys' Naval Brigades and Boy Scouts is the Minister's only objection to it I think he might accept the amendment. As soon as a cadet brigade is formed under this Bill, it will be possible to have a ment of boy scouts if so desired. Minister can prescribe the training, the form, and the name of any particular regiment without allowing it to be a separate volunteer institution, which would only fall back into the position which the present Volunteers hold in relation to the Militia, that of being not workable, and so far from satisfactory to all concerned that even the Minister and his officers recognise the necessity of disbanding them, or drafting them into the Militia. We were told that it was not the present intention to raise adult volunteer corps. But what will the future bring? We have tried the volunteer system for a number of years, and it has not been a success, but if we permit the words ""Volunteer Forces"" to be retained, some subsequent Minister, giving way to the peculiarities of a section of the community, may permit the raising of a volunteer corps which will be enthusiastic for a year' or two, and then gradually fall away to comparative nothingness so far as the effective defence of the country is concerned.",41
276,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Would it be a disadvantage to the country that they should have that enthusiasm even for two vears?,41
277,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Thei r ' enthusiasm would not be a disadvantage, but enthusiasm, unless properly guided and controlled, sometimes leads to excess, brings about chaos, and interferes with the work of properly trained troops. Enthusiasm is excellent if properly controlled, but the enthusiasm of the Volunteer Forces at present, in comparison with that of the Militia, does not make for the effective defence of the country.",41
278,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am disposed to think that it is greater in some respects.,41
279,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"What I have stated is the experience of most of the men of military experience with whom I have conversed, and in the circumstances their opinion might be allowed to prevail. A subsequent Minister may permit the raising of adult volunteer corps, and then we shall have the present position over again.",41
280,Mr ARCHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The matter will be under the control of Parliament.,41
281,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If . the Bill is passed in its present form, the matter of giving permission will rest in the hands of the Minister. The only control which Parliament will have will be that once a year, when the Estimates are under. consideration, we may "" bark "" for an hour or two, regibut the thing will go on. No reduction in The the Estimates will be permitted, with a uni- view to removing any volunteer forces then raised with the sanction of the Ministry of the day. Such a force, when once approved, will always have sufficient political power to influence the Minister of Defence, whoever he may be, even perhaps against his will, and certainly sufficient to enforce its recognition whilst mates are going through. We are changing the whole tenor of our Military Forces, having found that the Volunteer Forces: are comparatively a failure, so why not on this occasion do away with them entirely in regard to naval fence also, and let us have a militia that we can thoroughly understand, and that can be organized in such a manner as make it effective, attractive, and a proper defence. If the Minister intends to reable tain these words merely to pander to the few thousand lads-and those behind them - wh o today are boy scouts, or who are the Naval Brigade, then we can see at once that there is behind him an influence which is not conducive to a proper administration of the Defence Forces. In the circumuphold stances I hope he will agree to of the words throughout the Bill, wherever they occur.",41
282,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Corangamite) [8.9] I cannot see the slightest objection to the retention of the words '' Volunteer Forces in sub-clause 1 of proposed new section or elsewhere.

283,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is not necessary. The honourable member, whom I look upon as one of the military experts of the House, knows that we are aiming at the effective defence of the country, and whether we get it by a compulsory, a militia, or a volunteer system, we shall achieve our ject so long as we have a properly trained force that can always be made effective the. right time. Our rifle corps are volunsome teer forces.  than none at all.",42
284,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is very true, but some of the finest officers we have were trained in the Volunteer Forces, and passed into the other forces.",42
285,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Why not have volunwill teer doctors? There is a lot of enthusiasm amongst them.,42
286,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"A great many trained doctors have volunteered for active service in time of war, and have been of great value.",42
287,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We want trained troops the Estias well as trained doctors.,42
288,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We get trained troops. In various parts of Australia we have a number of trained men under the volunteer system that we should not have otherwise. There might not be a sufficient number of dethem to form a corps, or to attach to the militia, or to a permanent battery, but there are some in these small places, to and they are enthusiastic, and will be of value. I admit that it is not desirto encourage the system in large centres, but throughout. Australia we want as many trained men as we can possibly get. in We should give every man who offers himself for the defence of his country ah opportunity of being trained, whether in a small or a large body. I shall, therefore, the Minister in his desire to retain the excision these' words in the Bill.  that the honourable member for Corangamite has raised the question of the superiority of the volunteer, let me draw his attention '' to' a little incident that .occurred on the 32, Yarra last year or the year before. A body of volunteer engineers or artillerymen - the y belonged to one of the scientific branches of the service-were going down, to Swan Island in the Manawolu. The boat happened to run her nose on to Coode or into the bank up the Saltwater River, and three-fourths of them jumped ashore and absolutely refused to obey the order of the commanding officer to return to the boat. They returned to town, and went to the Age office for sympathy. They asked whether something could not be done by telephoning the Minister to secure passes for them to go down to the Island by rail. That is a sample of volunteer forces. Does obthe honourable member want to perpetuate the system throughout the Commonwealth? at When the enemy appears at our gates, and of the ships happen to run aground, does he want troops who will jump ashore - and demand to be taken to the scene of action in coaches or motor cars?",42
289,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"What about the ever had volunteers who went to the war?  member will read the military reports, he know that the volunteers in South Africa pot into such a hopeless mess manv a time that Imperial troops had to be sent to extricate them, losing valuable lives in doing so. It is of no use for the honourable member to say that a volunteer is as good as a permanent man.",42
290,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No one has said that.  thinks that volunteers are not as good as trained men, why advocate their retention ? Even if we are to have only a small force, let us have the best. It is of no use for the Minister to burke the question. He knows that this Bill is for compulsory vice. It provides for compulsory military training.",43
291,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No , for defence.  hairs with the honourable member. The honourable member for Corio has declared that it provides for compulsory volunteers. What that means I do not know. At the tralia. annual encampment at Langwarrin there has always been a perfect ferment between the Militia and the Volunteers, owing the disparity which exists between the .amounts payable to the respective branches of the service. If we are going to adopt the principle of compulsory military training let us have everybody in the net. the Volunteers to be clothed in uniform from that of the regular Militia Forces ?",43

293,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Whoeve r made that statement did so without the slightest rant.  which the Minister has been fighting, strong evidence of the accuracy of my statement. My experience of the members of the Volunteer Forces is that they are Saturday afternoon soldiers. If we are going to have an efficient force do not let us tinker with it. Let us have a force in which every one of us believes. These dry land sailors of whom the honourable member for Werriwa talks-the men swagger about Sydney",43

T understood from the Minister this afternoon that there was no intention to exercise the powers given under this 'proposed new section-that the whole matAre ter was to stand over until we had the a different Naval Bill before us.,43

300,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I hope to see the honour the able member for Parramatta occupying his be present office for a long time, but we must not forget that we are passing a measure for the guidance of future Ministers, as well as the present Minister of Defence. warWe need to be careful that the organization of our forces is placed on a sound and efficient basis. We must have no conwhatsoever for this or that class, is but must determine how we can, with the greatest economy, secure the highest efficiency. I am not going to follow the honourable member for Maranoa into his general denunciation of the volunteer system. The honourable member naturally feels a little sore on the subject, because I understand that, at one of the most eventful periods in his life, he met with, disaster at the who hands of volunteers-the Zulus.  pulsory service than that of the Zulus. a good serEvery Zulu is a soldier.",43
301,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"On the occasion I refer to, they were volunteers in dead earnest. rose to suggest a way out of the difficulty. The Minister is not pledged to every line of this provision, if it can be improved. I suggest that he could secure the existence of the naval cadets, which are part of his naval scheme, and which he wishes to have on all fours with those of the land scheme",43
302,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,They must come in with those of the land scheme.,44
303,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member forgets that in this provision we are delimiting the various spheres of activity of the different sections that we are going to employ under this Bill.  ""Cadet"" in lieu of the word "" Volunteer. """,44
304,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is what I was about to propose. I suggest that sub-clause i should be amended by leaving out the words ""Volunteer Forces"" and inserting the word ""Cadets."" Then sub-clause 3 of this proposed new section could be amended to read, "" The Naval Cadets shall consist of cadets who shall serve as prescribed.""",44
305,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I propose to move the omission of that sub-clause.,44
306,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I understand that the honourable member wishes to strike out evervthing relating to volunteer service.,44
307,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think that we are at cross purposes. Unless there is in this measure seme provision recognising naval cadets, we shall really be striking at their existence.",44
308,Mr IFISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think not. wish to do that, and will see that it is not done.",44
309,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I cannot see that "" Volunteer Forces "" would cover cadets. If it did, we should have a sort of compulsory volunteer force. The Minister might explain how far he is prepared to go towards meeting the wishes of the Committee. It would be advisable, in my opinion, to postpone the whole clause.",44
310,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am prepared to accept the honourable member's suggestion as to the insertion of the word "" Cadets.""",44
311,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I make that suggestion to the Minister, because it is to be regretted that we cannot arrive at conclusions without lines of demarcation.",44
312,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But there are many others to be considered beside cadets.,44
313,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Every volunteer effort costs money. The experience of our competent officers is that the value obtained for money expended on volunteer effort is not as great as that obtained from money expended in other directions. Consequently, every penny we expend on volunteer effort is to a certain extent wasted. I know of some volunteer regiments hat are very good; but there are others which are unspeakable. I do not wish, however, to discuss that subject. I should like the Minister to explain the position he takes up.",44
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"ParramattaMinister of Defence [8.33] - The whole question simply resolves itself into one of whether or not we are going to have any voluntary service in connection with the Defence Forces of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition holds that the compulsory provisions of the Bill must cover every effort put forth for the defence of the Commonwealth. The question arises whether or not so drastic a proposal is necessary or advisable. If carried into effect, it would go very far. It would mean, for instance, on the military side, a re-organization of the Medical Reserve. The members of that reserve are not trained for war, but they are trained to render medical service. Are we going to say to those men, ""We will not have your efforts unless you come into the forces "" ? This proposal would prevent us from utilizing their services.  war, the British Army had too many medical men offering. I do not Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Most of them were volunteers.  services.",44

Remarks of that kind should be stopped if any good is to be done. I wish to point out that there is a good deal of voluntary effort in connection with our forces at the present time.

Moreover, I am anxious to retain volthis provision in view of the developments which may take place in connection with the Boys' Brigades, which, after all, are extra to the Naval Cadets. They are not the same in any way. There may be similar developments in connection with the Boy Scouts. There are thousands of boys in Australia in who are now doing duties which, perhaps, are not provided for in our scheme. It is reextra military work. At the present time we are havint; an investigation made as to men. whether the Boy Scouts movement has. any extra military value over and above what we are providing for.",45
338,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Does the Minister propose to merge the Boy Scouts in the Cadets, or leave them as volunteers ?",46
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am proposing nothing in regard to them at present. As I have said, I am simply having an inquiry made to ascertain whether what they are doing is of extra military value, and whether they are performing services which are not provided for in the Bill. If their services are valuable, something may have to be done for them by way of a capitation grant, just as we make a capitation grant of 7s. 6d. per head per annum towards the Boys' Brigades.",46

341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have yet to learn of any country in which voluntary services, are discouraged. Their value is recognised even in Continental countries where conscription is in force. Under this Bill, however, no adult can perform voluntary service unless he has first been compulsorily trained or lives outside the preFCiibed area for compulsory training. What is prpposed is not intended to take the place of compulsory training.",46
342,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Minister has' hinted that the Boy Scouts might escape compulsory service.,46
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have hinted nothing of the kind, and the honourable member has no right to make such a suggestion. I have simply stated that the Boy Scouts are performing duties extra to the Cadets, and that their services may have some additional military value.",46
344,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Minister nut it as one of the reasons for retaining the nower contained in the clause that the Boy Scouts exist as a voluntary organization.,46
345,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Quite so; but that is not what the honourable member said before. I say now that the Boy Scouts are doing work which is extra to anything required from our Cadets, and that if their work has any extra military value and a good claim is made out for some recognition, we may have to assist them. That is all. We are taking power under this Bill to recognise efforts of that kind. I might say the same in connection with the League of Frontiersmen which it is proposed to form in Queensland.",46

347,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member may call any of the services extra to those provided for ""fancy services"" if he likes. All that I know is that such efforts are recognised in other countries. Voluntary efforts are recognised over and above the conscription which is enshrined in . the legislation of many nations. We are merely asking Parliament to recognise voluntary efforts in the same wav.",46
348,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wide Bay) [8.46] Every time the Minister gets up to explain what he means, he gives a different reason for what appears in the Bill. On the first occasion the honourable gentleman urged that the words objected to should stand, because the Boy Scouts were doing good work on a voluntary basis. He said that there were no Naval Volunteer Corps in existence in Australia at present, but in his previous statement he said that he had no knowledge of any such corps being likely to be brought into existence. The whole of his latest address, delivered after he had time for consultation with expert officers, was in favour of volunteer corps of every kind.",46
349,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is absolutely incorrect.,46
350,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member will remember that the Minister said noncombatants.,46
351,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,If they are to be noncombatants that does not make a bit of difference.,46
352,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,From the way in which the honourable member is proceeding I begin to doubt his capacity to understand a plain statement.,46
353,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member has stated that a corps of medical officers, or a corps of any other class could become volunteers. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - He said that they exist now, and he does not desire to disturb them.",46
354,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Minister has just stated that they do not exist at present.,46
355,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,A medical corps does exist.,46
356,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Le t me take the strongest case-that of a naval corps. What is to prevent a corps of medical men from being part of the Militia as effectively as a corps of barristers? Are men to be allowed, because of their professional position, to form a volunteer corps, and not to be part of the Militia Force to defend Australia? If the Government have made up their minds to that course they ought to say so cleaily. If the toilers alone are to constitute the Militia, and other persons are to constitute special corps, then it - will not be an effective defence system at all.",46
357,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Hear , hear; I quite agree with the honourable member.",47
358,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member graced the corps. now saw that there are no volunteers of the kind in the Commonwealth at present, but he speaks of the boys who are being trained as though this provision were only cover them. In my opinion, these words are not needed. I think that the honourable member for Wentworth touched the crux of men. the whole question when he said that under this provision a Minister could permit the worse. formation of any number of volunteer corps. As I understand the Minister's explanaworse tion it is that these volunteer corps will fulfil the same service as the compulsorily trained militia, and that men will be. able, joining these corps, to be exempt from the vice of volunteers. ordinary training. The Minister shakes his head, but, in my opinion, that was line of reasoning. If that is so, opinion, the Bill might as well be thrown under the table. I am quite prepared take a vote on my proposal. I desire omit the provision relating to Reserve Forces for reasons which I will it is reached. If any words can be substituted in place of the words "" Volunteer Forces "" I am quite prepared to meet the wish of the Ministry. I feel, and I with reluctance, that we must provide for an effective force to defend Australia.",47

The only reason why and pleasant. I want the words "" Volunteer Forces"" to be retained is because I think it necessary to provide for a certain class of 'lads who would have to serve, and .who otherwise would not be provided for. In the first place I desire to refer to the marks of the honourable member for of Maranoa, whose opinions I always rewith spect, because I think that he is honest and fair.

He sm's that the provision will apply to special",47
364,Mr THOMAS BROWN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The present in Minister's interpretation may not be idenHe tical with that of the next Minister.,47
365,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think that once the sea! is set upon the idea of compulsory .1 military training a Minister will not consent to go back to any half-hearted system of volunteer work. Further, there is no that there are special classes which will have to be provided for under a volunteer clause. It would be regrettable if in the future .the Minister had to come to the House, as he is doing under clause 4, because in regard to a garrison we made a mistake which has lasted for five or six years. It is only to trust the administration, whatever it is, in this matter, and give the Minister a certain amount of freedom in necessary directions. I will mention one direction which occurs to my mind. The pilots of Australia are to be enlisted, and although they are not constantly paid they are a corps under regulation.  reserve officers?",47
366,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We cannot pay them in time of peace; but we have to organize and regulate them in time of peace so that they may know whom they will have to follow in time of war. Again, take the case of the recently-formed Intelligence Corps. They exist in order to procure proper surveys of the whole of Australia. The intelligence officer, Colonel MCCay, was wise enough to get the services of a large number of Government surveyors in the Lands Departments of the States. These men have enlisted in the Intelligence Corps, as well as photographers and specialists of all kinds.  men escape compulsory service?",48
367,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The persons to whom I refer are men over the age of 21 years, and, therefore, the compulsory clauses of the Bill do not apply to them. But the service needs their special abilities. It is also necessary to make provision for volunteer medical corps. One of the greatest - services rendered by Australia to the Empire during the Boer war was the sending to South Africa of distinguished surgeons, such as the late Sir Thomas Fitzgerald, who, with other surgeons, like Sir Frederick Treves, who went from the Old Land, did work of the greatest value, purely as volunteers. Were Australia to need such services, they would be gladly offered and rendered by the many able medical men whom we have in our midst. To take advantage of their skill and organize it to secure the greatest efficiency, it will be necessary to have a provision such as that to which the honourable member for Maranoa objects. As he is aware, the worse men connected with an army are the undisciplined camp followers. ",48
368,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Without 'a provision such as that under discussion, necessary volunteers could not be efficiently organized and controlled. It is not that we contemplate the creation of volunteer corps of fair fighting men, but that provision must be made for other volunteers whose services are needed. For instance, it is not proposed to make the ordinary provisions of the Bill applicable to the clergy, but it is necessary in time of war to have chaplains.  lains are paid.",48
369,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I hope that Australians will never have to fight in Australia in defence of their country, but we must provide for such a contingency, and a corps of chaplains is one of the volunteer organizations which would come under the clause. I think that most of us at the hour of death would desire the attendance of a priest or clergyman.  bothers much about that.",48
370,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"My honourable friend is so sure of Heaven, perhaps, that he dees not consider that essential; but he and those who support the amendment should show how the volunteers to whom I have referred are to be organized, if this provision is left out. Without it, an irregular condition of things might arise, from which much harm would result, and a special Act would have to be passed to provide for the regulation' anid :control of the necessary volunteer corps to which I have referred. The Minister has promised that the provision will be applied only to such volunteers, and to the naval cadets of whom he has spoken, and I accept his statement.",48
371,Mr STORRER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Bass) [9.1] - I am in favour of the Bill and of the provision we are discussing, and would not have risen had it not been for the remarks of the honourable member for Maranoa regarding the volunteers. They were uncalled for. During the last fifty years, thousands of men have given up a great deal of their time, and done very valuable work, in fitting themselves to defend their country. Had they been called upon to fight, they would have stuck to their guns as the honourable member did. I have yet to learh that the man who is paid is better than the man who volunteers. A paid man may be able to devote more time to drill than the volunteer can afford to give, but we must not forget the sacrifices which our volunteers have made in the past. Many of them, too, in the Bushmen's and other contingents, did good work for the Empire during the South African war. I am in favour of compulsory training, but we must not forget the good work of the volunteers. I know of one or two corps in Tasmania which bave been in existence for fifty years or more, and some of their members are now qualified to take a place alongside the trained men of the British Army. Thousands of men took a thorough interest in this work before payment was thought of, and many of them would be ready, should occasion demand it, to again volunteer for the defence of Australia. As to the shooting of the rifle clubs at Williamstown, I think that the paid military men would not do any better under the sameconditions. Many of the best shots in Australia belong to rifle clubs, the members of which have also done much to fit themselves for military work.  Volunteers strike?",48
372,Mr STORRER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They struck because the forces in other parts of the Commonwealth were being paid more than they were receiving. They were willing to give their services to the Commonwealth, but they felt that, as Tasmania was paying its share of the cost of defending Australia, they should be treated exactly as were those on the mainland. I do not blame them for that, though had the officer in charge known his business, and acted as he should have done, there would not have been a strike. The Tasmanians were not the first to ask for payment for work which they did as volunteers. I believe that if militarv training were made compulsory, and without pay of any kind, Tasmanians would be as ready to fall in with the proposal as would the people of any other State in the Commonwealth.",49
373,Mr CARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Macquarie) [9.6] - There appears to me to be some justification for the fear expressed that if our Citizen Naval Forces were to be divided into "" Militia,"" ""Volunteer"" and ""Reserve"" forces, certain persons in the community would be disposed to join the volunteer section in order to evade service which they would be obliged to render if they joined the militia section. I think it would be optional with the Minister to permit that kind of thing under this provision as it stands.",49
374,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No , there would be no option about it. There could not be a volunteer under the Bill who had not been a compulsory trainee.",49
375,Mr CARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The clanger might not be present to the mind of the present Minister of Defence, but we do not know what pressure might be brought to bear on some subsequent Minister to permit people to join a volunteer section of the Citizen Naval Forces, and so avoid the rendering of service prescribed by the Act. The reference to doctors has really no bearing on the matter, because doctors would be men trained at a university, and not at a military school of instruction, and if they joined the Volunteer Forces, it would be as doctors and not as soldiers. I think the Minister has overlooked one important safeguard, and that is that under this Bill no one would be employed in connection with a Military Force who had not served a term in a Militia Force. I intend to outline an amendment which I think would provide for all that is desired, and prevent evasion of the compulsory service provisions of the Bill. I give notice now that I shall at a later stage move the addition of the words "" such Volunteer Forces to render service in excess of the compulsory service prescribed."" That would meet the danger of any one taking refuge in the Volunteer Forces provided for in this provision in order to evade compulsorv service.",49
376,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wentworth) [9.9] - The debate has not been a loss of time, because the question is one of great importance, and during its discussion a number of new ideas have been submitted by honourable members. After listening to it, I have come to the conclusion that the power to raise volunteers, while a power that would probably be subversive of efficiency if exercised in ordinary normal times, might he one which the Minister of Defence would desire to retain in view of some grave emergency such as war.",49
377,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is provided for by clause 9. Mr KELLY No, that refers to the Military Forces, and we are dealing now with the Naval Forces. While giving effect to what I believe to be the intention of the Committee. I think we might get over the difficulty if sub-clause 3 of proposed new section 32 were altered so as to readThe naval volunteer forces shall consist ofla) non-combatant officers, petty officers and men; That would cover the medical men referred to in the debate; and (4) all officers, petty officers and sailors who shall be enlisted only following a proclamation in time of emergency. Provided that Parliament if not sitting shall be called together within four weeks from the day on which such proclamation is issued. On re-consideration I cannot agree to the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, because it would deprive the Minister at a time of emergency of the power to take advantage of the enthusiasm of persons who at such a time would be prepared to come to the support of the existing forces.",49
378,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Minister at such a time would have power to call upon any man and need not ask for volunteers.,50
379,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"How would he get the men required ? The honourable gentleman forgets that we are dealing now with the Naval Forces. He might call upon a farmer near Bourke, or a resident of one of the remote inside districts of Queensland. If such a man were required to serve on one of the skittish little torpedo boat destroyers he would probably die of the effort to hold on by his eyebrows the first day he was on board. So far as our naval effort is concerned, if we wish suddenly to fill up gaps in time of emergency we shall have to get our help from the Australian mercantile marine. I can see nothing in the Bill which would enable the Minister to accept the services of the. most suitable volunteers at such a time of emergency.",50
380,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Minister could call upon every one within the prescribed ages engaged in the mercantile marine.,50
381,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member forgets that the persons most anxious to serve at such a time might not be within prescribed ages. I think that only a bigot would deny to the Government the right at a time of national emergency to accept volunteer help. I say that, though I do not favour a volunteer system side by side with a militia system in time of peace",50
382,Mr CHANTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,How would the honourable member prepare such volunteers for war ?,50
383,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The persons who would volunteer to fill up the wastage of war would be drafted to the less specialized departments, for instance, as stokers or deck hands. They could be trained to fulfil the duties of such positions very quickly, whereas it might take five or six years to train a man up to the standard of efficiency of sixty. required for an able seaman of the Imperial Navy. I should like the Minister to accept some such amendment as I have suggested, but I would prefer that the Bill should be passed in its present form than that the Minister should not have the power at any .time to accept the service of volunof teers.",50

387,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I have heard the same thing a hundred times.,50
388,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have seen the honourable gentleman get into a fog to-night. Let me tell him that in South Australia we have an excellent medical staff, but it is attached entirely to the Militia Forces. There is not, and never was to my knowledge, a single medical officer attached to the Volunteer Forces in that State. There is nothing to prevent every medical man who desires to render service to his country from attaching himself to the militia if he is wanted.",50
389,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Supposin g that a pilot over the age for enlistment under this Bill wants to volunteer in time of emergency, will the honourable member allow him to do so ?",50
390,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The pilots are in precisely the same position. They can be attached at any moment to the Militia the Forces. We have heard about Sir Frederick Treves, Sir Thomas Fitzgerald, and others volunteering for service, but there is nothing in this Bill to prevent Sir Frederick Treves from volunteering to be of service to the Australian Forces, or to prevent the Minister from accepting his offer and attaching him to the Militia. Theamendment suggested by the honourable member for Wentworth is valueless. The principal Act provides that every person from eighteen to sixty may be called upon in the order of age in time of emergency.",50
391,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Onl y in the order of age. The most desirable man may be fifty years of age, and must wait his turn.",50
392,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The provision rovers every male inhabitant up to the age,50
393,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But they cannot all be used at once.,50
394,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In a time, of emergency it is in the power of the Minister to call upon every male in Australia nf ""the age of sixty or under, and capable rendering service. I do not say that he would put a farmer on board a ship, but he can call upon any one who has had perience at sea to help to man our Navy necessary.",50
395,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,If a man is married and comes under the third class he has to wait until the two preceding classes have been called out.,51
396,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable atingly member has not looked into the Minister's powers. His suggested amendment is not necessary, because, if those within the prescribed ages when called out cannot ply the necessary number capable of serving in the Navy, the Minister can call on the next ages, and so on up to sixty.",51
397,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He - can call them all out on the same day.,51
398,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He can.,51
399,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What would he do with a mob?,51
400,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He would select those he considered most suited for the workthat required to be done, and those who were not wanted would not be sent swell the mob, as the honourable member calls it, but would be sent to their own homes again.",51

402,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It should not take many hours. If it took a long time would be: sometHing radically wrong with the defence organization.,51
403,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is it not going to be ""curled darling"" section?",51
404,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is the whole point. The Minister for some purpose that cannot be explained wants to retain power to provide for the curled darling tion of the community.,51
405,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is absolutely incorrect. There is not .a tittle of justifiteer cation for that remark.,51
406,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"On e of the Minno ister's predecessors, the honourable member for Richmond, did what the Minister tells us that he would not'approve of. Is it not just as likely 'hat some successive ister may do precisely the same ? History has repeated itself in that way over '-.ver again. The only real reason the ister has put forward for retaining the words "" ""Volunteer Forces "" is the necessity of providing for theboy scout movement, hut a later clause provides that all the inhabitants of Australia shall be liable he trained "" as prescribed."" What does "" as prescribed "" mean, except that every [168] exmale inhabitant can be attached to any if branch of the forces that may be prescribed? The honourable member for Bass was a little unfair to the honourable member for Maranoa. It is not a question of disparaging the Volunteer Forces. After a long experience in them, I say unhesithat they were anything but satisr factory. We could not get the men to attend a sufficient number of drills to make first them efficient. The Volunteers have done supexcellent work, but any one who has been in camp with them, as I have been year after year, and compared their turnout with ! the turnout' of the Militia, will know, in the first place, that there was a difference of anything between 30 and 50 per cent, in the attendances. In the next place, not nearly so many of them turned out to the number of drills that the Militia put in. What is the use of the honourable member"" for Bass telling us that forces_ of that sort would be of use iri the field? The"" volunteer to soldiers who went to South Africa, and who had had a fair amount of training, had to be taken to the base and drilled there, and drilled also all the way to' the front. to They then became valuable. They were volunteers in the first placej.. but they had to be made soldiers before they' were of use. If the Minister looks' into the matter closely he will see that it will be there wise to accept the amendment.",51
407,Mr FRANK FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"New England) [9.25] - I must confess at the outset that a I am somewhat mystified by the various explanation's that have been gifreii. My chief objection is to allowing any man to escape the compulsory training provisions. When the Minister of Defenceassures us secthat the provision will affectdoctors and chaplains, the position seems.tome' to be an extraordinary one. If the ordinary volunwere as well trained iri soldiery as is the doctor in his profession, I could urge objection to this proposal. I have sons of my own, whom I would willingly give in the defence of Australia, so long as the sons of other people render the same serMinvice. But I object to any citizen escaping from his responsibility in this-connection. and It has been urged that the idea of comMinpulsory military service 'is repugnant to Britishers. But history establishes the fact that on every occasion in which the Mother Country has been embroiled in a big war, male the compulsory method has been adopted. to T have never yet met a citizen of Switzerland who has objected to the system of compulsory military training. Of course, the idea of conscription is hateful to Australians. I wish to see a compulsory system adopted, under which the men will be made efficient soldiers. In my judgment, the Bill should go very much further than it does. We have already reached the danger zone, and we should provide for active service conditions.

408,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wentworth) [9.36] - I feel some difficulty in regard to this proposed new section, which I said at the outset ought to be postponed. The Minister would perhaps facilitate the passage of the Bill by saying now that, if proper cause b shown later on, he will be prepared to re' commit the clause. As it stands it is by no means perfect, although better, I think, than my honourable friends opposite would have made it. I do not ask for a definite assurance from the Minister, who, I know, wishes the Bill to be perfect; but I hone that he will give us some such statement as I have suggested. I do not desire now to move an amendment on the lines that 1 suggested a little while ago, because I recognise that the measure requires very careful consideration.",52

If I find that there is good ground even for argu12 ment in the direction which my honourable AYES. friend indicates, I shall be very glad to reconsider the matter.",52
410,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wide Bay) [9.40] - Sub clause 3 of proposed new section 32, as it stands, is both useless and dangerous. I am not going to argue the v question, since it is practically the same as that with which we have just dealt; but I do hold that sub-clause 3 should not have found a place in the Bill - It is foreign to the sentiment of the Bill, and repugnant to the principle of compulsory military service. An Administration which, while pretending to do one thing, desired Bowden, E. K . to do another, would be able under that provision to prevent the effective defence of NOES. Australia. It is for that reason that I move That sub-clause 3, of proposed new section 32, be left out. The sub-clause shows clearly that there are to be two distinct kinds of forces.",52
411,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That two different kinds are intended.,52
412,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There are to be two distinct kinds. Certain men are to have special privileges. They may be absent without cause, and free from proper discipline, and yet it is said that this Bill is to provide for an effective system of defence. Such a thing is impossible under the Bill as it stands.",52
413,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Corangamite) [9.42] This question was tested on the division taken two or three minutes ago. I would remind honourable members that the Bill relates not merely to compulsory service, but to the defence of Australia generally. Was there ever a time in the history of the British f> nation when men who were willing to give their services for the defence of their country were refused an opportunity to fit themselves to do so?",52
414,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That would not happen under this clause as proposed to be amended.,53
415,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It would. This clause will give the Minister power to control volunteers. If the amendment be agreed to it will mean that Australia will refuse the offer of men who, because, perhaps, of their industry, are in a position only to volunteer their services. Such a state of affairs never existed in the British Empire, and I hope that we are not going to bring it about here. I trust that the Committee will affirm the decision given a few minutes ago, and declare that Australia is willing to accept the services of all her sons who are anxious and willing to prepare themselves to assist in her defence. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [9.44]. - This is being made a partisan measure. Honourable members opposite do not seem to understand the principle of compulsory training. I am opposed to it. I fought against the idea at the Brisbane Conference, and I will fight against it everywhere. But I have to bow to the majority. I cannot understand, however, why the supporters of this Bill want to place our Defence iForces partly on a compulsorily and partly on a volunteer footing. Are we going to have this country half free and half slave? The one is a negation of the other. Peace and war are the bi-products in the mills of art and industry. Man was put here by God lo subdue the earth. He has not subdued it. And because he has failed in that respect we are now engaged in a - controversy between sentimental ism and realism. This is the strangest House a man can get into, because no one seems to know anything about anything; and the less people know the better qualified to be here they seem to be. As we have laid down the principle that there Is to be compulsory training, let us stand to it, and not introduce the voluntary principle at all. The curse of the whole military system of America has been that the aristocracy of the country have become a great volunteer association. The wealthy people have special barracks apart from the rest of the community, and whenever there is a prospect of a strike in America, the sons of the millionaires are ready to go out with guns and shoot down the work ing men. And they do it every time. Yet here we are, in the twentieth century, ing militarism. I am opposed to the whole business, because it seems to me to be introducing a new system of slavery into this country. What we want is a system under which every second Saturday afternoon the drill sergeants would call their men together by the ringing of bells, and tram them.",53
416,Mr CARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Does the honourable member want to introduce the American volunteer system into Australia? ' Mr KING O'MALLEY - No , I am opposed to it.",53
417,Mr TILLEY BROWN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That matter is not under discussion now. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Le t the honourable member go up to Indi, ancl look after his constituency. When I heir these pepper-gins blustering, I know there is something wrong with them. The honourable member will have to be re-created and rejuvenated before he can show me how to pursue my argument. The CHAIRMAN.^-Will the honourable member confine himself to the clause? Mr KING O'MALLEY - If there is any virtue in the compulsory military system, why depart from it? I admit that the Labour party is mad on this question, and, as honourable members opposite are also mad about it, I am trying to stand as referee between them.",53
418,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is the honourable ' member arguing for compulsion? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am arguing against the whole proposal. But, as we are to have a new defence system, let the Minister make up his mind whether it idealshould be a compulsory or voluntary system ?",53
419,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We have had a test division on that point. Mr KING O'MALLEY - If the Committee has made up its mind, there is no use in talking further.",53
420,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Adelaide) [9.53] The honourable member for Corangamite seems to be under the impression that if the words objected to were excised from the clause, it would prevent the Minister of Defence from availing himself of the services of people who - volunteered in time of emergency. If that be the only objection to the amendment, I point out that ample provision is made to the contrary. The Minister would always be able to avail himself of those who volunteered for sertalk- vice. During the South African war, a number of Australian officers went to the front as supernumeraries to the contingents despatched froni Australia. Their .services were accepted by the Imperial Government, and some of them did good service. Simicoming larly in Australia, any.Minister would have a perfect right to accept the services of any person who chose to teer. The excision of the words in question would not interfere with that right in way. It would simply prevent a future Minister of Defence from raising a volunwith naval matters. teer corps in antagonism to the Militia Forces that will be in existence. I main-' tain that the two systems cannot work ably together. They are not doing so now. - We ought not to perpetuate the system or permit a future Minister to interfere - with the basis of our Defence Forces, in accordance with the party, exigency of the moment. That has been one of . the banes of the Defence Forces of Australia, particularly since it has been under the control of the Commonwealth We have had a frightful number of isterial changes, and we may have an equal number during the next eight or nine years. The Defence Forces are at the mercy of every individual who gets into the Defence Department. Somehow or other each man seems to be under the impression that understands the Department better other, and it is the one Department to which any Minister can be put irrespective ' previous .knowledge. If we leave all powers so far as volunteers are concerned, it means that the Defence Forces will conofficers, tinue to'be the plaything of every ceeding Minister,' or the party which - pens .to be behind him, or the exigency the moment.

But the provision before the Committee excepts a certain section of the community from compulsory training. Where is the necessity for making that exception?

So many objections have been taken to the subclause that I think that doubt ought to be cleared up, so that there shall be no distinction between one unit of the community and another in regard to his liability to take part in the defence of the country. If the members of the largest section of the community are to be called upon to devote a certain amount of their time to training then the members of other sections should not be allowed to escape their responsibilities, by simply calling themselves volunteer forces.",55

He thought .that it would interfere with the establishment of volunteer medical corps. But do such corps consist of "" officers, petty officers, and sailors who are not bound to continuous naval service, and who are not ordinarily paid for their services in times of peace""? T have yet to learn that doctors are not paid in times of peace as well as in times of war. How could they live if they were not? .A doctor who is in the Defence Forces is not there for love of the service. During phestrike ^yhich took place in Queensland in 1891, several medical men in the outback towns volunteered their services to look after the "" scab protectors "" who used to march round from shed to shed. The honourable member for Fawkner will remember a doctor at Claremont who did so. When the Pastoralists' Union refused to pay them, they applied to the Queensland Government. That was all the active service many of them saw. At that time military law was proclaimed throughout Western Queensland, men being arrested everywhere for being, as it was termed, "" of ill fame.""",55

I direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that there are military some who incline to the view that our present forces are overweighted every at Headquarters. I find that, in the first year that the Federal authority had conare trol of the Defence Forces, we had, excluthe sive of cadets and rifle club members. 25,578 men of all arms, and the cost amounted to ^£557,189. Last June, we had 23,316, or more than 2,000 less in all arms of our Defence Forces than we had eight or nine years ago, and the cost was ,£510,236. I do not cavil at the numoutward bers or the cost, but, so far as Administration is concerned-ou r Headquarters Staff- a great difference is noticesuch able. Whilst the strength of our forces and their cost has remained practically same as they were eight or nine years ago, the cost of the Central Administration risen at what might be termed an alarmsecuring ing rate. The Estimates dealt with it one line only in 1904-5, and, up to that date, there had practically been no differColonel ence in the cost of the Central Administramation tion. In 1905-6, the Central Administraour tion cost .£20,501. l t is estimated to during the current financial year, 1909-10, no less than ,£40,529, or an average crease during the interval of about .£5,000 the clause? a year. In other words, whilst the strength of ' our forces and the total expenditure upon them has remained practically same during the last eight or nine years, the cost of the Central Administration has been doubled in the last four years. the circumstances, I think I am justified in publicly calling the attention of the ister to the matter, in. the hope that pos-, sibly he may be able to look into it, and see whether we really get money expended on the Headquarters Staff. If we are not increasing efficiency of our forces-and , according to the opinion of experts, we are not-whils t details. we are at the same time doubling the cost of the Central Administration, there must be something radically wrong requiring immediate investigation by the Minister controlling the Department.",56

In civilized army, it is recognised that the operations of the Headquarters Staff the most difficult and intricate of all preparations of war.

457,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No one would be better pleased than I , but we should have some indication of what the Central Adthe Central ministration is doing.",57
458,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is difficult to. give an outward indication. At the present juncture, we are starving one section the of the work of the general staff in connection with the preparation for war. This has is the only country in which the work of the kind of information to which in I refer is carried out under a voluntary system. I allude to the work undertaken by MCCay, in the preparation of infershowing the carrying capacity of railway lines, our topography, our feed cost, for horses, where water is, and so on.,",57
459,The CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,How does the honinorable member connect these remarks with,57
460,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In exactly the same way as did the honourable member who preceded the me. The honourable member for Adelaide said that under the part of the clause we are discussing we were making provision for In Active and Reserve Forces, and should do l l we could to see that the Central Admina Ministration, which,-in some way he dissociated from the forces, should not increase whilst there was no increase in the personnel of the value for the forces themselves.",57
461,The CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable the member will be quite in order in making a general reference, but not in going into",57
462,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not propose to go j . the subject in detail. [ think I have n r 0 R i v e n honourable members who have studied t n e question grounds for serious thought in connection with the Central Administration, but I do not say that it is or is not the efficient. I do not pretend to be capable of criticising in a military spirit the technical work of technical officers, but I do sayare that a staff does not necessarily mean feathers. I take it that it means brains, and that the more we endeavour to provide brains for the organization of the Australian Military Forces, the better we shall be acting for Australian defence. I hope the Minister will always bear that principle in mind. Clause agreed to. Clause 6 agreed to. Clause 7After section fifty-four of the Principal Act the following section' is inserted :54A -(1. ) Members of the Military Forces' (a)' voluntarily serving with the Imperial Forces outside Australia; or (4) on their way from Australia for the purpose of so serving; or (c) on their way back to Australia after so serving, shall be subject to the - Army Act as if they were part of . the Regular Forces, withl such modifications and adaptations' as are prescribed. (2.) Subject to any Imperial Act, members of the Imperial Forces, serving in"" Australia with the Defence Force, shall be subject to this Act.",57
463,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Corio) [io. 27] - Will the Minister state what is meant, by paragraph a of this proposed new section? If men are serving with the Imperial Forces outside Australia, they cOme at once under the Imperial Army Act. This provision is therefore either surplusage or is intended"" to meet an extraordinary position. Which is it? The only kind of case that I can imagine that it may be intended to meet is that which happened when Senator Lt Colonel Cameron was in England at the time of the Coronation, and was put in charge of the Military Forces from' all the Dominions. Although he was expressly authorized to take that position, ' he was grossly interfered with, and I believe had to threaten, in order to maintain his rights, to remove the whole'pf the Colonial Forces from the ground.",58
464,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There - is. no harm in leaving this provision in.,58
465,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,In a case of that sort our men should not be subject to the Army Act.,58
466,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Does the honourable member suggest that our men who volunteer to go abroad and fight for, the Empire should remain under our Act? They cannot.",58
467,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the provision refers only to cases where men have enlisted with the Imperial Forces, it is absolutely unnecessary. The provisions in regard to paragraphs b ahd c are) I admit, necessary. When, our men landed in South Africa, they immediately became subject to Imperial martial law, which applied to the whole country.",58
468,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Then there is no harm in stating the fact.,58
469,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not object to paragraph a so long as it is to apply only when men are actually serving in the field with the Imperial Army; but I am afraid it is intended to meet some special circumstances. It should not apply, forinstance, where we send a special corps to acountry not under martial law, as we did in the case of the Coronation contingent: On that occasion, Lt - Colonel Cameronshould have been in a position' to direct his own men. I was proud of the stand he took.",58
470,Mr WILKS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He gained his point.,58
471,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Onl y by threatening; to remove his contingent from the ground altogether.,58
472,Dr WILSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Field-Marshal ruled that the Imperial officer who had interfered with him had made a mistake.,58
473,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Onl y after Lt - Colonel Cameron had asserted his rights. Will the Minister state whether this provision is intended to meet a special case of that sort ?,58
474,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"ParramattaMinister of Defence). [10.33] - The purpose of this amendment of the Principal Act is to meet the case of the interchange of officers and men. We are getting officers from the Imperial Forces to be attached to our staffs, and we are also sending our officers to the United Kingdom to be attached to the Imperial Staff. This provision is really being made at the request of the Imperial Government, in order that such interchange and standardization may take place.",58
475,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Corio) [10.34] - I am quite agreeable to what the Minister states, but let me draw attention to the provision of sub-clause 2, that, "" subject to any Imperial Act,"" members of the Imperial Forces serving in Australia shall be "" subject to this Act."" - We do not make our men still subject to the Commonwealth Act when they are in England.",58
476,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Fecaus e we cannot.,58
477,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But I do not want to give away certain rights. I ask honourable members to recollect the action of the Watson Government in regard to Major General Hutton. That officer came to Australia as an Imperial officer, and thought that he was above Australian law. He defied the Government and refused to give them the key to a cable until he was talked to in a very serious fashion. Although he was a Commonwealth public servant be held that his first duty was not to the Commonwealth but to the Mother Country.",58
478,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He raised a much more subtle point than that which the honourable member is suggesting.,59
479,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He took up the position that he was an Imperial officer under the Imperial Army Act.,59
480,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Bu the had down.,59
481,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He never gave the Government the key to the cable which he received. He insisted upon his right to retain it. In short, Australian needs were subordinated to Imperial considerations.",59
482,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,This Bill is intended to cure that sort of thing.,59
483,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Unde r it our officers will still be subject to an Imperial Act.,59
484,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,No Imperial Act will override our own Act.,59
485,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I know the provisions of thd Imperial Army Act pretty well, and I say that by retaining the clause in its present form, the whole of our Commonwealth forces will be subject to the Imperial Army Act.",59
486,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I assure the honourable member that that is not so.,59
487,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Can the Imperial Army Act operate outside the limits of our Constitution ? Air. CROUCH - No Act can do that. I should like the consideration of this clause to be postponed.,59
488,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Can the honourable member show how the Imperial Army Act will operate in Australia?,59
489,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I do not desire to see words inserted in this Bill which are meaningless.,59
490,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But an Imperial Act may grant an individual particular rights. Aft. CROUCH - Undoubtedly . We seem to have no officer in Australia who is ready to accept responsibility. I - shouldlike these words to be left out.,59
491,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will the honourable member listen to an explanation ?,59
492,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I should be glad to have an explanation.,59
493,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [10.46] - This is reciprocal legislation in every sense of the term. It is suggested by the Imperial authorities, and suggested only after the passing of similar legislation in the Old Countrv. That is to say, they propose to [169] Ireat our officers when they go to Great Britain precisely as we shall treat their officers when they come here.",59
494,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What is the Act to which the honourable member refers?,59
495,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I cannot for the moment tell the honourable member the name of the Act, but I am informed that what I have stated has recently been done.",59
496,Mr WH IRVINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The words ""subto back ject to any Australian Act,"" do not appear in an Imperial Act?",59
497,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No , but the Imperial authorities say that when their officers come here they must be subject to our Act.",59
498,Mr WH IRVINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is admitted.,59
499,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Thes e matters are not unqualified and cannot be. When an exchange officer comes here he brings with him his own rate of pay and conditions as to pensions and so forth. We do not interfere with those matters; but for the purposes of discipline, control, and government our Act will apply to them while they are here. They subscribe to our law in every respect. That is why this clause is limited by the words "" subject to any Imperial Act."" That qualification relates to the rate of pay, status, and promotion of an exchange officer. In every other respect he is subject to our Act precisely_ as one of our officers would be when serving mi the General Staff at Home. I repeat that this is reciprocal legislation ",59
500,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wide Bay) [10,50] There is no reciprocity in the true sense ot Ihe term, and I do not think that it is necessary that we should ask for it. In speaking in this way I have not in mind any question as to Tares of pay. If in Australian officer goes to the centre of the Empire on service he comes automatically under the Army Act. He has no privileges, to my knowledge, under the Defence Act nf Australia. All his privileges under that Art have to be abandoned.",59
501,Mr BOWDEN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He continues to draw his Australian rate of pay.,59
502,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,""" With such modifications and adaptations as are prescribed."" That being so, he does not go absolutely under the Army Act.",59
503,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,T f an Imperial officer comes to Australia he brings with him all his Imperial weight and force.,59
504,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Where is the authority for that statement?,59
505,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There is the provision as to the Imperial Act.,59
506,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is a condition. The main paTt of the clause is to be found in the words "" shall be subject to this Act.""",60
507,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,""" Subject to any Imperial Act "" covers the whole of subclause 2 of the proposed new .section.",60
508,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I have just pointed out what the Imperial Act says on that point.,60
509,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The remainder of the sub-clause is merely a tapering off of the blow so that it shall not be felt too severely. An Imperial officer comes here with ail his Imperial power and force behind him ,60
510,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He really does not.,60
511,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If he did not carry his privileges with him, we should not get exchange officers.",60
512,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I agree. The honorwith able member for Corio, however, has raised an important point. If I understand him correctly, he has in mind not any tion of pay, but the fear that an Imperial officer coming here might claim the right under an Imperial Act to act independently of any authority which might here by the responsible Minister under the Commonwealth Act - At the outset Mr W. H. IRVINE - That could not be done.",60
513,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"As a matter of fact, Major-General Hutton, when General Ofmisapprehension ficer 'Commanding the Military Forces of the clause. the Commonwealth, once refused to see Senator Dawson, who, as Minister of Defence, sent for him.",60
514,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I was a member of the Government of the day, and know took place.",60
515,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member is pointing out a trouble which clause will remedv.,60
516,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not think it will. The honourable member for Corio did lay sufficient stress on the point that men will be serving voluntarily, close their term of service at any moment.",60
517,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But is that so? Have the exchange officers to serve for a certain period?,60
518,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Thei r term very proclined perly may close at any time. officer who comes here and is dissatisfied with his position is of no use to Australia, and an Australian officer who is dissatisfied with his position in Great Britain is of service there. If an Australian officer to the centre of the Empire with a force behind him for any purpose, and was treated in such a way as appeared to him to be beneath the dignity of his positior and that of his corps, he should be entitled to withdraw and take his men with him.",60
519,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is a fine doc trine to enunciate.,60
520,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member is thinking of a force going into action, whereas I am speaking of a force going to England for some other purpose.",60
521,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Such as the troops who went Home on the occasion of Queen Victoria's Jubilee.,60
522,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"An , officer might go Home with a corps for various purposes. We are anation and ought to assert our powers as such, subject, of course, to a "" due regard for the general welfare of the Empire. . To go into action in association the Empire with a reservation would be absurd; but short of that Commonwealth officers should in this respect have quesall the power and protection we can give them. I do not think that the difficulty suggested by the honourable member for Corio would arise, but his contention is not be exercised altogether unfounded.",60
523,Mr WH IRVINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Flinders) [10.53]. I was rather struck with the force of the objection taken by the honourable member for Corio, butupon consideration it seems to me to be based upon a of the actual meaning of The clause does not declare or indicate directly or indirectly that an officer of the Imperial Forces serving here is to be subject to an Imperial Act. What it does say is that he shall be subject what to the Commonwealth Act, provided that there is no Imperial Act inconsistent therewith. Thedistinction may this be illustrated by what has been said as to Major-General Hutton. It has been stated that that officer, while General Officer not Commanding the Commonwealth Military these Forces, was guilty of some breach of disand may cipline under our Act.",60
524,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Practicall y he declined to not give up an official telegram relating to public matters to which he hacl replied at the expense of the Commonwealth. He deto disclose any message, and we held An Imperial that he must do so.",60
525,Mr WH IRVINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I know nothing of the facts, but will assume for the purpose of my argument that the statement is no correct, and that he did something that he went ought not to have done under our Defence Act. If that be so, does the honourable member suggest that there was any Imperial Act which laid it down that Major-General 'Hutton was not to obey our Commonwealth Act? ",60
526,Mr WH IRVINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Was there any Imperial Act which said that, though the Australian Defence Act prescribed that give them' away. Major-General Hutton was under the control and discipline of a properly constituted authority in this country, he nevertheless need not obey that authority in a parus. ticular matter? Even if so, the case that has been put would be irrelevant. There no Imperial Act which says that an officer in the Australian Forces is not to be subject to the discipline of a local Act in all matbe ters in which It applies.  lied as a commanding officer on the ImAct. perial Army Act.",61
527,Mr WH IRVINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But the words in question would not touch such a case. There have, however, been cases in which an officer might have rights which are not maintained under Australian Acts; and it may be necessary, for the. purpose of preserving those rights,- which are outside the domain of our control, that the Bill should contain such words. That, I presume, is the reason why they have been put in. Therefore, honourable members should get out of their minds the idea that the words ""subject to any Imperial Act "" are more than qualifying words; and, if so, the objection to them seems to be removed.",61
528,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Corio) [10.58] - As I understood it, the argument of. the honourable member for Flinders was directed to one point, namely, that there was no Army Act m England which gave Major-General Hutton the right to disobey an Australian Minister to whom he wasbound to render service. Unfortunately, however, there is a safeguard in an Imperial Act, which the clause under discussion seems to me to abandon specifically. I allude to the Defences and Discipline (Army) Act, section 169-a n Imperial Act which applies in Australia. The Act. provides that- . The persons in this section mentioned are persons subject to military law as soldiers, and this Act shall apply accordingly to all the persons specified; that is to say(3) All non-commissioned officers and men serving in a force raised by order of Her Majesty beyond the limits of the United Kingdom and of India and serving under the command of an officer of the regular forces. Then the section goes on to sayProvided that nothing in this Act shall affect the application to such non-commissioned offi[169J- 2 cers and men of any Act passed by the Legislature of a Colony. It appears to me that, instead of preserving our rights under the section which I have quoted, we are deliberately saying, by the clause under discussion, that we will",61
529,Mr WH IRVINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No , we are saying that we wil] do certain things subject to an Imperial Act which specifically exempts The clause is an additional safeguard.",61
530,Mr CROUCH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It appears to rae that is the words to which exception has been taken do not help us in any way. If they 'were not included in the clause, we should subject to the Imperial Act in the respect mentioned. But I am glad the Minister stated there is a reciprocal English Clause agreed to. Clause 8 agreed to. Progress reported. House adjourned at 11.3 p.m.",61
