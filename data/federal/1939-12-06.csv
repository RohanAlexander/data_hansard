63,Mr FORDE,UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEFIN,"Capricornia) [3.32] - I take it that the object of the for Trade and Customs, (Mr . Lawson), in increasing the fact duty on condenser yarns, & c , for the manufacture of towelling, is to increase the demand for Australiancotton. To that extent it has my support, but it is not sufficient merely to increase the demand for Australian grown cotton; it is also necessary to increase the production of raw cotton in this country to meet the demand. The immediate requirements of the Australian manufacturers are 35,000 hales, and Australian production falls short of that hy 15,000 bales. When these new duties become operative, the demand for Australian raw cotton will increase. It is expected that within the next two years there will be a demand in Australia for 50,000 bales of raw cotton. It should he our objective to ensure that Australian manufacturers are supplied with raw cotton from Australian farms. That, I believe, is the Minister's ambition, but order to achieve it he must lay down a long-range plan for the encouragement of the cotton-growing industry. The decision of the Government to restrict the payment of a bounty on raw cotton to one year will have the effect of retarding development of the industry by holding up irrigation undertakings. The bounty legislation should be re-enacted for a period of at least five years. The Queensland Government tentatively agreed to do a number of things to assist the industry, provided the Commonwealth Government embarked upon a long-range plan, particularly in regard to the cotton bounty. The State Government agreed to make a grant of Â£30,000 for the year 1939-40 to assist individual growers to install pumping plant; also, to conduct investigations into the most suitable kinds of land, and to establish irrigation works. Cultural experiments were to be carried out, and dry-farming methods studied, because dry farming would have to be continued until irrigation schemes were established. The recent proposal of the Minister that the bounty legislation would have a currency during the war of-not more than twelve months will affect the expansion of the industry most detrimentally, and will retard irrigation developments. The chief problem in Queensland is one of production. The industry was revived in 1920, and since then cotton has been grown with the aid of natural rainfall only. The average yield per acre is very low, and the raising of cotton is, for the most part, unprofitable to the growers. Unless the acreage yield can he increased, the industry is faced with gradual extinction; The Cotton Board considered this ques* tion, and came to the conclusion that only by irrigation could production be increased and the industry placed on a sound and profitable basis. After the Tariff Board's report was presented to the Government in April 1939, negotiations were commenced between the Commonwealth and the Government of Queensland regarding the future of the industry. It was recognized that something further would have to be done if the industry were to expand, so as to supply all requirements"" of Australian spinners from the product of Australian farms. The urgent need for increasing the acreage yield was recogin nized by both governments. It was agreed that the Queensland Government should undertake extensive irrigation works, and it was understood that this could only be made an economic proposition if a long-term plan were embarked upon. Therefore, the Queensland Government asked that the bountyon raw cotton be granted for a period of at least five years. Preliminary investigations were begun and the Queensland Government is prepared to fulfil its part of the undertaking. The hold-up has been caused by the announcement of the Commonwealth Government that the bounty legislation will be reviewed from year to year. The experience of growers' in the United States of America shows clearly the value of irrigation in the growing of cotton. There, the acreage yield was increased by irrigation from 400 lb. to 1,500 lb. Experiments conducted by the Queensland Cotton Board show that production in Queensland has been increased fourfold as the result of irrigation. It would be a bad thing for Queensland, and for Australia generally, if the cotton-growing industry were to be extinguished. There are 3,600 growers, and seasonal employment is provided for 3,000 workers who migrate from cottonpicking to cane-cutting, obtaining a few months' work in each industry. If these men are to be deprived of employment in the cotton industry their annual income will be substantially reduced, and there will be less money in circulation. There will be a general increase of unemployment, and more persons will be seeking the dole. I therefore urge the Minister to treat this as a matter of importance. The reenactment of bounty legislation for one year does not meet the situation. There is no certainty as to the future, and this is having a disturbing effect upon the growers. In 'the past, they have not obtained a sufficient return for their product to enable them to develop their holdings. Many of them have not earned even the basic wage after expenses have been paid, and they have been unable to do the fair thing by those - whom they employ. In many instances the cotton-pickers have to live in tents bag humpies. That is not the wish of the growers. If the industry were profitable they would like to provide the same conditions for their employees as are provided generally in the pastoral industry. It is with a view to placing the industry on a proper footing that I appeal to the Minister to embark upon a long-range plan, including the payment of a bounty for five years. The hounty might be on a diminishing scale, the .protective duties being made to rise as the bounty falls. Item agreed to. Items 393, 415 and 419 agreed to. Item 392 (Yarns) (c) Woollen or containing wool--by leave-reconsidered .",26
64,Mr FORDE,UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEFIN,"Capricornia) [3.46] - It is proposed to reduce the British pre1 ferential tariff from 6d. per lb. and 25 per cent, ad valorem to 4d. per lb. and 10 per cent, ad valorem, and the general tariff from Is. per lb. and 42Â£ per cent, ad valorem to Is. per lb. and 35 per cent, .ad valorem. There is no justification for the reduction. The total production of .woollen yarns in Australia, based on the output for 1935-36, is approximately .27,700,000 lb. per annum. The output .of yarns used in weaving is approximately 21,500,000 lb. per annum, and, in addition, the output of knitting and fingering yarns amounts to 6,200,000 lb. Importations of yarns in 1935-36 totalled 274,000 lb. Nearly all of the woollen mills in Australia treat the wool from the time that it arrives in the bale. They class and scour it, spin it into yarns and weave and dye it. In many instances, all of the work is done under the one roof, whereas in England many manufacturers specialize in the production of yarns only. Messrs. Paton and Baldwins, of Launceston, specialize in the weaving of wool yarns. There is no difficulty in getting in Australia the whole of our requirements of woollen yarns. The same argument applies to worsteds and ladies' lightweight dress materials, on which the committee expressed an unmistakable verdict last night. As I dealt at some length with the woollen industry last night, I shall not go into details today, but shall leave the honourable member, for Bass (Mr Barnard), who has intimate knowledge of this subject, to bring certain facts before the committee. Last night and the committee made it clear that it does not intend to accept willy-nilly any recommendation of the Tariff Board, and I hope that, in respect of these duties, also, it will take a similar stand. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) said that at one period he was under a misapprehension with regard to the Ottawa Agreement/ He believed that, if the Parliament did not endorse a recommendation of the Tariff Board for a reduction of duty, it thereby committed a breach of the Ottawa Agreement, but subsequently he realized that was not so. The honourable gentleman saidHowever, a new interpretation has now been placed on the Ottawa Agreement. Article II of the agreement specifies that Parliament shall be "" invited to v a r y "" the rates of duty. The full text of the article is as follows:"" H is Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia undertakes that a review shall be made as soon as practicable by the Australian Tariff Board of existing protective duties in accordance with the principles laid down in Article 10 hereof, and that after the receipt of the report and recommendation of the Tariff Board the Commonwealth Parliament shall be invited to vary, wherever necessary, the tariff on goods of. United Kingdom origin such manner as to give effect to such principles."" Article 10 is in these termsHis Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia undertakes that during the currency of this agreement the tariff shall be based on the princip'e that protective duties shall not exceed such a level as will give United Kingdom producers ful l opportunity of reasonable competition on the basis of the re'ative cost of economical and efficient production, provided that in the application of such principle special consideration may be given in the case of industries not fullv estabMshed."" The significant of the article lies in the words "" invited to vary "". When T was putting throuffh the tariff schedule in 1933. I understood those words to mean that any defeai of a recommendation of the Tariff Board would involve the violation of the agreement, and I said so on more than one occasion. That was also the opinion of the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry U-ulleu), who had taken part in the framing of the agreement. Among the supporters of the Government there was no unanimity on the subject. The Government obtained the opinions of eminent counsel, and at the time it adhered to the policy propounded by the then Minister for Trade and Customs. Later, when speaking at Geelong, the Minister expressed opinions in relation to the Ottawa Agreement which were in conformity with the views expressed by honourable members on this side of the chamber. We had described it as an iniquitous agreement which cut across the protectionist policy of Australia, in that it took from the Parliament the right to fix what it thought to be adequate protection and handed over the whole business .to a body consisting of public servants and representatives of industry, which had been created by the Parliament. In dealing with the many tariff items which have come before it the Tariff Board has always had in view the reduction of the protective incidence of the tariff in order that overseas manufacturers may compete on favourable terms in the Australian market. The Labour party has always held that charity begins at home, and that the first responsibility of the National Parliament is to Australia and Australian workers. It is our privilege and duty to protect the livelihood of the 500,000 Australians who are engaged in secondary industries in this country. On this point, the members of the Country party should support the Labour party because they frequently bring forward requests that the primary producers of this country should be paid for their produce a home-consumption price based ou the cost of production. I remind members of that party that a home-consumption price can be paid to the primary producers only so long as we have in Australia a contented population of workers in receipt of decent wages. Were it not for the market provided by the workers, it would he impossible to pay bounties to the growers of wheat, fruit, butter and other primary products. On this question, the Labour party does n it facÂ° both ways, hut there are certain honourable gentlemen in this chamber who try to have one foot in the free trade camp while claiming also a place in the protectionist camp. They want 300 per cent, protection tor all that they produce and free trade in respect of the things they do not produce. Their incouiistency brings them into all kinds of difficulties, so that one day we find them fighting one another, and the next day voting together. Just as the committee last night disregarded the recommendation of the Tariff Board in respect of woollen piece goods, so I trust that today it will act similarly in regard to woollen yarns and wool tops. I invite honourable members to reject this proposal. The previous duties should be restored.",28
65,Mr BARNARD,UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEFIN,"Bass) [4.0] - I associate myself with the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde), on this. item. The proposal of the Government provides for a reduction of the duty from - 6d. per lb. and 25 per cent, ad valorem, subject to exchange adjustment, British, and Is. per lb. and 42Â£ per cent. ad. valorem general, to 4d. per lb. and 10 per cent, ad valorem, with exchange adr justment .6 per cent, ad valorem British, and Is., 35 per cent., and .7 per cent, respectively, general. I strongly oppose the alteration. The reasons I gave last night for resisting the proposed reduction of duties on woollen piece goods apply with equal force to this proposed reduction of duties on yarns. I said last night that because of the war, the full effect of any such reduction might not be felt immediately, but that the reduction was sure to have a seriously adverse effect on the industry when normal conditions returned and when normal shipping was available. This industry is of great importance in my Plectorate where 1,250 hands are cr.iployed in making woollen yarns. The:- pay roll is considerably more than Â£3,000 a week. I have watched the industry grow from very small beginnings to its pi-esent proportions. It would be serious for the Government to interfere with the industry. If the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr John Lawson) is not prepared to withdraw the item for reconsideration, I trust that honourable members generally will deal with it as they dealt last night with the item relating to woollen niece goods. No doubt the Minister will say that the Government is under an obligation to honour the Ottawa Agreement. The Ottawa Conference was held in July and August, 1932, and the agreement was signed on the 20th August. The Tariff Board, in September, 1932, recommended certain revisions of duties. Subsequently, when these came before Parliament, the then Minister for Trade and Customs said that, the new rates gave effect to the formula for margins of preference and other charges agreed to by the Australian delegation at Ottawa. In these circumstances the duties then agreed to should be continued. I admit that the proposed new duties carry the unanimous recommendation of the Tariff Board.  wrong recommendation!",29
66,Mr BARNARD,UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEFIN,"I agree with the honourable member. The yarn manufacturers in my electorate are very concerned about the situation. If the duties are reduced, the results may be extremely serious to the Australian people. Under the rates of duty now proposed, the firm would probably be able in normal times to send Australian wool to Scotland, manufacture it there, and return the finished product to Australia at a cheaper rate than it could be produced for in Tasmania. ""We should not take the risk of any such happening. The growth of this industry has been remarkable. Its operations are decentralized and all the circumstances of the case warrant the extending of the most favourable consideration to it. I shall not labour the matter as I covered the ground fairly fully last night. I submit that, as the company is not earning exorbitant profits, and as it producing a satisfactory article, it should be accorded the protection it deserves. Lower duties than those which applied prior to the introduction of this schedule should not even be considered.",30
67,Mr DRAKEFORD,UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEFIN,"Maribyrnong) [4.8] - The Government has produced no evidence to support this proposed reduction of duty, but apparently it feels obliged to give full effect to all recommendations of the Tariff Board in respect of woollen goods. I suggest, however, that it would be wipe to take cognizance of the vote recorded by honourable members last night when the Government proposals were defeated. Any reduction of the duties affecting the woollen trade, should be strongly resisted. Honourable members indicated last night that this was their view. I do not propose to traverse the ground so effectively covered by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde). I simply urge the Government not to regard, the Tariff Board as an infallible body, but to give some attention to the expressed views of honourable members of the committee. The Tariff Board should not be permitted to override Parliament, and it is unreasonable, in my opinion, for the Government to expect us to accept, without question, every recommendation that the Tariff Board may make of this kind. No justivery fication has been advanced for any reduction of these duties and, therefore, I hope that the vote which honourable members gave last night in respect of the duties on woollen piece goods will be repeated in respect of these yarns.",30
68,Mr JOHN LAWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEFIN,"MacquarieMinister for Trade and Customs) [4.11]. -'Honourable members who have criticized this proposal should bear in mind that primarily the Government is actuated by the desire to do the fair and reasonable thing towards the United Kingdom. This proposal is fair and reasonable. The total production of woollen yarns in Australia in 1937-38 exceeded 30,000,000 lb., while imports in the same year totalled 238,000 lb - considerabl y less than 1 per cent, of local production. Raw wool for spinning into yarn is available in Australia at world parity prices and represents from 60 per cent, to 75 per cent, of is the total yarn cost. Existing duties are high, and on a typical yarn of United Kingdom origin exceed 14d. per lb., which is equivalent to two-thirds of the costs incurred in Australia in all the processes of manufacture from greasy wool to finished yarn. Such yarns as are imported are brought into supply the demand for special varieties not obtainable in Australia. In the majority of yarns examined by the board, the cost of' converting the wool into white yarn exceeded similar British costs by from 20 per cent, to 40 per cent. The production of dyed yarns is a more expensive process, but here again Australian conversion costs do not exceed similar costs in the United Kingdom by more than 40 per cent. The variety of yarns required in Australia, especially for fancy dress goods and sports wear, is enormous. The demand is constantly changing, thus rendering it difficult for all types to be economically produced in Australian factories. In a number of instances submitted to the T a r i ff Board, the Australian price was less than the landed duty-free cost of comparable imported yarns, and this would apply to the great bulk of yarns in big demand. Because of the limited market local prices for fancy yarns are relatively higher. The bulk of yarn is produced in Australia in self-contained factories and is thus largely immune from overseas competition. While most Australian yarns are available at reasonable prices there are instances where local prices are higher than necessary. The greater part of our imported woollen piece goods consists of cloths in which variety is the predominant sales factor, and in this field local weavers are somewhat hampered by the present high duties on these special yarns. duties now proposed will not affect the Australian production of yarns except in those few instances where local prices appear too high. Any increased importations will be in respect of yarns not competitive with local production. This will assist Australian weavers in competing with imported cloths made from these special yarns. I have no doubt that the margin of protection accorded Australian spinners of woollen yarns under the proposals now before the committee will adequately safeguard the local industry.",30
69,Mr NOCK,UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEFIN,"Riverina) [ 4 . 1 5 ] - I support the Government's proposal. I believe that the informatio n supplied by the Tariff Board, in addition to that given by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr John Lawson) in regard*to imports, provides ample justification for my support of the reduced duties. Some people are continually talking about adequate protection; in my opinion the present rates of duty afford adequatp protection to the Australian industry. The fair ness of the rate is obvious when we realise that less than 1 per cent, of similar goods is imported into Australia. There is no need for excessive protection. Yesterday, during a discussion on another item, reference was made to profits. We were told that certain members of the Opposition did not take any exception to manufacturers making big profits-that they did not care how large profits were.",31
70,Mr FORDE,UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEFIN,"No honourable member ou . this side of the chamber said that. We are all against profiteering, and we stated that the Government could deal with profiteering under its emergency powers.",31
71,Mr NOCK,UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEFIN,"The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) said that he did not care what large profits were made because the Government could tax them. His statement can be verified by reference to Hansard. I take up a different attitude. I believe that the protection should be reasonable, but that it should not. allow manufacturers to make unreasonable profits because unreasonable profits increase the cost of living. We have seen the unreasonable profits earned by the glass industry; we saw them i u the cement industry; and we see them again in the motor body building industry. The tariff should be so regulated at a The reasonable level to ensure that the Australian market is reasonably reserved to the Australian manufacturers and yet prevent them from exploiting the Australian people. These duties were recommended by the Tariff Board and, as I consider them reasonable, I support the Government's proposal. Question putthe That the sub-item be agreed to. The committee divided.

72,Mr FORDE,UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEFIN,"Capricornia) [4.22] The proposal before the committee is the duties on wool tops be reduced from 6d. per lb. and 20 per cent. British to per lb., and from Is. per lb. and 20 per cent, general to 9d. per lb. For the same reasons that I opposed the duties on saidwoollens, worsteds and ladies' lightweight dress materials last night, and on woollen yarns today, so I oppose the reduction of effectdepreciation duties on wool tops. The Tariff Board out made its recommendations regarding the rency reduction of the duties on these items the result of investigations having in mind Kingdom. the terms of the Ottawa Agreement. I Customs quote another passage from the remarksexcept of the honourable member for Balaclava counts (Mr White), who was a member of the t it y i that delegation that visited the United Kingever, dom last year to consider the renewal of with the agreement, and to make what adjustoccasional ments might"" be necessary. Speaking on in Australia. another item yesterday, the honourable gentleman said In connection with the interpretation agreement, however, it was finally agreed provided the law officers of the United dom approved, the article in question would be taken to mean just what the words implied, namely, that Parliament "" would be invited vary "" the duties in accordance with the recomreduction of duty. mendations of the Tariff Board, but if i not do so, there would be no abrogation of the agreement. So, the committee may reject the recomment's mendation of the Tariff Board which contained in the Government's tariff proposals without in any way infringing the Ottawa Agreement. I trust that it will do so as it did so overwhelmingly in regard NOES. to another item last night. The manufacturer of wool tops in Australia is very soundly established. For many years unspecified tops were admitted to this country duty free, irrespective of origin, but from 1909 to 1915 a bounty was paid for export. The bounty payments ceased in 1915, and in December, 1929, a duty of 9d. per lb. and 20 per cent, was imposed. This far exceeded the cost of conversion and gave practically the whole of the Australian market to the local manufacturers. Before that duty was imposed, approximately 1,000,000 lb. of tops was imported M a k in N . J. 0. ; annually. Because of the difference of organization in the two countries wool tops are not bought and sold in Australia in the same proportions as they are in the United Kingdom. For many years wool tops have been exported from Austhat tralia in considerable quantities. In 1935-36 the export was 3,145,057 lb., 4d. valued at Â£A.404,704, and in 1936-37, 3,749,819 lb., valued at Â£A.532,574. Commenting on this industry the Tariff Board It speaks well for the efficiency of the Australian combing industry that, in spite of the in our currency, with its indirect on costs, the process of combing is carried in Australia at costs in Australian curthat are little higher than the costs of as the same work in sterling in the United It would appear that, even if the tops were duty free in all columns of the Tariff, no importations would occur, to supply tops manufactured from of wool not available in sufficient quann ' Australia. There is one factor, howmight place the Australian manufacturer of tops at a disadvantage compared the British manufacturers, and that is the higher cost of strong cross bred wool In view of the comments of the Tariff Board and the fact that we have the of the plant, equipment and the men in Austhat, tralia necessary not only to supply the Kingwhole of the Australian market, but also to export considerable quantities overseas, to there is no justification for the proposed The arguments t did advanced in connection with worsteds and cotton yarns are applicable in this case. The committee should reject the Governproposal and permit the duties is formerly levied to be continued. Question putThat the item bo agreed to. The committee divided. (THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN-MR .

In view of the committee's rejection of the Government's proposals for a reduction of the duties on woollen piece-good3, the duties revert to the higher level under the Customs Tariff Act as from the date of their introduction, and normally the Government would therefore have to charge the higher duty on goods already cleared through the customs. The insertion of this new clause will overcome the necessity for charging the higher duty on past imports, and will limit the higher rate to goods entered through the customs from now onwards. verbally Proposed new clause agreed to.

75,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MOTOR VEHICL E ENGIN E,"B a r k e r Leader of the Country party) [4.40] This is the first occasion on which I have heard of an appropriation being made for this purpose, and I was not aware that the Government had yet put anything through Parliament which would ""give the authority to pay this bounty. Some more explanatory statement by the Minister is necessary before, in what may be the last week of this sitting, we commit ourselves to any definite action. I was aware of the history of the proposal to pay a bounty on the production of motor vehicle engines, but I believed that the matter was.now somewhere "" o u t in the blue "" and not likely to return for some time. I would, therefore, like to hear an explanation fro m the Minister.",34
76,Mr JOHN LAWSON,MOTOR VEHICL E ENGIN E,"MacquarieMinister for Trade and Customs) [4.42]. - The Government has been giving consideration to the establishment of this industry for a very considerable time, and statements on the subject were made in this House by the Prime Minister (Mr . Menzies) in order that honourable members might be made aware of the fact.

Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted.

77,Mr JOHN LAWSON,MOTOR VEHICL E ENGIN E,"MacquarieMinister for Trade and Customs) [4.44]. - I move That the hill be now read a second time. Honourable members will recollect that in 1936 the present Minister for External Affairs C Sir Henry Gullett) advised this House of the decision of the then Governmanufacture ment to give a strong lead, and what hoped, decisive encouragement, to the establishment of the motor vehicle engine and chassis-manufacturing industry in Australia. To this end bounty proposals on engine units were offered and an import tax of .'7d. per lb. was imposed on all chassis entering the country in order to provide the funds for payment of bounty. Prolonged investigations and negotiations followed this offer of the Lyons Government. There was on the part of those companies which might have been expected to undertake manufacture a perhaps understandable reluctance to accept the Government's offer. The profits of some of the companies were high and it appeared that they preferred to continue to conduct, the industry on the basis of the importation of chassis. One of the first acts of the present Government was to consider the steps necessary to ensure the establishment of the industry in the Commonwealth. On the 17th May, 1939, the Prime Minister announced in this House that the Commonwealth Government had' definitely decided that motor vehicle engines and chassis are to be manufactured in Australia and that there should be no undue delay in establishing the industry. The reasons for this decision were defence preparedness, industrial expansion, conservation of overseas funds, immigration, employment and utilization of Australian raw materials. The Government considers that the time has now arrived when the necessary bounty legislation should be introduced in order that the Government's offer can be - translated into an act of Parliament, and the Government's desire to see the industry established fulfilled . Briefly, the terms of the bill provide for payment of bounty on engine units of 15 horsepower or over ofFor the first 20,000 engine units-Â£3 0 a unit, For the second 20,000 engine units-Â£25 a unit, For the third 20,000 engine unitsÂ£20 a unit. 'This bill provides for payment of bounty' only in respect of enarine units of 15 horsepower or over. If the occasion arose for the Government to consider a proposal for of engines below 15 hor?ewas power the bounty legislation could be amended if this course were considered desirable. The bill also provides that bounty shall be paid on the basis of the engine units comprising 90 per cent. Australian materials. The bounty rates will be reduced if the units contain less than this percentage. The act will come into operation only when the Governor General notifies that he is satisfied that there is a factory with complete works pvoperly equipped for the manufacture of at least 8,000 engine units per annum.",34
78,Mr BEASLEY,MOTOR VEHICL E ENGIN E,"Has the Government investigated that aspect? Mr JOHN"" LAWSON - The Governindustries ment has made extensive investigations.",35
79,Mr FORDE,MOTOR VEHICL E ENGIN E,"Hav e any proposals been made to the Government ? Mr JOHN L'AWSON - Yes . Provision is also made that the bounty will be paid only when the shareholding a company claiming bounty is at least two-ithirds Australian owned and trolled. It is estimated that the 60,000 units for which bounty provision is made will take a well-equipped compauy some four years to produce when consideration given to the fact that no company would produce at capacity in the first two years of production. It will take probably eighteen months for the company to erect car production. plant, install machinery and enter into large scale production. Bounty payments will amount to Â£1,500,000 for the 60,000 engines - From now until the end of the four-year manufacturing period it is additional estimated that the existing .7d. per imposed on imported chassis will return Â£1,400,000.",35
80,Mr FORDE,MOTOR VEHICL E ENGIN E,What amount of tax has already been collected ?,35
81,Mr JOHN LAWSON,MOTOR VEHICL E ENGIN E,"I cannot say of offhand, but I think about Â£1,000,000. It will be essential for the successful later stage. marketing of the Australian car that a price differential in favour of an Australian-produced car should be estabthemselves lished in oTder to overcome what might be termed "" sales resistance "" to meet the competitive methods of firms marketing cars incorporating imported engines and chassis. Probably the major portion of the bounty will he required for an Australian company to meet these two points. To the degree that the prices of cars are reduced the public will benefit. It is anticipated that, when the Australian car is offered for sale, the price of the imported cars will be considerably reduced. The Government is anxious for the industry to be established in Australia at the earliest possible date and feels that the introduction and passing of this legislation will be an important contribution to that end. The time is long overdue when this great industry should be established. The great pity is that it is not already a part of our economy, playing a vital part in the general war effort of .the country. There are probably few in a nation's industrial makeup during time of war that rank higher than the motor car engine and chassis manufacturing industry. Mr Forde' - If we can manufacture aeroplane engines we should he able to of manufacture motor car engines ",35
82,Mr JOHN LAWSON,MOTOR VEHICL E ENGIN E,"Yes . The conhighly-skilled labour, machine and machine tool equipment, essential precision work and the development and production of alloy steels will bring about national development in the highest form is of engineering production and achievement. I strongly emphasize that. To-day one of the standards of a nation's wartime strength is measured in 'terms of motor The Government is satisfied that motor car engines and chassis can be produced in Australia economically and withoutcost to the public. Certain parts lb. may have to be imported in the initial stages, but, ultimately, most of the engine and chassis parts will be able to be manufactured in Australia. This bill does not, of course, make provision for assistance in respect of chassis parts. The question the form of protection to be accorded to chassis parts will be considered at a Australian industrialists have proved in the field of iron and steel production and in engineering achieveand ment. To-day we are entering into the higher field of precision production. The manufacture of aeroplanes is a notable examp'e, and with the manufacture of the complete motor car we shall indeed be able to claim that Australia will have witnessed an industrial revolution. It sometimes requires a major crisis to bring to fruition those national projects long delayed or too long in contemplation. The national pulse today is beating at a faster rate, and it will stimulate us to achievements by which we shall be able to measure our progress as a nation. The difficulties confronting those who will undertake this work will be very real and complex. Not the least of these will be the competitive methods which will be employed against them. It will be the duty of every Australian government to ensure that the Australian industry is given a fair and reasonable opportunity in its own market. I am surely not anticipating developments when I say that the Commonwealth Government will take all possible steps to safeguard the new industry against unfair competition. I say this solely for the purpose of letting all interested parties know where the Commonwealth Government stands. . I make an earnest appeal to all honourable members to give the greatest possible support to this bill, and, when the industry is establishedj to that industry. The success of the venture will depend not only on Australian engineering skill andadministration, the Australian artisan, who ranks with the best in the world, and the Australian public, but also in no small measure on the good offices, sympathy and co-operation of every Australian government. are many directions in which each government will be able to assist in the initial stages of development, and I make this appeal in the - hope that it will be met. In asking all honourable members to support this bill, I wish to pay tribute to the vision of the present Minister for External Affairs, who first sponsored the proposal. As. I said earlier, it is a pity that the industry is not already part of our wartime economy. That honourable gentleman not only sponsored the proposal, but also fostered it and kept it alive. I should mention, too, the very active support given by my predecessor, the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr ""White) during the earlier negotiations.

The effect of this amendment is to modify ithe duty imposed on unexposed kinematograph film on Thursday last, the 30th November. The duty then imposed was I d . a lineal foot and its principal object was to secure revenue from unexposed film used in the copying in Australia of positive films fro m imported negatives or lavender prints. In its incidence, the duty bears very heavily on Australian film studios engaged in the production of motion pictures, such as the film studios at Waver ley, Sydney, and on producers of Australian newsreels. The amendment provides for free admission of unexposed film subject to departmental by-law.

87,Mr JAMES,NATIONAL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Hunter) [5.35] - The Labour party will not oppose this bill, but it is of the opinion that the interests of the workers who will establish homes at Glen Davis should be protected. We know from practical experience that whenever new mining villages are established, as is proposed in this case, the workers are likely to be exploited by financiers, contractors and others. No provision is made in the bill to prevent such exploitation. We are of the opinion, also, that as the Commonwealth Government has invested a largo sum of money in this venture, it3 security should be protected. Originally, a lien was held over the land, part of which, comprising from 80 to 120 acres, is to be used for the village site; but this apparently has been surrendered and it would seem that in the future the Commonwealth Government, at. any rate, will have a lessened security in respect of the money it has invested in this enterprise. The original agreement made between the Commonwealth of Australia of the first part, the State of New South Wales of the second part, and the National O i l Proprietary Limited of the third part, provided that the Commonwealth should invest Â£334.000. the State Government invest Â£166,000, and the National Oil Proprietary Limited Â£166,000 in this enterprise, making a total investment of Â£666,000, of which Â£500^,000 was being provided by the two Governments. As I understand the agreement which we are now asked to ratify, any claim which the Commonwealth Government may have had on the land in question is to he discharged. Whilst it is laudable that provision should be made to enable the workers to establish homes at Glen Davis, it is also desirable that the interests of the Commonwealth, on the one hand, and of the workers, on the other hand, should be safeguarded. Banking and finance companies, investors and land speculators should all be watched. Apparently, no satisfactory title deed is to be provided in respect of the land upon which individual workers may establish themselves. We do not know the amount by which the State Government may reimburse itself out of the sale of this land at Glen Davis, but it seems no provision whatever is being made to preserve the security of the Commonwealth. The land is to be sold at auction next Boxing Day. I take exception to the procedure that has been adopted in regard to this bill. When two parliaments are asked to ratify an agreement made with a third party, I consider that the bill submitted to one parliament .should be made available to the members of the other parliament. There should, in fact, be an exchange of bills. But, although the Parliament of New South Wales passed a bill early in November to ratify this agreement, we were not furnished with copies of it, nor have we received copies of the resultant act. This act will cover the conditions of disposal of land over which we have a covenant for Â£334,000, which the Commonwealth has invested.",39
88,Mr HOLT,NATIONAL OIL PROPRIETARY,"The Parliament of New South Wales passed the bill at the request of the Prime Minister, and this Government was familiar with the terms of it.",40
89,Mr JAMES,NATIONAL OIL PROPRIETARY,"I understand that the honourable member for Hartley in the Parliament of New South Wales took exception in that Parliament to the provisions of clause 29, which took away the right of the State Liquor Licensing Board to grant any further hotel licences at Glen Davis without the consent of the Minister of the State of New South Wales. When a right of this kind is taken from a duly-constituted licensing board and made subject to the will of a Minister or of a government, the word that immediately comes to one's mind is "" graft"", particularly when it is asserted that Mr. Davis, who owns the land, gave an undertaking to Mr Lee, of the hotel at Mount Victoria, that, if he obtained a transfer licence he would see him .protected against competition. Hence, the reason for section 29 of the New South Wales act, which confirms Mr Davis's promise to Mr Lee-n o licence is to be granted without the consent of the State Minister. The workers employed at Glen Davis are entitled to the enjoyment of home and family life in close proximity to their work. They should not be obliged to keep two homes, as men are usually required to do who undertake pioneering work in new mining fields. I have had that experience myself, for I have pioneered in that mining villages. The workers should not be obliged to travel considerable distances at week-ends from a temporary home on a mining field to wherever their permanent home may be; but at the same time any arrangement that is made to enable them to acquire a home of their own on the new mining field should include provisions for their protection against persons who are only too ready to grasp every opportunity for exploitation. The Government of New South Wales will undoubtedly be able to recoup itself to some degree from the proceeds of the sale of the Crown lands which will become the site of the new village.",40
90,Mr HOLT,NATIONAL OIL PROPRIETARY,"I think I should point out that the Government of New South Wales will be spending. Â£40,000 in addition to the money that it has already voted for this enterprise. I assume that it will reimburse itself, to some degree, in respect of that Â£40,000 from the proceeds of the sale of this land.",40
91,Mr JAMES,NATIONAL OIL PROPRIETARY,"My reply to that is that whilst a State government is expending Â£40,000, the Commonwealth Government is providing approximately Â£70,000 for the construction of a strategic road to the town for a distance of 30 miles through very difficult country, in addition to our Â£334,000 as against the State's Â£166,000. It is regrettable, however, that, although the Commonwealth is providing that money, the work is being carried out under the supervision of the New South Wales Government, which i "" exploiting the workers engaged on it. What is actually happening is that the New South Wales Government is utilizing this Â£70,000 for the purpose of relieving unemployment in the State. Single men are given two weeks' work in every eight weeks and married men two weeks' work in every four weeks. These men are drawn from the metropolitan area of Sydney, and because of the long periods of idleness they suffer considerably from sore hands when they resume work.",40
92,Mr MULCAHY,NATIONAL OIL PROPRIETARY,Did the Commonwealth empower the State to subdivide the township of Glen Davis?,41
93,Mr JAMES,NATIONAL OIL PROPRIETARY,"No , the Commonwealth is providing Â£334,000 to finance this project and an additional Â£70,000 for "" the construction of - the strategic road; the New South Wales Government is making only a comparatively small contribution. In his second-reading speech on the bill the Assistant Minister (Mr Holt) saidThe company has generously offered to make available to approved employees the, necessary deposits to enable them to undertake the construction of their own homes. Who will be regarded as "" approved"" employees? Will the company give first consideration to cringing and crawling employees, or scabs, who may take the place of trade unionists? Does the honourable gentleman believe that the company is so philanthropic as to make advances to its employees for home building, free of interest and without sfecurity? Its home-building scheme will be purely a business proposition. The workers in mining towns have had a very sad experience' of home-building schemes 3uch as this. Many people in the mining localities in my electorate who have taken advantage of a so-called "" generous offer "" such as this, after having paid their instalments regularly for a long period of years, have experienced bad times and lost their equity in the property to this company or other finance companies. We have only to remember what happened in connection with workmen's homes erected by J. and H . Brown Proprietary Limited at Minmi. As the result of the loss of employment through the depression years most of those unfortunate people who acquired homes from the company found that they were so hopelessly in debt to their employers that they had to relinquish their homes. Today J. and H . Brown Proprietary Limited own practically the whole town of Minmi. This may be the future of Glen Davis. It is remotely situated from the main centres of population, and, should this undertaking fail, the position of workers who have secured advances for home building from the company will be no better than that of the unfortunate people of Minmi, Kihabba, Greta, and half a dozen other mining towns in the electorate which I represent.",41
94,Mr BEASLEY,NATIONAL OIL PROPRIETARY,Is - the Government doing nothing to protect the equity of the worker in such cases?,41
95,Mr HOLT,NATIONAL OIL PROPRIETARY,I shall deal with that later.,41
96,Mr JAMES,NATIONAL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Paragrap h 2 a of the schedule of this bill empowers the Prime Minister to annul the only protection possessed by the workers who acquire homes from the company. The paragraph readsNotwithstanding the provisions of Clause 12 of the said agreement and' the terms of the Deed of Covenant and Charge . . . . made by the company in favour of the Commonwealth the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth shall have power to release without any consideration the lands described in the schedule hereto from the provisions of clause 12 of the said agreement and of the said Deed of Covenant and Charge to the intent that such lands shall cease to be comprised in or subject to such Deed of Covenant and Charge and the Prime Minister may deliver up to the company all documents of title to any of the said lands. This at least gives the Commonwealth Government a right in the land, and by virtue of that right, a sympathetic government could protect workers from the exploiter. In view of the fact that the Commonwealth Government, with road included, is finding approximately Â£500,000 for this venture, why is power to be given to the Prime Minister to annul the only safeguard provided in the original agreement? No provision is being made in the bill to prevent the exploitation by land sharks of workers who acquire homes. Unscrupulous 'land speculators will be permitted to buy as many blocks as they wish, and to fix the price at which they are re-sold to the workers. Adequate provision should be made to curtail the activities of these unscrupulous speculators. Just as the Government finds it is necessary to assist private enterprise in the building of defence annexes for the manufacture of war material, so also is it necessary for the Government to nnance workers who are engaged in the production of oil. so essential for our fighting force to build housps. I have no quarrel with the Government for its decision, to assist this company, but I contend that adequate safeguards should be provided for the protection of the employees of companies so assisted. Why should not the workers at Glen JJavis be assisted to build their own homes by advances made through the Commonwealth Bank? The history of homebuilding ventures by private enterprise in the past, particularly by mining companies, has been an unhapnv one. A mine of any description, once opened up, is a wasting asset; the life of most mines rarely extends beyond 40 years. I venture to say that the life of the shale oil deposits in the Newnes-Capertee valley will not exceed 30 years. After these deposits have been exploited what will be the position of the workers who have acquired homes from the comoany, particularly those who have acquired building blocks from land sharks at an exorbitant price? After 30 years the homes purchased by the workers at Glen Davis will not he worth a "" bumper "". It will be a deserted village. In the words of the poet GoldsmithIII fares the land, to hastening ills Where wealth accumulate, and men decay. Although certain protection afforded by the terms of clause 12 of the original agreement this bill now proposes that the Prime Minister may deliver up to the company all lands comprised in the deed of covenant. It will be found that the companv which, in the words of the Assistant Minister has, "" generously offered to make advances for home building "" will, in the final result, own not only the lands comprised in the covenant hut also the whole of the improvements of the town of Glen Davis. The measure which has been submitted to us is very brief-it s contents are largely contained in the schedulecompared with the more elaborate measure submitted to the State Parliament. The Commonwealth should guard againet hphig regarded as a milch cow by individuals engaged in exploitation of industry. I have nothing against Mr Davis. I realise that he has Mr James. . done much valuable work for his country, but when substantial financial backing for enterprises of the sort pioneered by Mr Davis is provided at the expense of the taxpayers, adequate protection should be given to the workers engaged in them. The Government should not overlook the fact, too, that other localities in which large deposits of shale exist should not be neglected. Very large shale deposits are to be found at Baerami in the electorate represented by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Gardner), and in the Gwydir electorate. Although the shale in those deposits is of greater thickness and is capable of being mined at a lower cost, the yield is not so high in oil content as from Glen Davis shale. The mining of a seam of shale varying from 2 feet to 3 feet in thickness involves heavy expenditure for brushing. Before men, horses or vehicles can work underground on a seam of that depth, the strata have to be brushed down to a. depth of at least 4 or 5 feet, which costs an extraordinary amount of money. Brushing is not necessary in the two localities to which I have referred, whereas costs at Newnes and Glen Davis are at least 100 per cent, higher on that account. The Assistant Minister stated that Â£450,000 of a total of Â£660,000 had been a prey, expended on the employment of Australian labour and Australian material in was this venture. That appears to me to be very strange, because, during the debate in the Parliament of New South Wales, it, was stated that Mr Davis had not called upon any of the money provided hy the State Government or the Commonwealth Government. According to the Assistant Minister, the Davis Gelatine Company must have only Â£6 left of the amount that it made available. I ask him, therefore, to give a satisfactory explanation of that circumstance. How has all this money been expended? It has been expended principally on surface works, such as concrete constructions. And who has received the bulk of the money under the contract for these works? "" The Concrete Construction Company. Admittedly, it is an Australian company, hut we know that two of its directors, Mr Murray, M.L.C, and Mr. Kneeshaw, M.L.C, are interested in companies which have received not only this contract but also other big defence contracts from the Commonwealth Government. They appear to be favoured by this Government, and so does National Oil Proprietary Limited. I understand that Mr Murray is the chairman of directors of the Masonite Company, which is now constructing military huts for the Defence Department with masonite, quite different from the materials which where used during the last war. Masonite is very expensive. It appears to me that Messrs. Murray and Kneeshaw, and others of their kind, are being given preference in connection with Com ruon wealth contracts.",41
97,Mr GREEN,NATIONAL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Thei r firm has been granted the Â£118,000 contract for the Patent Offices now under construction at Canberra.",43
98,Mr JAMES,NATIONAL OIL PROPRIETARY,"It is obvious that they are being favoured. The contract for the work at Glen Davis specified a maTgin of 10 per cent, over and above costs, whereas a contract in my electorate, which was let to a contractor in Hamilton, was for cost plus 5 per cent. How is it that supporters of the Government, such as Messrs. Murray and Kneeshaw, receive contracts at higher percentages plus cost than any one else?",43
99,Mr BEASLEY,NATIONAL OIL PROPRIETARY,They are refusing to pay country allowance ito their workers.,43
100,Mr JAMES,NATIONAL OIL PROPRIETARY,"That is another fact to be added to those which I have already stated. Members of the Government leave themselves open' to the severest criticism when they talk of the employment of Australian labour and materials in these works. They should ensure that the works are - allocated more equitably, and not given to one particular group of political supporters every time. I ask the Assistant Minister to give favourable consideration to the suggestions that I have made. If he does not do so, members of the Opposition may feel disposed to move an amendment designed at least to safeguard the investments of the people whom they represent and the interests of the men employed in this industry who desire to acquire homes. The workers should be given treatment as considerate as that accorded to the owners of large industrial organizations whifh have established defines annexes. Those annexes which the Commonwealth Government finances will be of no use to the working people. They will become the property of those who own the land upon which they are built. The Government has never attempted to build annexes on land owned by workers; on the contrary it has taken their homes away from them as it did at Bathmines. Because oil is just as essential to the defence of this country as annexes which provide the implements of war, the Government should retain its interest in the ownership of this land and construct workers' homes upon it as an annexe to house workers in an important industry of defence such as oil supplies. Those homes could be rented to working people at reasonable rates, and in that event, the workers would not lose as much as they are losing at present. If any body should suffer as the result of this war, it is the Commonwealth Government and not the workers. I ask the Assistant Minister to consider my submissions.",43
101,Mr BEASLEY,NATIONAL OIL PROPRIETARY,"West Sydney) [6.9] The committee is indebted to the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) for raising aspects of this matter which otherwise might not have occurred to our minds. From the remarks of the Assistant Minister (Mr Holt) it would appear on the surface that this proposal involves merely the transfer of 180 acres of land to the State of New South Wales, but from the remarks of the honourable member for Hunter, it would appear that the transfer actually involves the severing of certain rights which the Commonwealth holds over that land, by handing it to the State Government which, in turn, according to statements made in the Parliament of New South Wales, proposes to offer the property at auction. It might be purchased by speculators, or even perhaps by National Oil Proprietary Limited, whose employees will live in homes erected on that land.",43
102,Mr CURTIN,NATIONAL OIL PROPRIETARY,The men could bp allowed to construct homes on leasehold on this ground.,43
103,Mr HOLT,NATIONAL OIL PROPRIETARY,They are able to do that under the provisions of the New South Wales act.,43
104,Mr BEASLEY,NATIONAL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Accordin g to what has been said, this measure, if enacted, will empower the State of New South Wales to dispose of the land in any way that it may think fit. I have yet to learn from the statement of the Assistant Minister that this proposal ties the hands of the State Government. It removes all legal obstacles affecting the Commonwealth's rights and hands over entirely to the State Government the right to dispose of the land. If that be the case, it will be competent for the State Government to offer the property at auction. That will offer opportunities for speculators to bid The workers, because they do not possess the necessary assets, will not be able to take part in the auction in order to acquire for themselves areas upon which they may have entire freedom to erect their own homes and dispose of them when they so wish. No workers at this stage can he sure of any continuity of the tenure of their employment. They will be at the mercy of the employer, and under this measure, they are left entirely without safeguards. That is most unsatisfactory. The Government should not surrender its rights in any way. The land could be made available to those workers who wish to erect their homes upon it, without handing any rights over it to any other body, which. might decide to sell it by public auction to speculators. This industry is undoubtedly of national importance as the major oil companies exercise an extraordinary influence, not only over this country, but also ever most of the countries of the world, and therefore we have yet to see whether or not this venture will be permitted to develop to its full capacity. But at this stage in this matter we should, at least, preserve the rights of all workers, who will be, from time to time, engaged in the industry.

The proposed manufacture in Australia of cord and fabric for pneumatic .tyres prompted the Tariff Board to recommend assistance by bounty at the rate of 3^d. per lb., on the assumption that imports would be admitted at the rates of British free and general 15 per cent., but that an additional duty of | d . per lb. would be imposed when bounty expenditure reached Â£5,000 per annum and that the bounty rate would be correspondingly reduced. The Government's scheme will give the same amount of assistance as that recommended by the Tariff Board, although the bounty rate will be l j d . per lb. lower owing to the imposition, since the receipt of the board's report, of a budget tariff increase equivalent to about l i d . per lb.

Debate resumed from page 2220.",44
113,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"West Sydney) [8.5] Before this debate was interrupted, the Assistant Minister for Supply and Development (Mr Holt) gave the. House a little more detail regarding this proposal, but I believe that honourable members will want further enlightenment. This measure needs a much closer examination than I - believe it was originally intended that it should have. The Assistant Minister declared that the land with which this bill is concerned belongs to the National Oil Proprietary Limited.",48
114,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Ou t of a total of 180 acres, 120 acres belong to that company.",49
115,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"That land is an asset of that company. The original agreement contained in the National Oil Proprietary Limited Agreement Act provided for a lien over the land and other assets of the National Oil Proprietary Limited as a security that the company would recognize its financial obligations and other responsibilities to other to the agreement, namely, the Commonwealth Government and the Government of New South Wales. The proposal in this bill is to lessen the value of that security to the extent by which the land owned by the National Oil Proprietary Limited is reduced in size as the result of the transference of the ownership for the establishment of a town. The Government lien over that particular land will come to an end. The matter resolves itself into whether or not the security held by this Government in respect of the money that it has advanced to the National Oil Proprietary Limited shall diminish until the security is merely a lien over plant. All honourable members are aware that plant, once erected and in use on a mining field, becomes almost worthless as a security because it is too costly to remove it.",49
116,Mr GANDER,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,It becomes scrap iron.,49
117,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Yes , as so much iron and steel it represents no real security. Land is the greatest asset of all from the security point of view. The greater the development of the shale oil project, the greater will be the value of the land, and consequently the greater the security. In is strange, therefore, that the Government should surrender any portion of that security. Under the principal agreement the Commonwealth Government advanced to the National Oil Proprietary Limited, Â£334,000 and the Government of New South Wales, Â£166,000, both upon security. At that time, it was maintained on this side of the House that public funds should not be invested in any undertaking unless the undertaking was subject to the direction of a representative of the Government. We contended that it was wrong that the Government should invest money in a private undertaking without reserving some power to control its operations. We further suggested that a board should be set up to control the shale oil projects in the same way as boards control Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and Commonwealth Oil Refineries, in each of which this Government holds a majority of the shares and is represented. It was necessary, we said, that that should be done, because,-otherparties wise, the Commonwealth Government would have no means of telling whether the money that it was investing was being wisely expended. It was the more essential in this case, because of the importance of oil in our national economy. Our suggestions were brushed aside. The Minister at the time (Sir Archdale Parkhill) refused even to consider them. That brings me to the matter raised by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. James) who directed the attention of the House to the work that is being carried out at Newnes by Concrete Constructions Limited. I am led to understand that that firm is working on a cost plus 10 per cent, basis. At least part of the Â£334,000 which the Commonwealth invested at Newnes is being used to pay foT the completion of that contract. I fail to understand why the contract was granted on a basis of cost plus 10 per cent., especially when defence contracts are being carried out on the basis of cost plus 5 per cent. If we had a representative on the National Oil Proprietary Limited we should be able to check up on that sort of thing. Clause 12 of t.hroriginal agreement provides that Notwithstanding anything in this agreementcontained before any advances made by the Commonwealth or the State to the company, the company shall execute and deliver tn each of them the Commonwealth and the'State as security for the advances to be made by it and interest thereon a Deed of Covenant and Charge in accordance with the form contained in the second schedule hereto with such variations, modifications and additions as the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the Premier of the State and the company consider necessary or desirable and so that the said deeds of covenant and charge shall rank pari passu as a first charge on the property and assets the company comprised therein or subject thereto without any preference or priority one over the other. That clause gives to the Commonwealth Government security for the money advanced.",49
118,Mr JAMES,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,And this bill annuls that security.,50
119,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Yes . Clause 2 of the new agreement reads- 2. (o) Notwithstanding the provisions of clause 12 of the snid agreement made the twenty-third day of July one thousand nine hundred and thirty-seven and the terras of the Deed of Covenant and Charge dated the twentyeighth day of March one thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine registered Number 868 Book 1841 made by the company in favour of the Commonwealth Prime Minister of the Commonwealth shall have power to release without any considers tion the lands described in the schedule from the provisions of clause 12 of the said agreement and of the said Deed of Covenant and Charge to the intent that such lands shall cease to be comprised in or subject to such Deed of Covenant and Charge and the Prime Minister may deliver up to the company all documents of title to any of the said lands. (&) Notwithstanding the provisions of clause move12 of the said agreement made the twenty-third day of July one thousand nine, hundred and thirty-seven and the terms of the Deed Covenant and Charge dated the twenty-eighth day of March one thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine registered Number 809 Book 1841 made 'by the company in favour of the State the Premier of the State shall have power release without any consideration the lands described in the schedule hereto from the visions of clause 12 of the said agreement of the said Deed of Covenant and Charge to the intent that such lands shall cease to be comprised in or subject to such Deed of Covenant and Charrre and the Premier may deliver to the company all documents of title to any of the said lands. That completely annuls the security which this Government has held against the advances made hy it to the company, in respect of, not. only bona fide operaBeasley) tions; but, also interest payments. WP maintain that the Commonwealth should already been prepared. retain its interest in this land which, the venture develops, is bound to become more valuable. If the Commonwealth relinquishes control to the State, it impose the necessary conditions in agreement, but that does not seem to intended. If the land is auctioned, some of the sites will fetch more than others, and we should like' to know who will finally obtain possession of the land. ""We of do not want it to pass into the hands of speculators who will be in a position to levy toll on the workers in that district. Has the National O i l Proprietary Limited asked for this change? No reason for it was advanced by the Minister in his second reading speech. My concern is to ensure that the workers' title in their homes will not be disturbed by some one whose only interest in the venture is to reap profits. The primary object of this development is to obtain oil, and in this the part played by the employees will perhaps be more important than that played by capital. If the Commonwealth retains its interest in the land it will be in a position to compel the company to honour the its undertakings, and to meet its commitments and not drive the workers off the hereto field by taking possession of the land upon which their homes will be erected. The Government, moreover, will be able to ensure that the workers will never be forced to abandon their homes, and lose their equity in them, at the whim of a proprietary company. Therefore, 1 That all the words after "" That"" be omitted of with a view to insert in lieu thereof:"" this House .is of the opinion that the bill should be withdrawn so that the agreement therein referred to may be reconsidered with the object of ensuring that the securities now to held by the Commonwealth over the National Oil Proprietary Limited's land shall not be prosurrendered until a proper scheme has been and devised for the housing of its employees.""",50
120,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Eawkner-Assistant M in up ister for Supply and Development) [8.22]. - I think I can clear up most of the difficulties which - are troubling honourable members. The Government is not prepared to accept the amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr . because a comprehensive scheme of settlement on the land in question has It is of great as importance that the measure should be put through Parliament as soon as possible, so that the work may he proceeded should with. The honourable member for West the Sydney has stated that the Commonbe wealth is surrendering one part of the security it possesses for the advance which it has agreed to make to National Oil Proprietary Limited. According to that agreement, we undertook to advance Â£330,000, and as part of the security we have a lien, in common with the Government of New South Wales, over the assets, of the company. As the honourable member has pointed out, one of the assets is an area of 120 acres of land which has now been transferred by the company to the Government of New South Wales. The honourable member suggests that this is likely to be the most valuable of the securities, and that the Commonwealth is making a real sacrifice of its security by permitting the transfer to take place. I have two answers to that. The first is that, after all, the transfer is being made to a State Government. If it is a concession to agree to the transfer, the cession is in favour of the Government of the State which is primarily interested in the development of the project. My other answer is that the land was purchased for approximately Â£9 an acre, which represents a total outlay of a little more than Â£1,000.",50
121,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,But its value will alter materially as development progresses.,51
122,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"It is suggested that the value of the land will increase considerably. If that is so, it means this: Mr. Davis is in one breath accused by the honourable member of entering into an arrangement with Concrete Constructions Limited that will menace the investment of the Commonwealth; in the next breath it is stated that he is making a most generous gift of land which, according to the honourable member for West Sydney, will be of great value as time goes on. This gesture by Mr Davis is, in that case, a 'most generous one, and the Commonwealth is prepared .to assist him to be generous by not maintaining its own position at the expense of the Government of New South Wales. As for the arrangement with Concrete Constructions Limited to do certain work at cost, plus 10 per cent., I point out that the advance made by the Commonwealth is not ih .the nature of an investment in the company, hut is a loan at 4Â£ per cent, interest. Consequently, if Mr Davis has made an arrangement that will react unfavorably against the company, it will affect first only the company's dividends, and not necessarily the return to the Commonwealth on its advance. . The purpose of the honourable member in moving his amendment is, I presume, to ensure that a proper scheme of townplanning is devised and enforced, and that the rights of employees in their house properties are not endangered because of lack of proper supervision by the authorities concerned. The Government of New South Wales is the authority directly concerned with the administration of this township, and with the provision of proper facilities. The Commonwealth Government has no power over local governing bodies, save, perhaps, what authority it might exercise through its wartime emergency legislation. The con- Government of New South Wales has gone to a great deal of trouble to ensure that, this town is properly planned. It has appointed the Surveyor-General of the State to preside over the committee which has the woTk of planning in hand. The plans are at an advanced stage, and it is proposed to conduct an auction of some of the land on next Boxing Day. I come now to the substance of the complaint that the Governments concerned have not exercised proper supervision. In this connection I draw the attention of honourable members to some of the provisions of an act recently passed by the legislature of New South Wales.",51
123,Mr JAMES,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,Why were we not supplied with copies of that legislation?,51
124,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Copie s of it have not yet reached the Parliamentary Library, as they have not been circulated by the Government of New South Wales, but as I have already informed the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), who is the official spokesman for the Opposition in this matter, I am prepared to make available to him the copy in my possession. Under section 16 of the New South Wales act it is provided that the Minister may lease any land. That point was raised by the honourable member foT Hunter, who contended that the employee should have the right to lease land without necessarily having to purchase it. The section referred to contains the following words: "" subject to such reservations and conditions and for such term as he may think fit"". It goes on to make provision, as to how the conditions of the lease are to be exercised, subject to the supervision of the Minister. Under section 17, power is given to the Minister to sell any of the land acquired by him under the act to any person upon such terms and conditions as he may think fit. It also prescribes some of the conditions, one of them being that the land shall not be subdivided without the consent in writing of the Minister. Another condition is that buildings only of a specified character or class shall be erected on the land, and that they shall be erected within a specified time. The Minister is given power to impose any condition which he considers necessary for the carrying out of the objects and purposes of the act. So far as the protection of employees is concerned, I point out that, under the proposed arrangement, the company is prepared to make deposits available to its employees in order to enable them to acquire land.",51
125,Mr JAMES,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"It will want security and interest, and eventually it will get possession of the land like J. and A. Brown Limited has done.",52
126,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"The only deposit required is 10 per cent, of the value of the land. The rest of the finance will be arranged, I am advised, through the Credit Foncier section of the Rural Bank. By section 25 of the act, the Minister may remit any part of the amount due under any contract for the sale of land, or extend the period for the payment of any interest or purchase money. Honourable members will see that substantial protection is to be given to the purchasers of the land. The Minister will be in a position either to remit any part of the amount owing, or to extend the period provided in the contract for the payment of the purchase money. The responsibility devolves upon the State Government which is primarily interested.",52
127,Mr RIORDAN,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,Why should the State Government sell the land at all?,52
128,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"That Government is not compelled to sell the land; if it so desires it can dispose of the land under lease. T assure the House that the details of this project have been carefully worked out. As was stated in the legislature of New South Wales, this project represents an important and interesting experiment on the part of the Government of New South Wales, in conjunction with the company. It is an attempt to provide a model township at Glen Davis, so ihat the workers there may live under decent conditions. At this moment, the Commonwealth Government is negotiating with Mr Davis with a view to increasing the output of the company from 10,000,000 gallons to 30,000,000 gallons per annum. That increased output should cause an expansion of the township and also of employment.",52
129,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,Did the company ask to be relieved of this security?,52
130,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"If the company had regarded the transaction merely from a cold commercial point of view, it would not have asked to be relieved of an asset which is likely to increase in value.",52
131,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,Did it ask to be relieved of its commitments under Article 12 of the original agreement?,52
132,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"It s commitments will not be lessened. The security will be transferred to one of the creditor parties, namely, the State Government, which shared in the lien which was to be exercised jointly by it and the Commonwealth Government. Under the original measure covering the tripartite agreement between the Commonwealth Government, the State Government, and National Oil Proprietary Limited, the Commonwealth Government advanced certain money to the company at 4Â£ per cent, on the security of the company's assets. That was provided for in the bill which came before this House. To the extent that the company will transfer to the State Government 120 acres of land which ""it formerly owned, the arrangement entered into will be varied, and, in order to put the transaction in order, it is necessary for this Parliament to approve formally of the transfer of the land from the company to the Government of New South Wales. That is all that this measure proposes lo do, and that is the only reason for bringing this proposal before the House at the present time.",52
133,Mr LAZZARINI,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Werriwa) [8.38] I refuse to accept the statementof the Assistant Minister (Mr Holt) that a generous spirit has been exhibited by thi? company, or, indeed, any similar company in the treatment of its employees. ""We have heard similar stories on numerous occasions. I remember that when a company at Port Kembla set out to establish a home-endowment scheme for its employees, I told one of its members that it would build homes for some of its employees, but not all of them. I had with me one of the company's employees who was active in the industrial sphere, and I said, "" Would you build a home for Pat Molloy?"". The answer was, ""Certainly not"". It is the custom in Britain and in many other countries for the workers to be housed near to their work, and to be given an interest in their homes. That system is also in operation in the United States of America, where it is used as an economic weapon to discourage workers from participating in industrial disputes. Expressed plainly and bluntly, it is a means adopted by employers to keep around them a number of potential "" scabs "". I am suspicious of this project, because of my experience and of what I have read of the measures taken by huge companies to protect their own interests under the guise of making "" generous gestures"" to their employees. There must have been some reason why the Government accepted this land as security in the first place. We are told now that it is worth only about Â£1,000. If that be so, why was it thought advisable to accept it as security? I do not like people who buy land by the acre and sell it by the foot. On the other side of the chamber are men who have made large sums of money in that way. One of them is a member of the Cabinet. This company will make advances to its employees in order that they may build homes. It will probably happen that some of them will have partly paid for their homes when sickness or trouble overtakes them, with the result that they will lose their homes. That kind of thing has happened too often. Few workers who set out to buy homes under such conditions ever own them. If the Government really wants to provide homes for the workers, it should utilize, the resources of the Commonwealth Bank and build homes for them, free of interest. Only by such means will the workers have a chance tb own their homes. Under these endowment schemes a man who sets out to purchase a home costing Â£1,000 may pay Â£2,000 or even more, and still not own it. I am afraid that that will happen in this instance. As the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) said, the company will eventually own all of the homes, and the workers in them as well. Why cannot the company direct that homes may be built on leasehold land as in the Australian Capital Territory? Under the leasehold system, a man with Â£50 or Â£100 can build a home, whereas when a land boom is on it takes that much to buy the land. There has 'been more cheating of the workers under homeendowment schemes than perhaps in any other way, and I hope that the Government will not encourage the introduction of that vicious system. I frankly confess that I am suspicious of the whole thing. When this land is handed over to the State Government the Commonwealth will lose its asset. We know the attitude of the present Government of New South Wales towards big companies. It has given away to them State assets worth thousands of pounds, and it will do the same with this land. The Mair-Bruxner Government will do with this land what the Stevens Government did with the State brickworks, metal quarries, and other assets. I regard this as a "" land-boodling"" scheme to enable the company to make money out of its employees. The company proposes to start a home-endowment scheme so that it may hold over every home purchaser the threat, ""Go to work, or lose your equity in your home"". If industrial trouble should occur at Glen Davis in the future, the miners living in these homes might be treated as the coal-miners were treated in parts of England years ago. We have all read, I suppose, of mothers and children being turned out of their homes into the street by the owners of their dwelling houses who took this means to try to force the bread-winners to terms. In days gone by, sick mothers and children have actually been carried out into the street in their beds in the hope that this action would break the spirit of the miners when a strike was in progress. We do not want conditions of that kind to be developed here. I am suspicious of this scheme and shall support the amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley). This project should not be hurried. The Government should be prepared to bring , down a properly-planned and complete scheme that would ensure adequate protection of the interests of the workers. There is no need for haste; but it seems that on every occasion when the Government is rushing into recess, it must bring down a bill of this description and, on the plea of urgency, rush us into doing something which, if proper consideration were given to it, would not be done. It has been said that the Government is concerned about the interests of the workers. Has it shown any interest in the welfare of the unemployed workers? Not even the approach of Christmas has awakened such interest in Ministers opposite ",52
134,Mr SPEAKER,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,Hon. G. J. Bell) The honourable member must confine his remarks to the subject before the Chair.,54
135,Mr LAZZARINI,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Apparentl y the Government and its supporters wish to place the Opposition in a false position, but we and they know that our objective is solely in the interests of the workers. If a proper scheme is introduced it will have our support.",54
136,Mr NOCK,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Riverina) [8.48] - I support the bill. It is clear, surely, a properly-planned town is desirable Glen Davis. In my opinion, the proper authority to ensure that a suitable town shall be built is the State a Government. Let honourable members who are opposing this bill look, for a moment or two, at the alternative. I the measure is not passed, the land will remain the property of Mr Davis, who will, himself, be able to build such homes as he wishes on the site. It is quite likely that homes built by a private individual will not be of the same standard as homes built under government supervision. Surely also it clear that it is desirable that there should be only one mortgage over the properties. I can see no reason for objecting to the mortgagee being the Government of New land shall be auctioned. South Wales. The workers would unscheme, doubtedly get a fair deal from that authority. There is everything to be said in favour of allowing the workers to own their own homes in this proposed of new settlement. Regulations would undoubtedly be promulgated by the Government of New South Wales which would ensure proper conditions. I strongly favour the adoption of the Government's plan in preference to one which would permit the whole project to remain under the control of a private individual or a company. As the land was bought for about Â£10 an acre originally, the elimination of the area that will be involved in this town-planning scheme is not a very material factor in the security of the Commonwealth and State Governments, for it is only a trifle in the total security. In any case, the Commonwealth Government has only a mortgage interest in the land. If the Newnes shale oil-fields deposits are developed as successfully as we hope they will be, the value of this land will increase and the workers who own the homes will benefit thereby. In all the circumstances, I shall support the bill.",54
137,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Melbourne Ports) [8.51] - If the proposal were as the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Nock) has described it, I should not offer much objection to it, but he has not directed attention to all of the facts. I know something of the history of the building of mining towns in Australia. On some of that the richest mining fields of Australia, at which have been developed for many years, miners are still living in shacks built mainly of kerosene tins. That is disgrace to the authorities responsible for it. If it were proposed that modern homes should be built under modern conf ditions at Glen Davis no one would offer any objection to the scheme. The trouble is that room is being left for the exploiter to exercise his guiles. I do not think that any honourable member has offered any objection to the principle of the construction of homes for workers in close proximity to their work. In every State is there is a clamour for workers' homes to he built. The trouble is .that the conditions of this scheme are contradictory. I strongly object to the proposal that the Under that the'company, or some speculative interests, might buy all the blocks and thus put a stranglehold on the settlement at its very inception. The blocks will, course, go to the highest bidder if they . are auctioned, and the old and objectionable system of private landlords will be inflicted on this new settlement. I suggest to the Government that it should evolve a scheme similar to that at Yallourn in Victoria. Years ago, the Victorian Government was in much the same position in respect of the Yallourn district as the Commonwealth Government and the Government of New South Wales are in in respect of Glen Davis. The Victorian Government had decided to exploit the brown coal deposits of Yallourn. But instead of offering land for sale in the proposed town site, it took responsibility itself for the whole scheme. It prepared the plan, surveyed the land, provided all the essential services, and built the homes which were afterwards let to tenants. The properties remain in the possession of the State Government. That, I suggest, is a very good scheme which could well be copied at Glen Davis. I do not think any honourable member desires to adopt the dog-in-ithe-m anger attitude and say that this Government should not, in any circumstances, refuse to allow the Government of New South Wales to do what is necessary to provide modern homes for the workers at Glen Davis. What we wish to do is to prevent the speculator from entrenching himself in the new town. If the Government would prepare the plan and build houses, the workers, could become tenants of the Government.",54
138,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"The State Government has already arranged to spend about Â£40,000 in laying out the site and providing the necessary services.",55
139,Mr HOLLOWAY,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"In that case I see no reason at all why it should not go further and build the homes. I see grave objection to allowing private speculators to come in and reap the advantage that must accrue, in such a place, for the expenditure of so much public money in town-planning. If the land increases in value, as it is sure to do if this scheme develops as we hope it will, the Government should reap the benefit, and not the private speculator. If the hope that the production of fuel oil from this field will increase from 10,000,000 gallons to 30,000,000 gallons a year is realized, the town allotments will certainly treble in value. A ll these consider a[40] tions reinforce my argument that the Government itself should assume complete responsibility for the whole scheme. That would ensure that slum areas would not be developed. There is always a temptation .to private speculators to make as much profit as possible out of schemes of this kind. If the Government takes charge such temptations will be resisted to a large extent, if not altogether. No doubt Mr Davis himself desires to see a pleasant and modern town built at Glen Davis. This ideal will be more likely to be realized if the Government is responsible for the operations. I urge that the Yallourn scheme be looked to as a. model. The job of building the town of .Glen Davis should be undertaken properly; the whole operation should be under Government control, and the dwellings should remain Government property.",55
140,Mr LANE,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Barton) [S.58] - I am surprised that honourable members of the Opposition should be placing so many obstacles in the way of the carrying out of this scheme. They say they represent the workers, but they are not representing them in the truest sense by the stand they are taking up to-night. The Government's scheme should be endorsed, for it undoubtedly provides for full cooperation between the parties concerned, and will permit of the construction of a properly-planned town, such as should be provided in such an area. I have had the pleasure of visiting the Newnes works on three occasions. The first time. I went there I discovered that considerable dissatisfaction existed amongst the employees of the co-operative company which was then engaged in the production of oil. I was informed by one of the men in charge of the works that agitators who came from the city had induced the men to limit the number of skips which they handled each day. The effect of this slowing down process was to so restrict production that it became impossible to produce oil in payable quantities. The New South Wales Government subsequently withdrew its support of the project, and the works were closed. On my second visit I was accompanied by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr John Lawson). On that occasion . I warned the workers not to allow themselves to be made the tools of certain unscrupulous organizers. I pointed out that the future of the project lay in the willingness of the average Australian worker to do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay, and that those who allowed themselves to be led astray by unscrupulous agitators could contribute nothing to the success of a venture such as this. I told them that more harm would be done to this enterprise by such people than by the major oil companies which they professed to fear so much.",55
141,Mr WARD,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,I warned the workers at Newnes what to expect from the honourable member before he went there.,56
142,Mr LANE,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"If I had my way, the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward) would not be alloAved in Glen Davis. Honourable members opposite have stressed the need for Government control of the sales of land in the township. . In this connection we have only to remember that the present leasehold system adopted in the Australian Capital Territory has reflected no great credit on the Government. I believe that the Government should do everything possible to encourage the workers to own their own homes, aud the scheme proposed for the bousing of the workers at Glen Davis has much in its favour provided that the homes do not prove too expensive. I do not believe that any working man can afford to purchase a home costing more than from Â£500 to Â£600. I commend the Queensland Government for its excellent home-building scheme. During an extensive tour through Queensland I inspected, a number of houses provided under the Government housing scheme. One of the greatest difficulties with that scheme was that the Queensland Government asked working men to take over properties costing Â£1,000 for which the payments in respect of principal and interest were too high. If a worker on the basic wage is purchasing his own home and has the misfortune to be out of employment forthree months, he is immediately in great difficulties. His difficulties are, of course, greatly increased if the rate of repayment is high. Let us consider, for instance, the difficulties associated with the administration of war service homes. Here,, we have perhaps the best example of government mismanagement of a housing scheme. If I had my way, I would write down the value of every one of those homes, and put it within the power - of returned soldier purchasers to repay the whole amount owing on their homes within ten years. The only fault I find with the scheme for the housing of workers at Glen Davis is that it is proposed that the repayments be spread over a period of twenty years. I cannot understand why honourable members opposite should put obstacles in the way of the development of this important industry. If they had the interests of the workers seriously at heart, they would assist honourable members on this side of the House to give the bill a speedy passage.",56
143,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,The company cannot get sufficient plant to enter into immediate production on a large scale.,56
144,Mr LANE,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,I believe that the difficulty in connection with plant is largely a matter of finance.,56
145,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,That is not so.,56
146,Mr LANE,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"I am informed that Mr. Davis went to Great Britain twelve months ago in order to acquire the necessary plant. I appeal to honourable members to disregard the remarks of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini). The honourable member has merely repeated the statements of disgruntled people outside this Parliament. The workers at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, and at the factory of the Davis Gelatine Company at Waterloo speak highly of Mr Davis. He is regarded as a captain of industry, capable of handling this large venture with profit, not only to himself, but also to the associated workers engaged in it.",56
147,Mr GANDER,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,Is the honourable member in favour of the establishment of a wine bar at Glen Davis?,56
148,Mr LANE,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"If a wine bar is established there, I certainly would not be in favour of allowing the honourable member to have anything to do with it. He is the wrong sort of person to go into a wine bar. Nor would I grant to his colleague, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), a licence to run the "" pub"". I am sorry that the question of the liquor licence has been introduced into this debate. In my opinion all hotels should be under the control of the Government. Mr SPEAKER,-Order !",56
149,Mr LANE,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"I believe that the establishment of a hotel at Glen Davis will only result in great disaster into many homes in the locality. I sincerely hope that the conduct of an "" annexe"" such as this will not be left to private enterprise. Here is an opportunity for the State Government to have a "" go "" at the role of hotel keeper. If the hotel at Glen Davis were conducted by the Government much would be done to curb the rapacity of unscrupulous private individuals who batten on the workmen and fleece them of their hard-earned wages, and whose activities result in needless poverty in many homes.",57
150,Mr SPEAKER,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,The honourable member must either discuss the bill or resume his seat.,57
151,Mr LANE,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"I trust that this bill will be passed in its original form, and that the amendment will receive the consideration it merits. I do not believe that honourable membei's opposite seriously desire to hold up the development of this important industry. At heart I am sure they are just as anxious as we are to see the workers at Glen Davis settled in their own homes and given an opportunity to live a normal, useful life. The result of their labours will be of great benefit in the development of this country. Nothing is more needed in Australia than a permanent supply of oil, and it is the earnest wish of every Australian that this industry should be established on a sound footing. .I am surprised that the honourable member for Hunter should have placed every obstacle in the way of the passage of this bill.",57
152,Mr JAMES,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,I have not done so.,57
153,Mr LANE,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"I trust that the members of the Labour party, recognizing in this bill an opportunity for the successful establishment of a great Australian industry, will expedite its passage.",57
154,Mr JAMES,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Hunter) [9.12] - I wish to speak to the amendment. I am at a loss to understand the statement of the honourable member for Barton (Mr. Lane) that the members of the Labour party and I , in particular, have placed every obstacle in the way of the speedy passage of this bill. That is not so. Thi3 bill is designed to supplement legislation which has already been passed by the New South Wales Government. Under the covenant contained in the schedule of the original act, the New South Wales Government held what, may be termed ""protection"", by way of mortgage over the land which originally belonged to Mr Davis. By the passage of this bill we renounce that mortgage. The honourable member for Barton referred to the granting of a liquor licence at Glen Davis.",57
155,Mr SPEAKER,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,There is nothing in the amendment about the granting of a liquor licence.,57
156,Mr JAMES,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"This Government has a lien by way of mortgage upon the land on which the hotel may be built, but in spite of that, a liquor licence has already been granted by the New South Wales Government Liquor Licensing Board.",57
157,Mr SPEAKER,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,Order! The honourable member is replying to the remarks made by the honourable member for Barton who was speaking on the bill. The honourable member has already spoken on the bill and is now dealing with the' amendment which does not cover the question of the establishment of a hotel.,57
158,Mr JAMES,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"I claim, Mr Speaker, that I am in order in referring to this matter, because the Minister, when replying to the amendment moved by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley), referred to section 29 of the State legislation which empowers the responsible New South Wales Minister to override a decision of the State Licensing Board in connection with the granting of a further licence at Glen Davis. I submit also that I am entitled to discuss the matter of the granting of a hotel licence because the Commonwealth Government holds a lien over the land on which the hotel will be erected.",57
159,Mr SPEAKER,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,The amendment does not refer to a liquor licence; it refers only to housing.,57
160,Mr JAMES,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Hotel s erected in mining communities provide housing accommodation for single men. The licence has been transferred to Glen Davis by William Lee, the licensee of the Mount Victoria Hotel. Prior to that, according to the debate in the Parliament of New South Wales, Mr Davis had promised Mr Lee that, if he secured a licence, he would be given every protection against the granting of other licences. Under clause 29 of the New South Wales act, the State Minister, Mr Martin, has sions of the State act. absolute power to reject any application for a hotel licence at Glen Davis.

170,Mr JAMES,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"In his reply to the case "" applisubmitted by myself and amplified by in the honourable member for West Sydney, new the Assistant Minister (Mr Holt) did not answer the question that I raised in regard to housing. The Comthe bounmonwealth Government has expended millions of pounds on the establishment of in annexes to private industries for the purpose of building implements for the destruction of human life, including aeroplanes, which will be absolutely useless without oil fuel. Since the products of Oil Proprietary Limited are to the effective defence of Australia, I ask the Government why it does not build another form of annexe by erecting homes for the workers who are producing this commodity.",58
171,Mr SPEAKER,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Ha d the Assistant Minister answered that part of the honourable member's speech I should have called him to order, because he was then speaking only to the amendment. He can reply to the second-reading debate at a later",58
172,Mr JAMES,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"The Assistant Minister said that the company, which had paid at Â£9 an acre for the land, had very generously offered it to the State. But the Commonwealth has an interest of Â£334,000 in that land as a security, and under this proposal, it is relinquishing that security. According to the Assistant Minister, Mr Davis is going to be genermonoous and make an advance to the home; but he will not make an advance without obtaining some interest-bearing security, and that security will the title deeds of the homebuilders with the prevailing rate of interest. As time goes on, this mining the village will go down, and I have have seen others go down, until ultithe workers will be in intermittent employment only and will be unable to maintain their payments. Then Mr Davis will be able to foreclose on his mortgages. It will merely be a repetition of what happened in the township of Minmi, the whole of which was acquired by J. arid A. Brown. The right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) visited that township where that firm showed the kind of ""generosity"" that Mr Davis proposes, and he will be able to support my statement. That ""generosity"" turned out to be merely a wise business transaction. The shale-oil industry at Glen Davis will not last for more than 30 years. The lownsliip will then become a nice little tourist resort in the mountains, and for that reason will be very valuable but not to workers. That is unfair. The proposed amendment provides that the land, upon which the Commonwealth has a lien, will not be exploited in order that Mr Davis, who professes to be a philanthropist, may enrich himself. In the district from which I come there arc thousands of acres of land surrounding the mines, which is not worth more than 2s. an acre. If "" it were cut up into town sites, however, it would be worth a great deal more. It is in that way that National Oil Proprietary Limited is now trying to enhance the value of its own property at the expense of both the State of New South ""Wales and the Commonwealth. It proposes to give the land away for the time being, but ultimately it will get it back when the workers are unable to meet their mortgage payments. The State Government, which has put Â£166,000 into the project, proposes to sell the land. It will be bought first by speculators, not by the workers. The workers cannot afford to compete at auction sales with the speculator, but ultimately will accept the speculator's sale terms. As the result of this sale the State Government will get back the money that it has invested. But what protection is provided in this measure for the Commonwealth's investment? The Commonwealth has provided more than four-fifths df the money invested when the road we are building into the area is included in our original investments.",58
173,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"The Commonwealth get 4Â£ per cent, on its investment.",59
174,Mr JAMES,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"What is .the Commonvalue wealth getting for the 30-mile strategical road, costing more than Â£70,000, which will provide a highway to those sites?",59
175,Mr SPEAKER,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,iTh e honourable member's remarks have nothing to do with the amendment.,59
176,Mr JAMES,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Altogethe r the Commonwealth has put approximately Â£400,000 into this venture. At election times members of the Government and their supporters talk about the welfare of the working class and tell the people that they will provide a proper housing scheme for the poor unfortunate workers. But when the chickens come home to roost, and those honourable gentlemen are returned to office, they do not redeem their promises. This amendment provides them with an opportunity to do so by building homes at Glen Davis as annexes to an important industry that will supply fuel for the machines of war which are necessary for the defence of Australia. If it is good enough for private enterprise to undertake this project, let us hold on to this land and build homes for the workers.",59
177,Mr ROSEVEAR,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,Dalley) [9.30] The Commonwealth and State Governments are engaged in a very interesting transaction with the National Oil Proprietary Limited.,59
178,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,This proposal has the unanimous support of the Labour party of New South Wales.,59
179,Mr ROSEVEAR,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"I am not concerned about that. I am concerned with a few aspects which may have been overlooked, even by the Labour party of New South Wales. The interesting aspect of this is that the National Oil Proprietary Limited, in spite of all of the wonderful inducements that were held out to it, would not venture upon the extraction of oil from shale without the advance to it by the Commonwealth and State Governments at a low rate of interest of a great sum of money. Yet, before the company has actually reached the stage of production, it finds itself able to lend money to its employees to enable them to take up will land for the buildine of homes. According to the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Nock), the unimproved of the 120 acres of land entailed in this proposal is only Â£10 an acre. At that valuation, it does not matter home a great deal whether or not the land remains part of the security which the company gave to the Commonwealth and State Governments. The amount of Â£1,200 is little in a. total advance of Â£500,000 by the Commonwealth and State Governments to the company. The proposal is that the Government of New South Wales shall expend Â£40,000 on improvements to this land, which was originally worth Â£1,200. The land will then be subdivided and sold to the highest bidder. That is where this party joins issue with the Commonwealth and State Governments. We believe that, if the real purpose of this scheme is to provide a township of decent homes at reasonable rentals for the mostly unskilled and basic-wage workers, the objective of the Governments should be to make the land available at the cheapest possible rate, so that the workers will be able to take up the land. My contention is that, in order to prevent speculators from cornering this land, there should be a leasehold system under which no person would be able to take up more than one block.",59
180,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Provisio n has been made for that, except in special circumstances.",60
181,Mr ROSEVEAR,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"No . The Assisincumbent tant Minister read sections of the State act to prove his case, but he failed to do so, because that act provides that the Minister may sell the whole of the land, portion of it, or lease it, in whole or in part.",60
182,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,I shall quote what the governments. State Minister said.,60
183,Mr ROSEVEAR,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"There is no provision in the State legislation to prevent speculators from taking up the whole the blocks.' The Government of New South Wales cannot move in this matter unless this Parliament passes this bill. barons. We, therefore, have some say. If , in respect of this land, the Government of New South Wales were to operate a leaseas hold system, which would prevent anyduce body from purchasing the whole of the blocks, there would be this advantage: If any lessee wished to surrender his lease, the State could issue a fresh lease person who did not already hold a Unfortunately, it, is not proposed that. Instead, the land will be offered to the highest bidder. None of the basicthat wage workers will be able to compete with the land speculators. Thus, the disshould he recast. posal by the State of this land by auction will defeat the very objective of cheap homes for the workers, because those land jobbers who purchase blocks will dispose of them later at inflated values. It is probable that this land, which in its unimproved state is worth Â£1,200 and upon which a further Â£40,000 is to be expended on improvements, will, on sale, bring Â£100,000. Who will get the profit? Will it go to the State Government or to the National Oil Proprietary Limited? It would be interesting to have a reply to that, because it is intended that National Oil Proprietary Limited shall become money lenders to its employees. It is said that more than 4,000 people will be housed in the proposed township. I should say that 4,000 people would represent between 1.500 and 2,000 families. Those families will become the immediate victims of the money lender. This company which is "" sacrificing "" its interest in a Â£1,200 block of land, will become the money lender and the security that it will have will be Â£150,000' worth of assets created by government expenditure. I do not see why the Assistant Minister should have felt it upon him to eulcgize the National Oil Proprietary Limited in his second-reading speech, because, after all, that company is sacrificing nothing in comparison with the security it receives for its loans to home builders because of the expenditure of the contracting The honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) drew a parallel between this of proposed new township and townships in the northern coal-fields area which have become the absolute property of the coal The workers at Newnes will find themselves under this plan in the same position many wheat-farmers who cannot proat a profit because of the inflated value of their land, and they will find themselves forced "" to pay fictitious values for the land on a small income. to any Should one of the employee-tenants block. be unable to meet his committo do ments, the money-lending company will be able to realise on the asset he is forced to abandon. Fundamentally, the whole scheme is wrong and",60
184,Mr WARD,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"East Sydney) [9.42] - In ordinary circumstances the Opposition would support any scheme of home purchase for the workers, but there are certain important aspects that must be considered when the proposition concerns housing on a mining-field. The Newnes field will have a limited life, and eventually what has ha.ppened on many other mining-fields will be repeated; the homes that are to be erected will have to be abandoned. The objective of the National Oil Proprietary Limited and the Commonwealth and State Governments is not so much the provision of housing for the employees of that company as the tying of the employees to their work. The honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane) said that it was labour difficulties that had prevented earlier companies from successfully exploiting the shale-oil deposits. 'Those companies could not get workers to remain at the niggardly pay that they offered. But, if a worker has his home near the locality of his employment, there is a greater incentive for him to stay on the job. Moreover, when workers are the tenants of the employer, there is not the same likelihood of an industrial dispute because they will fear to lose their homes along with their employment.",61
185,Mr JAMES,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,And lose the whole their equity.,61
186,Mr WARD,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Yes . The Assistant Minister for Supply and Development (Mr Holt) said that the State Minister would have the right to remit certain payfrom ments or to extend the period of repaysafeguard ment. Judging by experience, when unimproved the workers have engaged in an induselse. trial dispute over working conditions, we may expect an anti-Labour government to that be favourably disposed to the attitude of of the employers. If such a government is in. a position to do so, it will "" apply screw "" to ensure that the workers, under pain of losing their equity in their proto perty, return to work upon the conditions laid down by the employers. We know to that anti-Labour governments have not block, hesitated to expropriate the interest of to the workers in superannuation and homepur cbase schemes in an endeavour force them back to work when an industrial dispute occurs. We should not be precaution prepared to accept the mere statement of the Assistant Minister that the scheme is designed for the benefit of the workers. The Newnes field has only a limited life, and I believe that the best proposition would be for the State Government to build homes for letting to the workers at moderate rentals. Then, in the case of an industrial dispute, the workers could walk off the field without incurring the risk of losing the savings invested in their homes. We should not be carried away by the glib assurances of honourable members opposite that they are anxious only to assist the workers. The mere fact that they have given those assurances should be sufficient to make us view the whole scheme with suspicion.",61
187,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Fawkner - Assistant Minister for Supply and Development) [9.48],-in reply-Some honourable members opposite have claimed that the safeguards against the possible exploitation of the workers under this scheme are not sufficiently strong. I have already referred honourable members to those clauses in the New South Wales act which empower the Minister to exercise rigid supervision over the conditions of sale and lease of land. I shall now quote from the speech of. the Minister who introduced the bill in the New of South Wales Parliament, reported at page 7294, volume 143, of the New South Wales Parliamentary DebatesMr L. O. MARTIN - Yes . The Government realizes the need to prevent speculators swamping out those interested and every is to be taken to prevent speculators from buying and holding - for a rise in the value at the expense of some one The bill also gives power to the Government to attach certain covenants ; > the land, and areas will be sold subject to .i provision the purchaser shall erect a certain type building in a given time, otherwise the land shall revert to the Crown, to which the money the paid - for it shall be forfeited.",61
188,Mr HORSINCTON,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Is there any restriction the number of blocks which a"" person may purchase ? Mr L. 0. MARTIN - An effort will be made prevent persons from buying more than one except in cases in which it is necessary have additional land to carry stores or "" other buildings.",61
189,Mr BADDELEY,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"In which case they would to have to erect big buildings? Mr L. 0. MARTIN-Tlia t is so, and every will be taken to ensure that the wish of the Government is carried out. That is a very clear expression of the determination of the State Government to see that the employees will not be exploited. It has been suggested that the housing scheme should be financed by the State Government. In effect, that is practically what is being done. Mr Davis has undertaken to advance 10 per cent, of the purchase money, representing the deposit on the land, but arrangements are now in train for the balance of the purchase money to be made available by the Credit Foncier department of the Rural Bank.",61
190,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,That seems to indicate that Mr Davis is now financially strong enough to carry on without the help of a Commonwealth Government advance.,62
191,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"I do not think that we would be justified in drawing that conclusion. In any case, if the scheme is as good as honourable members suggest, the Commonwealth will obtain a return on its money in excess of the interest it has itself to pay. The Commonwealth, in those circumstances, should have no desire to be relieved of the need to make the advance. A lot of unjustifiable criticism has been directed against Mr Davis. . It has been suggested that he will be in a much stronger position as the mortgagee who has advanced money .on the land than if he had not transferred the land at all. I point out, however, that the Government of New South Wales, and, indeed, all the members of the Parliament of New South Wales, made it clear that they appreciated the generous action of Mr Davis in transferring the land, and the Commonwealth Government has no hesitation in endorsing that appreciation. Very few men would be prepared to transfer land which, on the admission of honourable members opposite, is likely to increase considerably in value. In addition, Mr Davis' has indicated his readiness to advance money to his employees to pay the necessary deposits on the purchase of the land. I feel confident that the Government of New South Wales car be relied upon to prevent the exploitation of the workers. I trust that the House will not divide on this question, but will exhibit the same unanimity in regard to this important industrial and social undertaking as did the State legislature of New South Wales.",62

This is a purely formal amendment which is consequential on the modification of the principal agreementmade hy the clause 1 a of the amending agreement proposed to be approved by the bill. That clause of the amending agreement provides, in. effect, that any reference to land in the principal agreement shall be read as a reference to the land specified in that agreement but excluding the land prescribed in the first part of the schedule to the amending agreement. In the National Oil Proprietary Limited Agreement Act 1937 there are two provisions in relation to the lands specified in the principal agreement. In view of the variation of that agreement, it is desirable that the act of 1937 should be read as if the reference to lands therein were a reference to the lands now covered by the principal agreement, as raried. The the land. proposed new clause has been prepared to give effect to this, objective. Proposed new clause agreed to. Schedule.",63
195,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"West Sydney) [10.8J. single blocks. - The Assistant Minister for Supply and Development (Mr Holt) did not fully reply to the criticism levelled against schedule. Clause 2 a of the proposed agreement deals with the surrender the right of the Commonwealth Governwould ment to hold this land as security. The Assistant Minister said that the attitude of the company in forfeiting this land generous, and that the legislature of New South Wales had expressed its appreciahad tion of that generosity. I understand that, at the moment, the land in question is the property of the company.",63
196,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,That is so.,63
197,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"It is the property of the company only insofar as to provide security for assistance rendered to the company by the Governments of the Commonwealth and New South Wales. That is to say, although the land is the property of the company, the company is not free to dispose of it as'the company may think fit.",63
198,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,That is so.,63
199,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"In other words, the land is tied up, and therefore the Minister's statement relating to the generosity of the company is without foundation. On examination, the proposal of the company is purely a business one. The company desires to free the land from the lien which the Commonwealth Government has upon it. At the moment, the land is not free, but it is proposed to free it and to transfer it to the Government of New South Wales, for auctionby the State, probably in order that the company may buy it back again, free of any lien. Notwithstanding that, the State Government proposes to exj>end Â£40,000 on improving the property. In its present condition, the land is worth, perhaps, Â£9 an acre, but, after the State Government has expended Â£40,000 on improvements, and when it is free from lien, it will be worth much more. It will be seen, therefore, that the company, instead of being generous, is making a good business deal.",63
200,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,It might be if it bought,63
201,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,What is to stop it from buying the land?,63
202,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,The Government of New South Wales says that it will sell only,63
203,Mr BEASLEY,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"The Assistant Minister said that the Government the of New South Wales expressed a wish to that effect, but he proof duced no evidence to prove that it act in that way. And even if that point were covered, there would be nothing to prevent the company from securing was the most valuable sites, which would greatly appreciate in value after Â£40,000 been expended in providing roads, sewerage, and other improvements. The Government of New South Wales, it. is stated, will not expend that money while the Commonwealth Government retains its lien upon the land. I repeat that the proposal of the company is not generous; it is, in fact, a shrewd business deal in its own interests and, I admit, no one can complain about the company making the best deal it can in its own interests. It is this kind of generosity that is so frequently exhibited by men like those who have been appointed to the various advisory panels associated with the Defence Department. They are not so generous as some would have them appear to be. I do not want to be one to fall for such things. It is not a generous offer, but is a business deal, and I am happy to know that the Opposition has not fallen for it in the way the Minister presented the case. Whatever may have happened in the State Parliament, the Opposition in this Parliament will oppose the proposal contained in this bill. It may be that the workers who occupy these homes will have roofs over their heads, but the land will begin to slip away from them from the moment that they take possession of their homes if tliese conditions are allowed to prevail.",63
204,Mr ROSEVEAR,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Dalley) [10.9] - I do not think that the Assistant Minister for Supply and Development (Mr Holt) should expect the committee to pass the schedule without some further explanation. Section 12 of the original agreement refers to the assets of this company in the following terms:Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement contained before any advance is made by the. Commonwealth or the State to the Company the Company shall execute and deliver to each of them the Commonwealth and the State as security for the advances to be made by ' it and interest thereon a Deed of Covenant and Charge in accordance with the form contained in the Second Schedule hereto with such tions modifications and additions as the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the Premier of the State and the Company consider necessary or desirable and so that the said Deeds of Covenant and Charge shall rank pari passu as a first charge on the property and assets of the Company comprised therein or subject thereto without any preference or priority one over the other. Por the money which they lent to' the company, the Commonwealth and State Governments have an equal share in the lien over the company's assets, which were tendered as security. ' It would appear that the bone of contention is in clause 2 of the proposed agreement, wherein it is provided that the Prime Minister and the Premier of New South Wales shall deliver to the company all documents of title to any of this land. According to the measure before us, all claims by the governments concerned to this property are immediately to be abandoned to the company. I wish to know by what means the Government of New South Wales will recover its right to the property. The Minister should explain whether it is merely a legal transaction between the company and the Government of New South Wales or whether it is something which requires special legislation. I wish to know also at what date the company proposes to abandon its claim to this property. Will it do so before Â£40,000 is expended on improvements by the Government of New South Wales or after those improvements have been completed ? Should the company not abandon its claim to the property until the improvements have been effected, will it be entitled to any rebate from the Commonwealth or the State in respect of the "" sacrifice "" that it will make ? I make that point for the reason that if the company hands over the property now, all that it could expect in return would be its value, which is Â£1,200; but if it retains the land until after improvements costing Â£40,000 have been effected, the position might be entirely different. There is no provision in this bill-and it might be that such a provision should not rightly be placed in it-requirin g the company to hand over the property immediately the lien upon it is removed. I hope that the Minister will inform the House as to what plan the governments concerned have in mind for the variadisposal of any surplus which might arise from the sale of the property. Will any such surplus be shared equally by the two governments, or will special consideration be given to the company? The Assistant Minister should make it quite clear that if the lien on this property is removed there will be no hindrance to an immediate transfer of the land to the State Government.  have listened with interest to the speeches of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) and the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) and I endorse their request that the position im regard to this property be clarified. We should know exactly what we are doing.",64
205,Mr NOCK,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Riverina) [10.14] - In connection with any collateral security it is not unusual for a release of security on adjustment of the advance or some other condition to be arranged between mortgagees and mortgagors. I do not tli ink there is anything unreasonable in the proposition before us. It is purely a business deal such as is frequently made in connection with collateral security. It should be recognized that if this land were not transferred to the State Government Mr Davis himself could do what is now proposed. He could build houses or shops or in fact do anything that an owner of land may do with his land, but he could not give workers a clear title to the blocks unless it is released from the Government mortgage. I can see no reason why the Labour party should object to the procedure that is being adopted. When an owner of land erects buildings on it he is entitled to draw the rentals. As a matter of fact Mr Davis is not on a bad wicket, but I have no doubt that he, like the Government of New South Wales, is interested in the building of a-typical model town on this site. He, as well as the Government, desires to see a better town than is usual in mining settlements. It is for this reason that the Government has taken action. The conditions provided in the State act counteract speculation, and make it clear that the kind of buildings to be erected and also the general terms and time limit for erecting buildings in connection with the whole matter shall be subject to regulation. I have no doubt at all that the State Government has ideals which it would like to see expressed at Glen Davis. The very fact that only one block of land will be sold to each person, except where, say, a big store is to be erected, shows that the matter has been given careful consideration. I can sec no reason why the proposal should not to he endorsed.",65
206,Mr BLAIN,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Northern Territory) [10.18] - I should not have participated in this discussion but for the suggestion implied in the speech of the honorablo member for the Riverina (Mr Nock) that, at present, Mr Davis could do what he liked with this property. The word ""planning"" has been used frequently this evening, but some honourable members do not seem to appreciate the meaning of the term. I have not visited Glen Davis but I have visited the shale deposits west of Musswellbrook and I can visualize the situation to some extent. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) and also the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) have, in my opinion, rightly raised the whole question of the method by which this proposed new town is to be built. It should be remembered that town planning is the function, not of an individual, but of a local authority. I was surprised to hear the Assistant Minister .(Mr Holt) speak as he did on this point in his second reading speech. He seemed to disregard altogether the consideration that town planning is the function of a local authority. The honourable member for West Sydney is quite right, in my opinion, in pretesting against the expenditure of Â£40,000 by the Government of New South Wales on certain planning operations in view of the fact that no proper arrangements have been made for supervision. I am not aware of all the facts of the case, but if public money is to be expended in the provision of roads, footpaths, sewerage, State water services and other amenities, a proper local authority should be appointed to supervise the work. I am sure the British Parliament would not endorse a proposition of this kind. When a similar subject was being discussed in the House of Commons recently, Mr. MCLean pointed out that, when public moneys were being expended on highways, arterial roads or the like, the owners of adjacent properties were required to make some contribution, on a graduated scale, for the benefits that they would thereby enjoy. That is a proper system. It seems to me that some honourable members do not understand even the rudiments of town .planning. In this instance we have not been informed whether there is to be a civic square, or whether any of the usual facilities of a modern town are to be provided. The name of the ex-Surveyor-General of New South Wales, Mr Matthews, has been mentioned, but we have not been informed of his exact status. We do not even know whether he is to prepare the plan; but, in any case, the carryingout of the plan should be supervised by a local authority. I was sorry to hear the honourable member for Riverina blatantly state that, at present, Mr Davis could do as he likes in a matter of this kind.",65
207,Mr NOCK,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"I did not say that. said that he owned the land at present, and so could do what was needed.",66
208,Mr BLAIN,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"I join members of the Labour party in protesting against the unsatisfactory provision that is being made to ensure that a proper town-planning authority shall be set up and a proper plan prepared in respect of Glen Drivis. We should defer further action on this matter until adequate assurances are forthcoming that the work will be properly done. The workmen who will live at Glen Davis should not be treated as mice; they should be given some authority. Otherwise, the proposed work will not be done as we might wish it to b(\ done.",66
209,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"Fawkner-Assistant Minister for Supply and Development) [10.25] - Tw o points have been raised in this discussion. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) and the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) have asked what interval is likely to elapse after the passing of this bill before the land will be transferred from the company to the State government. I assure them that the sooner the bill is passed, the sooner the transfer can be made. At present, difficulty is being encountered in preparing the plans because the transfer has not been completed. The auction sale is to be held on Boxing Day.",66
210,Mr ROSKVEAB,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,Will any legislative action be required in connection with the transfer of the land after this bill ha? been passed ?,66
211,Mr HOLT,NATION AL OIL PROPRIETARY,"No ; that will be a legal process. The other point related to the proceeds from the sale of the land. have already explained that the State Government is sppnding Â£40,000 on this site in providing various services. In my opinion-it will be very fortunate if the sale of the land reimburses it for this expenditure. Schedule agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill reported with an amendment; report-by leave-adopted . Bill - by leave-rea d a third time. PATENTS, TRADE MARKS, NA I (WAR POWERS) BILL 1939. SECOND READING.",66
212,Mr HUGHES,DESIGNS AN D COPYRIGHT,"North SydneyAttorney-General) [10.29] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to make special provisions with respect to patents, trade marks, designs and copyright in consequence of the war. The measure will remain in operation for the period of the war and for six months thereafter. It is substantially identical with a similar measure passed some little time ago by the Imperial Parliament. As honourable members are aware, trading with enemy subjects is forbidden under the Trading with the Enemy Act; but unless provisions such as those set out in this bill are made, it will not be possible for traders and manufacturers to enjoy the benefits of licences under patents, designs and copyright that may have been granted by enemy subjects. In like fashion it would be equally impossible, in the absence of a measure such as this, for persons in this country to obtain in enemy countries that protection for their inventions and the like which, but for the war, they would have been able to obtain. The bill provides that where a person residing or carrying on business in this country has obtained a licence under a patent, design or copyright from an enemy subject, the licence shall continue in force. There are, no doubt, in this country many manufacturing industries carrying on under licences obtained from persons who are now enemy subjects. If these licences were hot continued' in force, these industries might be forced to suspend or curtail their operations because they would no I longer have authority to manufacture, according to the patents held by enemy subjects. The bill also empowers the Attorney-General to, revoke such a licence or to vary any condition subject to which it has effect. Difficulty may arise in the case of a person who wishes to establish some industry in Australia for the purpose of which it is necessary to use a patent held by an enemy subject. The provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act prevent that person from obtaining a licence for such a purpose at present, and provision is made in the bill empowering the Attorney-General to grant a licence under patents, designs or copyrights held by enemy subjects. The bill also contains certain provisions in respect of trade marks. It not infrequently happens that substances are principally, or solely, known according to some trade mark. If such a case occurs in respect of an enemy trade mark, trade in that article would be hampered by reason of the fact that the trade mark could not be used in connection therewith. The bill provides that, in such cases, the Attorney General may suspend the right to use the particular trade mark to the degree necessary to render well-known and established some description of the article which does not involve the use of the trade mark. I remember very well the case of Imperial Bayer's Aspirin and Aspro. This bill is and becoming increasingly familiar to me as I go through it ; it is almost a facsimile to that State. of a bill introduced some time ago. The bill further provides that, withstanding the war, patents may granted, and trade marks, designs and copyrights registered, on the application of an enemy subject, and that no act necessary for that purpose shall be deemed a contravention of the Trading with the Enemy Act. It will be appreamend ciated by honourable members that if were not to allow this to be done, reciproImperial cal rights would not be granted in respect of Australian patents in enemy countries. Owing to the dislocation of communicacountries, tions, considerable delay takes place lodging and completing applications for patents and the like received from abroad. It is therefore proposed to authorize extension of any period of time fixed under the relevant acts where circumpatent stances arising from the existence of state of war render that course desirable. The bill also contains a clause permitting persons in Australia to pay any fee, or to do any act, necessary for obtaining the grant or renewal of a patent, trade mark or design, in an enemy country, and permitting an enemy subject to pay any such fee or to do any such act necessary for obtaining such a grant in Australia. This provision is desirable in order that Australian subjects may acquire, in Germany, their rights to industrial property. All of these provisions arise directly out of the war. There is, however, one provision in the bill which does not arise in consequence of the war. I refer to clause 15. By reason of a recent amendment of the Imperial Patents and Designs Act, certain Orders in Council which gave effect in Australia to the international arrangements for the protection of patents, trade marks and designs, were repealed as from the 1st August. 1938. Section 121, sub-section 4 of the Patents Act 1903-1935 readsThe provision of this section shall in the case of foreign States apply only in the case of those foreign States with respect to which His Majesty by order in council has before or after the commencement of this act declared the provisions of the aforesaid section one hundred and three of the said first recited Act (or any provision enacted in substitution for that section) to be applicable, so long only in the case of each such State as the order continues in force with respect It was the practice until quite recently not to proceed by way of Order in Council; be hut in the recent amendment of the Imperial act, that procedure was superseded by statutory authority. Section 121 of the Patents Act 1903-1935 refers to and is operative only in respect of Orders in Council. It is necessary to the Australian act to conform .to we the amendment of the Imperial act. The Patents and Designs Act which, as I have said, formerly operated by Orders in Council directed to - specific was in operation when ithe first in Australian Patents bill was introduced into this Parliament in 1903. The former procedure of operating by Orders in Counthe cil operates under statutory authority. An Australian who wished to obtain rights in countries other than his a own could not be granted such rights in countries to which the Order in Council did not apply. Now the procedure has been altered and the matter can be fied by the exercise of statutory which applies to all countries which members of the Convention for the ProAct tection of Industrial Property.",66
213,Mr ROSEVEAR,DESIGNS AN D COPYRIGHT,How many countries are not signatories to that Convention?,68
214,Mr HUGHES,DESIGNS AN D COPYRIGHT,"I do not know offto band; I should say that practically every civilized country is. Amendments of which notice has been given will be submitted, and I shall be pleased to give to honourable members any legislation. information I can regarding them. Speaking generally, I commend the measure"" to the House, and give an assurance that a substantially similar has been passed by the British Parliato ment. All of the provisions, with the exception of clause 15 to which I have referred, arise out of, or are necessary, owing to the war. The period for which this legislation will operate is limited the war and six months afterwards.",68
215,Mr SCULLIN,DESIGNS AN D COPYRIGHT,"Yarra) [10.41] - I war. have read this bill and it appears to be a necessary measure in a war period. As the Attorney-General (Mr Hughes) has said, it is a temporary measure and ment. will operate only for the duration of the war and six months afterwards. That was the period for which similar legissubjects lation operated during the last war, this is not the same kind of law as was passed on that occasion, and I am rather glad to notice"" that it is not. I suppose that the experience gained has led to this alteration. The bill passed on the last occasion merely gave power to make regufact lations to do certain things, but in this case the bill itself stipulates the mental principles to be observed, and enables the House to determine them. This is a great improvement. The measure brings home to us how upsetting the war really is. Not only does it strain the relations between nations; it ' upsets the trading, and almost personal, relations within a country. As the Attorney-General has pointed out, the main thing which this bill does is to give authority to the Minister suspend or void patents, trade marks, designs and copyright. It gives authority for persons to hold licences for rectipatents that are in the hands of authority enemy subjects, or trade marks, are otherwise the Trading with the Enemy would prevent the sale of goods under those trade marks. The bill enables us to carry on with patents that Would otherwise be in the hands of the enemy. It also enables enemy subjects to pay fees maintain their patent rights, and it makes it possible for Australian patentees to pay fees in an enemy country to maintain their patent rights there. On the whole, I think that this is very necessary It occurs to me, in reading measures of this kind, and in studying international conventions dealing with trade marks and bill patents, that agreement has been reached a remarkable degree between practically all of the nations of the world regarding the reciprocal rights that have been granted in different countries in respect of patent's and trade marks. One to regrets that we cannot get that same spirit of co-operation with regard to other matters instead of having to resort to",68
216,Mr BLACKBURN,DESIGNS AN D COPYRIGHT,In connection with the Postal Union we find similar agree,68
217,Mr SCULLIN,DESIGNS AN D COPYRIGHT,"Yes . When nations meet around a table, and discuss certain of mutual interest, they can but reach agreement, hut on other matters that are of greater moment, I believe that if they met at a conference table in the same spirit, they could reach agreement to a similar degree, and avoid the bloodshed witnessed in the past. However, the that so many nations are prepared to respect patent rights in all countries fundais, in itself, a great achievement. This legislation, it has been stated, will operate for the period of the war and six months after it, and then the rights of other nationals will be practically also restored to them. Any money derived from the issue of licences, or any royalty received, will go not to the enemy, but to our own revenues, to be held in trust for adjustment subsequent to the war, thus respecting the individual rights of perto sons who may now be regarded as enemy subjects. Of course, there are safeguards in the bill to prevent money from going to enemy countries arising out of any of their rights during the war and six months afterwards. As the bill is a most necessary one, I support it .  bill deals with very important matters, in which I have been interested for years. When the Attorney-General introduced the measure, I asked him whether it was the big bill or the little one. He said that it was the little bill that deals with enemy subjects.",68
218,Mr HUGHES,DESIGNS AN D COPYRIGHT,"And with rights, too..  ward to the time when the second reading will be moved of the other measure, which will deal with the law relating to patents and trade marks generally.

The more comprehensive measure to which I have referred will deal, among other things, with certain anomalies that have arisen in connection with our trade relations with the United States of America. Under the present bill, some protection will be afforded in respect of patents, trade marks and designs of enemy subjects. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

Paragraph a of the clause provides that war, the actual inventor is to be deemed to have an interest in a patent where it has been granted, not to him, but to some one to whom he has communicated the invention, or has been granted to his agent, attorney or nominee. The reason for this provision is to prevent evasion by an person enemy subject who is an inventor obtainAustralia ing the grant of a patent by means of e person in one of the classes named. Thr paragraph as printed, however, does no: provide for the case where an enemy subject who is the actual inventor assigns the invention to a second person, and that second person communicates the invention to a third person, who obtains a patent there for in the Commonwealth. Nor does it cover the case where the legal representative of the enemy subject comour own municates the invention to a person in the Commonwealth. The obtaining of a patent by a communicatee from the legal representative or 'assignee of the actual inventor is provided for under section 32 of the Patents Act, and the amendment is necessary in order to cover cases such as this.

The purpose of this measure is to authorize the re-printing of Statutory Rules, as amended from time to time. As was pointed out in the second report of the Standing Committee of the Senate on Regulations and Ordinances, "" the frequent amendment of regulations makes it extremely difficult for those concerned to lay their fingers upon all the regulations that bind them "". The committee suggested, as one of the means by which that evil might be mitigated, that a periodic consolidation of the regulations should be made. ""While provision is made by the Amendments Incorporation Act, that, whenever the Government Printer reprints an act, he is to reprint it with any amendments which have been made thereto, no such provision exists"" with respect to the reprinting of Statutory Rules. It is now twelve years since a general revision of Statutory Rules was made, and many of them have been amended on numerous occasions, thereby Sydney- giving rise to the difficulty to which the - I move- Senate committee has referred.

The Tariff Board had recommended a sliding scale bounty based on the average imported cost, for each financial year, but practical considerations, not apparently brought before the board's notice, render it impossible to pay sulphur manufacturers any bounty at all until after the end of each financial year, as the hasis for bounty, namely, the average imported cost for that year, could not be ascertained until after the end of the year. This amendment of the principal act will be very acceptable to sulphur producers, and will render that act similar in its operation to other bounty acts. Section 9 of the principal act provides for a reduction of bounty where profits exceed 10 per cent, per annum. Without the amendment proposed in clause 4 of the bill, it would be impossible to determine the sales value of sulphur or sulphuric acid used by a manufacturer in the production of his .own fertilizers or other commodities. The determination of an assumed sales value or selling price for such sulphur or sulphuric acid is essential for the Minister to determine the net profit earned from the manufacture and sale of sulphur or sulphuric acid, and to limit that profit to 10 per cent, per annum, which is the vital purpose of that section of the bounty act. The industrial section, clause 5 of the bill, was not included in new bounty legislation in 1938, as there was then some doubt as to its validity. The then Attorney General, however, promised the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) to consider the matter fully, and to insert such a section if it were found to be valid and also advisable in the interests of employees in industries in receipt of 1939. Commonwealth bounties. Such consideration has been completed, and the Government recommends to the House the present bill, which provides for(a) the observance by bounty claimants of standard rates of wages and conditions of employment prescribed by Commonwealth or - State industrial authorities, or registered under Commonwealth or State industrial agreements; or (&) where such standard rates do not exist, the special declaration by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, upon application by the Minister, of fair and reasonable wages and conditions of employment.

A similar provision was included in the Iron and Steel Products Bounty Act, but it has been demonstrated that a great deal depends on the way in which the the act is-administered. When bills of this kind are before the House there is always a suggestion that the bounty is paid to assist some struggling industry, but I find that the wire netting bounty is paid to the Broken Hill Proprietary seen Company Limited through its subprosidiaries. There are three companies engaged in the manufacture of wire netting. Lysaghts and Rylands of Newcastle, and I a known that Lysaght Limited and Rylands Limited are both subsidiaries of Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, and I understand that the Western Australian",72
230,Mr WHITE,WIRE NETTING BOUNTY BIL L,Not unless it happened,72
231,Mr WARD,WIRE NETTING BOUNTY BIL L,"The Labour party supthe granting of assistance to industries that are in need of it, but we should examine every proposal of the kind in order to determine whether the industry concerned does, in fact, need assistance. Last year the Broken Hill Proprietary Company made a profit of Â£1,500,000, and it seems very strange that it should be allowed to rake in some more thousands in the form of a bounty on wire netting. Bounty payments under the Iron and Steel Products Bounty Act are limited to Â£250,000 in any one year, but it is provided that if the industry does produce sufficient to entitle it to its quota in one year it may produce an additional quantity the next year to entitle it to take up the whole of the bounty which would have been available over the two years. Thus, though a company may limit production in one year it may, by increasing production the following year, suffer no reduction of the amount of bounty it receives. The provision relating to labour conditions appeared in the original bounty legislation, but it did not afford the protection to the workers that it should. A lnbour dispute occurred at Lysaghts' works in 1938, not because the workers were seeking increased rates of pay, but because the company had reduced piece work rates by amounts ranging from 20 per cent, to 50 per cent. The Government, instead of using its power under the bounty - legislation to enforce justice for the workers, gave permission for the importation of 25,000 tons of galvanized iron, thereby assisting the company to impose unjust, terms upon the employees.",72
232,Mr GREGORY,WIRE NETTING BOUNTY BIL L,Most improper!,73
233,Mr WARD,WIRE NETTING BOUNTY BIL L,"I agree. The Government refused permission to import bar steel which the Broken Hill Proprietary Company could not supply, so that allied industries were held up, but when the industrial dispute occurred, it permitted the importation of 25,000 tons of the finished article. It is one thing to include certain provisions in a bill of this kind, but it is another thing to ensure that they are carried out. Anybody who has been through Lysaghts' works at Newcastle and inspected the conditions under which the men work ""will realise that they had a just grievance in 1938, particularly the men employed in the pickling section, when they protested against the reduction of their wages. At that time the employers contended that the wage rates were very high. The employees replied that the rates might appear to be high, but there were very many occasions when the men were not able to work a complete week. Owing to the effect of acid fumes the health of the men was seriously affected. They contended that even the old rates were not unusually high having regard not to the effect of the work on their full health. The acid fumes, I understand, loosen the teeth of the men and destroy their hair, causing baldness. Despite these conditions the government of the day did not exercise its power to ensure that the men were paid reasonable rates. It failed to take one step in order to protect them. However, when a bounty bill is introduced, certain baits are held out to honourable members generally in order to obtain their support for the measureI t is argued, for instance, that, irrespective of the wages and conditions to be observed in the industry concerned, it is far preferable to establish the industry and thus provide more employment in this country. On such occasions the Government also guarantees to prevent exploitation of the consumers. I know of no instance in which the Government has exercised that power effectively. In order to prevent profiteering the Government has power to examine the books and accounts of any company whose operations are the subject of complaint. A fair margin of profit is deemed to be 15 per cent, over costs. Under this system, however, no regard is paid to the fact that, companies can hide their, real profits, by having enormous sums placed in reserve and further sums set aside for taxation. I do not agree that that is the proper way to arrive at a fair profit. Consequently, I shall not build up the hopes of the workers in this industry, or give them any reason to expect any additional protection with regard to their wages and conditions, as the result of this measure. Provisions of this kind can be effective only when they are administered by a government sympathetic with the workers concerned; and it is because we hope that at some time in the future a Labour government may have an opportunity to administer this provision to the advantage of the workers in the industry, we offer no abjection to this measure.",73
234,Mr GREGORY,WIRE NETTING BOUNTY BIL L,"Swan) [11.25] - No doubt the Government is pleased with the mately reception given to this bill, which is being introduced for the purpose of placating Labour. It should deal as sympathetically with the primary producers as the principal users of wire netting. I have which pointed out on more than one occasion that Lysaghts' and Rylands' quotations not only provide wholesale, hut also stipulate retail prices, and that these firms penalize any retailer who sells their products prices below those stipulated. This abuse are less than 6 per cent. should have been inquired into by Tariff Board when, on a previous occabe sion, I produced figures showing that South Africa the wire netting of the British manufacturer, despite the fact that he has to meet Belgian, Dutch and Germany competition, and pay a duty 15 per cent., is from 30 per cent, 35 per cent, cheaper than it is Australia. In 1910, in Western Aus-' tralia, I bought 10 miles of imported rabbit-proof netting at under Â£20 a mile. The average price over a number of years up to three years ago was Â£44 mile , for a most inferior item. When I was last in Western Australia, found that in some districts! which hud selves. experienced heavy rain, miles of Detting had been destroyed. One man who just erected six miles of netting half of it in that flood. Some time ago the Labour Government in Western Ausout, tralia imported from Great Britain 352 miles of rabbit-proof netting when bounty of Â£3 9s. was being paid to our manufacturers. Although the British product is supposed to be duty free, dumping duty of Â£1,970 was charged that shipment. I cannot understand why cheaper. legislation of this kind is rushed through in the closing hours of a session merely in order to satisfy certain demands by - Labour, while at the same time, the vernment is not prepared to protect the primary producer. The manufacturer should be compelled to sell his product ""every trader at a uniform price, and should be prevented from dictating the price at which the product shall be retailed.",74

Since the provision of the bounty on newsprinting paper, very active steps have been taken to establish the industry in Tasmania. I hear an honourable member ask: ""Where is Tasmania""? It is the smallest and most persecuted State of the Commonwealth, but the establishment of the newsprinting paper industry there will mean a good deal to it. The company which has. embarked on this enterprise will spend Â£1,000,000 on capital equipment. The industry will su PPly long-felt need in Australia. I a understand that the newspapers are already experiencing some difficulty in obtaining newsprint, and we may look for smaller issues in the near future. I . have no doubt that before very long the production of newsprinting paper will be undertaken in other States than Tasmania. I am sorry that the Tasmanian company has not actually reached the production stage. Had it not been for the provision of the bounty, the industry could not by now have been established. I visited the works a few weeks ago and found hundreds of men in employment there. The necessary buildings are in course of construction. When the bounty bill was before the House last is re- year, the manager of the company, who was present in Canberra, said that no objection would be offered by his organithe zation to the inclusion in the bill of a clause of the kind now before us.

We have been given to understand that a good housing scheme will be provided as soon as the company gets its works into operation, for it ""desires the people working for it to be contented and happy. The company will also assist in co-operative forestry work. Unfortunately it has been the custom in Australia to destroy forests. This company undertakes to cut out the forest and to use all timber of suitable age. It has no objections to this amendment. I have reason to believe that the Minister would have been prepared to accept it when the original bill was before the House some time ago but for some legal difficulty arose in connection with it.",76

255,Mr JOHN LAWSON,NEWSPRINTING PAPER BOUNTY,"Macquariefor Trade and Customs) [12.30 a.m.] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. I wish to emphasize that the notes exchanged between the High Commissioner now in London and the Brazilian Ambassador signed on the 19th July, 1939. The notes together form a simple type of No specific tariff concessions arc provided for in the agreement, which ' simply if guarantees that Australian goods imported into Brazil and Brazilian goods imported into Australia will receive treatment not less favourable than that granted to goods from..any other foreign country. On the part of Australia, the agreement was designed principally to secure the most favourable conditions of entry of Australian wool into Brazil,-the trade in which was showing a promising degree of expansion. Honourable members will appreciate that the events which have taken place since the signing of the agreement may affect the export of wool to Brazil. Nevertheless, I do not consider that that fact should prevent formal approval from being given to the agreement. I shall, therefore, deal as briefly as possible with the reasons which led to the exchange of the notes which constitute the agreement. - Brazil has a double-columned tariff providing minimum and maximum rates of duty. The lower tariff rates are applied to imports from countries which have entered into trade agreements with Brazil under which Brazilian goods receive most-favoured-nation treatment. At the present time, imports of Brazilian goods into Australia are subject to the general tariff rates of jluty, and consequently Brazil applies the maximum tariff rates to Australian goods imported into that country. The agreement now before the House will remove any competitive disadvantages to which Australian goods are subject in Brazil. The Brazilian import duty on wool under the maximum tariff is 1.680 milreis per kilogramme gross weight, plus 10 per cent, of that duty, equivalent to approximately 3d. per lb. gross weight in Australian currency. The minimum tariff is 1.360 milreis plus 10 per cent., equivalent to approximately 2jd. per lb. The woo] textile industry in Brazil has been expanding rapidly in recent years. It already supplies the bulk of the domestic demand for the coarser typen of fabrics woven from locally grown and .spun wool. Eor the manufacture of finer weaves of textiles the industry has been dependent to a large extent upon imported yarns, but this trade is gradually being displaced by the increasing output of the Brazilian spinning industry using imported raw wools of fine counts. Australian exporters have been evincing a keen interest in this development. Mr John Lawson Brazilian statistics show that imports of wool in 1938, including raw wool and wool in all stages of manufacture up to yarns, were valued at the equivalent in Australian currency of approximately Â£664,000. The value of Australian wool exports to Brazil has increased considerably since 1934-35, and, as Australian wool is subject to slightly higher duties than wool from competing sources, it was anticipated that the removal of the differential margin would encourage a more extensive use of Australian staple. A trade has recently developed in the export of Australian essential oils to - Brazil. These goods will receive the benefit of a reduction of duty of approximately one-fifth by the application of the minimum tariff. Brazil has a favourable trade balance with Australia. This is due to the fact that Brazil supplies a number of commodities which are raw materials for Australian industry, such as carnauba wax, edible nuts, cocoa beans and cocoa butter. The goods imported from Brazil are not of a kind on which tariff concessions have been granted by Australia in trade agreements negotiated with other foreign countries. The extension to Brazil of most-favoured-nation treatment will not, therefore, result in any measurable increase of imports from Brazil, or any loss of revenue. The agreement contains the usual stipulation by which preferences granted by Australia to British countries are to be maintained. On the other hand any special advantages granted by Brazil to neighbouring countries for the purpose of facilitating frontier traffic, of the advantages or favours resulting from any customs union to which Brazil may become a party, are exempted from mostfavoured-nation treatment. Honourable members will observe that the agreement is to come into operation on a date to be fixed by mutual arrangement. This provision was incorporated in order that the agreement would not become effective until after approval by Parliament. I therefore submit the bill to this House with every confidence that it will meet with the approval of honourable members.",77

When we make these tuppennyHe halfpenny most-favoured nation treaties, we may get a little more direct trade, but in doing so, we lose a corresponding quantity of trade with Great Britain, and, in the last analysis, there is not very much in them. I do not think that very long will elapse before we shall come to the conclusion that we should scrap the lot and say to the world that, after we have given preference to our own people, no nation is more favoured in our eyes than any other. I suppose that this bill will be agreed to prinunanimously, but we must recast our thoughts in the manner I have indicated if we are to obtain the collective security that we all hope will emerge from this war.

264,Mr WHITE,NEWSPRINTING PAPER BOUNTY,Balaclava) [12.42 a.m.]. is - The way in which the honourable member-for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) has addressed himself to this matter not be allowed to pass unnoticed. The honourable gentleman spoke about internaIs he opposed to the policy of Empire preference ?,79
265,Mr HOLLOWAY,NEWSPRINTING PAPER BOUNTY,I said that I was in and favour of Empire preference.,79
266,Mr WHITE,NEWSPRINTING PAPER BOUNTY,"Wel l why make these pious generalizations? Is the honourable member opposed to protection in Australia? Certainly not! The honourable Aramember shows that he is not, whenever tariff matters are before the House. should not belittle a bill which is brought forward in order to increase our trade and broaden trade throughout the world, because he should know that the result of mostfavoured-nation treatment has been to increase the flow of international trade. When nations offer us such terms as were offered by Brazil, we should accept their offers. This policy achieves that very aim of which the honourable member is thinking. Universal free trade can never be achieved until all the resources of the nations, physical and material, are equal and until national boundaries no longer exist. The honourable member should realise that without protective tariffs Australian industry could not hold out against Japan: I think that the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) asked me what I thought about Empire trade.",79
267,Mr BRENNAN,NEWSPRINTING PAPER BOUNTY,"No , free trade.",80
268,Mr WHITE,NEWSPRINTING PAPER BOUNTY,"My idea of Empire trade which I should deal with first,.is that we should have the greatest possible flow of trade within the Empire as an example to the other nations of the world of the worth of co-operation, and in order to show that a community of nations can live in peace and friendship and enjoy a high living standard. Free trade, I think, could never come unless the conditions were as I have .just specified, and unless all countries had uniform taxation, hours of work and rates of pay. .Why, therefore, at this juncture, should the honourable member for Melbourne Ports rise to talk about a just peace and a changed world? There is a big enough task in front of us now. Let us first concentrate on winning the war by giving the greatest possible support to Britain and its allies. We can keep at the back of our minds - those other matters which the honourable member has brought forward as beingof such great importance. I support this little hill. We do not buy much from Brazil.",80
269,Mr JOHN LAWSON,NEWSPRINTING PAPER BOUNTY,"We buy from Brazil more than it buys from us. The balance of trade is in Brazil's favour. Nevertheless last year we sold to that country Â£15,000 worth of wool.",80
270,Mr WHITE,NEWSPRINTING PAPER BOUNTY,Yes . Collectively House. tliese trade agreements are well worth having. Last year we concluded a little one with Switzerland. South Africa did not give us most-favoured-nation treatment until two years ago. These arrangements make for expansion of trade and although this a small measure it is a worthy one.,80
271,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NEWSPRINTING PAPER BOUNTY,BarkerLeader of the Country party) [12.4j7 a.m.] - I should not have spoken but for the speech of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway).,80
272,Mr HOLLOWAY,NEWSPRINTING PAPER BOUNTY,I am glad that I have shocked the honourable member into thought.,80
273,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NEWSPRINTING PAPER BOUNTY,"The honourable member has not shocked ns into thought. On the contrary he has made us realise that there has been a stirring of the intellectual dead bones of the Opposition. The honourable gentleman had a bit to say about international trade and the necessity for it to be freer, and about the necessity for collective security. I have vivid recollections of the last time when collective security was an active issue. The Opposition, with the exception of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn), was absolutely opposed to collective security.",80

275,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NEWSPRINTING PAPER BOUNTY,"At this hour of the morning and in the last month of the year I do not propose to enter into what would be an interesting debate on this question, but the honourable member for Melbourne Ports can rest assured that his speech to-night will not be forgotten and that on an occasion next year a few of us will have some interesting observations to make about that speech.",80

277,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NEWSPRINTING PAPER BOUNTY,"The real point to-night is that the Minister did not profess that this new trade agreement, from the viewpoint of cash value, was important, but the fact stands out clearly that anything that can be done to increase the sale of Australia's greatest export, namely, wool, is helpful to our economy. Therefore this measure should be supported by every member of the",80

279,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,NEWSPRINTING PAPER BOUNTY,"My stand in respect of trade with. Japan is all right, and I know where I stand in regard to the wool industry. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports mentioned the sale of wool to Armenia and Arabia. Not much wool goes to Arabia.",81

SECOND READING.",81
282,Mr JOHN LAWSON,TRADE AGREEMENT,"MacquarieMinister for Trade and Customs) [12.50 a.m.] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. Honourable members will observe that the exchange of notes embodying the agreement between Australia and Newfoundland provides for the grant by Newfoundland of exclusive tariff preferences of 1 cent, per lb. on Australian butter and 10 per cent, ad valorem on Australian canned fruits, while Australia accords admission under the British preferential tariff of Newfoundland newsprint. At present goods from Newfoundland on importation into Australia are subject to most-favoured-nation treatment. Similar treatment is accorded to Australian products on importation into Newfoundland. The rate of duty now levied in Newfoundland on butter is 8 cents, approximately 5fd. per lb., and on canned fruits 40 per cent, ad valorem. No preference on these commodities is accorded by Newfoundland to any country, either British or foreign. Newfoundland newsprint imported into Australia is at present dutiable under the general tariff at Â£4 a ton, whilst newsprint originating in the United Kingdom .and Canada, which are Australia's principal sources of supply, is admitted free of duty under the British preferential tariff. Australian trade with Newfoundland has up to the present been negligible, and it is hoped that the preferences granted hy Newfoundland to Australia alone may have a beneficial effect on our trade with that country. On .the other hand, Australia will undoubtedly benefit from the establishment of an alternative Empire source of supply - of newsprint. Australian newspaper interests have already had difficulty in obtaining an assurance of future supplies from the United Kingdom. It is not proposed to substitute indiscriminately Newfoundland newsprint for that manufactured in the United Kingdom. The agreement has the support of the United Kingdom Government, which is at present administering Newfoundland under a Commission.",81
283,Mr FORDE,TRADE AGREEMENT,"Capricornia-Deput y Leader of the Opposition) [12.53 a.m.]. - Althoug h this measure is not of great importance, I believe that it is a step in the right direction, and consequently the Opposition will not oppose it. Some years ago the Scullin Government negotiated a very satisfactory trade agreement with the dominion of Canada which conferred considerable benefits on the primary producers of this country. Under that agreement dried fruits and numerous other primary products were placed on the Canadian markets, and in return Australia purchased a number of Canadian products without interfering with our secondary industries. I do not support all agreements entered into between the Commonwealth and overseas' markets, because I can recall some introduced by previous Ministers for Trade and Customs which cut right across Australia's protective policy, and under which concessions were granted that militated against secondary development without conferring any commensurate benefit on the primary industries of the Commonwealth. This agreement will not inflict any hardship upon Australia and will provide preferential rates in respect of butter, canned fruits and other commodities, and in return we are to give British preferential rates on newsprint produced in Newfoundland.",81
284,Mr WHITE,TRADE AGREEMENT,"Balaclava) [12.55 a.m.].' - I challenge the statement made by the : Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde) that some trade agreements entered into by previous Ministers for Trade and Customs have cut right across Australia's protective policy. The honourable member knows very well that the industrial development in Australia at the period to which he referred, whether based on the number of employees, the number of factories or the amount of the wages paid, was the greatest which Australia has ever experienced. I invite the honourable member to quote one agreement that had the effect he alleged.",82

289,Mr WHITE,TRADE AGREEMENT,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition made a definite statement, and I should be allowed to reply. Mr SPEAKER,-The Deputy Leader of the Opposition may have made such statement; but the honourable member for Balaclava would be clearly out of order should he reply to it at length.",82

Trade agreeconcede ments made in the past cannot be debated under this measure.",82
292,Mr WHITE,TRADE AGREEMENT,"I have no intention now to do so. The Government's policy is to provide for two-way traffic, and the object of this agreement is to assist that policy. I am glad to have had an opportunity to deny the wild statement made by the Deputy Leader of the Oppoing sition. I support the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: The bill.",82
293,Mr BRENNAN,TRADE AGREEMENT,"Batman) [12.58 a.m.] - This agreement between the Commonwealth and Newfoundland is, in accordance with the prevailing fashion, supposed to be taken at a single gulp. Newfoundland now appears to be designated "" Nufundland "", which is quite out of harmony with my teaching. I propose to-deal with the question of trade agreements generally. The bill invites specific and meticulous examination, for example, of the Ottawa Agreement.  The honourable member is not in order in discussing that matter, even though the bill is being taken as a whole. He must confine his remarks to the effect of the clauses.",82
294,Mr BRENNAN,TRADE AGREEMENT,"There can be no principle applying to this trade agreement which may not properly be compared with the principles that apply to other trade agreements. There is no principle of trade, reduced to writing as a trade agreement, which, for purposes of illustration and comparison, may not a properly be examined when we are considering this bill-as a whole in committee.",82
295,The CHAIRMAN,TRADE AGREEMENT,The honourable member must recognize that the references in the various clauses of the bill are specific.,82
296,Mr BRENNAN,TRADE AGREEMENT,I apprehend that so you would concede something less in a of a bill as a whole in comthe mittee than you would be prepared to in a discussion on the motion for the second reading of the bill.,82
297,The CHAIRMAN,TRADE AGREEMENT,That is so.,82
298,Mr BRENNAN,TRADE AGREEMENT,"As a matter of fact, if I succeed in establishing the point that any interference with the right of honourable members to discuss trade agreements in general during the second-readdebate on a bill would be quite improper interference with the rights of Parliament I shall be satisfied. Now, having to my own satisfaction, and the satisfaction of other honourable members, irrespective of the lateness of the hour and the comparative unimportance of trade agreements with Brazil and Newfoundland, established that the rights of honourable members still remain intact, I should like to make a few general observations in support of some remarks passed by my friend, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Holloway). I am not referring to a recent debate in this House, because I know that there are all sorts of ways of impinging upon the rights of honourable members if they seek to do anything of that kind. A few days ago, however, I had a conversation with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports on the subject of trade agreements, and I heard from him an expression of opinion which was marked by that common sense that characterizes everything he says. He stated that, on the whole, these patchwork agreements, though they might in special circumstances",82
299,The CHAIRMAN,TRADE AGREEMENT,"The honourable wise member is not in order in making a second-reading speech at this stage. He must confine himself to the three clauses of the bill, together with the schedule.",83
300,Mr BRENNAN,TRADE AGREEMENT,"I am doing so, and I take leave to say that I heard an opinion expressed recently by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that the method of entering into agreements, now with one State and now with another, was unsatisfactory, and had the effect of creating animosity and jealousy among nations that ought, as far as possible, to be avoided. It has been suggested that, as we accept the principle of Empire preference in trade, there is justification entering into this agreement. propose to discuss the general principle of Empire preference other, than to say that it is based on the assumption that the Empire is an integer.",83
301,The CHAIRMAN,TRADE AGREEMENT,The honourable member is aware that his remarks are inconsistent with the Standing Orders.,83
302,Mr BRENNAN,TRADE AGREEMENT,"I do not question your right to call me to order, Mr Chairman, and I shall accept your direction, but if you presume to tell me that I am insincere, and do not believe what I am saying, I resent it . I will not accept such an imputation from you or any other"" man.",83
303,The CHAIRMAN,TRADE AGREEMENT,"The honourable member surprises me if he insists thai he, with his experience, really believes that his remarks are in order 'during this stage of the bill.",83
304,Mr BRENNAN,TRADE AGREEMENT,"I take it that agreements of this kind should be entered into only in very special circumstances, and to a limited extent, and that, in principle, they are to be deprecated on the ground which I have already stated, namely that, on the whole, the small gain to be obtained is more than offset by the consequent jealousies, trade bickerings and lack of reciprocity to which they give rise. Therefore, while I accept the bill for the reasons given by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Eorde), an experienced former Minister for Trade and Customs, who, as Deputy Leader of the Opposition, has acted throughout in a and judicial manner. I do so with the qualifications which I have stated. Bill agreed to and reported from committee without amendment; report adopted. Bill-by leave-rea d a third time. TARIF F PROPOSALS 1939.

306,Mr JOHN LAWSON,SAW COTTON BOUNTY BILL,"MacquarieMinister for Trade and Customs) [1.18 a.m.] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The bill provides for an amendment of the Raw Cotton Bounty Act 1934-38 to extend the period of the bounty on raw cotton for one year from the 1st December, 1939, at the rate applicable during the last two years, that is a basic bounty of 4jd. per lb. when the spot price of - Vmerican middling cotton at Liverpool is 6d. per lb. The actual amount of bounty paid will depend, as hitherto, on the actual Liverpool spot price. For each weekly variation of the Liverpool price up or down of one-hundredth of a penny per lb. from Od. per lb. during the ginning of the Queensland crop, the bounty on raw cotton produced in that week will be onehundredth of a penny per lb. less or more than 4jd. per lb. Honourable members will note that the bounty now proposed is Id. per lb. higher than that provided in the bill which I introduced last September. The original bill was in accordance with the Tariff Board's recommendation, which was based ou peacetime conditions. However, after further consideration of the. position of the Australian cotton industry and more of the importance of cotton in wartime as a raw material used extensively for civil and military purposes, and because so much of it has to be imported, the Government has decided that it is not desirable at present to reduce the existing bounty. As the result of the Governments announcement a few of weeks ago that it would renew the bounty at the existing rate, the issue of seed to growers by the Queensland Cotton Board for planting has already increased from the equivalent of 30,000 acres to 46,000 acres, and may increase still further. The latter acreage will, under satisfactory climatic conditions, yield, some 13,000 bales of raw cotton. The Commonwealth Government has assisted this industry with marked generosity. From 1923 to 1925, it paid Â£170,900 to cotton producers in order to cover losses under the then system of guaranteed prices and, from 1926 to the 31st October, 1939, bounty payments have amounted to no less than Â£1,021,099. The extension of the present rate of bounty for one year will enable the Government to consider the usual long range policy for assisting the - industry. This consideration will involve careful attention by the Government to the urgent need for a substantial improvement of efiiciency in the cotton-growing industry which was stressed by the Tariff Board. The yield of cotton to the acre in Queensland has declined to a rather alarming extent. The Tariff Board reported that the best methods of cultivation and rotation were not generally practised, and that scientific research for the purpose of overcoming pests and diseases, and of breeding cotton plants which will give economic yields of types of cotton suitable for Australian requirements, should be accelerated and improved. It seems especially necessary to produce cotton in Australia under suitable methods of irrigation, by which the average yield could probably be increased threefold. By the adoption of improved methods there is no doubt that the cost of producing cotton in Australia could be substantially reduced, thus enabling a material reduction of bounty payments without causing any disability to the growers of cotton. The people of Australia are entitled to expect the utmost efficiency from all in dustries which are protected by bounty or tariff. The Government therefore hopes that satisfactory arrangements will be made immediately for the institution by the Queensland Government and those engaged in the cotton industry of a comprehensive plan for putting the industry on a sound economic footing as early as possible. The adequacy of that plan will largely determine the incidence of any long-range policy by the Government for assisting the cotton industry after the termination of the proposed legislation, which .1 now submit f o i the favourable consideration of the House.

COUNTRIES.",87
314,Mr HOLT,RATES OF MILITARY PAY IN EMPIRE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. It is understood that payments by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited for overtime, Sunday and holiday work were at the rates mentioned. The Public Service Board has now approved of similar conditions and payments to these operators as employees of the Civil Aviation Department and payments are being made retrospective to the dates when the employees were taken over from the company. 3. Of the stations mentioned in'No. port allowances are involved only at Port Moresby and Cooktown. Pending investigation Iiy the Public Service Board to determine whether existing Public Service rates of ling allowances are appropriate, the provisions of the Public Service Regulations are being applied at Port Moresby and a temporary allowance of Â£88 per annum has been approved at Cooktown. At Port Moresby the operators' transport allowance payment will approximate Â£52 per annum.

Australia has steadily increased its share of the market, and in 1938 supplied 55 per cent, of the total importations. The balance is supplied by northern hemisphere countries, whose fruit comes ou the market when the Australian export season has finished. Indications are that the total market capacity under present conditions has been reached, although it may be possible to secure a slight increase of Australia's share. There are certain restrictive factors, however, notably those due to the lack of refrigerated transport to islands other than Java. A survey of the Eastern markets for Australian fruit is being prepared for the guidance of the Apple ana Pear Board, which is considering the whole question of the disposal of the 1940 crop. Inquiries are proceeding with the Australian Government Commissioner in Netherlands India regarding the possibilities of the disposal of other apple products in Netherlands India. PUBLIO DEBT.",89
