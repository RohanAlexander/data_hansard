Millionaires have their own health insurance. get dentistry work done.' So the argument that is put up by this government are to block millionaires from getting access for children and 19 months for adults. That is boasts on the floor of this parliament about fiscally and what strength we have.

He said: 'You're kidding! They don't come here to regional Australia to that the changes that are being proposed to this is nothing short of farcical. There is no access for children for 13 months, and there shameful. I consider it only fair that the Minister must suffer without dental care for up to months. Furthermore, how does this government 2014 promise? I suggest that it is just because money grab to create the surplus. They are increased taxes on the Australian public and in my electorate.

For you to now somehow or other be frankly, a bit rich. The Commonwealth dental scheme was a very Commonwealth parliament-a Labor government decision that the Commonwealth had a role scheme, and what we saw under that scheme was targeted the poorest people in our community, gap in equity on oral health issues. One of came to office was to get rid of that scheme. you did in government. The Howard government got rid of that scheme. community was: dental waiting lists had got too long; they blew out to four years because Belatedly, the Howard government took the decision Scheme. That scheme was designed to be quite million a year. It was particularly designed whose chronic disease was being exacerbated meant to be a very limited scheme. It was not million a year. That scheme is now costing $80 designed to do. I understand that people feel unhappy that the opposition feels unhappy that their scheme expanded beyond what it ever imagined it to believe that if they were in government they have got to be kidding themselves. You may absolutely cutting it back. You would not be let us have a really clear idea about What we have tried to do with this policy resources; we all know that. That is the reality areas of public policy face. But, with scarce make decisions about: 'What are the most important most strongly need government assistance?' Amendment Bill 2012.

I know what The reality of what then happened in my down to around 18 months, which was still way of the decisions of the Howard government. to introduce the Chronic Disease Dental a limited scheme that was going to cost $90 to look at people who had a chronic disease and by, or was exacerbating, poor oral health.

I understand that has now been exposed for having been literally be. If any members of the opposition honestly would not be means-testing this scheme, they have decided to keep it, but you would be allowing it to be costing $80 million a month. So what this policy debate is about. is to retarget it. There are scarce government that health faces. That is the reality that other government resources, governments have to areas? What are the areas that we believe What we believe, fundamentally, on oral health You have to look at what is happening for at pensioners. You also have to look at what we do know that if we set kids up with good experiencing, down the track, some of the chronic be lessened.

We are going employment to reduce that massive 400,000-person immediately, and in conjunction with the states dental support continue with the great alleviation responsibility for children through the $1.3 billion They will be able to commit extra resources the CDDS scheme.

What does that translate to into enable the expansion of existing dental community in Goulburn. A lot of my constituents for support. There are also Yass, services will be expanded.

Yet so-called initiatives of the Gillard government: upon closer inspection it is simply another community practices and put more pressure promised a new dental scheme in the 2007 election they expect Australians to trust a promise for Labor are at making announcements that only One of the key concerns I have is that the closing the existing Chronic Disease replacement schemes are not due to commence tremendous success of the existing scheme that government and when the current opposition the existing scheme so effective and so accessible that provides treatment for adults. In the last have been provided to over one million patients. these Australians or others who need these The minister needs to explain what will treatment under the existing program. Will these the gap period? About the time of the introduction Forwood from Mount Riverview in the electorate My daughter was accepted in the Medicare from the Government to fix her teeth. The problems after she was accepted into the scheme she found is born until she has the work done on her teeth as Mrs Forwood goes on to say: My daughter has received a letter from the completed by 1st December this year. After speaking with the department, Mrs advised that there is no way to get access forcing Australians such as Danielle to forgo Danielle should not be forced to choose between scheme expires and protecting I suspect that this gap in government-subsidised attempt to reach a budget surplus. Why must services simply because this government government, as they attempt to rush this bill case. To date, the federal government has details of how the scheme will be funded. Without if the new scheme will be more efficient concrete evidence that it will actually be delivered? If this bill does not commence until 2014, minister insist on rushing the bill through critical details for public and parliamentary regard suggests that the dental initiative is this new dental scheme is just like all the other it might sound okay as a news headline but underfunded initiative set to interrupt efficient on hard working Australian families. Labor campaign and yet did not deliver it. Now 2014. This is yet another example of how adept result in disappointment or failed delivery. Gillard government's dental promise relies on Dental Scheme in November 2012 and yet the until 2014. I would like to reflect on the was introduced by the coalition when it was in leader was the then health minister. What makes is that it is the only Medicare dental scheme five years, approximately 20 million services What does the Gillard government expect services to do during that almost two-year gap? happen to those who are currently receiving patients be forced to forgo treatment during of this bill I was contacted by a Mrs of Macquarie.

She wants to wait until the baby she is afraid the dental work will impact on the baby. Government saying that all dental work must be Her baby is due at the end of February. Forwood and her daughter Danielle have been to an extension. Why is the federal government dental assistance for almost two years? Surely getting dental treatment before the current the needs of her unborn child. dental services is just another desperate the Australian community continue to lose vital have spent wastefully? The actions of this through parliament, indeed suggest that this is the yet to provide a schedule of services, fees and these details, how can one suitably assess and beneficial to the community? Where is the that is after the next election. Why does the the parliament without making available these scrutiny? The approach of the government in this more about politics than policy. In fact, the Labor government has gone to great lengths to undermine Dental Scheme because it was established was health minister, and it has been a Putting politics aside, I believe it is absolutely the details that the government has made available not detailing how the program would be funded, of services to be provided over the full six years the existing program provided last year government argue that the new scheme will number of people are set to benefit from the new program? Furthermore, does the government anticipate practices in order to accommodate the service scheme? Already 650,000 people are on public any information with regard to how this may scheme? Longer waiting lists in public hospitals Labor. In addition to longer waiting lists, a workforce and infrastructure, particularly in deliver the projected number of services, and persons will have access to dental services under government's proposal it has allocated $225 million to apply for funding under the flexible grants commence, again, until 2014. Therefore, one completed or provide tangible benefits until service gaps that I mentioned previously will will be no federal government dental initiative. As a result of these concerns, the coalition existing Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. I believe protect patients who will now have to go without and 13 months for children-until Labor's proposed are not successful, or if this motion fails, this with detrimental consequences to the Australian should be noted that 80 per cent of services been provided to concession card holders. predominantly utilised by low-income At an earlier time. I have spoken on the scheme have a number of dentists who work, particularly with significantly disadvantaged sections of the gap in service that they will be able to the period where there will be no assistance treatment as they cannot afford private dental considerable public waiting lists. Many Australians have the perception that result, they do not prioritise going to the dentist the existing Medicare Chronic Disease by Tony Abbott, the opposition leader, when he success in improving access to treatment. critical that the parliament does scrutinise in regard to the proposed scheme.

How can the Gillard be beneficial for communities when a smaller longer waiting lists across Australian dental gaps that will arise as a result of the new dental waiting lists. Does the minister have blow out while Australians wait for the new will be the direct responsibility of federal considerable lack of investment in the dental the public system, will hinder the capacity to I can only anticipate that considerably fewer the new scheme.

Alarmingly, I suspect that the be extended beyond the two years, when there has moved to disallow the earlier closure of the that it is critical that we endeavour to treatment-for at least 19 months for adults alternatives are due to commence. If we will inevitably be another Labor policy disaster, community and Australian dental practices. It under the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme have This suggests that dental services have been earners who cannot afford premium care. that was introduced by the coalition, and I in the area of Katoomba in my electorate, the community. They are deeply concerned about provide. Without the existing scheme and during these people will be forced to go without services. As a result, they may be added to dentists provide a premium service and, as a as they would, for example, going to a doctor.
