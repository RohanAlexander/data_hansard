I note the amendment which has repeating the elements of that. In our amendment the cuts, in real terms, that the government has local government since first coming to office; government funding partnership by financial assistance grants funding to the service from the GST as the government to renege on this commitment within months of and unfair tax on essential services provided Australia; and the way in which the compliance costs, with inadequate compensation way in which the Commonwealth funds local government financial assistance grants and states under the Local Government (Financial payment for on-passing to local government.

The guaranteed minimum grant means because councils with no relative needs or NA Thursday, 1 June 2000 more revenue than they need to fund standard the needs of other councils cannot be met and standard services. That is a very important issue, which impacts Territory. I want to explain how that is so, which the Commonwealth provides these funds allocation for local government purposes. We require that once these funds are received minimum, they use the fundamental principle when taxpayers' funds are made available governments for distribution to local governments, principle. Of course, they are for other Commonwealth made available as a result of Grants Commission of horizontal fiscal equalisation. That means resources to provide a similar standard of services equitable across Australia. This is not the case seen an abrogation of responsibility by the only since the Howard government came to office-to remote communities. I have in front of me a letter written by Minister for Regional Services, Territories Local Government Association of the Northern in which he informs the association, as he is Local Government (Financial Assistance) undertaken before 30 June 2001. He points out that must be covered by a review. The act also local government that he may determine. That did not determine. He points out that he discussions between his department and finalising these terms of reference, he has ministers. He points out that the review May 2000. I would like to quote the I am conscious that some in Local Government review of the interstate distribution of funding. I interstate distribution reviewed at all.

For matter I suggest you approach your State What a cop-out. The fact is that this minister, response, have totally washed their hands of financial assistance grants through state around Australia. I also have in front of me a letter, in response the Northern Territory President of the Local which she says: You have advised in your letter of 17 April Government's desire to enhance equity between councils”. MAIN COMMITTEE 16907 service provision receive funding. As a result, they are not funded to enable them to provide gravely on my constituents in the Northern and why there should be a review of the way into state and territory governments for the by the states, whilst they have got a of fiscal equalisation in their distribution. Yet by the Commonwealth to state and territory they are not required to use the same grants. All general revenue assistance recommendations are based on this question that all states and territories are then given to all their citizens so that they are roughly for local government. In that context, we have federal parliament over a number of years-not local government, particularly in more Senator the Hon. Ian Macdonald in his capacity as and Local Government to the President of the Territory. The letter is effectively a form letter required to do, he says, under section 17 of the Act 1995, that a review of the act will be that section 17 of the act specifies some areas requires him to review other matters relating to is significant, Mr Deputy Speaker, for what he has drafted terms of reference which followed the Commonwealth Grants Commission.

There is, as a result, remoteness, no allowance for disability factors, raised when we distribute funds on the fundamental have time to go through those now, but I am elements that go into that determination because these are per capita grants, The fundamental issue is that, because grants larger base, a larger population, get a greater remote areas. This is significant. You can see For example, the Brisbane City Council is eligible because of the size of the base in Queensland government properly distribute those funds, distributed amongst other councils. The Northern is not enough money to spread around to remote the nature of the services they provide. As a comparison of how funds are distributed approximately the same population, for example, City Council received $1.3 million as a result million. Katherine received $450,000 whereas received$1.4 million. Port Keats, an Aboriginal $200,000, and Barcaldine in Queensland, a You can see the obvious disparity which available. The Aboriginal communities get an Grants Commission because significantly they local governing bodies in the Northern Territory, do not have a rate base, and they get short-changed funds because they are distributed unfairly. Why should it be that residents of North local government from this government as do at all in the distribution of these funds. Why the same level of funding from this federal in the case of local government funding?

What Mrs Vigants has done is the way in which grants are made available in the territories are done on a per capita basis of because it is per capita, no allowance for no allowance for the other issues which are principles of fiscal equalisation.

Suffice to say that, none of these issues are contemplated. are made on a per capita basis, states with a amount of funds to distribute around the state to how significant it is in the case of Queensland. for $38 million on a per capita basis, but and the way in which the Queensland it receives only $12 million, the rest being Territory gets a total of $9 million, so there communities on the basis of remoteness and across Australia, in towns with Darwin City Council and Ballarat, Darwin of this funding and Ballarat received $5.7 Ararat, of roughly the same population, community to the west of Darwin, received town of equivalent size, received $1.2 million. results from the way in which the funds are made operational subsidy from the Northern Territory have no rates base. This is true of most of the apart from the metropolitan councils. They in the context of the distribution of these Sydney get the same allocation of resources for people who live at Kintore? There is no equity is it that the people who live in South Yarra get government as do the people from Tennant Creek, is no logic to that position. I have made it very make this an issue and continue to develop it as an NA Thursday, 1 June 2000 issue because I do not believe that to allow govern. I note that the government talks about practical before that practical reconciliation, and what ultimately about giving people the rights they to public infrastructure, rights to health care-things expect to be made available to them by the reconciliation at all; I think that is a matter In the context of local government, they deficiencies that exists in this funding is the the formula to Aboriginal organisations government functions.
