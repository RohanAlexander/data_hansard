That and sincerity in relation to the issues we are that maybe-just maybe-the coalition has moved that the community will not tolerate high-wealth system. I certainly hope so-but I doubt it. not really serious about tackling these issues. First, we have the appalling double standards as the government basically admitted that it was trusts despite the Treasurer's promising to do about whether the bill we are debating today NA Thursday, 7 September 2000 will crack down on those who are currently those issues in detail. The government's lack of commitment in devices solely to gain social security payments to taxing trusts generally. As I said before, simply, the government has been strangely yesterday the Treasurer was asked why an and save $2 billion is yet to be honoured. plan to tax trusts was still policy but said that gave a guarantee that the legislation on trusts parliament by the end of June.

However, figures we see they are not rorters, they are through a mistake in the estimation of their and the government is quite happy to characterise yesterday, that is simply obnoxious. It is a Party in the United States. In fact, it would get down to the bowels of the Prime Minister's Republican strategist down there putting forward Nations, the conspiracy theory, The government is very well practised in the agenda, which is to punish and attack the incomes incomes of those in the middle, and distribute top. That is one of the reasons why we constantly and tax legislation that this is a government on the strong. This is the central strategy of the government, the government's motives here.

There is a to do with the fact that half the government in the House the government was ducking and that it has failed to pursue. When it comes to the government appears only too willing to lend with vested interests. However, when it comes it is a completely different story. and those who require its assistance as easy is now well practised in the black art of wedge in detail yesterday, the way in which the and its recipients for electoral gain is well all people who receive social security as the country claiming that their crackdown on when we get down to the middle of the people who have received overpayments either income or through a mistake made by Centrelink, all of these people as rorters.

Previously, if you cent tolerance if you underestimated your income. force is changing these days, the way it is increasingly not know from week to week whether they people are receiving overpayments. Sometimes the new zero tolerance family policy means that get lumbered with a bill, so much so that payments are receiving debts, the average who are included in the government's figures acknowledges they are no such thing, and when are convicted of welfare fraud. That is part of the background as to why sincerity in implementing some of the measures here is a lot of chest beating. The minister, release about how the government is going to he is going to get out there and get these people, there is no such tough approach at all. The and the zero tolerance family policy, which started do not see that sort of action against the rorters action against those with trusts that we families receiving family payments.

In the same vein, at a rural and remote community ensure improved coordination between governments and between governments and other agencies, exceptionally important. That was one of the October last year held in this Parliament need for better coordination at a government level.

That is of our medical practitioners are unwilling to the more disadvantaged suburbs of metropolitan that, in addition to our endeavours to improve we also start to give some consideration to the member for La Trobe this morning and also by me important issue, because I think it is part of today. I suggest to the Main Committee NA 20550 that communities must be empowered to meet partnerships between communities, governments organisations. Perhaps it is about creating including health services. In order to ensure our communities requires resources, not governments hospital system to actually run down. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I both know in attracting and training medical practitioners doctors, which is the nature of the bill before and other health professionals. We might succeed about doctors. I then suggest to the House some thought about what we do to try to attract other medical services that we require, professionals. The obvious undersupply of health practitioners underservicing and unmet need but also to areas. You need only to look at the facts and practitioners face. When I talk about these disincentives, am talking about a range of people who actually nurses, dentists, teachers and police officers. I argue that, in thinking about how we deliver areas, we should actually look beyond the consideration to how we make it more attractive and remote Australia but also to remain in future for rural and remote Australia. Just rural areas. It is far greater than in other areas. practitioners, the fact that they are far higher. call. The number of hours on call is much higher, are typically lower. Another point that is often understated is rural areas, particularly when a partner works needs. We as a community have also got to remote Australia beyond the intent and the should not just be about putting the heavy penalties if they do not remain in rural and over time, we can make it attractive for Australia to take their families there. We are that is before the House today; we are thinking services which go hand in hand with someone Australia. There is a health care crisis in rural and is why we are jointly here today, on both sides shadow minister is right to raise any concerns government should listen to those concerns, not they can improve the delivery of medical up any of the suggestions made by our shadow we are about having the best possible I suggest that the lack of access to timely concern.
