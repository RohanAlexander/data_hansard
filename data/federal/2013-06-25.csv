Although Coles lost expend substantial resources on harassment of dominance. The other issue that we see in our wine-retailing Certainly if someone is buying a smaller quantity price.

Firstly, in the industry. A lot of those mergers and paper written by Professor Evan Jones details a in Adelaide a small market trader of organic organic wines. Coles fought the application in the an adverse judgement in the Supreme Court, the battle, the fact that they were prepared to a minnow is indicative of a strategy of market sector is the issue of price discrimination. of wine they would expect to pay a higher quantity, they would expect to receive a can go to their larger competitors and buy they can get it from a wholesaler, something is the market. That is simply because of price in the liquor and wine retail industry. For many years, we had no effective law to remedied in 2007 when the former Treasurer the Birdsville amendment, legislation written last six years of this government, the ACCC has There have also been examples of geographic This is very important for our farmers only to protect the consumer but also to players to sell to. If they are forced into a of the market, that damages the supply chain. It simply becomes more difficult for a wine to get that label onto the nation's supermarket The other issue that affects our wine producers law is a hangover from bygone years, taken the producers who actually had the market American courts have in many cases overridden it is no longer anticompetitive and against wine producers who would like to market their price. Another law that leads to market concentration regime, anyone who wants to enter the market regulatory barriers that the result is that resources to wade through all the legislation, in the market. These are the risks to our not want to see a situation where our wine producers they are being screwed down to the last penny, they are getting low prices and they are basically face. We must also look at the risks to the consumer wine sales. Despite the theory telling us that what we have seen in our supermarket sector groceries has led to the Australian consumer inflation in the developed world. If we do grocery shelves and those in any other country, some of the highest prices. For consumers who litres per person; for every man, woman and child the increase in market concentration.

Certainly I have no argument with the Winemakers for Braddon for allowing me to put that on say, he was on the Regional Australia Committee Riverina and heard from those people who do locals but on behalf of the nation and our exports. The merger of the two existing wine statutory would create an ability to identify and deliver R&D goals, management efficiency of program government and the industry. That is important industries and all regional industries, is hurting a crisis in confidence in regional Australia having an effect on the psyche of people in confidence. When those business confidence invest and they are not willing to spend. There that things will improve. The softening Australian to ensuring that confidence in regional particularly in agriculture, will improve. Another benefit of merging these two statutory relationship between industry and government. speech that government has not consulted many aspects of legislation.

Industry need to parliament but also that what they do is achieving and generating income and, indeed, Commonwealth to spend is really important, nation is valued. Another benefit will be genuine accountability government requirements. That, too, is communication and strategic alignment between entity. That, too, is absolutely critical, because As I said, it has been under a lot of pressure the global downturn or poor public policy, critical to the Riverina and to all winemaking be critical for the future success of the winemaking to the Riverina.
