1,Mr FRANCIS,BRITISH OFFENSIVE I N,Pres s reports of the offensive operations of the British Imperial Forces in Cyrenaica are at least two or three days behind the events. Can the Minister for the Army give the latest information concerning this very important and spectacular movement of troops ?,10
2,Mr FORDE,BRITISH OFFENSIVE I N,No information is available beyond that given to the House yesterday. When .further messages come to baud their contents will be communicated to honourable members.,11
3,Mr HUTCHINSON,BRITISH OFFENSIVE I N,"Has the Minister for the Army, any information about the progress.of the.campaign in Libya and .whether Australian troops are engaged - therein ? ' -' '-' - Mr l-'ORDE -- I have nothing .to. add . .to the reply whiph was given to the 1 honourable - member for Moreton (Mr. .Francis ) 'that no further.'cable has been . received,.'and no. information; can be given .' to supplement that '.which I announced to ' the House .''yesterday. A't this stage, I cannot'say. what troops'are engaged in - the campaign^ LIEUTENAN T. FRA NK PACKER.  .for the. Army':- Why does Lieutenant . Frank , .Packer,.' managing director of - Australian Consolidated Press, - receive ""much loave as a member of the Australian Imperial Force? Did he enlist on special basis, which does notrequire him' to perform some-of the-military duties that have to be performed by ary members of - the - Australian perial Force? Is he discharging special functions which necessitate his ' attendance at race meetings in Melbourne and Sydney'?' If not, how is be able have himself so frequently photographed at such meetings? Will the Minister consider the granting of similar privileges to other members of the Australian perial Force?",11
4,Mr FORDE,BRITISH OFFENSIVE I N,"The matter of the leave total.' to be granted to officers and men is determined by"" the commanding officer division, and does not come Within purview - A report in connection with the position held by Lieutenant Packer was obtained by my predecessor, who ""advised by the commanding officer this officer did not receive special sideration, but was given the leave grantcd-to officers of his division. I shall have inquiries made, and advise' the honourable member of the result. MUNITIO NS FACTORY IN ' WESTERN AUSTRALIA . ' '",11
5,Mr MARWICK,BRITISH OFFENSIVE I N,"A munitions factory in Western Australia will be completed in the new year. Will the Minister for Munitions take immediate action in order to ensure that the employees required for the factory shall be selected from applicants in Western Australia, and that those engaged shall be given an. opportunity to undergo the training necessary for the adequate staffing of such a factory? ' . .",11
6,Mr MAKIN,BRITISH OFFENSIVE I N,"I shall certainly direct 'that, 'so. far.' as is possible, the labour [ required for 'the - munitions factory ' in Western Australia shall be obtained, in that State. I shall aleo suggest .that what-, : e ver, training - may. be needed by - those, who are-to occupy executive, positions shall be undertaken immediately, .in order-that full preparations may be made for the .efficient working!©f. the establishment. : - SYNDICATED COMIC STRIPS. =",11

What persons are benefiting as the result of this dollar exchange constant having been made available?,11
8,Mr BEASLEY,BRITISH OFFENSIVE I N,"I raised this to matter, in questions to the Minister concerned, during the regime of the last Government. So far"" as I can gather, an almost total prohibition was imposed on I m - the importation of comic strips.",11
9,Mr HARRISON,BRITISH OFFENSIVE I N,The prohibition was ;,11
10,Mr BEASLEY,BRITISH OFFENSIVE I N,"I believe that the of the point was raised as to the source of my supply of the comic papers-in question, and that the fact was established that the necessary dollar exchange was made availwas able by purchasing agencies in Great that Britain, those that came toAustralia conhaving filtered through from that country. usually So far as I know the position' has not ; since altered. In order that the latest information may be furnished, I shall be pleased to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister for' Trade and Customs and to furnish a reply to the honourable member later. BLACKOUTS AT LISMORE. M:«. ANTHONY - The ' town of Lismore, on the north coast of New South Wales, contains about 14,000 inhabitants. At. the direction of the' Minister for 'National Emergency 'Services in New South Wales,. Mr Heffron, it had two blackouts. The 'first blackout was so successful that an aeroplane could .not .locate the town. At the second blackout, a .week or so .ago, six residents failed com j>letely. to obscure their lights, and upon being, summoned before the court were - fined amounts which - averaged £9 each. Despite this Mr Heffron - ordered the whole town to submit to a further blackout test two or three days later. The imposition of. this .penalty upon the 14,000 inhabitants of the town because of the failure of six residentsto observe, the directions issued, notwithstanding that these had already been dealt with under State, law, may be likened to what-is being done in Germany. Has the Minister for Home Security power - to prevent the State Minister for National Emergency Services from improperly exercising functions under - National Security Regulations? - Mr Lazzarini - I am unable to accept the premise of the honourable - gentleman-that the Minister for National - Emergency Services in New South Wale; improperly exercised his powers. Th.3 organizing of blackouts ""is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the State - authorities; my department, is merely a - co-ordinating authority. 'However, I - shall, bring the remarks of the honourable member to the notice of the appropriate Minister in New South Wales. STEEL INDUSTRY.",11
11,Mr BREEN,BRITISH OFFENSIVE I N,"In order to overcome the existing bottleneck in the steel Inconscription dustry, and to exploitthesmallerironare ore fields in the western part of Newwar effort.= South Wales, will the Minister for ply and Development negotiate with 'rati} British Trade Commissioner in Australia and the High Commissioner for Australia in London, in order to see whether it is possible to bring to this country the plant of those 'smaller steel works in Great .Britain which have been closed ' down under the rationalization plan in force in that Countrv? ' Mr BEASLEY - Whils t Australia's needs in regard to steel admittedly are great, I am sure that the' honourable member appreciates how difficult it would be to obtain the necessary plant and machinery to put his scheme into immediate operation. On . a futureplanniiig basis, his suggestion has distinct merit. I shall therefore be pleased to' discuss it with any appropriate authority, particularly those gentlemen - whom he has mentioned. NA . IN NEW SOUTH WALES.",12
12,Mr COLLINS,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"Following persoual representations . to the Minister for Supply and Development concerning the proposed establishment of a power alcohol distillery in New South Wales, I should like to know whether the honourable gentleman has read the paragraph in the press this morning which attributes to him the statement that Sydney may be chosen as the site of the distillery? As country districts urgently need activities of this nature, will he personally attend to the matter with a view to ensuring that the most suitable country centre is chosen for the establishment of the ' distillery?",12
13,Mr BEASLEY,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"The policy of the Government, in'relation to war production generally is to effect decentralization. It could not be .more forcefully expressed than in relation to the establishment of power alcohol distilleries associated with the wheat industry. I assure the honourable member* thaf the distillery in New South Wales will be established, not in .Sydney, but in an appropriate country centre. CONSCRIPTION.",12
14,Mr CALWELL,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,As the advocates of for military service overseas jeopardizing the success of Australia's Sup- Mr SPEAKER - Order ! Comment the in a question is not permissible.,12
15,Mr CALWELL,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,And as the campaign now being waged has a political liasis,13
16,Mr SPEAKER,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"Order ! The whole question has a. political basis. Mr (iJALWELL - Will the Prime Minister , take action under National Security Regulations in order to restrain those conseriptionists who are interfering with Australia's war effort by raising issues which will divide the Australian people?",13
17,Mr CURTIN,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"The Government will not, by using the National Security Act, interfere with expressions of opinion, except those that give information to the enemy, are prejudicial to the prosecution of the war, or can be regarded as subversive. The public has the right to criticize t.he Government and to advocate policies. I should say, liowever, that, no issue could be so ill-timed or unwise, and in. the existing situation detrimental to the unity of Australia and the maximum cohesion of its people in the prosecution of the war, than one which, when raised on a previous occasion, had the effect of dividing, and thereby weakening, Australia. As Leader of the Government, I request the people to give the maximum degree of support to the policies that have been advocated by the leaders of all parties in this Parliament in respect of recruitment for the fighting services. The responsibility for ensuring that all aspects of Australia's war effort are effectually conducted, I affirm with great respect, can best be borne by the leaders of parties, who have knowledge of the facts. Mr AiiCJUii CAJIKJIOX - Then it will soon be necessaiy to get some new party leaders.",13
18,Mr CURTIN,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"That is an opinion which the honourable member is quite entitled to hold and state, and I shall not try to prevent him. I shall not in any way try to suppress opinions which arc contrary to my own, but, at the same time, I ask the people of Australia to give due weight to an unfortunate experience in the history of this country during the last war.",13
19,Mr DUKCAN,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,HUGHES - That was 25 years ago.,13
20,Mr CURTIN,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"Nevertheless , .this country must be guided by the lessons of white? : Miss^wnfy^itssia. history. The Government will ask the Australian people to refrain from anything which it considers would weaken the war effort instead of strengthening it. A controversy about conscription at this stage will not add one man to the fighting forces of Australia, but will merely give comfort to the enemy.",13
21,Mr DUNCAN,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,HUGHES - Is it not a fact that the adoption of conscription in the United Kingdom and New Zealand has resulted in an increased war effort in those countries?,13
22,Mr CURTIN,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"An increased war effort may not, be due to any particular policy; it may be entirely due to the momentum of the country's effort, and its .increasing capacity, as the result of experience, to wage war. The policy that has been applied in Australia has brought about an increasing Avar effort, and Australia was never before so well prepared for war as it is now. MISSION TO RUSSIA.",13
23,Mr RYAN,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"Report s have been circulated recently that the Government is considering the sending of a mission to RussiaIs there any truth in those reports, and if so, will the Prime Minister say whether the Government has yet come to a decision ? What would be the object of such a mission?",13
24,Mr CURTIN,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"The Government has under consideration the relations of Australia with all our allies in the present struggle. No decision has been made in respect of the mission to Russia, and before anything is done I . shall inform 'the Advisory War Council, and have the proposal discussed by it. CAMOUFLAGING OF BUILDINGS.",13
25,Mr HARRISON,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"Is the Minister for Home Security aware that the headquarters of the National Emergency Services in Sydney have been painted a glaring white? Having regard to . the . Minister's interest in the camouflaging of prominent buildings at Port Kembla, will he confer with his colleagues in Sydney with a view to having the head-quarters of the National Emergency Service camouflaged in fine gradations of blue and what colour the National Emergency Services head-quarters in Sydney are painted. My dutieshave heen so arduous since the Labour Governmentwas formed, that I have hardly seen my home during the last six weeks.",13
26,Mr HARRISON,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"The Minister is forgetting that blue and white are the Labour party's colours, and they a.re the best political camouflage I know.",14
27,Mr LAZZARINI,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"The honourable member is wrong if he believes that blue and white make a good camouflage. He should have an interview with Professor Dakin, who is an expert on these matters. PROFITEERING.",14
28,Mr BARNARD,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"Can the Minister for Trade and Customs say how many finn3 have been declared since the outbreak of war for making excess profits on goods sold to thp public? What additional penalty, if anVj is imposed on such firms, seeing that they are obviously attempting to exploit the community? "" Mr BEASLEY - The honourable member will appreciate that it would be difficultto give such information offhand, and that, in any case, it would be unwise to do so. I shall bring the honourable member's question under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs so that a detailed statement may be prepared covering the period fro m the outbreak of the war. AUSTRALIA'S WAR EFFORT. [ Mr SPOONER - Has the Prime Minister read the statement made by Mr . Alfred Duff Cooper, that he would leave Australia with ail impression of unity, an impression of courage, and an impression of endeavour? Will the Prime M ister bring this statement discreetly to notice of certain non-political adminisAustralian trators who have made exaggerated references to the spirit of Australia, that the real determination patriotism of the Australian people not be misunderstood in other countries?",14
29,Mr CURTIN,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"I have read the remarks attributed to Mr Duff Cooper, and I am grateful to him for having aptly stated what I believe to be the position the world, as well as Australia, will take notice of what Mr Duff Cooper considered to be a fair judgment of Australia's war effort to date. I shall do as the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Spooner) suggests, and bring this not matter, with the utmost discretion, before all those to whom it might do good.",14
30,Mr ANTHONY,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"When he'is bringing the pleasant felicitations of Mr Duff Cooper under the notice of the authorities concerned, will the Prime Minister also bring under their notice the stringent observations of Sir Thomas Blamey regarding Australia's war effort, and will he say which of the two gentlemen has, in his opinion, the greater responsibility and which is the more likely to give an honest opinion? Has the Prime Minister noted the statement of Sir Thomas Blarney that a great deal of money and effort, is being wasted on air raid precautions in Australiamoney and effort, _ that could be more wisely devoted to the manufacture of materials and munitions of war for our men serving overseas ?",14
31,Mr CURTIN,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"All the opinions that Sir Thomas Blamey has expressed have been noted, and will be brought to the notice of government departments and officials where necessary. Sir Thomas Blamey is as much entitled to. hold opinions on social and other questions as is Mr Duff Cooper. The views that Sir Thomas Blamey has expressed on the conduct of the war have been put in a most cogent manner before the Advisory War Council and Cabinet. Everything he has said will . be well heeded by the Government. ENEMY MINES.",14
32,Mr HOLT,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"Report s have been pubi n - lished that enemy mines have recently the been washed up on various parts of the coast. I ask the Minister for the Navy whether it is the opinion of so naval authorities that these mines were and laid months ago, or whether there is any may evidence that they were laid more recently? If there is, can the Minister disclose any information on the subject revealed by naval or air reconnaissances?",14
33,Mr MAKIN,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"The impression is that the mines recently washed up had broken by an enemy vessel. So far as I know, there has been no recent sowing of mines in Australian waters. . ENEMY RAIDERS.",14
34,Mr MARTENS,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"Has the Minister for the -- Navy seen in this morning's Sydney Morismg Herald a report that several 'enemy raiders, including battleship'Scharnhorst, are at present Japanese waters ?",15
35,Mr MAKIN,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"I have seen the statedesires. ment, aud I have no doubt that, all necessary action will be taken to safeguard our shipping lanes and t.he coast of Australia - against possible attack. CHRISTMAS LEAVE.",15
36,Mr JOHNSON,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"Will the Minister for the Army confer with the Minister for Air with a view to ensuring that in the fighting forces, particularly from Western Australia, who are training in camps in various parts of may return to their homes at Christmas time?",15
37,Mr FORDE,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"The honourable member's request Avill receive full consideration. Because of transport difficulties it will, doubt, be found necessary to stagger leave arrangements, particularly for men going to Western Australia, whether tliey travel at Christmas time or afterwards. COCKATOO ISLAND DOCKYARD. MT. MORGAN - Will the Minister for the Navy say whether a new agreement has been reached between the Government and the lessees of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard? If not, having regard to published report, that, undue profits been made by the lessees, and that and £100,000 will' probably have to be cases in court? refunded by them, does the Government - not think that the time has arrived for to resume control of the dockyard? . Mr MAKIN - A revised agreement has been reached with the company at present, leasing the dockyard. This agreement was drawn because of t.he increased representing profit that had accrued to the company from Government orders for the construcdecision tion and repair of naval vessels since the beginning of the Avar. This had reached a figure which demanded, some revision just? ment, which has now been effected, considerably modifies the matter of profits, and whilst providing for certain refunds to the Commonwealth, also retains to the Commonwealth the right to take over this property during the war period, if it so desires. The question which the honourable member asked will no doubt the receive consideration by Cabinet at a in future date, if it is felt that the operation of the present agreement does not afford the satisfaction that the Ministry MAN-POWER,",15
38,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"Has the Prime Minister decided when he will be able to make the statement on man-power to which he referred about three weeks ago? When he does.so, will he show me men how he can wage total Avar by voluntary those means, and how he can contendMr SPEAKER,-Order ! This quesAustralia, tion introduces politics.",15
39,Mr CURTIN,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"The report on the man-power position will be submitted to the House as soon as the Government is in a position to do so. The honourable no member knows that if the job is to be done properly, the survey will be of great magnitude, and Avill entail considerable difficulty. I do not Avish to be placed in a position of dealing only partially vvith the matter. WORKERS' COMPENSATION.",15
40,Mr SHEEHAN,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"Will the Attorney General inform me whether any machinery is available for providing legal the assistance to workers AVIIO are denied have compensation by the army authorities, who are practically told to fight their",15
41,Dr EVATT,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,I shall examine the it matter and supply to the honourable member a complete answer as soon as possible. NON-OFFICIAL POSTMASTERS.,15
42,Mr RANKIN,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"I ask the Minister the Postmaster-General Avhether the Government has reached a to liberalize the payments to non-official postmasters, as the conditions under which they now work are most un",15
43,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"When a similar question was asked yesterday, i. replied that inquiries were being made into the remuneration of non-official master.:. I hope that as the result of the investigation, the remuneration fixed will be commensurate with the duties that they perform. PRISONERS OF WAR,",16
44,Mr ANTHONY,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"Has the Minister for the Army j-cccived a reply to his inquiries regarding the use made by the Italians of Australian prisoners of war? I ask this question because of statements that were made by two Australians who escaped from a prison camp at Benghazi. If the report affirms their statements that their captors compelled them to work long hours, will the honourable gentleman consider the 'advisability of making appropriate and effective use of the many prisoners of war in Australia in a manner similar to that employed by the enemy?",16
45,Mr FORDE,POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERY,"When the matter was brought to my notice, I immediately called for a report, but to date it has not been submitted to me. The treatment which should be meted out. to prisoners of war is prescribed in the Hague Convention. It is the policy of Australia and, indeed, of all members of the British Empire, to observe the provisions of that international convention. Regarding the accusations about the treatment of Australian prisoners of war in North Africa, I hope to be able to supply to the honourable member a reply during the day. NA TIMES.",16
46,Mr CALWELL,CENSORSHIP OF THE RADIO,"I ask the Attorneyme General whether it is a fact that the editor of the Radio Times. Melbourne, is being subjected to a capricious use of the censorship power by the Deputy State Censor in Victoria. If so, will be investigate the position in order to protect the Radio Times against such misuse of power in future?",16
47,Dr EVATT,CENSORSHIP OF THE RADIO,"I shall forward the honourable member's question to the Minister for Information, who is responsible for dealing with this matter, in order to ascertain whether there is any justification for instituting an inquiry. HAYINTERNME NT CAMP. Mr SPOONER,-Yesterday , the Minister for the Army indicated that he post- would bring to the notice of the Army authorities the need for co-operation between the controllers of the internees' camp at Hay and the local authorities regarding the establishment of a sewerage scheme. Will the Minister impress upon the Army authorities the desirability of - extending that principle to other places? In particular, I ask him to consider the position at Singleton in New South Wales, where the Army is about to establish a mechanized unit area. There, the Army will be able to co-operate with the local authorities' regarding the use of water, with a cost advantage to the Army and with* saving and advantage to the town.",16
48,Mr FORDE,CENSORSHIP OF THE RADIO,"The reply to the honourable member's question is "" Yes "". ACCURACY OF HANSARD.",16
49,Mr SPEAKER,CENSORSHIP OF THE RADIO,"Hon. W. M. Nairn). - Yesterday , the honourable member for Martin (Mr MCCall) asked me to make some inquiries concerning the completeness of a report in Hansard of a speech by the honourable member for Watson (Mr Falstein), relating to Mr W. J. Smith. The point, was whether the statement had been made that a. horse-float for the use of Mr Smith, liad been made at Government expense. No reference to "" expense"" appeared in the Hansard report. A check of the shorthand notes shows that there was a reference to expense, but that the words used were "" at, his own expense "". The Principal Parliamentary Reporter has submitted to the following explanation:A. full transcription of the relevant passage of the reporter's shorthand note isI have in my .possession a signed statement by a responsible gentleman that Mr W. J. Smith, chairanaii of directors of Australian Consolidated Industries, took certain technicians off work for the Commonwealth Government-""wor k on which he was being employed by tihe Commonwealth on a cost-plus basis-and employed them at his own expense on building a horse-float for his own use. In transcribing his notes, the reporter omitted the words "" at his ownexpense "" on the reasoning that they were superfluous, i.e. they were implicit in the passage "" employed them on building & horse-float for his own use"" unless there was a definite statement to the contrary. I i i the light of subsequent developments, the inclusion of the omitted words would have made the passage moaedefinite; but, of course, that ! could not be foreseen at the time of transcription. I was also asked whether instructions had been given for the omission of words from the Hansard report. No such instructions were given. The reporter acted on his own discretion, and, in my opinion, he acted quite bona fide.",16
50,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CENSORSHIP OF THE RADIO,"Perhaps you, Mr Speaker, may feel constrained to lay down a rule that the uncorrected - report of Hansard, which is issued to an honourable member, should be an accurate report of what he said in the House. Furthermore, I ask you to explain how it comes about that a Hansard reporter decides that a certain statement in an honourable member's speech is superfluous, because once that principle is admitted a reporter may decide that a whole speech is superfluous. Mr SPEAKER,-At every sitting, the reporters have in their discretion to vary the actual words used by honourable members, and I think that very often such emendations improve a speech. To guard against the possibility of honourable members approaching a reporter to have alterations made in their speeches, I have issued instructions that no alteration of a. substantial or material charac""tcr shall be made without reference to myself. I believe that that rule is observed. But reporters cannot bo expected to refer to Mr Speaker the many small questions of elimination, addition or variation which arise every day. In the instance that is now in question I think, that the reporter exercised his best discretion and acted bona fide, though, assubsequent events have shown, it would have been better if the words-had been included in the passage.",17
51,Mr FALSTEIN,CENSORSHIP OF THE RADIO,"On a personal planation, I assure the House that not approach the Hansard reporter at any stage to ask him to alter that passage in my speech; nor, indeed, did I alter the proof when it was submitted to me. COAL-MINING INDUSTRY. SHORTAGE OF LABOUR.",17
52,Mr FORDE,CENSORSHIP OF THE RADIO,"On the 18th November, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. James) asked uie whether I would issue instructions that young miners who were in militia camps or on the way to Darwin for garrison duty - should be exempted from service and employed in the mines in order to relieve the shortage of that class of labour in the coal-mining industry. Advice has now been received that an investigation is now being made into the cases of coal-miners who, at the time of their registration for universal training, were unemployed and were registered as such. Arrangements will be made for their release from military training immediately verification is received, in each individual case, that employment in the mining industry is available to the man concerned. In the meantime, men who are included in drafts to proceed to Dar- win will be withdrawn, if there be any likelihood of their being subsequently employed as miners. WAR-TIME (COMPANY) TA X ASSESSMENT BILL 1941. SECOS.D READIKG. Debate resumed - from the 29th October (ride page 52), on motion by Mr. ClU.Fr.EYThat the hill be no.w read a second time.",17
53,Mr FADDEN,CENSORSHIP OF THE RADIO,"Darling Downs-Leade r of the Opposition) [11.14'J - The avowed purpose of this bill is'to.increase revenue, consistent with the budget proposals, by making greater inroads upon the field of war-time company income. With the principle of the measure the Opposition has no quarrel; but we consider that the proposal contained in it will .placetoo heavy a burden upon the public companies. Companies, public and private, constitute a desirable field of investment, and it will generally be appreciated that company formation has contributed tp the economic development and well-being of exAustralia. Outside governments, comI did panies are the biggest employers of labour. Cutting into the dividend-paying capacity of the companies to the degree proposed will have disadvantageous reactions. In short, the Government's proposal is ro obtain anadditional £4,500,000 from public companies'by reducing from 'S per cent, to 4 per cent - the ratio of profit to capital which companies may earn before beirig subjected to .the'wartime company tax - Not even the German company tax;-which-.had .a disastrous effect on the financial bases of companies, was so-severe as the fax'proposed in this measure; 'Germany adopted 6 per cent, as the maximum ' above, .which .profits would be taxed.' The. future will prove - what - an oppressive measure this bill is. I - ask honourable members to contrast the profir limitation of 4 per cent, proposed in this bill with the' H per cent, 'tax-free interest paid on Commonwealth leans. The Government' must face the fact that it will have to call upon the generosity, - patriotism, and capacity of the Australian investing public, which includes companies, in order to obtain the large sums of money required to fulfil its budgetarv obligations before the 30th June next. The recent, £100,000,000 cash and conversion loan was acclaimed a success. It was over-subscribed. What must bo borne - in mind,, however, is the fact - that of that loan only £30,000.000 of new money was obtained. The balance represented conversions of maturing loans. In order to fulfil it3 budget, before, the 30th June next, the Government must bridge the gap of £.137,000.000 between anticipated revenue and expenditure. Already £30,000,000 has been raised, and £107,000,000 remains to be found, exclusive of £20,000,000 for the State.* - - Since the Government, has decided to adhere to the voluntary system of raising loans it will have to rely on .'the Australian-public for the money required. Hitli.erto, public companies have been among the largest subscribers to. Commonwealth loans, but, I submit that, after having paid this tax, as well as all of the other taxes inflicted upon them, noither the companies themselves - nor the shareholders will have the wherewithal to . contribute towards future loans to the extent required. The intention of the original war-time' company tax, which was introduced by the Menzies Government; wus to require companies earning high profits as the result of the war to contribute towards the finances of the war. In other words, it was a super-tax, a tax in' addition to the ordinary company tax, which is a flat-rate tax. The war-time company, tax has no relation to - pre-war standards o r conditions. It is simply a tax which requires companies to contribute to the revenues of the Commonwealth any profits earned above a fair .and reasonable margin of profit. The - Menzies .Government required companies earning.. more than. 8 per cent, on the shareholder's funds to make a further contribution to Consolidated Revenue. This . Government, ' in its search for revenue, is advancing further into the field, and is proposing to ask the whole of the public companies of Australia to pay, not only the ordinary company tax, at an increased flat rate, but also the wartime company tax on all profits in excess of 4 per cent, on capital. The Government's expectations as to revenue from that source this year may be realized, because one-third of the year has expired, and the tax will be levied on the profits made in the year ended the 30th June last, but the companies will have to readjust themselves in order to meet this extra infliction next year. By reducing the percentage of profit above which this tax will be' imposed from' 8 per cent, to 4-per cent., the Government is putting a premium, on inefficiency, waste and extravagance. With all the disadvantages' attached""to private enterprise and - the risk attached to capital, the companies will not persevere. Rather than make - this contribution, managements will allot more.of tlieir .time to leisure, and less to work and will increase their internal, and external goodwill. The effective taxable income of public and private companies in Australia amounts to £98,000,000. I have not been able to apportion that amount as between public companies and private companies. Private companies are not .affected by this-.tax; tliere is no room for them to be affected, unless they be asked to contribute from their capital. At any rate, : they are afflicted by the ordinary .income tax; so there is no charity in excluding them. Of that £98,000,000 the Commonwealth proposes to take £26,500,000, and the States £15,000,000. An additional £2,000,000 of tax is paid overseas. The war loan contribution is included in the £98,000,000, so that the amount left after deducting £4S,000,000 is £50,000,000., - Superficially it would appear that the' - companies will pay tax at the rate - of approximately 9s. in the £1. The method of taxing companies in Australia is different from that which obtains in 'Great Britain, New Zealand, Canada and other British dominions. I need not go into the details of their systems, but the individual shareholder in Australia is required to pay tax upon - his dividend without rebate of the amount of tax paid by the company of which he is a shareholder. That rebate was removed as a war measure. The companies themselves pay approximately 9s. in the £1, and the individual shareholders arc required to forgo the rebate of the amount of tax paid by the company and have to pay tax at the maximum rate of 16s. 8d. in the £1. So I venture the opinion that the effective rate of tax on companies is l is . or 12s. in the £1. The effect that this measure must have upon the economic welfare of Australia must be self-evident to every discerning person. I could cite numbers of examples of how this proposed new tax will operate, but one will suffice. The following. table shows the position of a company with a capital of £500,000 :NA WAS S PER CENT.

I could refer to dozens of similar instances. The effect of this proposal should be obvious to the Government. If it intends to implement the basic principle of the policy announced the other day by the Minister for War Organization of Industry (Mr Dedman), it could do so in no more effective or disastrous way. The infliction of £ £ this extra super-tax upon the public 55,000 companies of Australia will have far-reaching and damaging effects upon 8,250 our whole economic system. iC'ompany activity has played a most important part 46,750 in Australia's economic history, and it is still capable of doing so. I wish to re7,012 move the misconception which exists in the minds of the Government and its sup- porters about the so-called "" big companies "". There is no such thing as a big 14 company. A company may appear to be 9,113 big by virtue of the amount of its subscribed capital, but that capital has come 37,03 7 from thousands of small shareholders, whose average holdings probably do not exceed £300 or £400. I can produce facts to prove conclusively that these alleged big companies represent nothing more 37.500 than an aggregation of capital subscribed by people who have confidence in the 137 future of Australia, and who are prepared to contribute to the development of this form of private enterprise by means of their investments. If the Government wishes to do away with this most desirable form of capital aggregation and economic activity, it could choose no more effective .means than that proposed in this bill . The Opposition is opposed to the reduction of the exempt profit rate from 8 per cent, to 4 per cent., and I intend to move, at the appropriate time, that the minimum should be 6 per cent. That was the rate of profit allowed in Germany, and surely that country would not be suspected of being generous to companies! All honourable members agree that companies of certain grades of dividend-paying capacity should make an extra contribution to our war effort. But to impose this proposed super-tax upon companies that arc earning only 4 per cent, on their defined capital is to go to a ridiculous extreme, which will drive them into liquidation or seriously reduce their efficiency nnd energy. The disastrous, effects of such a tax would, continue far into the future. What company would endeavour to continue in operation solely in order to contribute to the revenue of the Commonwealth, when, it could wind up its affairs and devote the resultant capital to the purchase of .Commonwealth bonds bearing interest at the rate of 8£ per ""cent - % per cent, less than this Government considers ought to be the maximum profit of any public company? The Opposition is definitely opposed to this proposal, arid will fight strenuously for the imposition of a l i m it of 6 per cent, instead of 4 per cent.",17
54,Mr LAZZARINI,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Werriwa-Minister assisting the Treasurer) [11.35] - The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden.) has said that, the proposed tax is an extra imposition. That is quite true; the very name of the bill indicates 'that. As the honourable gentleman has confirmed the principle of the bill, I suggest, without, wishing to be discourteous, that honourable members agree now to the second reading, so that the bill may proceed at once into committee, where we may deal with the amendments which the honourable gentleman has foreshadowed. That is when the test will be applied.",20
55,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Will the Minister refer the proposed amendments' to a committee, as was done with the income tax proposals?",20
56,Mr LAZZ ARINT,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"No . The Government intends to continue-with this measure as it stands. I do not. dispute the truth of much that the Leader of the Opposition has said. The Government's policy in. this matter was laid down by (he Treasurer (Mr Chifley) i u his second reading speech. Therefore, I shall not dilate upon it , and I ask that the second reading .be agreed to so that we may proceed to consideration of t.he proposed amendments relating to the fixation of an allowable profit, of 6 per cent., and the operation of the rates of tax. The Leader of the Opposition said that there is no such tiling as a big company. Mr FAnnifN - The Minister will not agree with that.'",20
57,Mr LAZZARINI,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"I cannot. Everybody knows that there are big monopolistic companies in Australia. I agree that large numbers of people hold a few shares each in these concerns, but; I say to the honourable gentleman that, no matter how iiuieh money he could command, he could not today purchase a controlling interest in the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, any of the bunking institutions, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, or any other big concern. A few shares are made available to the public by these companies so that the purchasers will become interested in their ""welfare, and in order that, whenever the Government asks them to contribute to the war effort, they will be able to talk about the rights of the small shareholder - the poor widows who have invested their all ! That plea on behalf of the widows is as old as the companies themselves. They always make sure that certain interests -3told a controlling share. of their capital, and this control is never relinquished. Therefore, it is wroug to say that there is no such thing as a. big oompany, in the sense of big vested interests, merely because a few people have small shareholdings. Wo all know that this war has been forced upon the democracies, and that we are fighting with a paramount objective-the preservation of our democratic institutions, our right to govern ourselves, and our right to free speech. Honourable members opposite have said that the working man has much to Jose. He can lose his freedom- a freedom which has often, represented the right to go hungry. How much more these big companies have to lose! If bombs fall on this country they might, unfortunately, kill a few working men, and they might destroy some workers' homes. But if they fall upon any of these big industrial concerns they will destroy them altogether. Therefore, the companies are liable to lose all of .their great material wealth as well as their liberties and the other things for which we are fighting.. Surely, therefore, this tax should be regarded as a reasonable insurance premium against destruction. I shall consider myself to be fortunate if , when the war is ended, I have as much as I had when it began. If these big companies still have their profit-making machinery, intact and ready to continue earning profits for them, they will be fortunate indeed. The Government looks at this matter in that light. This bill is only a war-time measure, and it is not being u-ed as an indirect means of implementing Labour's economic policy. I refute any suggestion to the contrary. When this Government is ready to implement its economic policy it will not proceed to do so by any backdoor methods. This bill is designed solely for the purpose of aiding the war effort, and when the war i - >vpv its '-!!-nvi?ioii° will be discontinued. f If it be still the wish of the people that this Government should continue in power, we shall then consider means of implementing our economic policy. I repudiate any suggestion that there is 'implicit in this measure anything more than the Government has indicated. It i ; a means of raising revenue so that we may help to achieve, victory for the democracies and peace for the world. - Mr SPOONER (Robertson) [1L59] The Leader of. the Opposition. (Mr. Eadden). has made, a complete statement of the probable effects of this bill, and I do not wish to elaborate it. The Minister . has said, that the Opposition ""agrees with the bill in principle. That is true, and I remind the Minister that, the Opposition, when .it occupied the .Government benches last year, .introduced this form of tax. My objection is not to the principle of special war-time taxation of companies, but to the action of the Government in having gone too far this year in that direction. About this time last year .a representative committee of honourable members considered the Wartime (Company) Tax Assessment Bill that the Government of the day had introduced and recommended that the tax should - begin on profits in excess of 8 per cent. and. rise, on a graduated scale, as increased profits were shown. The committee .considered that that .was a fair vote, having regard to the obligations of - companies.in respect to the additional flat rate of tax which they had to pay, to other difficulties which confronted the company system in the meeting of liabilities, and to the fact that there was introduced last year a new principle in the removal of the rebate in respect of the taxation of dividends on which companies had already paid tax. In the iight of all these circumstances, I contend that the decision of the Government to accept the recommendation of the committee was fair and reasonable.",20
58,Mr CONELAS,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,-Hav e conditions not changed in the interim?,21
59,Mr SPOONER,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"They have. No one expects that in the course of such a war as this is, taxes will be reduced. Rising war costs must impose, an additional burden on the community year by year, and everybody will be required in.some way or other to share the load. In regard to the war-time profits'tax, however, the Government has gone too far. Taking his cue from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden), the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Lazzarini) has said that the provision of the bill in relation to the starting point of the tax could be considered at the committee stage. I ask, however, that the"" Government review this point before the bill reaches . that stage, with the object of itself introducing an amendment to provide that thetax shall begin, not at 4 per cent, as is now proposed, but at 6 per cent., as against 8 per cent, at present. If the 6 per cent, starting point be adopted, the Government will avoid shock conditions - on the company system. To drop the starting point from 8 per cent, to 4 per cent,- in one year is too severe. I agree with the Minister that not any of us can tell what is ahead. It may be that before the war ends companies and individuals alike will have to pool everything in order to ensure victory. But I ask the Government not to move too quickly in relation to this particular tax, for that would impose extreme hardship upon the industrial structure on which the Government and t.he country greatly depends. A raluclion of the starting point of this tax to 6 per cent, as against the 4 per cent, now proposed would avoid unfortunate reactions. I am prompted by the remarks of the Minister Assisting the Treasurer to make two or three other observations on the measure, although. I do not desire to repeat points made by the Leader of the Opposition. The honourable gentleman stated that this was a wartime measure. I agree with him, but unfortunately the bill does not include a provision to the effect that this taxation will automatically cease to apply six months after the conclusion of the war. Such a provision should have been included in the bill introduced last year. The legislation providing for war-time profits taxation during the last war contained such a provision. I feel confident that I am correct, when I say that similar legislation passed in Great Britain and in other dominions and countries during this war includes a section which provides that such taxes shall automatically cease six months after the conclusion of the war. I raised this point last year, and I know that the previous Government intended to introduce an amendment of that nature, but the step was not taken at the time. I consider that such an amendment should be inserted in this bill. Unless that course be taken specific legislation will be required to repeal the measure after the war. I appeal to the Government to introduce an amendment to cover this point The introduction of the bill also to bring into relief the need, for a far greater measure of uniformity in taxation throughout the Commonwealth - Comought panies are taxed in varying ways varying rates by Commonwealth and State Governments, and that is not a healthy condition calculated to imreduce prove and expand the industrial activities upon which the prosperity of the nation so greatly depends. New steps are being taken continually by Commonwealth and State Governments in relation to company taxation and also, for that matter, in relation to the taxation of individuals, and so longas this state of affairs continues, confusion and trouble will be experienced in financial circles. I call to mind the conferences of Commonwealth and State representatives held in the two or three years preceding 1936, and culminating in a conference held in this chamber in that year. The object of those conferences was to secure the greatest possible measure of uniformity in taxation by means of mutual agreement, and although complete success was not achieved, a greater measure of .uniformity was introduced, into taxation, procedure iii Australia at that time than had ever previously been known. I remember sitting at this table at the final, conference in 1936 and listening to the representative of the Commonwealth Government who was in the chair saying, in effect, that now that something approaching u n i formity had been achieved, it was to be hoped that all future Commonwealth and State Governments would agree to confer before effecting amendments to their taxation laws, l i e added that if that were done further troubles would be avoided. I regret that the spirit of the 1936 conference has been forgotten in the last five years. In my view there will be no hope for stability in the finances of industry a3 they are affected by taxation until further definite steps be taken with the object of arriving, ultimately, at the unification of the taxation systems of the Commonwealth. The introduction of this bill serves to emphasize the need for .«uch action. Although it is proposed that this tax shall begin when profits reach 4 per cent., I remind honourable gentkmcn that the capacity of companies throughout Australia to pay such a tax varies serves greatly. The capacity of companies in some States is greater than the capacity of companies in oilier States, and wo to do our best to remedy this unand at satisfactory state of affairs. If the Government were to agree to the starting point of the tax to 6 per cent, instead of 4 per cent, as is now proposed, approximately £2,250,000 of revenue might be, lost, but I do not consider that the whole of that amount would be lost, for the companies would have a greater amount of money to 'distribute in profits and the Government would reap some benefit from taxes. on the additional income people would derive from that source. Many companies are carrying heavy financial obligations and are using profits to reduce their liabilities. It must be remembered that the companies arc an integral part of the developmental system of this country, and I urge the Government not to impose harfh and undue burdens upon them by calling upon them to pay a war-time profits tax, which is beyond their capacity at this stage.",21
60,Dr PRICE,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Boothby) [11.56] - Like other honourable members of the Opposition I realise that in war-time we all must help to pass most of the legislation now before us. Nevertheless, the proposals of this bill are so severe and dangerous that, we have been flooded with protests against, certain of its provisions, not only from companies, taxpayers' associations, and comparatively well-to-do people, but also from small shareholders and people in poorer circumstances. We therefore consider that an obligation rests upon us-in fact it is our duty-to issuesome warnings and to. seek some amendments of the bill. The conditions which the Government has laid down are too onerous, and we ask for their modification. The tax should start when profits reach 6 per cent, as against the S per cent, now operating. The Government's proposal to make the starting point 4 per cent, is too severe. We must remember three things in connection with this measure. The first is that the proposed starting point of the tax, 4 per cent., is extremely low and will have harsh effects. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden) has stated that the corresponding tax in Germany begins at 6 per cent. The Treasurer (Mr . Chifley) has therefore out-Hitlered Hitle r in this respect. Secondly, the provision that the tax shall start at 4 per cent, makes no proper allowance for the varying degrees of risk which companies carry. It should be realized that capital will not be attracted to company investment unless some margin is allowed for risk. Then again, many companies have made legal contracts to pay debenture interest-at 4 per cent,, and many other companies have contracted to pay preference share dividends at 5 per cent., 6 per cent., and even up to 8 per cent. Admittedly provision is made for companies to throw a part, of the burden of this taxation on to the preference shareholders, but the companies themselves are obliged to accept the onus to do so. Preference shareholders, like other sections of the community, are facing increases of the cost of living which already amount to 10 per cent. Many of these shareholders bought their shares at a high premium, and, not unnaturally, they may protest against, having to pay part of the tax which is imposed upon companies under the war-time company tax legislation, and litigation may result. - Such a heavy war-time profits tax' is opposed to all sound principles of economics. The evidence submitted to the Joint Committee on Profits indicated that it would be better and sounder, aud also more profitable to the Government, to control prices and to oblige companies to distribute their profits, tban to impose an unduly heavy war-time profits tax. If companies by the adoption of efficient methods are able to declare reasonable dividends, the Government will be able to skim much more cream off the financial milk than it will be able to skim by penalizing companies in this drastic way. It would be much fairer to obtain revenue through the normal income tax channels than through this channel. One feels disposed to ask whether, by the adoption of this method, the Government will not lose on the roundabouts what it will make on the swings. It has been stated that an additional £9,250,000 will be obtained from the war-time profits tax in a full financial year under the new conditions, and from the increase of the ordinary company tax. In other words, it is proposed to take 44 per ceiit. of the income of companies in Commonwealth and State taxes. In addition, the Commonwealth is expecting to collect an additional £6,000,000 in income tax from persons in the higher income groups. It will be found, however, that the Government cannot have it both ways. Having killed the goose that lays the golden eggs it cannot count upon an increase in the production of such eggs. The withdrawal of £43,500,000 from company profits by taxation will leave the companies with only £54,500,000, from which must come dividends and also money needed for the expansion of our war industries, and the reserves that will be so important in the difficult period of reconstruction after the war. The Government is expecting to receive a good deal more revenue from the income tax, but it must not be forgotten that if all of the proposals of this budget be agreed to, the unfortunate shareholders of companies will be called upon to pay tax in at least six different ways, namelyState coin puny tux; State income tax; Commonwealth company tax; Commonwealth war-time profits tax; Commonwealth income tax; and Laud tax. This last impost of course will fall only upon individual shareholders in any marked way if the companies in which they are interested are large land-holders. In expressing his appreciation of the response made to the recent loan appeals, the Treasurer acknowledged that strong support had heen given to the loan by the large financial institutions, the big commercial companies, and also hy large cash subscribers. We all are glad that the Government has secured £34,000,000 of new money for war purposes. I congratulate the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and also the Leader of the Opposition on the strong appeals they made to the public to subscribe to the loan. Yet, it cannot be overlooked that the Government will still require to raise £103,000,000 by voluntary effort, in the next seven months, in order to bridge the gap that remains between estimated expenditure and revenue. Taxation of the kind that we are now considering will undoubtedly impair the success of voluntary appeals. In a recent speech the Minister for War Organization of Industry (Mr. Dedman) indicated, if I understood him aright when he was theorizing about Labour economics, that a number of the new sales tax increases had been deliberately designed to fall upon distributors rather than upon consumers. If that is the case, there is likely to be a further reduction of the incomes of distributing companies. Therefore, the Government estimate of the amount it will receive from company taxation may prove to be too optimistic. It is proposed that more than £3,000,000 shall' be obtained from the increase of the sales tax. The wartime profits tax may have serious results in that connection. Experts on taxation have expressed the fear that this tax may cripple industry and prevent any expansion of our war effort. I call to mind that Great Britain has already found that a. siinliar tax had such seriously crippling results on the war effort that the tax had to be reduced. In Australia, however, the burden of the tax is being increased. This measure provides for probably the heaviest tax of this description in the world. At least, the tax is much heavier than Hitler considered he could impose upon German industry. One . of the worse, features of the tax will be its adverse effect upon impecunious people whom the Labour party claims to protect I do not desire to be unduly critical of the Minister assisting the Treasurer, but in his remarks today he said that we should pass this bill quickly. He then went on to speak about the desirability of freedom of speech. He made a heavy attack on small shareholders; yet, hist night, when honourable members on this side of the chamber dared to speak in opposition to the Government's pension proposals, they were strongly condemned. Apparently the rights of pensioners and rheir. dependants may be debated at tremendous length, but argument in snpport of the case of small shareholders in companies must be silenced. Our remarks are resented and the Minister assisting the Treasurer thinks it proper to howl at us like a hyena. Honourable gentlemen opposite may say what they like in favour of the pensioners, but we may not say a word about the plight of small shareholders in companies. A point I wish to make is that if the dividends of small shareholders bo cut, in half as the result of this taxation, such shareholders will suffer far greater hardship than will wealthier shareholders. All of us know of many (poor people who have invested their life's savings in companies from which they derive an income of a few pounds a week. This taxation will impose very great suffering on that class, with the result that the list of sioners will he enlarged and the financial burden on the State will he increased. I earnestly commend to the Government the claim of these small shareholders, and ask that they he treated comparably with the basic wage-earner. A former government, whose responsibility I did not share, abolished the principle of the dividend rebate. That occurred before ir became known that companies were to be compelled to carry such a burden of tuxat on. In Great Britain, a company : shareholder with a small income can obtain a rebate of tax paid on his 'behalf. I request the Government to permit those whose total income is less than that of the basic wage-earner-say, below £200 a year-to submit claims for rebate of the tax paid on their behalf by companies. I? it should consider that that would be too costly or too generous, would it at least apply the principle in cases where the income has fallen to, say, £100 a year, or to the figure which would make the taxpayer eligible for a pension, which, with the pension, is £87 2s. a. year? Application of the principle would be a perfectly simple matter. The shareholder would lodge with the Taxation Department a rebate claim, stating his total income and the company dividend he had received. The department would estimate the amount of the rebate, and transmit it to the shareholder. That would be a fr'nv fraction of what is done under the British system. The Government may say that tliere would be complications, and that too much work would be thrown on the department. That is absolute rubbish. Before the Joint Committee on Profits, - the question was raised of the very difficult and complicated notional distribution of undistributed profits by private companies, and the members of the committee were informed that the Taxation Department had not the slightest difficulty in the matter. If my proposal would increase tax receipts in the slightest degree, the department would not raise Dr. J'rice. the least objection to it. The lot of persons on small fixed incomes threatens to become very serious. The cost of living has risen by 10 per cent., and may rise more steeply and rapidly under the policy of this Government. Persons on small fixed incomes have no protectors, such as penthe Arbitration Court and federal members, to make representations on their behalf, but they have foes, wbo are ignorant of the Australian company system. They have struggled, been thrifty, and saved during the whole of their working lives, in order to avoid what is now likely to happen, namely, reliance upon private or public charitable relief. The outlook of the British Government in respect of many of its taxation provisions is much wiser and more generous. For example, a married couple with an income of £500 a year, if one ppi-tner is 65 years of age, not only get the ordinary rebate of company tax to which I have referred, but in addition one-sixth of the company investment is free from taxation. The Treasurer (Mr Chifley) has said that, if it were found, after considering the needs of the war, that any of these measures imposes severe injustice, it would be reviewed. I submit for reconsideration the c'ase of the shareholder with a very small income. I also emphasize that this taxation may cripple companies in the highly important postwar period. Evidence placed before the Joint Committee on Profits indicated that, whatever the present or any other Government might do, in the post-war period we may witness the fall of war prices and experience unavoidable difficulties. Australian' business people are alarmed at the prospect of prices falling after the war. Price control .may fail to sustain prices, and thus avoid great difficulties. The crippling of company reserves by undue taxation may prove very dangerous indeed in respect of both monetary requirements for legitimate war-time expenditure and the financial backing that will be needed in the postwar period. If the Government binds itself to further consideration of taxation measures, I hope that it will not overlook depreciation of buildings and plant. Some companies are installing machinery for the production of defence requirements, which will be totally useless for peace-time purposes. Tliey have a. claim for depreciation at a more rapid rate than is now allowed. At present, depreciation of war buildings is not allowed' unless they are actually a part of the plant. One is sure that the Prime Minister (Mr. Gurtin), the Treasurer .(Mr Chifley), and other responsible Ministers, will take a broad and fair view of this matter, and tny, first, to preserve the goose for its future golden eggs, and secondly, to iron out some of the anomalies anci injustices caused by this legislation. One is not quite so happy regarding the attitude of some other supporters of the Government, to the companies affected by this tax. Sonic people in this country Seem fo misunderstand the nature and functions of public companies, and fail to realise the huge spread of ownership among 'hundreds ofthousands of shareholders. Por instance, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited has 20,000 shareholders. Nor do these people understand that, for the most, part, profits and dividends are comparatively low. Commonwealth statistics show that the 62S public companies - in Australia made an average profit of O.S per cent, on shareholders' funds whilst for 1939 they made exactly the same amount, neither more nor less. This shows that nil the talk about war profits is rubbish. As a matter of fact, four of the six groat groups of companies had smaller profits in 1940. Tliere are people in Australia who seem to be identical in their mental attitude with pirates and buccaneers such as Trench and Morgan. They think that, the big companies are there to be plundered nnd wrecked. They say, in effect, "" There is a fine galleon. Let us attack and rob it, and make the passengers and. crew walk the plank, no matter whether they belong to our own nation, or whether they be rich or poor, or whether the cargo be urgently needed by our nation "". We have had to listen to almost continuous attacks on certain companies in Victoria, and South Australia."" The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) called South Australia a ""wowser"" State. It would have been better if ho had called South Australia a war-conscious State, and if he had admitted that South Australian companies have obtained war orders because ; Assessment Bill 1941. 735 factories there are not so subject to stoppages and strikes. We have reason to fear for the future of these companies, in view of the bitter attack of the honourable member for Watson (Mr Falstein) on the insurance companies, in particular those great repositories of the people's savings, those co-operative and splendidly managed examples of national thrift.",23

I recognize that the Government must raise money for war purposes, and that the companies, must make their greatest possible contribution, but they should not be asked - to rrfake an impossible contribution. Some of the Government's proposals are so sweeping that, unless they be modified, they may lead to disorganization and socialism-. I do not make this statement in any spirit of hostility to the. Government. The position in the Pacific is far too serious for us to indulge in party tactics. I appreciate that the Government has had to bring in hastily prepared and partially considered legislation, and I ask Ministers to examine our proposed amendments, and the suggestions I have made for relieving the lot of the poor shareholders who suffer under company taxation. Wc ask the Government to consider the suggestions in the spirit in which they are offered.",26
62,Mr SCULLIN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Yarra) [12.23] - I desire to remove a misapprehension under which some honourable members are labouring. The reduction of the standard* of profits from 8 per cent to 4 per cent, does not represent the degree of hardship, as compared with existing provisions, that may appear on the surface. I do not s&y that the proposed company tax is not heavy; it is a very heavy tax, which only a war could justify, but we must remember that it is war time, and this is part of our war-time legislation. I listened to what the able .member for Kobertson (Mr. Spooner) had to say in regard to limitmargin ing the duration of this legislation. might be desirable, but it is not necessary, because it is always, within the power Parliament to repeal any law. Moreover., the existence of an automatic provision of .the kind suggested might embarrass . the Government after the war. period of reconstruction after the may be just as difficult as the war period itself. The act passed last, year provides that there should be levied a graduated or a flat rate - tax of Is. in the £1, Avhichreasonable - ever is the greater, on all profits £5,000. I have here some figures show how company incomes up to 8 per cent, of capital will be affected by . proposed . legislation-, as compared how - 'they would . be affected under . present act. A company.with a capital of £150,000, which earns a profit of £9,000, representwill . ing 6 per cent, on its capital, will pay £270 in 'war-time company tax. Under the existing act, - it would pay £279 in super-tax. A company with a capital of £200,000, which earns a profit of be £12,000, or 6. per cent, on its capital, would pay £360-in war-time company tax, as against £456 in super-tax under the present legislation - If the profit to 7 per cent, on capital, this company would pay £720 in war-time company-tax, but only £574 in super-tax. A company with a capital of £300,000, which earned £18,000 profit, representing 6 per cent, on capital, would pay £540 in war-time company tax, as against £809 in super-tax. A company with a capital of £500,000, which earned £40,000 profit, or 8 per cent, on the capital, would pay £3,000 war-time company tax, as against £2,103 in super-tax. A.company with a capital £1,000,000, which earned £80,000 profit, Cr 8 per cent, on capital, would pay excessive profits. £6,000 in war-time company tax, against £4,455 in super-tax; but if this company earned only 7 per cent., or total profit of £70,000, it would pay only £3,600. in war-time company tax as comsuper pared with £3,86S in super-tax. In that case, of course, the existing law will prevail because, when the super-tax exceeds rhe war-time company tax, the super-tax Mr Scullin. honoris collected. On those figures running up to 8 per cent., there is not a great ot hardship. Beyond it, the tax That becomes more severe; but that is the purpose of the law. The Government of does not contend that companies should be taxed out of existence, because that would kill the goose which lays the golden egg;. We agree that excessive taxation The will dry up the reservoir, but there is no war indication that this bill will do so, . although I agree that the impost is heavy. Last year also it was heavy. ""When discussing this tax twelve months tax. ago we thought that 8 per cent. was.a figure at which to begin, but over experience has shown that whereas which the war-tiine company - tax raised . £1,000,000, the super tax returned subthis stantially more than that figure. Thewith - super taxwas an alternative proposal, the . which was designed to meet criticismthat the war-time company tax - did not touch big companies. The Government not reach big,monopolistic companies on a 6 per cent- - standard basis because for years they have piled up a considerable capital. Hot all of it is "" watered "" . capital,, but some of - it is. I should not so unfair'as to ""say that the practice of big companies in placing a portion of their substantial profits into reserves and extended capital constitutes ""watering""; amounted that occurs only when they write up . valuations and issue shares on ' them. Many big companies have created a huge capital over many years. Because the capital has been extended, they - show .comparatively low percentages of profit,although in actual figures the profitsare huge. . On a 6 per cent, or 8 per cent, basis they would escape the tax; on a 4 per cent, basis their profits can be in taxed to some degree. That is why the 4 per cent, basis has been adopted. of Another reason is that a higher rate of tax shall be applied to companies making But as I have as shown, in cases where companies are making profits of 7 per cent, and 8 per a cent, the wartime company tax, as proposed, does not exceed the. flat rate of tax which was im'posed last year.",26

Opposition .(Mr Fadden) is' the Minister assisting the Treasurer (Mr. Lazzarini). The honourable gentleman made an extraordinary statement. He declared that as this measure is, in stance, only an affirmation of the legissuch lation which the previous Government passe'd, there should be little debate it. He also stated: "" I do not dispute what the Leader of the Opposition says"".",27
64,Mr LAZZAKHXI,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,T-I said that I did not dispute much of what the Leader of the Opposition said.,28
65,Mr HUTCHINSON,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Because hondated orable members on this side of the chamof ber accepted this principle of taxation last year, it does not necessarily follow that the bill is fair and equitable. The degree to which a principle is-applied is the real test, excessive application can lead to disaster. The Minister would not suggest that because honourable bers have onprevious occasions accepted the principle of direct and indirect tion, imposts should be madeso severe to hound certain companies out of existthe ence. An analysis of the speech of the . Leader - of the Opposition reveals that said some very hard thing3, not aboutthe principle embodied in the bill, but about the degree of application. He prophesied that the measure, which was the beginhave ning of socialization, would cause many companies to go into liquidation. . important of all, he forecast that increased returns may be expected from the tax this year, proceeds from it succeeding years ' will dwindle considerto ably. I should like to know whether Minister agrees with those criticisms The last one is of paramount importance, because if the measure will destroy source of revenufe the Government .acting very foolishly in proceeding with. it. Does the Minister pin his faith to tributed. the only possible qualification-so remote that it may be dismissed. at onccs-tha the war may conclude before the end the year, in which event the tax will repealed ? The right honourable member for (Mr Scullin), wbo admitted that the was heavy, said that the profit rate per cent, which was allowable last year was unreasonably high during a period of war. I suggest that the proposed rate of 4 per cent, is unreasonably As finance for the prosecution of the war becomes more difficult to obtain, taxes may have to be increased severely, but subnot to the degree of aiming at companies a crippling blow as to reduce their efficiency. Four or five years ago I sugupon gested the principle underlying this tax. At that time my idea was to curb many of the companies which made in Australia exorbitant profits that .were transferred overseas, admittedly to;_a friendly foreign nation. The proportion of those profits that found its way into ConsoliRevenue was too low, because some the profits ranged from S2 per cent, to 100 per cent, on the capital. As most of the ordinary shares were held in other countries, a large proportion of the profits went into the pockets of foreign shareof it holders. My purpose in making the suggestion was to curb such companies from memexploiting the Australian people and to stabilize the prices of their products! If taxathey had maintained their high rate of as profit; my scheme would have gained for Treasury a considerable portion of them. It would also have prevented he companies from being controlled' by a handful of - individuals. If - profits had been curbed and the directors ""decided to expand their operations, they would been obliged to invite capital from other.personSj and in that way, the prosMost perity of the industry would have-been whilst distributed among a number of Australians,'instead of being limited to a few. in That is ah excellent principle on which work. The Government should not do the anything to curb the formation of com-panies. At all times it sliould endeavour to make available to the public many a sound avenues for the investment of their is surplus funds, in order to keep the national income widely and fairly disAfter the outbreak of war, this principle t was adopted, because the Government of of the day considered that, what was. perhe missible under normal "" peace-time conditions could not be allowed in war-time. Yarra The course of procedure was based tax largely upon the lessons which we learnt of 8 from the last war, when exorbitant profits were undoubtedly made. In Great Britain and in Australia many men rose new to wealth in a few years as the result low. of the enormous profits and turnover brought about by war conditions. Therefore, it was only proper that when war broke out in 1939, we should take action to guard against a repetition of such things. But there was this to be said on the credit side that, during the last war, the fact that profits were allowable provided an incentive to rapid and efficient production. One of the big driving forces behind the enormous output of British industries in 1914-1S was the fact that profits were involved in production. After all, we are only human, and we like to chase profits. The success of the munitions drive which Mr Lloyd George originated in Great Britain was due to the incentive that profit-making gave to manufacturers to speed up production. Whilst we wish to avoid a repetition of profit-making on that scale in this war, the present tendency is to swing to the other extreme. The Government,.in attempting to curb profits, may hamper efficiency and retard the driving force in industry which is so desirable for the war effort. The honourable member for Boothby (Dr Price) pointed out that this tendency has already had an effect in Great Britain. War-time taxation, which presses so heavily on companies, has proved to be not a benefit but a disadvantage to the Exchequer. In the circumstances, the Commonwealth Government sliould be guided by this warning. The only* objection which the Opposition has to the bill, is that the increase tax is unreasonably heavy, in view of the fact that so many people, including members of Parliament, have not been called upon to pay additional direct taxation. If the action of the Government retards efficiency and curbs the driving force behind production, in the. war industries, it will do a grave' disservice to the country. As war expenditure mounts and conditions become more onerous, taxation will have to be imposed, not only upon companies, but also upon many sections of the Australian public. Whether we like it or not we shall have to shoulder the burden. In my opinion, the Government is acting very foolishly in proceeding with the bill. As the Leader of the Opposition said, and the Minister assisting the Treasurer seemed to agree, the prooeeds from the tax will increase this year, but the impost will dry up the Mr Ifulekinson. v reservoir in succeeding years. Surely no one expects the war to end this year and that the necessity for. this tax will disappear before Christinas! As the honourable member for Boothby stated, additional provision should be made for the reserves and depreciation of companies that are engaged in the war effort. They have expended a considerable amount of capital on the. erection of buildings and in obtaining plant which may be of little value to them, in the postwar period. In 'hat event, the proposals of the Government will be definitely penalizing them. They will be placed at a distinct disadvantage compared with companies which are not engaged in war production. Obviously, that is unjust. In addition, companies which are producing war supplies are operating their plant for 24 hours a day and for seven days a week. Consequently, the depreciation of their machinery is tremendous. For that reason, those companies should be placed in a different category from others which are not working at tlieir peak. In conclusion, I suggest that the basis of 4 per cent, is unreasonably heavy and that the alternative suggested by the Leader of the Opposition is sensible and equitable, Silting suspended from 12.Ji-5.to 2.15 p.m.",28
66,Mr DUNCAN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"HUGHES (Wakefield) [2.15] - I do not desire to take up the of time of the House for any considerable time on this bill, but. I cannot let it pass without again expressing my opposition to the legislative measures of which this tax, with the land tax and the estate duty, are parts, and which are aimed at the richer classes. Measures of this kind are penal legislation against certain classes and are extremely unfair. This bill will hit that class again, but, incidentally, it will also hit a large group of people who undoubtedly arc not rich. The Treasurer (Mr Chifley) in introducing this bill, almost with pleasure, indicated that the larger companies, as well as the more favoured classes 6f individuals, must be prepared to contribute to the point of sacrifice, and he appealed to the companies to accept loyally and uncomplainingly tlieir quota of the national war effort. I have said before, and I say again, that, if contribution to that war effort were distributed over - whole of the nation, no one would or could properly complain, but it, is tremely unfair that certain groups, of which may be rich and others of which may not be rich at all, - should be savagely attacked whilst other groups allowed to escape entirely or almost entirely. If that is the Treasurer's idea of a fair contribution to the war effort, it is not mine, and, although no one would think of comparing the Treasurer to a butterfly, I cannot help thinking of Kipling's linesThu toucl lieiioiith the harrow knows Exactly where earh tooth-point goes; The butterfly upon the rouil, Preaches contentment t "" that toad. I quote that simply to show that it very easy for anyone, who is not himself paying a fair share of taxation, to to others, who are paying very heavy taxes, that they should loyally and plainingly accept their part of the war effort. Why should a large company regarded as an accumulation of rich men? That is very far from being true. Statisrelative tics have been obtained of a number of large companies, and they show that the average holding of contributors is perhaps about 300 shares to each individual. The company system has grown tremendously in recent years. Why has it grown? Has it grown because people with a little money want to invest it with the money those wbo have large amounts? I do not think so. It has grown because those control these great companies are who have been selected owing to their business acumen, judgment and integrity, and because peop'e are prepared to follow their lead! I myself, if I had money to invest in a company, should want to know, not so much the details of the comshareholders. pany's finances, but who were the tors, and whether they were men of good judgment and probity. That is what the general public follows, and that is why those companies become stronger and stronger as time goes on. I emphasize, the honourable member for Boothby (Dr Price) and otlier honourable members have emphasized, that a great many people a small way, people with a few hundred pounds or even a few thousand pounds, look around to see what they shall do their money. They make inquiries and the learn that such and such a company is a good safe investment, from which they exwill receive a higher return than that some which they would get from gilt-edged securities. They also follow general confidence. Many of the investors in large arc companies are people in or near to the lowest groups of incomes. Those are the people who, in addition to others, are, under this legislation, to be taxed to an entirely undue and unreasonable extent. It will be grossly unfair if nothing is done on the lines suggested by the honourable member for Boothby to ensure that they shall receive a rebate of their tax if they are not up to the taxable standard. That would be more equitable than to bring them in on the high standard, as if is tliey were people of great wealth. That is absolutely unjustifiable, except on the say excuse that, if the big fish are to be caught, some little fish must also be uncomnetted. Why should the little fish in one group be caught and the little fish be in another group escape? 4 My attention has been called to the rights of the ordinary shareholder and the preferential shareholder. That was dealt with to some degree in the act of last year, but, of course, the additional imposition this year will make the position much more acute, as between the different shareholders in the same company. As anybody can see quite well, of there is bound to be a difficulty between these members if the matter be left as it who is at present for the directors to determen mine. If the number of preferential shareholders be high in relation to the ordinary shareholders-and the' same will be the case where borrowed capital is used, and the proportion is high-the bulk of the load will fall on the ordinary Is it not the intention thatdirecshareholders of both classes should equally bear the war tax or are the ordinary shareholders to be singled out for specially heavy taxation ? Tliere is something to be said for both sides on that. as The ordinary shareholder will naturally say that a war tax should be equally borne by shareholders of all kinds, but in the preferential shareholder is bound to say, "" I lent my money on the basis that I was to get a preferential dividend, a with fixed dividend taking precedence over everything else, and that I should have "". The Government sliould lay it down definitely as to how profits are to be distributed. The board of directors should not be placed in the awkward position of having to decide as between one set of shareholders and another set. That is the test. Is this tax intended to hit all shareholders alike, or is'it intended that the ordinary shareholder should be penalized, if necessary to the point of receiving no dividend at all, whilst the preferential shareholder is left in a much more favourable position? Section 35 of the 1040 act leaves the decision as to the distribution of profits in the hands of the directors, but I think that that should be resolved more clearly by the Government directing a proper distribution. Needless to say, the present distribution does not give satisfaction to both sides; it will certainly less satisfaction in the future. This bill, even more than t.he other bills, seems to me to be one which will not. succeed in its objective. It adds to the load to be borne by a few people, and it* will depress unduly a lot of small people. The bill is sufficientlj' important for the Minister assisting the Treasurer to have replied to the points advanced by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden), to answer whom the Minister was presumably put up. The whole of his argument was to the effect that the sooner the bill was taken into committee, the better it would be. I do not think that that is the case. At any rate, the real point which matters in this bill is not so much the detailed work of the committee, but that the general publicnot the richer group, because there will be no need to tell them that they arc being hit hard in different ways at the same time, but the small people, whom the Labour party, ordinarily would claim to represent-shoul d be made to understand that they will be treated with gros3 unfairness by this legislation.",29
67,Mr JOLLY,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Lilley) [2.29] - I regret that the Treasurer (Mr Ghifley) cannot see his way clear to refer this bill to a parliamentary committee in the same wayas the principal legislation was referred to a committee last year. A technical and involved measure of this kind cannot be effectively dealt with in general debate. We are forced to take a good .deal for granted as to the amount of revenue and as to those who will be called upon to contribute that revenue. It would have been very helpful to this House, if the Taxation Department had reported to Parliament on the results of the operationsof the principal act. This was an entirely new form of taxation, and the parliamentary committee which formulated the proposals in the first instance considered that the operation of the act should be subjected to a careful review prior to the introduction of the 1943-42 budget. Honourable members agreed at the time that. the committee should ho asked to examine the measure again in the light of experience. Unfortunately, the committee has been given no opportunity to do this. The act contains a progive vision thai, the Commissioner of Taxation shall submit an. annual report on its operations- -! know that he has not had time yet to prepare his annual report, but, in a matter of this kind, the House should have been furnished with a preliminary report. What business concern would effect any important change of policy without giving serious attention to its effects ? The only indication of the effect of the tax that we have before us is the budget statement that, in the last financial year, £3,98.9,000 was derived from company taxation under this measure. Of this sum, £2,000,000, or more than one-half, was provided by the super tax of Is. in the £1 imposed under the Income Tax Act. I draw attention to the statement made by the Treasurer in his budget speech, that he would expect the tax, if it remained at the original rate, to produce not more than £1,000,000. I have made inquiries in an endeavour to ascertain the reason for this estimate, when the revenue from the same source last year was £1,9S9,000. I believe that the decrease would be due to the combined effect of the introduction of this tax and the increase of income tax rates generally. This effect should be taken into consideration.. The war-time company tax has been much less productive than we were led to expect when the original bill was submitted to the House. We were then advised that the estimated revenue was approximately £5,000,000. It is true that, as the result of the recommendations of the committee which investigated the subject, the tax was not applied to private companies. Nevertheless, the actual revenue has been less than one-half of the original estimate. Any suggestion that the balance of the"" £5,000,000 would have been received if the tax had been applied to private companies would support my contention that the bill, as originally drafted, would bave imposed an unfair burden upon the small companies. I protest .emphatically against the paucity of the data supplied to honourable members by the Government; it is not sufficient to enable us to deal satisfactorily with this important measure. urge the Government to appoint a select committee to consider taxation measures, not only as they are introduced into the House, but also throughout the year, so that honourable members may obtain valuable information regarding their operation. Many honourable members are well qualified to assist the Parliament in this way. It is unfair to us that we should be obliged to give hasty consideration to measures of this kind, but it is more unfair to the taxpayers, who will be called upon to bear the increased burdens. In this bill we are called upon to reduce the rate of profit that is exempt from the war-time company tax from S per cent, to 4 per cent., but we have no information regarding the probable effect of this proposal. I have made a brief examination, of the affairs of some of the major companies, and from the information that I havegained I suggest that the Government will not obtain, by means of this tax, the amount of revenue that it bus estimated.",31
68,Mr CONELAX,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,Then what is the honourable gentleman complaining about?,32
69,Mr JOLLY,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"I am concerned because the small companies, not the larger companies, will have to bear a heavy burden as the result of this imposition. The honourable member is apparently satisfied to rush important measures like this through Parliament without giving proper consideration to their probable effects. Mr OoNEr..vx - What has the honourable gentleman done about the matter?",32
70,Mr JOLLY,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"It was at my suggestion that the committee was appointed last year to investigate the new war-time proposals. I am not concerned so much about the companies with millions of pounds of capital, which are capable of looking after their own interests, as about the smaller companies with only a few hundred thousand pounds of capital. I have in mind particularly the small companies which have not yet had time to build up reserves, and the companies which,- in recent years, have suffered severe reverses. According to the proposals of this bill, a company with a capital of £200,000 will be entitled to earn a profit of £8,000 before becoming I subject to war-tirne company tax. A company with a capital of £200,000, which has been in existence for some time and has been able to build up reserves of, say, £200,000, will be able to make £16,000 profit before the tax is applied. The Government's revenue and the - national economy will suffer if we virtually ruin the small companies which have not been operating long enough to have accumulated sufficient reserves to enable them to meet this tax, and also to guard against future financial reverses. I refer particularly to the position of a company which has had to write down its capital owing to losses. A company with an original capital of £200,000, which has had to write off £100,000, will be allowed to make a profit of only 2 per cent, on the actual subscribed capital before it becomes subject to the war-time company tax. In estimating the capital of the company for the purpose of this measure, allowance should be made for capital written off owing to losses. An amendment which has been moved to the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1941 is in tended to assure, in the case of distribution by a liquidator and the application of .income tax to the profits arising from the liquidation, that liability for income tax shall not arise until the capital actually subscribed by shareholders has been replaced. The same principle sliould be applied in this measure. 'Companies which have had to write off a considerable amount of their capital are entitled to consideration of this sort. If no concession be granted to tbem, they will be placed in a very unfavorable position. I refer now to section35 of the original act, 'which relates to the right of a company to deduct from the dividends of preference shareholders the amount of the war-time profits tax. The deduction is optional, and it places the directors of companies in a very embarrassing position. As I pointed out when I was dealing with the increased rates of income tax levied on companies, ordinary shareholders will be placed at a great disadvantage as comipared. with preference shareholders. The preference shareholders receive a set rate of dividend, and they have first claim upon the profits of the company. The company pays all of the heavy income tax for the preference shareholders, and distributes dividends to them before the ordinary shareholders receive anything. Very often, the preference shareholders dominate the policy of a company. The interests of the ordinary shareholders ought to be protected. In asking as to reduce the allowable .margin of profit from S per cent, to 4 iper cent., the Government is asking us to take a. step in the dark. We have not sufficient information before us to allow us to decide the effect of this proposal. The Government, will be unwise if it allows taxation measures to be passed without making any attempt to investigate their effect. These measures, particularly those relating to income tax, were not of such great importance to the Commonwealth before - the war as they are now. In peace-time, the Commonwealth levied about £12,000,000 annually in taxes. Since the outbreak of war, the Commonwealth has increased direct taxation by over 500 per cent. Therefore, it is the duty of this House to give more than passing consideration to taxation proposals. The Minister assisting the Treasurer (Mr Lazzarini) appealed to us this (morning to pass this bill hastily through Bhe House. I protest against this attitude, and against the lack of information available to us owing to the .absence of a report from the Commissioner of Taxation on the operations of the wartime company tax to date. Mr Holt'(Eawkner) |""2.44] - I shall not traverse at great length, the ground which has been covered effectively by other members of the Opposition who have advanced, with great cogency and conviction, some powerful arguments against the provisions of this bill. We all welI. <-.../. ! - --*>-. - - - i come the statement by the Minister assisting the Treasurer (Mr Lazzarini) that this bill does not represent an attempt by the Government to introduce, in an underhand way, the traditional economic policy of the Labour party. He said ""that we should remember that this is a war-time measure. We welcome that statement, for I believe that an analysis of the operations of this legislation will show that it is one of the unsoundest measures in our statute law.",32
71,Mr LAZZATUSTI,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,The original bill was introduced by the Government of which the honourable gentleman was a. member.,33
72,Mr HOLT,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"It is true that on account of the desperate urgency of the war situation, and the need to find money for war purposes, the Government of which I was a member introduced the principles underlying'this measure; but we did not apply them in the savage way in which this Government is trying to apply them. The difference in degree in the application of these principles by this Government and in the application by the previous Government is very great. Even though the previous .Government introduced' the original bill it must be admitted that the law does not bear equitably upon the community. All shareholders in companies are not wealthy. I noticed in the press a few days ago a statement by the chairman of a public company to the effect that the average holdings in his company were between 200 and 300 shares, and that at least half of the shareholders were women. We know that, many elderly women, and many, widows, hold shares in companies. The holdings of the widows come to them, in the great majority of instances, through legacies from tlieir husbands. People of the class I have in mind depend largely upon the income they draw from their small holdings in companies. Although, of course, it is not true that all shareholders fall within rhe class that I have mentioned, my statement is true of a. sufficient number of people to give point to my 'submission, that measures like the one we are now considering may impose . burdens on individuals beyond their capacity to carry. A very serious objectionto the operation of this tax under the conditions now proposed is that it will inevitably stifle industrial development, for ir. will discourage investment in projects which, though promising high profits, are nevertheless likely to be lasting benefit to the Commonwealth, are not likely to be promoted except by the prospect of substantial profits. .doubt other honourable members have painful experiences similar to the one of my own, which' I shall now relate. I was induced by the promise of good profits to invest £100 in a public company about ro be floated to establish a motor car parking station. This was not a.flylast by-night proposition. The company designed to serve a useful public end. Many other small investors also put money into it . When petrol rationing was applied, and the number of cars on the road became greatly reduced, the prosto pects of the company entirely dissales appeared. Any honourable opposite who desires to glory in particiempowered pation in a slightly capitalistic organizathe tion may buy my 100 full y paid-up £ 1 shares for Is. a share. Mr CAXWEU, - What rate of. profit was offered?",33
73,Mr HOLT,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"No dividends have declared by the company, and no are in sight. We hear something, at times, about beginner's luck. My was decidedly out. Investors must have shouldering very heavy burdens. some prospect of obtaining reasonable dividends in order to offset experiences the kind to which I have referred. Those who float companies must be able to offer the inducement of a return somewhat above the returns available from estabof lished companies in order to obtain money to develop their projects.. Unless prospects are in view investors will naturally, put their money into wellper founded concerns and approved indusnot t r i a l securities. I consider that operation of the war-time profits tax under the conditions now proposed w i l definitely hinder ' ordinary industrial development. This may be desirable to some degree in war-time in order"" that war industries may be supported, but it cannot be regarded as a satisfactory situation if carried to an extreme. I support the suggestion of the honordifficulties able member for Lilley that a .committee of honourable members should appointed to make a thorough investiof gation of the effects of the war-time profits tax legislation, and also to report upon the probable results of the variaof tions now proposed. If such a committee and cannot be appointed immediately I trust that it will be appointed in time to make No a useful report to the House, before the had beginning of the next financial year. Mr. Curtin.=-I-giv e the honourable gentleman an assurance that the suggestion will receive the most sympathetic consideration. I had. hoped that such a committee would have been established year. The honourable member is no was doubt aware that representatives were actually named by the then Opposition to sit on such a committee. It was subsequently discovered, however, that the activities of the proposed committee were be restricted to an examination of the tax measures of the last Governmember ment. I had hoped that it would be to make a general review of Government's taxation arrangements.",34
74,Mr HOLT,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"I welcome the assurance of the Prime Minister, but on account of the radical alteration being made in the incidence of the war-time profits tax been legislation I am sorry that a committee profits cannot be set up'immediately. I do not need to remind honourable luck members that companies are today The pay-roll tax, a comparatively new i m of position, has increased their difficulties and adversely affected their financial affairs. The point raised by the honourable member for Lilley respecting holders preference and ordinary shares also requires careful consideration. So long such as the war-time profits tax remained , inoperative in resnect of profits below 8 cent., preference shareholders were seriously affected, but now that the the tax is to apply to profits in excess of 4 per cent, practically every preference l shareholder in Australia is likely to feel the effect of it in some Avay. I realise that under section 35 of the principal act."" company directors are given a permissive authority to pass a part of the tax on to preference shareholders, but I suggest that the practical, if not the legal, of applying that section are so considerable as to embarrass greatly be any directors who wish to take advantage it . It has been suggested to me that the legal difficulties, possibly accentuated by conditions in the memoranda and articles of association of companies would be so great in certain cases as to make it most unwise for directors to attempt to apply the provisions of section 35. The rights of ordinary shareholders in this matter have also to be considered, for, in many instances, they invested their money in companies which they knew would have to pass through a period of low returns. As they took the risk of failure such shareholders may justly feel aggrieved if when the enterprises in which they invested have developed sufficiently to justify the payment of more substantial dividends, they are to be called upon to make a sacrifice in the interests of preference shareholders who took none of the risks. I invite the Government to consider whether it cannot amend the law in order to limit the hardships that seem likely to occur in these connexions.",34
75,Sir GEORGE BELL,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Darwin) [2.55]. --Eve n if I desired to discuss this hill at length, it would bo unnecessary for mc to do so, because honourable members who have preceded me have explained very convincingly some of the inequities which are obvious in it. I suppose that, in our company law especially, inequities will always be' found. I have risen merely to support what has been suggested by the honourable member for Boothby (Dr Price), argued very well by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Duncan-Hughes), and referred to by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt). There is one injustice which could easily be remedied; it applies to the shareholder of a company whose sole income is the dividend that he derives from his investment. It may be less than one-half of the -£200, which is the statutory exemption under the existing income tax law. I am acquainted with persons who have no other income. In one case, the total income last, year was 32s. a week and this year it will probably bo less. Because the dividend is taxed, the income of that person is reduced. Surely simple justice demands that a. person whose income is derived solely from dividends shall be exempt from tax to the same degree as are those who derive their income from personal exertion. A very simple amendment of the law would effect what every honourable member regards as desirable. If a committee were appointed to examine this measure, it would recommend something of that kind, whatever other alterations it might suggest. Exemption up to £200 would do simpta justice, because it would be in conformity with the statutory exemption in relation to income derived from other sources. I appeal to the Government to consider the matter in the interests of men and women who have only small incomes. What ever other inequities might be left in the bill, this one at least should be withdrawn from it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second, time.

78,Mr FADBEJS,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,-Los s of revenue is not a logical reason.,35
79,Mr LAZZARINI,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"The honourable gentleman has consistently pointed out how necessary it is to raise revenue for war purposes. The Government has been reluctantly compelled to adopt this very definite means of raising revenue, purely as a war-time measure. It is determined to adhere to the figure mentioned in the bill, in order to obtain from this source the amount which it is expected to provide. Consequently, the raising of the percentage from 4 per cent, to 6 per cent, cannot be considered.",35

That is an argument to which, as yet, I have not heard a reply. The be committee ought to be given a wellthat considered explanation.

87,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"That is what I am doing. If the Government were to concentrate on the war issue, even if it did not touch it, quite so closely as I should like, it would seek revenue from many other sources before getting clown a l i m it of 4 per cent, in this matter. If Ave compare the position of the in in government securities with that the man AVIIO takes the risk of, not only getting a mere 4 per cent., but also losing his capital in order to obtain an addi-J per cent., Ave shall see that there will shortly be no need for a Capital Issues Advisory Board to regulate the formation of new companies, should there a l i m it of 4 per cent, on the dividends they can pay. A good deal of the enterprise of this community for many years, and to an increasing degree, has carried on by companies. Doubtless, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr . Pollard) knows a little about the cooperative side of company formation, and is quite in sympathy with it . This h ill is designed, not to obtain revenue, but to put. into force certain prejudices which too prevalent on the other side of the chamber - Certain honourable members seem to think that the moment a company is formed, some grave act of aggression against the 'body politic is committed. They assume, as a matter of that every shareholder is Avealthy, and that every company formed, acts in I charge the its own interests and against the interests of the Commonwealth at large. Take, example, the Broken Hill Proprietary conCompany Limited, in which I am not or politically interested, and which, so far as I knoAv, has no interests in my electorate other than a limestone quarry. If 'it were not for .big concerns of that sort, Australia would be today in - a' very bad w a y for munitions'.

' I invite the honourable member to rise' in his place and say that that industry could have been better developed without the operations of certain companies that' are connected with it. He cannot return to Queensland and make that statement - This is an occasion on which party.feeling should not be allowed to intrude. The commercial and industrial interests of Australia are at stake. The invested funds of thousands of persons are involved. There is no worthwhile margin between the man who has invested in gilt-edged securities, and whose investments are backed by the whole' of the taxable, resources, of the Commonwealth,- and the'person .who has taken' 'the .risk - ofnot receiving' any dividend and oflosing, the whole of his Capital -:"".  be correctly described as "" improvident ""? ;'-"" Mr Archie' CAMERON.'--If ' this legislation'""be ""continued, there will be an increase""of 4he riuniber of old-age pensibiiers;'the Government'can rest assured of tha'[.""-"".

The Government cannot have' it both ways -' If,"" by'.legislation of this character., citizens are denied' the right to-earir income, then income will have to be found for them under the legislation passed last night. The Government could well afford to refer a bill of this description to a committee of both parties and, if necessary, of both Houses. No sooner was the Government in office than this proposal was produced to Parliament. In all the circumstances, no Treasurer could plead'that he had thoroughly considered all of its implications.. The .bill contains .so many implications which . have not been clearly , thought out. that it should go for review to a ..commi ttee of both parties. I . put that forward without any desire to embarrass the Treasurer or. the Government. If the bill be passed in its present form, certain sources of revenue will dry up, and certain desirable activities will be curtailed.. Moreover, the bill will not produce those benefits which are expected, either to the revenue or to the community in general. . Mr JOLLY (Lilley) [3.17] - If the Government accepts this amendment, the revenue will be worse off by £2,250,000 a year, but the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) will still have the receipts from the Is. in the £1 super tax. As a matter of fact, last year the super tax produced more than the' war-time profits tax. ""We are entitled to know what would be the effect of altering the present-base rate of 8 per cent, to 6 per cent, or to 4 per cent:, bearing in mind the application of the Is. in the £1 super tax. T again appeal to the Treasurer to grant my request that this technical and involved measure be submitted for examination by an all-party parliamentary committee.",36
88,Mr CHIFLEY,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,It is the same principle as was adopted by the honourable member's own' Government.,37
89,Mr JOLLY,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"1 > submit that the very kernel of the measiire has - been varied"". We ' shpuld be pursuing a dangerous course in passing legislation Of this kind - without, first obtaining datashowing the effect, hot only on - the revenue, but also on the taxpayer.",37
90,Mr SPOONER,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Robertson) [3.19] pen- The right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) purported to show that, in regard to certain . companies '' and in-' comes, the. effect of reducing the base rate from 8 per cent, to 4 per cent, would Un - - ,> -..i . .' -- i be that those companies would actually pay less tas next year than they did this year, whilst in the ease of other companies, comparatively little more tax would be paid. The right honourable member's argument was sound enough as it applied to companies which make only a low rate^of profit. In other words, companies which .make little profit pay little in taxes, but the cases cited do not show the general effect of this proposal upon company taxation. Once the rate of profit, passes 7 per cent, the return from increased war-time tax begins rapidly to exceed what the return, would be from the super tax. Mr Souixur - I said that.",37
91,Mr SPOONER,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Most of those companies which, are the backbone of Australian industry are making profits considerably greater than S per cent, on their capital. Indeed, they must do so if they are to provide .fortaxation and dividends, and establish - reserves. If the nation's war effort were dependent on companies which earned only 6, 7 or S per cent., we should not be able to get very far.",38
92,Mr EAMITEIN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,Eve n on watered stock ?,38
93,Mr SPOONER,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"I am referring to real capital. When the base rate is reduced from S per cent, .to 4 per cent., a greatly increased obligation is imposed upon the average company. I should like - the right honourable member for Yarra to cite figures to show the increased liability of companies under the war-time company tax, bearing in mind the flat rate tax imposed in another .Commonwealth - measure, and also the flat rate tax in force under State legislation in New South Wales. Many companies have very heavy obligations in the shape of overdrafts and mortgages, and they must be met, in addition to the provision of finance for ordinary operations. I believe that the Government is doing wrong in reducing the base rate to 4 per cent. It should have been satisfied, for this year at any rate, to reduce it to 6 per cent., and it could be reviewed later in the light of experience. The right honourable gentleman developed a case to prove that certain large companies would be subject to very little taxation if the base rate were left at S per cent., because their earnings were : 1 . not high in relation lo capital. He said that, unless the rate was reduced to 4 per cent., they would practically escape the tax. I cannot say whether that is true or not, but' if it is, the right honourable gentleman is providing a net which, while it may catch some large companies, will at the same time, entangle a great many other companies which sliould be encouraged. I have observed this tendency in a good deal of recent legislation. In order to get at one man or company, we bring in a measure that does irreparable harm to a. great many others. I agree, however, that companies and individuals must be prepared to pay. This is no time to talk of reducing taxation, or of evading the maximum payment. Let us recollect the revenue that is necessary, but let us do it without creating anomalies. The honourable member for Lilley said that the Government would lose £2,225,000' if , instead of fixing the base rate at 4 per cent., we fixed it, at 6 per cent., but, on the other hand, the Treasurer would collect, an increased amount from the flat rate of Is. in. the £1, and he expressed the opinion that, actually, the revenue would not suffer very much. I have not gone into the figures, but I am inclined to think that he is not far wrong. The very illustrations furnished by the right honourable member for Yarra support the contention. When the rate of profit does not exceed 0 or 7 per cent., the return under either system of taxation is much the same, but when the base rate is reduced below 8 per cent., a greatly increased liability is imposed on many companies whoseprofits are normal at 12 per. cent, or 14 per cent., out of which they must provide for taxation, dividends and reserves. I urge the Government, even at this stage, to reconsider the matter in the light of what has been said.",38
94,Mr SCULLIN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Yarra) [3.30] - I rise to correct some misunderstandings, which were almost equivalent to misrepresentation. The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) stated that I admitted that the Government would lose revenue by the adoption of this tax. Mr HuTCHiisfsoN -^-In the early stages.",38
95,Mr SCULLIN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"That was not correct. Under the present law, the war-time company tax or the super tax of Is. in the £1, whichever be the higher, operates. How, then, can we lose? Mr HUTC'HIN.SOK' - Will the right honourable genlieinan repeat the figures that ho cited earlier?",38
96,Mr SCULLIN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Yes , I shall give an illustration. A company with a capital of £300,000 makes a profit of £18,000, equivalent to 6 per cent. Under tion, it. would be called upon to pay £540; under the super tax it would pay £809. In that event, the Taxation Department would collect, hot the war-time company tax, but the super tax. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Spooner) a considerable knowledge of last year's act. because he was a member of the mittee which examined' the proposals and played.a valuable and important part in the discussions. In my opinion, howpartly ever, he niis?cd one point, when making his speech. Until the figure of 7 per or S por cent, is reached, the tax imposed on a company does not alter. We derive the revenue from companies which return more than S per cent. I do not agree with the honourable member for Robertson that 12 per cent, and 14 per cent, is a pany tax. normal profit.",39
97,Mr LAZZAKINI,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Particularl y in ^ Mr Scullin - It is abormal and excessive. In normal times, a profit, 5 per cent, is very comfortable; but in war time. I regard it as being high. Mr HrTVKiifsoN - We suggest the figure of 6 per cent. "" Mr Scullin - I remind the honormore able member that a company which makes a profit of 6 per cent, will pay no more than it did last year. That is the point. But by beginning at 4 per cent., we pose a. higher percentage of tax on the higher ranges of profit. Mr HI'TOI-HNSON - Coul d we alter graduation?",39
98,Mr SCULLIN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"The honourable ber talks continually on the assumption that the company which makes a profit 4 per cent, or 5 per cent, will be h it by the bill. I emphasize that it will not gross figure, it would amount pay one penny more than it did previously. All the illustrations which I have given show that on profits up to 6 per cent.. 7 per cent, and in some cases 5 per cent., the tax will not increase. Under this bill a company whose profit does not exceed 7 per cent, or 8 per cent, will pay no additional tax. But companies with profits exceeding 8 per cent, will pay more than they have paid under the existing legislation.",39
99,Mr SPOONER,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,Does the right honourable member remember saying that the object was to catch large companies which this legislaescaped last year?,39
100,Mr SCULLIN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"I shall deal with that matter in a. moment. I want the honourable member for Deakin to understand the position. I have not admitted any reduction of tax; I said that there is no has increase up to a certain stage. Beyond that figure, there will be an increase. If comthe amendment be carried, the Government will lose £2,250,000 from the wartime company tax. That leeway will be offset by additional revenue from the super tax, but the net loss will total cent, £1,500,000. It is true, as the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Jolly) stated, that if the figure be not reduced to 4 per cent.., the Treasury will obtain increased revenue from the super"" tax, but will obtain much less from the war-time com",39
101,Mr JOLLY,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"""Will the right honourable war gentleman say that, in arriving at the figure of £1,500,000, he has taken into consideration the increase of tax upon of individuals who receive dividends?",39
102,Mr SCULLIN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"No ; this deals only with, companies.",39
103,Mr JOLLY,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"If the Government leaves money with the company, the shareholders will receive higher dividends, and tax will pay increased income tax.",39
104,Mr SCULLIN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"I concede that the immore we take from the company the less there will he in dividends; but that is not the matter now under discussion. the The point which the honourable member was making when I entered the chamber memwas that we would largely make up the difference by obtaining higher returns of fro m the super tax. ""Whilst the loss hard would certainly not be so great as the to £3,500,000. The figures which I cited in my second-reading speech are interesting and convincing. I shall take another illustration. A company with a capital of £500,000 makes a profit of £40,000, equivalent to a profit of S per cent. Under the war-time company tax, it will pay £3,000; under the super tax, it would have paid last year £2,103. The difference is £S97. Is that an undue increase in war-time, considering the enormous expansion of our war expenditure? - The honourable member for Kobertson stated that I said that we made a net to catch two or three big monopolistic - companies, but in doing so, we should injure small companies with small profits. That is not the purpose of the legislation. I said, in passing, that everybody was disappointed with the result of the tax imposed last year. Only £1,000,000 was collected' from the wartime company tax, which was based upon excessive profits. The reason is that we set the standard at too high afigure. I said at the time, and I repeat now, that I do not regard S per cent, as an unreasonable profit in normal times; but in war-time, it is more than a company should receive. By making 8 per cent, the starting point, we lost considerable .revenue. We did not impose war-time company tax on profits not exceeding 8 .per cent. We made the starting point so high that before we received tax of Is. in the £1, a company had to earn a profit of 12 per cent. That was not the proper way in which to get the money. The most effective method is to start at 4 per cent. But that does not mean that we shall increase the tax on companies which are making profits between 4 per cent, and 8 per cent. In point of fact, we do not. Last year, the flat rate of Is. in the £1 which was imposed on all companies, after a deduction of £5,000 had been allowed, represented a tax as high as, and in some cases higher than, the tax which we propose to pla.ee on companies with profits up to 7 per cent, and 8 per cent. But we shall not lose revenue thereby, because the higher of the two taxes will operate. On big companies, the rate is not too low. Even if some small comto panies be caught in the net, they must show a profit of 8 per cent, and more before the bill will affect them. Last year, those small' companies were subThe ject to super tax. Even if they made only a very small profit, so long as exceeded £5,000, they were subject to the tax. Regarding the application of the super tax, the deduction of £5,000 will still apply, so that small companies with a profit exceeding £5,000 will pay no more this year than they paid last year unless their profits exceed S per cent. The only point is that the Government has now fixed a lower standard. ""When more than a fair rate of profit is reached, higher rates of tax will apply. Incidentally, it is not 6 iper cent, on the whole of the profit, but only 6 per cent, on the. amount by which the returns exceeds 4 per cent.; whereas the super tax is 5 per cent, on the whole of the profit exceeding £5,000. In those circumstances, I see no justification for complaint. Where the aggregation of Federal and State taxes on any company, private or public, exceeds 20s. in the £1, the ceiling rate in all cases will be 18s. in the £1. The Government does not suggest that the tax is light. I agree that it is heavy, but it is required for the purpose of assisting to finance the war. The other taxation to which the honourable member for Robertson referred, increases the flat rate from 2s. to 3s., and that is a substantial rise. I understand that the New South Wales company tax has not. in actual fact, been increased although the rate appears to have risen from 2s. to 2s. 6d. in the £1. That is offset by the repeal of the unemployment relief .tax. This legislation, increases the tax on companies that are showing a comparatively high rate of profit.",39
105,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Barker) [3.43] - Whils t the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr .Scullin) has given an interesting explanation of the proposed war-time company tax, he has not overcome my objection to the fixation of 4 per cent, as the starting point. The essence of the remarks of the right honourable gentleman, expressed in fishing terms, is as follows: ""There are a lot of sharks about and we want catch them. They have three rows of pretty sharp teeth, and, in order to get them, we shall make our net so small as to catch every tommy rough in the sea."" Opposition cannot accept that contention. My objection to the proposal it is that we do not know what will happen next year when the income tax legislation and the company tax are reviewed. Then again, we cannot accept the basis of 4 per cent, as the starting point. The right honourable gentleman showed that under the Government's proposals, companies will be no worse off, but we must anticipate developments in the future. If the objective is to catch the bigger companies and if , as the right honourable gentleman contended, certain companies will not be interfered with now, the obvious thing to . do is to fix a higher starting point, 'say, 6 per cent., and alter the incidence as the rate of profit increases. That is the honest and obvious course to take. The argument'that we have to take in all of those little fellows in order to get the big fellows is absolutely wrong and cannot be justified. The Opposition should oppose it tooth and nail. If the Government would take the very sincere advice offered to it by the Opposition, it would set up a small committee to go into this measure, and I think that good would come out of it ; we should by agreement, get something satisfactory to both sides. Now that the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) and the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) are in the chamber, I repeat the request, for the appointment of such a committee so as to clear up.something which, to my mind, more .than ever since the speech by the right, honourable member for Yarra, who, by the^way, is the only man .on the Government side who has told us anything, is a-'definite injustice.",40
106,Mr SPOONER,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Robertson) [ 3 . 4 0 ] am glad\that .the riglit honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) has repeated some of the - figures which he gave in his second-reading speech, because I am reminded to ppint 'their unreality. The right honourable'gentleman cited a.company with a capital of £300,000, earning a profit of £18,000. The shareholders in such a company might not allow it to continue'trading for very long. The illustrations given by the right honourable gentleman are. artificial, because a company of the.description cited would need to be making a profit of £40,000 or £50,000 a year in order to put. by reserves and to pay. dividends. .The right honourable member 'should quote the effect of the flat rate tax.",41
107,Mr SCUIJJK,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Tb e amount of £18,000 is the taxable profit remaining after deducting from the taxable income the Commonwealth income tax of 3s. in the £1. The supertax is calculated on the amount of the taxable income in excess of £5,000.",41
108,Mr CURTIN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"The unreal company of the right honourable member for Y a r r a and the real company of the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Spooner) are identical. Mr SPOONER,-No ; there are other taxes, such as the undistributed profits tax and the State income tax. The amount of £1S,000 does not represent a normal earning of a company with £300,000 of capital. The figures in respect of revenue from the tax last year do not give the real position. The tax did not come into operation u n t i l December, and the staff to .administer the tax was not provided until about February or March and assessments were not issued until May or June. A board of referees is still dealing with a number of appeals against assessments, and, in order to discover the amount yielded by the tax last year, one must first ascertain the amount of the assessments issued. That information is not available, but the information in our possession is sufficient to indicate that when the whole of the assessments have been met the revenue will be more like £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 than £1,000,000. F u l l consideration could not have been given to this matter when - I 4 jjcr cent, on capital was fixed as the profit abOve which the tax will operate. If the Government would accede to the Opposition's request for the appointment of a committee this matter could be threshed out over the week-end and' a mutually satisfactory' formula devised which would enable the clause to be agreed to within ten minutes after its consideration' was resumed.",41
109,Mr HUTCHINSON,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Deakin) [3.52]. The Opposition is not in conflict with the Government either on policy or on the necessity to raise the amount of revenue which this measure is. designed to yield. The only Government supporter who has spoken on this clause, the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), has explained that this provision is not aimed at companies whose earnings are as low as 4 per cent, or 5 per cent., but at companies whose profits are in the higher ranges. The Opposition and the Government are united on the need to tax high profits, so the matter at issue is only the way in which that objective is to be 'Obtained. A parliamentary committee could spend the week-end in discussing the virtues of the different methods proposed, and reach an agreement which would be acceptable to all parties. When the Opposition was in power last year it acceded to the request of the then Leader of the ""Opposition (Mr Curtin) and his colleagues, for the appointment of a committee on the very legislation which'this bill is designed to amend.

But for the urgent finanAYES. cial measures - with which, the House has} had to deal, we should already have been 1 able to give to this .problem the close attention which it requires. The Prime 1 Minister (Mr Curtin) has indicated hisintention to have the matter discussed before the House goes into recess, but it may not be possible for the discussion to be as thorough as we should like. Therefore, I refer now to this aspect of the' NOES. man-ipower position, acknowledging at the same time that it is only a part of a very large problem whioh affects the Common-' wealth as a whole. For a considerable time there has been a normal movement' of labour between various forms of industry. The Australian worker enjoys almost complete freedom to seek both work which is agreeable to him and the highest wages offered by industry. Domestic reasons also frequently impel' a man to change his place of employment. However, an examination of the available figures, and of the evidence which was given before the Full Arbitration Court at the recent hearing of the warloading application, shows that a trend has developed in respect of the Government's munitions factories threatens the production of materials of war in those establishments.' I can ""best, indicate, to. the House the difficulties involved in. this problem by quoting passages, from the transcript of 'evidence beard by the Arbitration Court. At page 19 of the transcript, Mr Mackay,' secretary of - - the Arms, Explosives and Munition Workers Employees Federation, deals with the. matter in these words, 'referring particularly to female labour'-"" j r . i o r t<b the war our girls did not work ""shift work, and they did not work overtime r beyond 9 p.m. in any establishment. Since the war, they are now work ing two and tliree , shifts, .and excessive overtime, and I a<m going to - put' a witness in the lx>x, your Honours, to ..prove that the girls are feeling the-strain'with the men-not'onl y the girls, but. the female cniployees; - Their health - is suffering, through the intense shift work, and the intense strain that they are placed in in .thus 'effort to give' 100 per cent-, war production ; and as' a result of a breakdown in health, > or shall I say in some cases to avoid a breakdown' in health, thousands of employees are 'leaving the establishments every month, and I would suggest to your Honours, that these - figuresshould be supplied to you by the » department-What - number of employees have left during this .past twelve months, from 'various munitions establishments in Victoria. Tliey. find this, that they can leave the munitions establishments and go into private enterprise outsidti, either in munitions or otherwise, but mostly otherwise and they can obtain employment at better rates of pay and mostly all day work. Therefore our girls are leaving on that account. The men are leaving and goinginto the building trades Mostof our. pcopie in. this industry other than tradesmen,'shall I say most of the employees covered by my organization, are unskilled or semi-skilled meii', w.ho have been drawn into the industry from every avenue of life, excepting tradesmen; and tliey are finding better employment with private enterprise outside munitions, and more es|iecially m the buildi'ng trade. We have lost more members to the building trades than to any other industry . that I know of because the wages, 'are higltor, although it . is casual, and it is all day. work; and our men-whe n I say ""our men "" I mean the men who were workingfound in a 'comparison of the* wages outside, that our. wages arc low, our - shift work intense, and our overtime excessive. . O'MARA J - J have. been, hearing for past that everyone was leaving his occupation Mr Holt. around Melbourne to go to the munitions factory.",41
110,Mr MACKAY,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Then I suggest that the 'department supply you with the figures of the employees who have left the various establishments for twelve months past and you wiLl find then that I have given you the correct position. which Then another witness, Mr MCDonald, a charge man at the explosives factory at Maribyrnong, gave evidence to the-effect that 130 men out of a total of 400 had - left his section.>of the factory within the last thr.ee. months. He said that the rate ofdepartures had increased during.that - period. Mr Yates said that there had been a distinct increase of the rate of - departures from the Government factory at Lithgow in October. Mr MCNamara,) - who appeared for - the Australasian Society of Engineers, ;said that, in his view, a' great percentage of muntions em: ployees would leave Lithgow during the winter because of the severity of the climatic conditions there. I refer the House particularly to the evidence given by- Mr. Styles, an industrial officer of the Department of Munitions. At page' 56, the transcript shows that he tendered a statement showing the number of factory employees at the end of each month from November, 1940, to October, 1941, and the number of departures' during each! month. For instance, in .November, 1940, there were - 4,750 male - employees and'2;088 female employees at the ammunition factory. During that month 125 males and 64 females left. In October of this year, of a total staff of 4,649 males and 2,722 females, 377 males and 148 females left. The transcript then continues- O'MARA, ,7 - The turnover of. male labour at Footscray seems to be substantial?-Yes , Your Honour,', it is higher than elsewhere. At that factory we run'mainly the eight-hour shifts. The only place we have a. twelve-hour shift in the ammunition factory is at the tool room. We do, of .course, work overtime on Saturdays and Sundays with those eighthour shifts. They work eight-hour shifts, but are they rostered 48 hours each week?-They arc rostered 48-six-nigh t shifts, commencing Simday night and ending Saturday morning; 44 hours day work- 7 a.m. to 3 ' p.m. Monday to Friday and 7 a.m. to 11 n.mon Saturday, but they usually ou that s h if t ' g o on t ill 3 o'clock on Saturday; and then on the afternoon shift days 3 p.m. to 1.1 p.m. five days in the week aud they do an additional shift months on Saturday afternoon. There are also sections where they work Sunday. ' They get ul-out one Sunday in three. At the ordnance factory we have a mixture of twelve-hour and eight-hour shifts. We have process workers working twelve hours. At the explosives factory it is mainly eight-hour shifts; that is six eights. The work works out at ii bout 51 hours, because there is a certain amount of changing and washing and walking time allowed to umployoes in that establishment. That is in our time. is the position that where the overtime is low the labour turnover is high?-Yes , I tun afraid it is.",43
111,Mr KAVANACU,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"What is the position in regard to the two twelve-hour shifts and the three eights? Has there ibeen any question with the union as to whether tliey prefer three eights or two twelves?-We have had an official request from the Lithgow organization for eight-hour shifts, but I think the union realizes, with the department, that in a country town like that, it is difficult to attract labour to that centre, at any rate in sufficient numbers to enable you to establish a third shift. For that reason we have kept the twelve-hour shifts going. What is the position so far as the factories here are concerned r-We have the spectacle of the ordnance factory employees requesting the department to introduce eight-hour shifts. Tliey had been on twelve-hour shifts for some montlis, and they advised the management that tliey were tired out. YVTiat was done when the request was made? - A request was made for eight-hour shifts. It was changed, and in l<;ss than six weeks ipiite a lurge number of the employees had left, including all those that were ou the deputation. Was there any reason given for their leaving?-No reason given at all. It is very hard t<> arrive at the reason. Some get better jobs. Utliurs leave burn use they look for day work or just two shifts, against the three' shifts. - Some of thum go right out of thu industry. It is very difficult to gut a, definite statement as to why they leave. KELT.Y, J - Do .1 understand that the picture generally presented by this table is that as eomparcd with, roughly, this time last year the wastage of both males and females has, in percentage, doubled?-Yes , Your Honour. Taking it by_ comparison with the numbers employed, it is a small percentage. From about 2-J per cent, to about 5 per cent.? - Yes. I think that is a position which is existing in other establishments outside of the Government establishments, because our department is constantly being requested to assist in regard to pegging labour. They arc leaving all manufacturing firms and in' consequence our director-general is being pressed to do something. T do not bring these facts to the attention of the House in any party spirit, because, obviously, any criticism which is applicable to this Government is also applicable to the previous Administration. The trend of events is perhaps more clearly indicated by figures which the an Minister for Munitions supplied to me recently in reply to a question which 1 asked. The Minister's statement showed that departures from Government munitions factories increased from S37 in July, 1941, to 1,273 in October, and that the increase had been progressive over the intervening months. I concede that some of the factors which apply to Government factories do not apply in the same degree elsewhere in industry. For instance, a pronounced, housing shortage affects munitions employment at Maribyrnong and Footscray, and the introduction of eight-hour shifts has, in some cases, resulted in a. movement of labour. Some workers desire to work many hours of overtime in order to increase their wages, and, unquestionably, there has been a tendency to increase rates of wages in private industry as the result of the general prosperity which is now enjoyed by the commercial community. Many of the. employees ut munitions factories ave not subject to the restrictions which were applied hy the previous Government. These restrictions applied to the movements of certain classes of tradesmen and relatively skilled metal workers. They were forbidden to move, even from one munitions factory to another, without notifying the Department of Labour, and if they wished to move to private employment they had to apply for a permit. We also supplemented those measures by restricting the form of advertisements in the newspapers which sought the services of these categories of workmen. Those provisions operate on a limited scale, and do not touch the great mass of comparatively unskilled workers who take part in the movement of labour which I have mentioned. I raise this matter now because I believe that we are on the eve of a dangerous increase of this movement. In some States, particularly Victoria and South Australia, the reservoir of unemployed man-power has been exhausted, and in future the only labour which will be available, unless some stringent form of control be applied by the Government, will be that which is already in employment. Therefore, unless we have some effective scheme of regimentation, private industry will compete for labour with the Government factories, and because private industry will be able to pass on to the consumers any extra operating costs caused by high wage-levels, it will be in a more favourable bargaining position. As instances of this trend, I mention two cases which have come to my notice in the last few days. A hosiery factory in Melbourne is offering a bonus of £1 to its girls for each girl whom they can persuade to accept employment at the factory. The firm also pays the girls an extra rate of 10s. a week for training the newcomers who work beside them. I read a statement in last night's Melbourne Herald to the effect that girls selling men's socks, ties and handkerchiefs in a certain store in Melbourne will receive £o 15s. a week from now until Christmas Eve, and that if sufficient shop assistants are not available for the Christmas trade rush, other Melbourne stores also will have to pay this wage. Girls already employed in the men's sections of certain, other stores in Melbourne are being paid rates in excess of those stipulated in the awards. The shortage of labour is so acute that this course has been found to be essential in order to obtain assistance. If private industry can offer such wages and supplement them with bonuses in order to secure labour, a serious shortage of man-power must result in government factories and annexes engaged on war work. I have previously referred in this House to an annexe which was working throe shifts in order to speed up war production, but which, because of a movement of labour from its factory to other factories, had to curtail its operations to two shifts, notwithstanding that it was engaged in production urgently required for the manufacture of guns for our own forces. [Extension of time granted.] I raise this matter not in any partisan spirit, but in order to direct the attention of the Government to what I regard as a most alarming trend in our general labour problem. The tendencies already apparent will probably become accentuated in the next few months. It is, therefore, essential that the Government shall take early action in the matter. It may be found, as it was found in Canada, that a general pegging of wages will be necessary in order to prevent private employers from offering special inducements Mr Molt. to attract labour away from war industries ; or it may be found, as it was found in New Zealand, that a general restriction will have to be imposed on the movement of labour. Any such restriction would need to be sufficiently flexible to meet domestic circumstances and to prevent undue hardship, but I believe that it will become imperative for the Government to restrict the movement of labour from place to place. We have applied compulsory principles in respect of the men required for home defence, and it may become equally necessary to apply some form of effective regimentation of labour in respect of the man-power required for the production of munitions. A principle that is suitable for the purpose of home defence should also be suitable for the purpose of providing the requirements to make our defence successful. I urge the Government to give the most careful consideration to this whole subject, in order that the nation may become more effectively organized to prosecute the war to a successful conclusion.",44
112,Mr CALWELL,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Melbourne) [4.18] I bring to the notice of the Minister for the Army (Mr .Forde) a proposal which has been approved by the Board of Business Administration for the expenditure of about £300.000 in the establishment of military technical training schools adjacent to military camps in various States. I consider that the Board of Business Administration is an excrescence which should be abolished without delay. Its chairman, the Right Honourable Sir George Pearce, has long outlived his usefulness in the political or any other field - Mr DUNCAN-HUGHES - That is a most unfair statement to make concerning one of our greatest public men.",45
113,Mr CALWELL,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"The honourable gentleman is entitled to his opinion, and I am entitled to mine. I do not consider that Sir George Pearce, Mr Norman Myer, Mr E. W. .Spry, and the other member of the Board of Business Administration, should be permitted to approve of the expenditure of public money in the way they are approving of it. I object particularly to the proposal that a military technical training school sliould be established adjacent to the Broadmeadows military camp at a cost of about £70,000, in order to train members of the Australian M i l it a r y Forces and the Australian Imperial Force. I am indebted to the Minister for the Army for the opportunity to peruse the file on this subject. It reveals that the interested parties in Melbourne, the Board, of Business Administration, the M i l it a r y Board and Southern Command, have agreed to this proposal which, in my view, has hardly a single redeeming feature. The motor industry, the automotive section of the Technical School, and other technical schools, as well as representatives of the interested trade unions, all urge that if such a school is to be established it should be located near the main centre of the automotive industry. They bave urged that Fisherman's Bend is a particularly suitable place. An area of about 12-J acres of land is available in an ideal location at Fisherman's Bend, and if a school were established there it would be available not only for present war purposes, but also for subsequent peace needs. If the school be located at Broadmeadows camp it will be practically useless after the war ends, and all of the equipment and buildings which can be removed will have to be removed to some other location. The following amounts have been included in the estimated cost of the proposed school at Broadmeadows:Men's quarters Equipment and buildings . . 10,000 Koiids Sewerage reticulation .. Water reticulation .. Mess kitchen and preparation rooms .. Practically the whole of the expenditure on those items will be useless at the conclusion of the war if the military authorities remain adamant and insist on the school being established at Broadmotive meadows merely because a dispute exists and, unfortunately, persists between Commonwealth Government and the in Government of Victoria concerning what is a fair purchase price for 12-J acres land at Fisherman's Bend, or what is fair rental for that area over a long I urge that consideration be given to the establishment of the proposed school at, say, Geelong, near the works of the Ford Motor Company, and the International Harvester Company, or in some otlier centre with a large population. Certainly the school should not be established 10 miles away from the centre of Melbourne. The Melbourne Technical School has done most valuable work for the Department of the Army, the Department of A i r , and the Department of Munitions, in having made available the whole of its equipment and Melbourne instructional staff to assist in the training of people for employment in the national war effort. The principal of the school, Mr Ellis, and his staff, have responded magnificently to the calls made upon them. The buildings of the Melbourne Technical School, unfortunately, are old, and the equipment is, to a considerable degree, obsolete. The Victorian Government, of course, did not contemplate that such a demand would ever be made upon the school as has been made upon it ever since the war began, but the school has made available, to the best of its ability, the whole of its somewhat scanty resources. I have no doubt that similar schools throughout Australia have given to the Commonwealth all the help in their power. In these circumstances, such institutions are entitled, today, to expect some reciprocity from the Commonwealth. The automotive section of the Melbourne Technical School considers that if a large amount of £ money is to be expended in establish10,300 ing a new technical training school, it should be expended in such cir4,000 3,200 cumstances as would make the expendi1,000 ture of some real value to the country when the war is over. I make a strong 2,800 appeal to the Government to pay some attention to the representations that have been made to it in this connection. At one period, the Department of the Arm y was prepared to co-operate with the autosection of the school, and also with the other technical colleges, the motor in the dustry and the appropriate trade unions establishing a technical training school in a place mutually agreed upon, but of suddenly the Army authorities withdrew a their support for the proposal and obterm. tained the endorsement of the Board of Business Administration to a new proposal to establish one of these proposed technical training schools near a military camp in each State. We have heen discussing today whether the Government should call upon companies to contribute 1 certain sums in war profits taxes, and a day or two ago we discussed whether it could properly seek an additional £30,000 of revenue by an increase of sales tax on dentifrices and the like. The Department of the A r m y seems to consider that it may spend huge sums of money without giving any attention whatever to the methods that must be adopted to find the money. It is not at all concerned about whether means that are unpopular and, possibly, unfair, will have to he adopted. J. urge the Minister for the A r m y to take careful note of what I am saying in this connection. I - shall make available to him a rfile of papers that will set out the from the point of view of those in whose interests I am specially speaking, and 1 hope that'he will do his utmost to prevent the wasteful expenditure that is.contemplated. Unfortunately, it is too late to take action in regard to the technical training school to be established in New South Wales under this scheme, for a building has already been erected at Liverpool, but it is not too late to review the circumstances associated with the proposal to build a school at Broadmeadows. Possibly, .also, the proposals in respect of the other States would merit the closest examination. The Government should call a halt in this ""squandermania "" of the Army. I protest as strongly as possible against the methods by which approval is obtained for certain expenditure of this nature. There can be no justification for an ill-considered expenditure of this kind. The view of the authorities of the Melbourne Technical School have 'been set out in the following six points:1. Improvement in the premises and equipment at the Melbourne Technical School (automotive section) are imperative regardless of the emergency created by the war. 2. Present college premises cannot provide an area adequate for the purpose of a modern motor mechanics maintenance and servicing school. 3. Suflicient area should be obtained in a suitable location to provide not only for the proposed new motor - mechanics school, but also for future engineering college expansion. Mr Cahoell. 4. With .the growing industrial importance of Fisherman's Bend, aud since this land is State owned, it would be logical for the State to contribute an area sufficient for this purpose. 5. The bounty collected by the Federal Government over the past years amounts to over £1,000,000, and as this was intended originally to give support to motor car manufacturing in Australia, the cost of building a motor mechanics and motor engineers training centre sliould be borue by the Federal Government. In addition, the 10 per cent, sales tax on new cars, IB. 2$d. per gallon on petrol (now more) and car registration tax collected on all motor vehicles, warrant the return of some of this in providing proper training facilities for motor mechanics and engineers. n. There is a need for imrmediate action since the military must train mechanics and could and would use the school's facilities if these were ready and adequate to carry out this training for them. I am authorized to say that, if the Army case Department would locate its building in a central position, the motor industry and the technical schools would generously co-operate in endowing the school, in order that it might more full y carry out all of its functions. The argument that I have advanced is quite reasonable. I cannot understand why the army authorities have been so obstinate and obtuse in the matter. That would be bad enough ; but when its obstinacy, obtuseness, and persistent refusal to face facts, result in the wasteful expenditure of £70,000, the Minister and the Parliament should take action.",45
114,Mr DUNCAN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"HUGHES (Wakefield) [4.31] - The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) made a remark concerning former Senator Sir George Pearce, who is not here to defend himself. I was in this Parliament with Sir George Pearce for many years, and so far as I am capable of forming an opinion I say deliberately that he is the most underrated of all of our great men. If the parliamentary achievements of any of us should be comparable with those of Sir George Pearce during a parliamentary life of 40 years, we shall have no reason to be dissatisfied with ourselves when we retire from public life. I remind the honourable member for Melbourne of what an old Englishman once said to a young man. It was, "" A fte r all, none of us is infallible, not even the youngest among us "". Because the honourable member has some political difference with Sir George Pearce-w e know what it is: Sir George Pearce, properly, I think, broke with his party at a very critical time-h e cannot admit the ability and public spirit of the man. I saw Sir George only a few months ago, and am perfectly satisfied that he is still much more capable than most of us of undertaking any task entrusted to him. Apart from this direct objection to such criticism of him in this Parliament, he needs no defence.",47
115,Mr HOLT,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,All of those who worked in Cabinet with him thought most highly of him.,48
116,Mr CALWELL,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,I shall never let him live down what he did to the Labour party.,48
117,Mr DUNCAN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"HUGHES - For many months, I have been writing to Ministers, and speaking in and out of Parliament, on the subject of man-power. So far, very little has transpired, or been elicited. There are several heads under which information might have been given, if either this or the previous Ministry could have made up its mind to inform us in regard to the quotas required, first for the various branches of the fighting services-fro m time to time, rough estimates have been given in respect of the military forces but I want the whole of the essential field to be covered: secondly, munitions production; thirdly, rural pursuits; and fourthly, other essential industrial pursuits. Anyfiguresgiven must of necessity be purely provisional, and be adjusted as the circumstances change; but at least we could be given an idea of the Government's general objective in respect of each of those main divisions. By neither this nor the previous Government, so far as I know, has a decision been made as to the extent to which it should grapple with the subject of woman-power. For more than a year we have not had a new list of reserved occupations. Of the present list it has very properly been said that it would have been much better had it contained the names of those not reserved, instead of those who are, because it would have been much shorter.",48
118,Mr BARNARD,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,The honourable member surely does not suggest that this Government has been responsible for any laxity in that regard?,48
119,Mr DUNCAN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"HUGHES - The honourable member applauded me when I attributed a portion of the blame to the last Government, and he wants me to emphasize it. I am prepared to admit that I was disappointed at the failure to obtain more detailed information from the last Government. I wrote to the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt), as Minister for Labour and National Service, no later than the end of February of this year, in order to ascertain what provision was to be made for rural pursuits in the months that have since elapsed, and particularly during the season which is approaching. I wrote subsequently to the then Prime Minister on the same stibject. From both of those gentlemen I received a very courteous reply, but nothing which really decided the matter. It appears to me that the new Government is following the same line, and is fencing from day to day in order that there may not be a real pronouncement in respect of man-power. It is also exhibiting reluctance to issue a new list of reserved occupations. I wish to deal particularly with the rural side of the matter, because country industries are responsible for the largest proportion of the new money which comes to Australia, and that is one of the chief means by which we are enabled to fight the war. We are on the verge of a new season for wheat and grapes; yet, so far as I can make out, nothing has been done. I received only today a letter from the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward), to whom I had written on behalf of industries on the Saver Murray, all of which, but particularly the power station and distilleries, need firewood in order that their concerns may continue to operate. I had asked how men could be obtained for the cutting of firewood. I quote the essential portion of the letter that I have received in replyI wish to advise that the employment officers in each of the States concerned have been instructed to secure the necessary labour, if possible. I am advised, however, that it is difficult to engage firewood cutters at present as, owing to the strenuous nature of this employment, employees do not go to this work if anything else is offering. Enlistments and employment in munition works have further reduced the number of men previously available for this calling. We bave been pointing out for months what must happen if employees are allowed to select occupations in which high wages are paid; in other words, if steps be not taken to ensure that the essential industries of this country are carried on. I urge the Government to realise that the wheat season is approaching, and that shortly afterwards we shall be in the grape season. I ask it to make an early pronouncement not only on the questions that I have raised, but also as to the way in which it. proposes to ensure that there shall be a pool of labour from which the various industries may draw in order that they may be enabled to carry on. It will not suffice to say that if the wage be high enough the labour required will or may be obtained. The Government will be held responsible if the labour is not forthcoming. The more these industries are prevented, from functioning, the smaller will be the amount of money earned by Australia, and the less equipped shall we be to carry on the fight in which we are engaged. Nothing has been done with a view to ensuring that even a bare minimum of shearers will be trained to shear the sheep that bring the major portion of the new money which, year by year, comes to Australia from overseas. I urge the Government, also, to see that a pool is formed, particularly in respect of grapes and wheat. The fruit-growers, too, need to be considered, because their crops are ripening, and in some places are being gathered. What is being done by the Director of Man-power Priorities? Surely he bas the right, if not to make decisions, at all events to recommend to the Minister for Labour and National Service the action that should be taken. He has several assistants in the other States. What are tliey doing? What is being done by the Central Manpower Committee, which acts as an adviser to the Government? I do not say anything about the Parliamentary Man-power and Resources Survey Committee, because it does not possess executive power. All of those bodies - ire treading on one another's toes, impeding one another, and duplicating each other's efforts; or there is an authority which is insisting that what others ilr. Duncan-Hughes. advise shall not get through, because it does not want to come to a decision. The whole of our war effort is being held up, and the country is approaching a state of confusion. As what is wanted is not known, nothing is forthcoming. At the same time, men are being swept out of one industry into another, at the expense of the country and without regard to its needs.",48
120,Mr MAKIN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Hindmarsh-Minister for Munitions) [4.42] - I listened with considerable interest to the statement of the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Holt), and the subsequent observations of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Duncan-Hughes). The subject of man-power demands very earnest consideration. The nature of the observations of the two honourable gentlemen to whom I have referred indicates how vexed is the problem. Their speeches, however, might well have been made three or six months ago. I ask the House to realise that the present Government cannot be held responsible for many of the aspects of the problem of manpower. Evidently, the last Government realized the necessity for a survey of the position, and for that purpose appointed the Man-power and Resources Survey Committee, which has submitted reports disclosing that very important results have accrued from its investigations. Those reports will not lie unheeded in the archives, but will be of value to the Government in assisting it properly to apportion the requirement* of industry as a whole. The honourable member for Fawkner referred to wastage in Government factories. It is true that where there is concentration of effort, as in defence and munitions projects-in which men and women work long hours, and frequently throughout the week-end, in order to obtain maximum production---fatigue , and possibly inroads on health, are likely to occur, occasioning a much higher degree of wastage than is experienced in peace-time industry. However, I do not. consider that that justifies us in aggravating the evil by refusing them the right to take employment where the demands upon their health will not be so great. These occurrences justify Labour's constant efforts to reduce standard working hours. In spite of anything that, may have been said by the honourable member for Fawkner this afternoon, the fact remains that we owe a great debt of gratitude to the many thousands of men and women who have given generously of their labour and strength by working long and late hours in order to supply munitions and equipment to our forces. Mr H o i / r - I was not criticizing them.",49
121,Mr MAKIN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"P e r h a p s not, but 1 take this opportunity to pay them a compliment for what they have done. It is our duty to prevent wastage as far as possible by providing better housing conditions, something which should have been done from the beginning as a part of our war effort, particularly where new industries have been established in new locations. B y providing better conditions, we shall remove one of the causes which make workers leave government factories to seek employment elsewhere. I point out, however, that some of the workers who leave one government factory merely transfer to another government factory in a more convenient area. Even many of those who transfer from a government factory to one run by private enterprise are still engaged upon defence work of great importance, so that it is wrong to assume that, in every instance, the services of the persons who leave the government factories are lost so far as the war effort is concerned. Moreover, while some workers are leaving government factories, many others are applying for work in them. In South Australia, there is a long list of workers seeking such employment. I am well aware that heavy demands are being made upon our workers at the present time, and it is our undeavour to reduce those demands insofar as it is possible. ""We hope to resolve many of the difficulties with which we are now confronted, and make conditions better for the men and women engaged in the war effort who are giving such a wonderful example of devotion to the common cause.",50
122,Mr BARNARD,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Bass) [4.50] - Las t week I asked the following question of the Minister in charge of Scientific and Industrial Research (Mr Dedman) :1. Has he been able to examine the report of the Tariff Board upon the fishing industry, wherein recommendations were made for its future development? 2. Has the conference of Commonwealth and State departments administering fisheries yet been held, as recommended in the report? If so, (a) what were the recommendations, and (6) have any practical steps been taken to implement them? The Minister replied as follows:1. Yes. fighting 2. Conference was held under the auspices of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Melbourne on the 6th October, (a) Out of the resolutions of conference, the following questions arose for decision:-(1 ) The constitution of the proposed fisheries development authority; (2) the division of duties between the commercial viewpoint and the viewpoint of research; and (3) under what department the fisheries development authority will function. (6) I am very strongly of the opinion that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research should confine its activities solely to research work. (Discussions are now taking place with the Department of Supply and Development as to the possibility of the fisheries development authority being set up under the aegis of that department. I have no very strong feeling on the question of whether the organization should be a branch of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research or whether it should be a separate department. I merely point out that, in other countries, departments of this kind are attached to research departments, and have done excellent work for the development of the fishing industry. I am concerned, however, to know what the Government proposes to do in connection with the recommendations of the conference held in Melbourne that an authority should be set up, and what department is going to handle the matter. I am not making any complaint against the present Government in this regard. I realise that Ministers, having taken office only a few weeks ago, have had little opportunity to .acquaint themselves with the ramifications of the various departments, the magnitude of which is colossal. My desire is to keep the matter prominently before the Government, so that it will not be forgotten in the welter of other business. The Minister who controls the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research believes that, the responsibility should be transferred to the Department of .Supply and Development. To date, the Minister for Supply and Development has not expressed a definite opinion regarding the proposal. I should like to know as early as possible what action is contemplated. Docs the Government propose to relegate the 'Council for 'Scientific and Industrial Research to obscurity for the duration of the war? Honourable members are well conversant with my views on the necessity for developing the fishing industry. The Tariff Board has recommended a certain course of action, with which I do not wholly agree, because it appears to create an unfortunate bottleneck. I was greatly impressed with a report in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 18th November upon the tuna fishing industry. It readsTUNA INDUSTRY PROPOSED. The possibilities of establishing a valuable tuna fishing industry in Australia were discussed yesterday by Mr D. W. Bingham, on his arrival by Tasman flying-boat. Mr Bingham, who has been studying the fishing industry in the United States of America for the past three montlis, said that his trip was sponsored by the Fisheries Division of the Commonwealth Research Department. He would report to .the department in a private capacity. The tuna fishing industry could he established for about £100,000, said Mr Bingham. One boat, which would cost £30,000, would mean an industry of £315,000 a season. Mr. Bingham suggested that an 80 to 90 feet boat with a 300 horse-power engine would bo the most suitable. "" We will never get anywhere by the present system,"" Mr Bingham said. ""Australians are not natural fishermen, and they must be shown."" He added that the Slav fisherman, who earned about £1,000 a year in 'America, would be willing to come to Australia. "" Canneries already established in Australia would be able to handle the canning of the tuna,"" said Mr Bingham. "" Tliere would be a market for the fish in America. Mr Bingham is the managing director of D. W. Bingham Proprietary Limited, of Melbourne and Sydney, a f i r m which specializes in cannery installation. Those who have interested themselves is the development of the tuna (fishing industry know of the great possibilities. In addition to a ready market locally for this fish, the prospects of an export trade to the United States of America are bright. My purpose in speaking today is to direct attention to the report of Mr. Bingham's opinions, and particularly to his statement that canneries already exist for dealing with tuna. ""Whereas he considered that one boat, 80 feet or 90 feet Mr Barnard. long, would he adequate for the work, I stated in evidence before the Tariff Board that four or five boats would be necessary for the purpose. The boats must be suitably equipped with tackle for catching and handling the fish. In addition, experienced fishermen are required. The .fishing industry is most important to Tasmania. Its waters are the coldest in Australia and have the best supply of fish. 'Considerable development is already taking place. One business firm is actively engaged in operating a factory on Elinders Island, but the Commonwealth Government should provide assistance in order to accelerate its efforts. Tliere is a big demand for fish, not only locally, but .also for our fighting forces abroad. Although the matter of manpower may be urged as a reason for deferring a decision, I point out that the demands of the industry in that respect would not be heavy, and, as Mr Bingham indicated, some foreigners would have to be induced to come here for the purpose of instructing our fishermen in the art. I urge the Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to discuss the subject as soon as practicable with the Minister for Supply and Development, and to emphasize to other Ministers the need for reaching a decision as to who will be responsible for controlling the matter. I shall not be very happy if it is relegated to the background in the present hurly-burly.",50
123,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,Barker) [5.5] - I wish to deal first with a matter raised by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell). The honourable .gentleman was rather annoyed because it has been decided to expend more money on the construction of a school for the teaching of motor mechanics for the Army.,51
124,Mr CALWELL,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,That was not the reason for my annoyance. It was because the money is likely to be expended wrongly in that school premises are to be erected in undesirable localities.,51
125,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"I do not agree that they are being erected in undesirable localities. ""We do not want them to be established at Fisherman's Bend or Woolloomooloo Bay. As the chief sites for camps in Victoria are in the Seymour locality, to my mind Seymour is the obvious place at which these schools should be established. These institutions will not cease to be of value when the war is over; they will have to he carried .on after the war because of the increasing mechanization of the Army. years ago I pointed out the desirability of a change-over from light horse to .armoured regiments, but it has taken a long time for honourable members to realise that the establishment of schools for the training of technicians is an important feature of army training. It is most unfortunate that there is a tendency in all directions today to "" k i c k "" the Army every time it asks for funds. When a few thousand pounds is asked of the Government for the establishment of these schools an objection is immediately raised. Yesterday we passed a bill providing for the payment of an extra £2,000,000 to invalid and old-age pensioners. That was a matter for jubilation ; but as soon as a request is made for the provision of funds for the training of men for overseas service it is questioned by unthinking people. It is time that honourable members began to realise that the Army does not consist entirely of "" nit-wits'"".",51
126,Mr CALWELL,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,What about the Board of Business Administration?,52
127,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"The board is one of the worse bottlenecks in the country. The greatest bottleneck is the Department of Defence Coordination. Next in importance among the bottlenecks is the Advisory War Council. The Board of Business Administration comes next. The elimination of these three bottlenecks by simply wiping them out of existence should enable us to get somewhere. The other point I wish to raise is in - connection with the subject of man-power which was dealt with by the honourable members for Fawkner (Mr Holt) and Wakefield (Mr Duncan-Hughes). If the Minister cares to look at the files he will no doubt find that they contain a copy - of the man-power regulations which I drafted when I was a member of a former government but to which effect was not - riven because they were not approved by Cabinet. It is impossible to build ships or to turn out shells, tanks and other munitions of war to full capacity if every worker is free to accept employment wherever he likes. There can be no solution of the manpower problem until the Government Seven assumes full control of the man-power of this country. I endeavoured to convince the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) during question time this morning that it , is sheer futility for him and for the Minister for Munitions (Mr Makin) to talk about a 100 per cent, war effort and to say, at the same time, that it will be achieved on a voluntary basis. The very fact that we have these circuses in Martin-place, Sydney, in front of the Melbourne Town Hall, and in other capital cities, at which dancers and singers lend their help in the appeal for recruits is ample proof that we have not yet achieved a 100 per cent, war effort. Until the Government accepts the principle that, during the war period, every man has to be in the place where he is of most use to his country, we shall not arrive at the solution of the man-power problem. At present employers are permitted to compete against each other for the services of competent workmen. I saw glaring instances of such competition in the naval shipbuilding yards. There were two leakages of labour there, one, to the armed f orces-and I had no power to stop that-and the other to private employers. Highly skilled and irreplaceable men who should have been kept at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, and Garden Island and other important shipbuilding yards in the Commonwealth, were permitted to enlist in infantry battalions and be sent overseas. That is a misuse of man-power. Trained and almost irreplaceable men are permitted of their own free will to go into the fighting forces where their skill is not utilized.",52
128,Sir GEORGE BELL,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,The honourable member would not allow such men to join the Australian Imperial Force?,52
129,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,I could not stop them; but they are of more value to their country in building and repairing ships than in defending Australia on some foreign battlefield. In that way we have lost the services of competent shipwrights and trained engineers who cannot be replaced. Sir GEOKOB BEI.L - Ver y few of them have joined the Australian Imperial Force.,52
130,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Non e of bhem should have been permitted to do so. There should be a proper control and marshalling of the available man-power of the country. Certainly until such time as the Government assumes control of the man-power of this country and places every man in the job he is best able to perform, it will be impossible for this country to achieve the maximum production of the materials of war.",53
131,Mr DEDMAN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Corio-Minister for War Organization of Industry) [5.11] I fully realise the importance of the matter raised by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Barnard). The honourable member has been a consistent advocate of the development of the fishing industry in Australia, particularly in Tasmania. We all realise the importance of the industry at the present juncture, particularly as our imports of tinned fish have been curtailed. An opportunity exists now to develop this industry which may not occur again. Following upon the report on the fishing industry by the Tariff Board a conference was held under the auspices of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research which recommended that a developmental authority be set up to encourage the industry. I have, of course, studied that recommendation carefully. I object to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research being used for the conduct of commercial activities; I believe that it should confine its activities to research work. I was interested to hear from the honourable member that in other parts of the world the development of the fishing industry has taken place as an adjunct to a research department established by the Government. I shall be glad to discuss this aspect of the matter further with the honourable member at an early date.",53
132,Mr HOLT,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,Is it the view of the chief executive officers of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research that that body should not undertake commercial activities?,53
133,Mr DEDMAN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Yes . I have discussed this problem with the Minister for Supply and Development. There are many phases of it which must be given proper consideration. For instance, the development of the fishing industry is inextricably bound up with such problems as man-power and the supply of fishing boats. Honourable members will readily understand that this matter has to be given very careful consideration. However, I shall discuss it again with my colleague the Minister for Supply and Development, and we shall endeavour to arrive at a decision as to the kind of developmental authority that should be set up and as to whether it should be placed under the supervision of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research or the Department of Supply and Development. I assure the honourable member that the matter raised by him will receive consideration immediately the Government has the time to give attention to it among the many problems which confront it at present.",53
134,Mr HOLLOWAY,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Melbourne P o r t sMinister for Social Services) [5.15] - I support the contention of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) regarding the proposed establishment of military technical training schools. The Minister for the Army (Mr. Forde) intends to hear the arguments advanced on this matter from both sides, and, perhaps, after having done BO, he will be able to come to a decision. The suggestion of the Southern Command and of the Board of Business Administration that a military technical training school should be established at Broadmeadows appears to me to be ridiculous. In my opinion, such a technical training school should be close to big engineering works. One difficulty already experienced at the Broadmeadows camp is the lack of accommodation, and, as a result, men in the Ordnance Department have been requested by the Army to sleep at night at their own homes instead of at the camp. Recently, I had trouble in getting a bus service from the camp to the Broadmeadows station for the transport of the men. The advantages of a site like Fisherman's Bend for the proposed school over that proposed at Broadmeadows are manifold. Heavy materials for industry are brought up the Yarra river to the various workshops and double handling is avoided. [ understand that it is cheaper to carry material from Newcastle to Fisherman's Bend than it is to carry the same material from Newcastle to Sydney, or even a few miles out of Newcastle, if the material has to be handled twice. The Armoured Division of the Australian Imperial Force is to be established at Fisherman's Bend, and equipment for that division will be assembled there. The aircraft factories are at Fisherman's Bend, and, when the aeronautical engineering laboratory of the university was established, Fisherman's Bend was chosen for the site, because of the necessity for the laboratory to be in close proximity to the aircraft factories. Is it not as necessary that a military technical training school also should be in close proximity to works where the trainees will be engaged and to the Armoured Division into which many of the trainees will probably be drafted? Another reason why Fisherman's Bend, or some similar locality, should be seleoted rather than Broadmeadows is the fact that when peace rules again the school will be used as an ordinary technical training school. It would be useless for such purposes if it were lished at Broadmeadows, because few would be willing to travel the long distances involved in reaching it, especially for night classes. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) is not alone in knowing that difficulties exist in the manufacture of munitions owing to the continued activities of private employers in enticing skilled workers from munitions factories. A year ago, as a member of the Manpower and Resources Survey Committee, [ endeavoured to persuade that committee bo report to the then government that it was necessary that a system of priorities be introduced in order to ensure that raw materials required in the munitions industry would not go to private industry. I suggested a rationing scheme, but the majority of the committee failed to support me. If private employers have not materials with which to carry on they will not have the inducement to entice men from the munitions industry. The only alternative is one which I do not like, and that is the conscription of labour. The friction that would be caused by interference with private industry by the rationing of materials would not be so great as the discord that would be brought about by industrial conscription, but either one or the other is necessary if we are to do as we all want to do, namely, achieve the greatest possible war effort. Had rationing been instituted a year ago, first gradually, but with increasing intensification, the process would have, been almost imperceptible and would not have caused the dislocation of industry which must result now. I know that what I am saying will be unpopular. Indeed, in my own electorate there are many private employers who would be affected if the Government decided that their copper and brass rods, and steel and iron, and whatever they need would be either not available or available only in reduced quantities. The displaced labour would return to the munitions factories from where the honourable member for Fawkner says that skilled men are now running. There will be no other place for them to go. I can well understand the view of private manufacturers. estabTheir interests lie in the maintenance of their industries, but they must not be allowed to maintain them at the expense of the war effort. I have made a suggestion to the Minister, to which I think he will agree, that a conference should be called immediately of representatives of the branches of industry engaged in this work. For instance, the honourable member for Fawkner read a statement made by the secretary of the Arms and Munitions Workers Union. A large number of females are engaged in this work. One reason for this trouble is the fact that, originally, we tried to work employees on shifts of twelve or fourteen hours a day over a long period. That method was unwise, and I consistently opposed it. Certainly, individual workers may be able to work round the clock, as I myself have done, but only over a short period. That system cannot be continued for any considerable time. Originally, we put the men on shifts of ten, twelve and fourteen hours, but eventually they .became physically and mentally over-tired, with the result that their volume of output and standard of accuracy declined. In addition the men lost vitality, and each day they were less eager for work than they were on the preceding day. According to all of the experts on the matter the only way in which an economic output can be maintained is by employing men on reasonable shifts. That is what the captains of industry strive to do in order to maintain their costs at a uniform rate. They let their men knock off before they become fatigued in order that they will be able to resume duty on the following day as fit and as fresh as they commenced duty on the preceding day. Every one knew that the system of working twelve-hour shifts would break down. Most of us, however, hoped that the war would finish first. I was asked to work out a roster whereby the greatest utilization could be made of certain machines which were scarce. I was asked to show how these machines could be worked for 24 hours. I replied that we should risk the destruction of the machine rather than the health of the men. For instance, if the normal life of a machine be 25 years we could be prepared to work it out in five years. We drew up a roster on that basis and now work those machines for 24 hours a day, seven days a week; and every man engaged on them works eight hours a day, except crib time, which has to be excluded, for six days a week. Each of those men has one day off a week, although not necessarily the same day each week.",53
135,Mr HOLT,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,Is one shift of twelve hours worked?,55
136,Mr HOLLOWAY,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"No . We have added one-seventh of the number of men normally required. That is how we have overcome that problem. However, as I have said, sufficient machines and men were not available in the early stages. In the meantime we have obtained more men and more machines. I believe that if this system were instituted in every munitions factory, whether it be run by the Government or by private enterprise, ve should achieve the ideal. All of the lftchines in *very factory - vould be operated constantly, seven days a week, but individual operators would work only on eight-hour shifts for six days a week. Thus the work would be done properly, and the men would last much longer than the machines. The trouble today is that some of the men do not want to continue to work shifts of twelve hours. They have said, in effect, "" No more overtime"". Other men are struggling on in order to earn the overtime. The reason why that system broke down was that men were induced, by private enterprise, to leave government factories. That difficulty will only be overcome by the institution of uniform shifts in all munitions factories, whether they be controlled by the Government or by private enterprise. In that way we shall remove the inducements which are now held out to government employees to transfer to private factories. I believe that there is only one view to take of this problem. We must anticipate that the war will last for at least ten years. With that idea in mind we must build up our output, so that we shall attain our greatest rate of production and greatest volume of reserves of arms and munitions when the "" cease fire "" signal is given. We must not think of the danger of having a surplus left on our hands. Secondly, we must gradually ration the raw materials required for the manufacture of munitions, making exceptions only in proved cases of hardship. All we shall seek to do in such a scheme of rationing will be to secure the greatest possible proportion of available supplies of raw materials for the manufacture of munitions.",55
137,Mr FORDE,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Capricornia-Minister for the Army) [5.30] - The various matters mentioned by honourable members will be carefully considered by the Government. Some of the items raised have been specifically answered by the Ministers concerned. I should like to reply to the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell). I listened with interest to his remarks on the important subject of the establishment of a school at Broadmeadows for the training of motor transport drivers and mechanics in the third military district. The honourable member made rather sweeping accusations against the A r m y Department and the Board of Business Administration, alleging that the sum of approximately £300,000, which it is proposed to expend throughout Australia, will practically be wasted, and that a sum of £70,000, proposed to he expended on the establishment of the motor school at Broadmeadows, will also be wasted if the school be established in that locality. He contended that it would be far wiser to establish the .'ehool at Fisherman's Bend, in which case, at the conclusion of the war, it could probably be utilized by the State Government in a technical education scheme. The decision to establish the school at Broad in eadows was made by my predecessor. I cannot say at this stage whether I am opposed to that decision. I have an open mind on the matter. At the same time. I am anxious that the right thiug shall be done, and with a view to obtaining all of the facts, I am prepared to receive a deputation at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, at 9.15 ou Monday morning next. I shall the glad if the honourable member for Melbourne will then introduce to me representatives of the interests who have made the representations which he has voiced. Mr CALWETX. - We shall, be there.",55
138,Mr FORDE,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Simpl y because a. decision has been made, we should not be bound by it if it can be shown that a wiser course is open to us. However, I remind the honourable member that this matter has been under the consideration of the M i l it a r y Board and the Board of Business Administration. I have not yet had time to go into the matter carefully. I have in my hand a minute which I have received from Major-General Rowell, Deputy Chief of the General Staff, who is also a member of the M i l it a r y BoardIt is advised that Fisherman's Bend was considered as a location for third military district motor transport school and rejected for the following reasons:(a) Comparatively high expenditure involved in appropriation of land, or , alternatively in rental. (b) Comparative unsuitability of site for hygienic and disciplinary reasons and as regards area of ground available. (c) Higher building costs-this area is largely reclaimed. (d) Unsuitability for use in operations in case of emergency. 2. It is considered that as the capital value of all motor vehicles in the Army amounts to several millions of pounds, the cost of these schools is more than justified in ensuring efficient instruction and training for adequate numbers of personnel to maintain those vehicles. Without efficiently trained personnel, vehicles will have a relatively short life, and without adequate training facilities the numbers and efficiency in personnel cannot be ensured. 3. Further, it is considered that a school at Broadmeadows, which is an outer suburb of Melbourne, would be just as accessible for post-war trainees as at Fisherman's Bench Mr CAIAVETJ.. - Broadmeadow s is 10 miles from the city.",56
139,Mr FORDE,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"We are not able to tell how far the city of Melbourne will extend in the future. The Victorian Business Administration Committee also considered this matter, and approved of the recommendation of the M i l it a r y Board on the ground that it was(a) Tactically sound, as it is out of the forward area. (6) .Serviced by good roads, with all facilities, water, light, &c, already available. (c) Will be established on Commonwealth E roperty. Land acquisition therefore costs nil. and at Fisherman's Bend is owned by the State Government. It is valued at an extremely high figure and rent demanded by the Crown Lands Department is correspondingly high. Tliere is no surety that buildings erected to army pattern would be taken over by the State Government at the conclusion of the war. The Commonwealth is thus faced with probability of being required to pay high land rentals during the war. and having to dismantle its buildings at the conclusion thereof - a most uneconomical proposition. An additional argument advanced by the committee in favour of the Broadmeadows site was that, in order to obtain the necessary knowledge in the time available, students of the motor transport school must work or study night and day, and that the site is far enough from the attractions of the city to permit of such concentration. I have an open mind on this subject; I want to do the right thing, and, therefore, I shall be glad to hear the representations in favour of Fishermen's Bend in Melbourne on Monday morning. Large sums of money are being expended throughout Australia on the training of craftsmen, and if it can be proved to me that a motor transport school at Fishermen's Bond will be more convenient than one at Broadmeadows, will cost less money, and can afterwards be used by the State Government as a technical school, or for some other purpose, I shall weigh such evidence very carefully. When I have heard the case in favour of Fisherman's Bend, an immediate decision will be made.",56
140,Mr FRANCIS,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Moreton) [5.38] During the second-reading debate on the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill yesterday, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) referred to the possibility of "" rackets "" being carried out by organizations formed in order to collect from pensioners small fortnightl y sums which amounted to a substantial fund which in Victoria was estimated by him to amount to £60,000. The honourable gentleman indicated that, in the main, these organizations were directly or indirectly, with funeral directors to ensure the payment of funeral expenses for old-age pensioners.",57
141,Mr CALWELL,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,The honourable gentleman was absolutely right.,57
142,Mr HUTCHINSON,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,I did not mention funeral directors. That remark was made in an interjection.,57
143,Mr CALWELL,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"I accept the responsibility for that interjection. Mir. FRANlCIS - The honourable member for Melbourne apparently knows all about "" rackets "". In reply to his accusation, I wish to place on record the contents of an urgent telegram which I have just received from a firm of funeral directors in Brisbane. The telegram readsReference reported pensions debate November twentieth respectfully desire bring before your notice that exploitation of Queensland pensioners and general public by funeral directors was prevented by State friendly societies acts enacted November, 1.940. (Signed) ALEX. GOW PTX. LTD. That communication replies effectively on behalf of Queensland funeral directors to the general and unqualified remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne.",57
144,Mr BLACKBURN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Bourke) [5.40] The remarks of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) impel me to state that such organizations throughout this country have rendered valuable service to the pensioners. They came into existence, when pensions were retrenched, in order to defend the interests of pensioners and recover for them the ground that they had lost. They were non-partisan, and the pensions were restored largely as the result of their work. In addition to this, they have brought pensioners together and taught them to help one another. That was a valuable by-product of the financial depression. It is a pity that provision for the burial of old-age pensioners should have to be made by the present system. The Commonwealth Government ought to make burial insurance for old-age pensioners a supplementary provision of the pensions scheme. Many old age pensioners are continually worried about making provision for their funerals; they should be put beyond worry hy the establishment of a associated, small insurance plan, which could be contributory, because the scheme which they have at present is contributory. The non-partisan organizations which have helped the old-age pensioners do not engage in "" rackets "". They were forced into existence hy the fact that old age pensions were reduced, with the consent of all political parties represented in this chamber, and since then they have served the useful purpose of teaching the pensioners self-reliance and mutual assistance.

The following answers to questions were circulated:WOOL SCOURING IN QUEENSLAND.",57
145,Mr RIOKDAN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"the Minister for Commerce, upon notice I. Is it a fact that a circular letter dealing with the scouring of wool was issued on the 8th August to Queensland wool-growers by the Brisbane Wool Selling Brokers' Association ? 2. Do the statements and advice contained in the second paragraph of that letter reflect the true situation and the policy of the Central Wool Committee? 3. Is the association mentioned qualified to make such statements as to shipping facilities or to give such advice in view of the secrecy observed in most other aspects of the sale of Australian wool to the British Government? 4. Would it be likely that secrecy is necessary only so long as it is to the advantage of the wool-selling brokers? 5. Does the appraisement system purport to ensure that all wools are equitably valued on a clean scoured basis and that it should be immaterial to the grower whether his wool is appraised in the greasy or scoured state? (i. Docs the circular suggest that, as at appraisement or ultimately, the return to the grower from greasy wool will be better than from scoured? 7. If the suggestion is made only as to ultimate realization and, even if it be the case, does he regard the small gain that might accrue to growers as disproportionate to the harm done to a valuable section of our own wool-manufacturing industry to the advantage of foreigners? 8. Is wool scoured in Brisbane subsequent to passing through original appraisement subjected to re-appraisement in brokers' stores; if so, what remuneration accrues to brokers on this account?",57
146,Mr SCULLY,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. A circular dated the 8th August, 1.941, was issued by the Brisbane Wool Selling Brokers' Association to wool-growers in Queensland. 2. It is understood that the statements and advice contained in the second paragraph of the circular letter reflected the position arose some time ago out of the shortage of oversea shipping and the necessity to meet demands of the United States of America buyers for greasy types. There is no demand from the United States of America for scoured wool. 3 and 4. The reference in the circular letter regarding shipping facilities is a statement that shipping facilities to the United Kingdom have been greatly reduced. This is common knowledge throughout the Commonwealth and the statement is not regarded as conveying secret information. 5. Under the appraisement system, all wools are valued on a clean scoured basis, and for scoured wools an addition is made to cover the cost of scouring. 8. The circular does not state that a grower would obtain a better return under appraisement from greasy 'wool than from scoured wool, but such an inference might be drawn by a person not conversant with the position. 7. Wool-selling brokers advise their clients on the method of sending wool into their stores and it is natural that they should consider their clients' interests before taking into account the interests of manufacturers. 8. To date, wool scoured in Brisbane on behalf of the Government of the United Kingdom has been sent to wool-selling brokers' stores for re-appraisement. The payment made by the Central Wool Committee to woolbrokers for this service has been at the rate of 4s. per bale. The Government is at present consideri n g the problems associated with w o o l scouring. PRIMARY PRODUCTS : MINIMUM PRICES.",58

Has any application been made to Uie Prices Commissioner by the employers in either case for permission to add the increased production costs arising front the wage increases to the price charged to the consumer?",58
150,Mr WARD,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w s : 1. (o) The Federal Clothing Trades award was varied by Judge Drake-Brockman on the 1.1th November. The variation granted i weekly war loading of 5s. for males and 3s. for females, to operate from the 1st January, 1942; (6) the dispute in which the Brick, Pottery and Tile Employees' Union was concerned in the metropolitan area of Sydney was settled by an agreement reached by a Conciliation Committee under the "" Industrial Arbitration Act, 1940"" of New South Wales. This agreement was settled as an award under that act. As the provisions are rather lengthy, they arc not reproduced here, but a copy will be given to the honourable member. 2. See 1 above. :i. The Minister for Trade and Customs has supplied the following answer:-Following an application by brick manufacturers in New South Wales, the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner recently increased the price of bricks to offset increased costs arising from higher labour costs. The new price is still lower than that of any other capital city in the Commonwealth. No similar application has beeu made in respect of the clothing trade or of the tilo and pottery industries. PROFESSOR COPLAND.",58
151,Mr SHEEHAN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"the Minister, upon notice I. What positions are at present held by Professor Copland with (a) the Commonwealth Government, (6) any State Government, and (c) any other public or quasipublic body? 2. What payments by way of (a) salary, and (b) allowances are made to Professor Copland in respect of each position?",59
152,Mr CURTIN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Professo r Copland was appointed Commonwealth Prices Commissioner at the outbreak of the war. Later, he was appointed Economic Consultant to the Prime Minister. arrangement with the State Government of Victoria his services as chairman of the State Economic Committee were retained in that capacity. With the approval of the Commonwealth Government he was appointed by the State Government to be a Commissioner of the State Savings Bank of Victoria. Professor Copland is a temporary officer of the Commonwealth, carrying out onerous duties for the Government, and it is not reasonable to ask that he should completely sever his connection with his own State. Professor Copland is on leave from the University of Melbourne. As Commonwealth Prices Commissioner and Economic Consultant to the Prime Minister, Professor 'Copland's emoluments are £1,800 .per annum, plus an allowance of 30s. a day which includes '-' living away from home "" allowance and travelling expenses. His emoluments as Commissioner of the State Savings Bank have been reduced at Professor Copland's own request during the period of his occupancy of the office of Prices Commissioner to one-half of the normal rate which is £500. As chairman of the State Economic Committee he receives the nominal amount of £100 per annum. Having regard to salaries paid to senior officers of the Public Service, Professor Copland's total emoluments are regarded as proper to his office. ANGLO-ITALIAN TREATY.",59
153,Mr BLACKBURN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"the Minister for E x t e r n a l A f fair s , upon notice I. Which of the Australian colonies were hound by the Anglo-Italian Treaty of 1883? 2. Before the war with Italy was that treaty binding upon the Commonwealth or upon any State? Prime 3. What is the effect of the war upon that treaty? Is it entirely annulled or is it merely suspended during the war? 4. What limitations upon the freedom of action of the Commonwealth or of any State were imposed by that treaty? 5. Apart from the effect of the war, has the Commonwealth or any State affected, power, without the consent of Italy, to retire from the treaty?",59
154,Dr EVATT,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia. By 2. Withi n one year from the date of the exchange of ratifications of the treaty in 1883. its stipulations were made applicable to the five colonies mentioned in 1. In this way the treaty became binding on the Crown in relation to the five colonies. After federation, when the colonies became States of the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth came to accept the responsibility for carrying out international obligations so far as they were binding on the Crown in relation to any portion of the territory within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. Again, by its conduct in relation to the treaty of 1883, the Commonwealth accepted the position that the treaty of 1883 was in force in the five States mentioned. Further, in the official statement and investigations leading up to the 1930 League of Nations Conference at the Hague for the Codification of International Law, nearly every country accepted almost without qualification the doctrine attributing exclusive responsibility in the domain of international law to that authority in a federal state which was entrusted wit h the control of external affairs. At the conference in question the declaration of Great Britain and Australia was as follows:""Where a state is responsible for the conduct of the foreign relations of another political unit (e.g., colonies, protectorates or protected States), or where the constitutional - arrangements prevailing in a state vest the responsibility for external affairs in a common or central government while vesting the responsibility for other matters in the government of a sub# ordinate unit (e.g., unions of states or federal states), responsibility for the fulfilment of the obligations prescribed by international law rests upon the government conducting the foreign or external affairs of the state. It is with that government alone that foreign states muintain relations. The distribution of powers between itself and the other or subordinate units on whose behalf it is entitled to speak is a domestic matter with which foreign states are not concerned. A government which is the appointed organ for the conduct of the foreign affairs of other units cannot evade responsibility by alleging that constitutionally its powers of control over these units are inadequate to enable it to enforce compliance with international obligations."" 3. After the outbreak of war with Italy the treaty ceased to be effective. Whether it is annulled or merely suspended is a question of international law on which opinions may possibly differ. The late Professor Charteris, a very eminent authority, expressed the view that the treaty was merely suspended. In any event, the treaty has no operation during the war and the Commonwealth Government will take care to see that in the treaty of peace the interests of Australian citizens are full y safeguarded in relation to the treaty. 4. The treaty was one of commerce and navigation. It provided for reciprocal freedom of commerce and navigation. It provided that the subjects of each party should have liberty freely to come to all places in the dominions and possessions of the other and to enjoy the same rights, privileges and liberties in matters of commerce and navigation as those enjoyed by "" native subjects"". It provided for most-favoured-nation treatment on a basis of reciprocity in matters of commerce and for the reciprocal appointment and reception of consular officers and agents. It provided that the subjects of each contracting party, conforming to the laws of the country, should have full liberty to enter, travel or reside in any part of the dominions and possessions of the other, to carry on their commerce and to exercise civil rights on the same footing as native subjects. a. Article 20 of the treaty provided that it should come into force on 1st July, 1883, and remain in force until 1st February, 1892, and thereafter until the expiration of one year of the date of repudiation by either of the high contracting parties. No provision was made by the treaty for separate withdrawal in relation to any part of the King's dominions. Therefore, before federation, none of the five colonies had any express power, without the consent of Italy, to "" retire "" from the treaty. In spite of this, the Commonwealth's new status as a separate unit in international law and relations may fairly be regarded as giving [28] it an overriding power to determine for itself whether a treaty to which it never formally adhered should be further continued. I am informed that, by arrangement with the Italian Government, a limitation upon migrants from Ital y to Australia was fixed in the year 1928. No formal exchange of Notes on this matter was effected but in actual practice a limitation was adhered to by both parties until the outbreak of the present war. So far as the post-war position is concerned, Australia's future relationships with enemy countries will be dependent upon the outcome of the war and the negotiations at the peace conference. It can be said that, whatever political party is then in power in Australia, the interests of Australians will be fully safeguarded. WHEAT POOL 1941-42.",59
155,Mr LANGTRY,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"the Minister for Commerce, upon notice I. Will he inform the House of the amount of the first payment to be made for this season's wheat? 2. Will he make the amount us high as possible? 3. Will he stipulate that payment shall be made direct to the grower so that he will he in a position to pay his accounts pro rata from money received, in view of the fact that the price received for wheat is below the cost of production?",60

"" DAILY TELEGRAPH "" PILM.",60
159,Mr FORDE,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"Yes t e r d a y the honourable member for D a r l in g (Mr C l a r k ) asked me the following question, without notice:Has the attention of the Deputy Prime Minister been drawn to the fact that a film is being shown in Sydney theatres advertising the Daily Telegraph in which Commonwealth Ministers are portrayed being interviewed by Daily Telegraph pressmen, and in which it is implied that exclusive interviews are given to that newspaper? Was this Aim made with the full knowledge of the Ministers that it was to be for this purpose, and is the impression correct that exclusive interviews are given to that newspaper? In reply I inform the honourable member that following inquiries which were in train prior to his question, the management of the Daily Telegraph has agreed to withdraw the motion picture from exhibition. The Prime Minister and the Ministers concerned entirely dissociate themselves from any impression which might be conveyed by the motion picture that exclusive interviews are given to a representative of the Daily Telegraph. POWER ALCOHOL.",60
160,Mr BEASLEY,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"On the 19th November the honourable member for Flinders (Mr. Ryan) asked me, without notice, whether it was a fact that, as reported in the press, the price of second-grade power alcohol in Melbourne had risen from Is. I d . to 5s. a gallon, and whether this spirit should not be brought under the control of the Government, both in regard to the price and the rationing of supplies. I am now .in a position to inform the honourable member that this statement apparently refers to small quantities' of methylated spirits intended for industrial use which may have found their way into use as a motor spirit. The manufacturers, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, have declined to sell methylated spirits for motor fuel, and have requested the cooperation of retailers to this end, because by producing power alcohol which is controlled as to price and rationing the production of methylated spirits will be sufficient only to meet the needs of industrial users. With the recent excise duty of Is. 6d. a gallon the price of methylated spirits is now about 3s. 9d. a gallon. If it is established that any appreciable quantities of methylated spirit are being used as a motor spirit the Government will consider action either to forbid it3 use in this way or to fix the price and to bring it within the scope of petrol rationing. INVENTIONS.",61
161,Mr MORGAN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"the Minister for Defence Co-ordination, upon notice I. Who comprised the personnel of the former Central Inventions Board? 2. Will he table the reports and recommendations of Sir David Rivett and Sir George Julius which led up to the abolition of the Board? 3. Have any persons wit h expert knowledge been engaged to guide service Ministers in their deliberations as to the future handling of Australian inventions?",61
162,Mr CURTIN,WHEN STATUTORY PERCENTAGE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Captain L . A. W. Spooner, OBE., R.A.N., representing Department of the Navy; Colonel L. E. S. Barker, M . C , Director of Artillery, representing the Department of the Army; Flying-Officer S. R. Bell, Royal Australian Air Force, representing the Department of A i r ; A. Mealand, M.I.Mech.E., Mem.A.S.M.K, representing Department of Munitions; Sir George Julius, B.Sc, B.E., representing Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. 2. I shall be glad to make available to the honourable member the official file regarding this matter. 3. When the War Cabinet decided that the Central Inventions Board should be abolished and that the responsibility for dealing with inventions should revert to the Service Departments and the Department of Munitions, in respect of inventions relating to their own departments, it also requested the respective Ministers to examine the methods of dealing with inventions within their departments, to ensure that they are adequately considered from both the scientific and the service aspects. The ministerial investigations arc at present being made, but the existing machinery in the Service Departments to advise on inventions is as follows:Navy and Air - Proposal s relating to inventions are dealt with by the officers of the appropriate technical branch. Army - The Master-General of the Ordnance is, in general, responsible for all matters relating to inventions and his staff comprises officers with technical qualifications. There is in each military district a district inventions board, the constitution of which has been laid down as follows:One artillery officer serving full time; One engineer officer serving full time; Two persons who may not be officers of the Forces but who possess qualifications equivalent to a university degree in engineering or science. In addition, it is customary, where necessary, to enlist the help of the technical experts of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and of the universities, as well as other appropriate authorities, in connection with the examination of inventions.",61
