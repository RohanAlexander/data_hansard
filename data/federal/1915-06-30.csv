1,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Prime M in ister and Treasurer) [3.3] - I desire to make a personal explanation. Since we last met, there appeared in the Melbourne Argus, on 26th June, an article by "" It h u r i e l , "" in which, referring to the passage of the Trade and Commerce Referendum Bill after the departure of members of the Opposition, appear the following words: The Prime Minister and the Attorney-General were left staring blankly at emptiness, and it was a dramatic moment. The Speaker put the question that the Bill in hand be read a second time, and it was carried on the voices. The Chairman took the chair, read the titles of the few clauses, and in a minute or two the Bill was through Committee and reported to the House. Then the Prime Minister lost hia head for a space. He stepped up to tha Attorney-General at the table and said, "" Third reading, third reading. Put it right through."" Fortunately for the party, Mr. Hughes had himself bettor in hand. The third reading could, of course, have been taken by consent of the House, and there was no meinber of the Opposition present to dissent'. But the Bill would bave heen lost. It could not have been brought forward again this session, and a maimed scheme would have been presented to the people. In this statement the words, "" Third reading, thir d reading. P u t it right through,"" appear in inverted commas. The statement is not true. I ' did not utter these words, nor had I any such thought in my mind as they would have . expressed. The passage I have read reflects on my honour, because, on the afternoon on which the second reading was passed, I promised the Opposition that the old arrangement for the passing of the Bill.would-hold good.",5
2,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,Unknown,"Flinders) [ 3 . 5 ] - I , too, desire to make a personal explanation. I do not often trouble the House with these explanations",5

4,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,Unknown,"The Premier of Victoria is Teported to have said at the Farmers' Convention, with regard to certain proposals of the Government of the State, for the fixing of pricesThe priee-fixing laws were not the product of the Victorian Government alone. _ They were the result of a Conference, in which Mr. Joseph Cook, 8ir William Irvine, Mr Fisher, and others participated, and the decision was unanimous. The Bills were actually drafted by Sir William Irvine, and there was no motive whatever behind them other tban the public good. The PBIMB MINISTER - Hear , hear. To the last sentence of the report I take no exception, but those that preceded it require considerable modification. took place was this: Almost after the outbreak of war, certain action was taken in Western Australia, think was about to be taken in Queensland, on the supposition that there was a great deal of cornering of foodstuffs and other necessaries of life. The Commonwealth Government at once the position, and appointed a Commission, as honourable members know. that the Commissioners should have power to obtain information compulsorily, drafted a measure for submission to the Parliaments of the States. the draft with me, but the Bill based on it, and passed by all, or certainly . a majority, of the State Parliaments, nothing whatever in the way of fixing prices. The fixation of prices is not mentioned in the measure, nor was it contemplated in the drafting course, I do not now say a word for or against the policy of fixing At that stage, what I and members of the Government desired to do was to invest the Commission which we were appointing with full power to obtain information from every person in whose hands there might be wheat, butter, or other foodstuffs or necessaries of life, and with power to obtain that mation, under compulsion, I have here a copy of the passed by the South Australian liament, which, though I hove compared it literally with the draft, seems to me, speaking from memory, to be an accurate copy of it. This measure compels the supplying of returns hy every person - who has in his possession or under his control the quantity of foodstuffs other commodities specified in the first column of its schedule. Such a person is obliged to give the fullest particulars of the quantity in his possession, the place where it is stored, and so forth, and the foodstuffs set out in the schedule practically all the necessaries of wheat, flour, oatmeal, bran, rice, hay, chaff, sugar, molasses, beef, mutton, bacon, ham, tea, coffee, and a number of other things. The actual draft to which the Premier of Victoria referred, was for a measure which was to be limited in its scope to the investing of the Commonwealth Commission with a power which we Sir William - Irvine. considered essential to its inquiry, so that the central Government of Australia What might be armed with full information reimmediately garding the supplies of wheat, meat, and other necessaries of life, and might either and I itself, or in co-operation wit h the Govern- ments of the States, take such steps as should be necessary to prevent the export of large quantities of foodstuffs, or the cornering of them within Australia. The considered step we took did not go beyond that. I have seen the Premier of Victoria in In order regard to this matter, and he entirely agrees with me as to the correctness of I this statement. I have not CONTROL OF FOODSTUFFS .",5

6,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Has the Assistant Minister of Defence any information to give the House regarding the progress made towards the establishment of a second shift at the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow ?,7
7,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Withi n the last few daya the Government have been very active in this matter. They have been in consultation with one of the most able mechanics and engineers in Australia, Mr . MCKay, of Walkers' Manufacturing Company Limited, of Queensland, and that gentleman has been engaged to go to L it h gow with very large powers indeed. If he chooses, lie is to make recommendations to the manager, Mr W r i g ht",7
8,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,Is Mr W r i g ht still manager *,7
9,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Mr Wright is still the Factory. We have given Mr MCKay very extensive powers, and we hope that he will act quickly. He is to consult with Mr Wright, and the assistant manager, with a view to doing everything possible to bring about an early increase in the output of rifles. The management of the Factory will be free to engage skilled mechanics wherever they can be obtained in Australia. In fact, those in authority have been given a free hand in every way, the sole desire of the Government being that a second shift shall be instituted as soon as possible, so that the output of rifles may be augmented. WAR LOAN.",7
10,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"As it will be necessary foi the Commonwealth Government to raise a loan to meet the increased war expenditure, will the Prime Minister say whether it is the intention of the Government to raise such a loan in Australia ? Is it not a fact that a war loan of £10,000,000 could be raised in Australia at 4^ per cent.""",7
11,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I do not know whether we could raise a war loan in Australia at 4£ per cent. For some time the Government have had in contemplation the flotation of a loan in Australia in order to provide money to meet necessary Commonwealth expenditure, including that in connection with the war. The project has not yet developed sufficiently for any definite announcement to be made, but 1 believe that a large amount of money is available in Australia, and an opportunity will be given to the people to invest that money in Commonwealth securities. SUPPLY OF SUGAR.",7
12,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Havin g regard to the news published in this morning's newspaper, concerning Government action in connection with the sugar crop in Queensland, I shall be glad if the Prime M i nister will make a statement to the House on the sugar question, and indicate what will be the position of the New South Wales growers, and those Queensland growers who are selling direct to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company?",7
13,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"As this matter is not in a sufficiently advanced stage to allow of a definite answer being given, I ask the honourable member to put the question on the notice-paper for a few days ahead. I hope that all the growers and consumers in Australia will equally benefit from whatever action the Government may take.",7
14,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"H as the Attorneyat General made any agreement with the Premier of Queensland i i i regard to the sugar crop? If so, will he indicate the terms of the agreement to the House ?",7
15,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The basis upon which an agreement may be arrived at ha6 been decided between the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government, but, at the present stage of the negotiations, it is not possible for me to give any detailed in formation to the House. The arrangements, so far as they have gone, are such as will safeguard the interests of the producers and consumers throughout Australia.",7
16,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Will the Prime Minister say whether the Government are taking any steps to insure a proper supply of sugar to the people of Australia until the arrangement with the Queensland Government takes effect?,7
17,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That is part of our duty, now and always. COA L FOR GREA TBRITAIN .",7
18,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister make inquiries as to whether there is a shortage of coal in Great Britain , and, if there is a shortage, will he inform the Imperial Government that large quantities of first-class coal can be supplied from New South Wales?",7
19,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Government have already been in communication with the British Government on that matter, and we are awaiting a reply.. LETTER BY MR. BRUCE SMITH.",7
20,Mr HAMPSON,Unknown,"Did the Prime Minister notice a letter published in the Age of Saturday last, signed by one Bruce Smith, in which the writer reflects on the Speaker of this House by saying that the leader of half of the people-meanin g the right H o n . Joseph Cook, P.O., M.P - wa s prevented, by Mr Speaker, from expressing his opinion, thereby inferring partisanship on of Mr Speaker on account of his being a member of what Mr Smith terms "" The Labour-Socialist Party "" ? Also, did the Prime Minister notice the insult to members of this House in the passage in which the writer says, "" We are standing still as a nation, hand-tied and tongue-tied, because a knot of men actuated by the German International Socialist spirit, who are themselves German in spirit, German in their methods, and German in their moral code will the Prime Minister take steps to have this unpatriotic person put under medical, if not military, care?",7
21,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The letter in question hae been twice mentioned to me, and twice brought before me, but I have not read it , nor do I intend to do so. NA REFRESHMENT BAR .",8
22,Mr FINLAYSON,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,"In view of the fact that on and after Tuesday next the sale of alcoholic liquor will be restricted to the hours 9 a.m. to 9.30 p.m., will you, Mr Speaker, confer with the President of the Senate with a view to the honouring of the amended licensing law in this House? Alternatively, will you confer with the President of the Senate with a view to talcing a vote of the members and oflieers of both Houses on the question of whether the alcoholic bar shall be open during the day?",8
23,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,"The question raised by the honourable member is one which comes within the jurisdiction of the House Committee. I have no objection to consulting with the President, and asking him to call a meeting of the House Committee for the consideration of the honourable member's proposal. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. RAILWAY TRAVELLIN G OF SOLDIEBS : LETTERS TO THE TROOPS : EXAMINATIO N OF VOLUNTEEP.S : REGIS TER OF REJECTS.",8
24,Mr JOHNTHOMSON,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,"In view of the removal of the training camp to Seymoutr, and the consequent increased expense of railway travelling, will the As» sistant Minister of Defence endeavour to make arrangements with the VictoriaH Railways Commissioners for the conveyance of soldiers in uniform to and from the camp free of charge?",8
25,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,1 will bring the matterthe part before the Minister of Defence.,8
26,Mr GROOM,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,"I have recently received a letter from the parent of a wounded man, in which it is stated that letters have been sent to him by every mail, but that he has not received any for over five weeks. Will the Assistant Minister of Defence state whether the improved system of delivery that he promised in regard to postal matter addressed to the troops has been brought into operation, or whether he has yet "" ? If so, received any communication from Colonel Legge that effect has been given to the improved system adopted?",8
27,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,"It is quite possible that a wounded soldier has not received' all the letters that have been sent to him, because of the difficulty that must be experienced . in quickly locating a soldier when he is sent to hospital. There are so many hospitals that it may be difficult to find any one soldier im mediately. I shall be happy to make inquiries concerning the latter portion of the question.",8
28,Mr MANIFOLD,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,"A few days ago I drew the attention of the Postmaster General to the fact that letters which had been addressed to a private in the Canadian Field Artillery in England had been sent by the postal authorities here to Egypt. The Postmaster-General then promised to inquire. I should like to ask him whether he has done so, as these letters are still being returned from Egypt, although originally ""they were addressed to England ?",8
29,Mr SPENCE,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,"I have had the matter inquired into, though it is not yet finally cleared up.. At the same time, I am surprised that the difficulty should be continuing, in view of the fact that inquiries have been made.",8
30,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,"I should like to ask the Assistant Minister of Defence, in view of the enormous percentage of "" r e MEDICAL jects "" amongst the men who have volunteered for the front , whether be will take into consideration the desirability of making it clearer, either through the newspapers or by means of posters, what precisely is required from men anxious to enlist? It cannot be that all these rejections are due to physical defects. Will the Minister do what he can to stop men who have no chance of passing the medical examination coming forward? - Mr JENSEN"" - I shall be pleased to comply with the honourable member's request.",8
31,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,Can the Assistant Minister of Defence say whether it would be in accord with the policy of his Department to make public the in structions given regarding medical examination? May it not also be possible to relax in some particulars the rigidity of those instructions? Mr JENSEN' - I shall be pleased to bring the right honourable gentleman's question under the notice of the Minister. I see some justification for it myself.,9
32,Dr CARTYSALMON,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,"Will the Assistant Minister of Defence state whether any register is kept of applications for enlistment at the. barracks, and whether, in view of the fact that there is to be a relaxation of the stringency of the medical examination, he will cause those who have been rejected for slight defects to be informed by letter that they may present themselves for re-examination ? If no such register is kept, will he cause one to be instituted ?",9
33,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,"I am not aware that such a register is kept, but I shall endeavour to comply with the honourable member's request. It is quite possible that some men may have been rejected for very slight defects such as would not render them unfit in the f u t u r e for enlistment. I think the suggestion is a good one. SPEECH BYDR . RENTOUL .",9
34,Mr THOMAS,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,"I should like to ask the Prime Minister if he has noticed the statement made by Dr Rentoul at the meeting held in Melbourne last night, in which he says that he knew that ""* as far as Mr Fisher, Mr Hughes and Senator Pearce were concerned, they in their hearts did not desire that this t h in g "" that is the referenda- "" should be placed before the people,"" and "" that it had been thrust upon them by the powers behind."" I ask the Prime Minister if Dr Rentoul was justified in making such a statement?",9
35,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,"If Dr Rentoul has been properly reported he has said something that he has no warrant or authority of any kind for saying. The statement is not true. I desire to add that, however other men may be influenced or led or driven, as far as I am personally concerned I shall not be driven by any one to any line of conduct of which I do not approve. ARRANGEMENT WITH BANKS.",9
36,Mr MATHEWS,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,"Will the honourable the Treasurer inform the House if he has availed himself to the full of the offer made by the banks to place £10,000,000 worth of gold with the Treasury in return for Commonwealth notes?",9
37,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,"The Treasury has availed itself of the agreement between the banks and the Government. We have not collected all the gold that we might have collected, but I am glad to sayand to say as frequently as I can-that the banks have acted up to their agreement. The reason we have not asked for all the gold that we are entitled to ask for under the agreement is that we do not desire it . RECRUITING CAMPAIGN.",9
38,Mr MASSYGREENE,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,"Can the Prime M in ister in f o rm the House whether he - has received any request from the committee organizing the State recruiting campaign that this House should adjourn for a week in order that honourable members may participate? If he has not received any request, and receives one, will he consider it?",9
39,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,"So far as I am aware, such a request as that referred to by the honourable member has not been received. Any request of that sort will receive the most careful consideration. MANUFACTURE OF MUNITIONS .",9
40,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,Can the Assistant Minister of Defence give the House any information with reference to the progress that has been made in regard to the manufacture of munitions?,9
41,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMEN T HOUSE,"We have received certain information from-the War Office regarding the manufacture of steel shrapnel shells, which has been distributed to the State Governments. We are still awaiting other information of a very secret nature from the War Office. Some in formation on this point bas been received, and is being made use of by the M u n i tions Committee. NA TURKEY.",9
42,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The honourable member for Darwin, a few days ago, asked a question regarding the treatment of prisoners in Turkey. I promised him an answer. This is furnished in the following copy of a cablegram received from the Secretary of State for the Colonies on this subject, which has been forwarded for information:The Government of Turkey has agreed to establish a Prisoners of War Information Bureau, but its proceedings appear to be slow. United States Minister has been asked to obtain, as early as possible, from the United States Minister at Constantinople, information as to the means of the prisoners in custody of the Turkish authorities. Particulars will be cabled as soon as received. NORTHERN TERRITORY. UNEMPLOYMENT-ARRIVA L OF SETTLERS FROM PATAGONIA.  appeared a report, published as coming from the Administrator of the Northern Territory, to the effect that no more people were wanted there, as work could not found for newcomers. I wish to ask the Minister of External Affairs whether that report is correct?",10
43,Mr MAHON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"It is true that a large number of men have gone lately to the Northern Territory, and that the Adus ministrator has experienced difficulty placing them in remunerative employa ment.",10
44,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Ar o they artisans?,10
45,Mr MAHON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Artisan s and labourers of all classes appear to have gone up lately, and the Administrator has desired ment. it to be notified in the southern States that there is no employment offering newthat. comers there at present.  Minister of External Affairs been drawn to the following cablegram from ton, published in the Age of Thursday last:The Japanese steamer Kwanto Maru, bound from Talcahuano to Melbourne with a cargo oats and 220 Patagoni.in emigrants who intend to settle in the vicinity of Darwin, put Auckland to-night for coal. The emigrants include Welsh, Eussian, Spanish nationals, with twelve women and eight children. The Welsh are a good stamp of settler, and some of the families have been farming for over twenty years in Argentina. Will the Minister state how these poor"" deluded people are going to make a living by farming in the Northern Territory, in view of the failures that have attended our own Government experimental farms up there?",10
46,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Order ! The honourable member is now going beyond the asking of a question.  these poor deluded people are going to make a living by farmiug in the Northern Territory?,10
47,Mr MAHON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I have read the paragraph to which the honourable member has referred. These immigrants are coming to Australia under an arrangement made by the late Government as the outcome, I think, of a visit paid to Patagonia some time ago by Mr Rees, M.L.C., of Victoria. These settlers sold off their farms preparatory to setting out for Australia .",10
48,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,I think they sent representatives to Australia. I myself saw two or three of the m e n .,10
49,Mr MAHON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Perhaps so. After the be arrangement had been made, war broke out, and the matter was suspended. Representations were made to us, however, that since these people had sold up their homes, and were in a more or less destitute condition, it would be very improper for to depart from the arrangement that in had already been made with them, and as ship was calling at Patagonia for certain freights, we provided that they should be brought out by it.",10

53,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I desire to ask the WELLINGTON, Wednesday. Prime Minister a question without notice. An interjection made by the right honof orable gentleman while the question of into the removal of the sugar duty was under discussion in this House, on 24th June, and must have been misapprehended by the fiftyHansard reporter present at the time.",10
54,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Will the honorablo member ask his question?,10
55,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"It was necessary, sir, that I should make this explanation. I wish to ask the Prime Minister-and I have already brought the matter under his notice-whethe r the interjection, "" It is on the platform,"" attributed to him in Hansard, page 4321, and which would make it appear that the question of the sugar duty is on the Labour platform, is correct ?",11
56,Mr FISHEE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I am reported in Hansard to have interjected, while the honourable member was speaking, "" Not h in g of the kind. It is on the platform."" That is incorrect. The last sentence should read, "" The Tariff is not a platform matter."" IMPERIAL WAR LOAN.",11
57,Mr SINCLAIR,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Will the Prime .Minister state whether local facilities are being offered to the Australian people who desire to help the Empire at this - critical juncture by subscribing to the war loan now being floated by the I m perial Government?,11
58,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"This Government, is prepared to help the British Government and all other Governments of the Empire in every way possible, financially and otherwise.",11
59,Mr SINCLAIR,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Judging from the reply of th© Prime Minister, he does not seem to have quite grasped what I meant. What I desire to know is whether he will make arrangements through the Commonwealth Bank, or in some - other way, so that the Australian public may be able to subscribe to the British war loan if they desire to do so?",11
60,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"If the honourable member is asking for information, I have only - to say that the prospectus sent out by the British Government was to be handed - fco the press without comment. the prospectus, we have no further in formation. Doubtless there will be f u r - ther communications, and as soon as any are received that may be given to the House, they will be given. PAPER CURRENCY.",11
61,Mr BOYD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"In view of the statement - which appeared in the Australian press yesterday, that Austria was insolvent because she had issued £300,000,000 of paper, which is equal to £ 6 per head of ""her population, and the fact that Australia has a' paper £30,000,000, which is also equal to £ 6 per head of her population, will the Prime Minister say that he subscribes to the doctrine that Australia is insolvent?",11
62,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The appearance of the honourable member and others is, in it self, sufficient to supply an answer tp his question. There is no danger, nor is there any approaching danger, in this regard. Our paper currency will expand to a considerably higher amount than that of the present issue without any danger, or appearance of danger, attaching to it . This serves to show that there is a difference between Australia and Austria, although both names begin with the same letter of the alphabet. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. QUALI TY OF BOOTS : GOVERNMENT TANNERY AND BOOT FACTORY : PENSIONS FOR NURSES : "" UNREDEEMED "" CORPS : BOOT CONTRACT.",11
63,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"the Assistant M in ister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Whether the complaint made by the council of the Queensland Chamber of Manufactures about the quality of the boots being supplied to the troops has been considered by the Department of Defence? 2. If so, will he inform the House as to the result of such inquiry?",11
64,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are-^1. \'es. 2. At the request of the Minister of Defence the boot manufacturers' section of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures appointed a committee to report on the complaints received from the committee of the Queensland Chamber of Manufactures. Three of the members of the committee were boot manufacturers, but none of them had tendered for military hoots, nor were they interested in any boot contracts with the Department. The committee examined the four pairs of boots first sent from Queensland, and two pairs Beyond taken from the stock at the Ordnance Store, and compai-ed them with the sealed pattern made by each of the contractors concerned. The committee reported, on this examination, that the six pairs of boots complained of were so much below the sealed sample in quality that they ought not to have been passed by the examining inspectors stationed at the factories in which they were made. The committee afterwards examined a number of pairs of boots taken from the bulk store at the stores which had been supplied by each of the eleven Victorian contractors at various times. The committee, after making this examination, were unanimously of opinion that the sweeping condemnation bf the Queensland Chamber of Manufactures was not justified, and that the Brisbane statements applied to currency of only a portion (and that not a large one) of the boots supplied by certain firms only. Instructions were at once given to the temporary assistant examiners stationed at the factories at which the defective boots had been made to exercise more care in their work, and to see that only boots up to the standard required should be passed in future; and the services of three of the temporary assistant examiners were dispensed with.",11
65,Mr HAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"the Assistant Minister, representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Whether a recommendation has been made by the Examiner of Stores that, in order to overcome the serious defects in the supply of boots for the Expeditionary Forces by private contractors, "" a Government tannery and boot factory should be established to work in conjunction with the Harness Factory""? 2. If so, does the Minister regard the proposal favourably?",12
66,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The answers to the honourable member's, questions axe1. The Examiner of Stores in his report suggested the establishment of a Government tannery and boot factory as a means of overcoming the difficulties which the Department has experienced in the boot supply. 2. The Minister is favourable to the proposal, but at the present juncture, owing to the pressure on the Department, and the fact that such a factory could not be established in time to be of service during the present war, it is not proposed to take any aution at the present time.  ter, upon notice Whether he will at once extend the provisions of the War Pensions Act to nurses accompanying the Expeditionary Forces, or those dependent upon tliem in the event of illness or disablement, and so place them on the same footing as our brave soldiers?",12
67,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,The question will receive consideration.,12
68,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"the Assistant Minister, representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice Whether the Minister will request the Cabinet to give consideration to the formation of a regiment or legion of ""the unredeemed,"" consisting of young men who have served, or are serving, sentences for offences other than serious crimes, so that they can be given a chance to "" make good,"" and thus earn the respect of their fellow citizens?",12
69,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The answer to the honourable member's question isI t is not considered desirable that a regiment of ""the unredeemed"" should be formed. No obstacle is placed in the way of a man enlisting as a member of the Australian Imperial Forces who has been convicted by the civil power, except for the most serious offences, who has expiated his offence and has since been of good character. On enlistment such men take their places as ordinary members of the Australian Imperial Forces, and the fact of their having been convicted would not be generally known. It is considered preferable to give such men the chance of retrieving their character in this way rather than by the formation of a corps of "" the unredeemed."" It is considered probable that few men would wish to join such a corps if they could give their services in an ordinary unit, as a corps bearing the name of "" the unredeemed "" would, no doubt, be an object of probably unwarranted suspicion, and the members thereof would, perhaps, be subject to undeserved indignitieswhich would not attach to them as ordinary members of the Australian Imperial Forces.",12
70,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"the Assistant Minister, representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Has a recommendation been made to the Minister by the proper officer in respect of the contract for supply of boots by Mr Henry Harris, boot manufacturer, of Fitzroy? 2. Does the Minister propose to give effect to the recommendation, and, if so, when?",12
71,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. No; but the Examiner of Stores has reported that it has been necessary to reject a large number of boots supplied by Mr Henry Harris, and that such action has resulted in an improvement in the quality of the boots tendered for acceptance. 2. See reply to 1. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. LETTER CARRIERS' HALF HOLIDAY: FORAGE ALLOWANCE : CHANGE OF TITL E - FUNCTIONS OF POSTAL OFFICERS APPOINTMENT OF POSTMASTERS.",12
72,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"for Mr CARR) asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that the weekly halfholiday enjoyed by the country and outer suburban letter carriers for the past twenty-five years has been abolished since his acceptance of office? 2. Will he seek to amend the Public Service Act to provide for a half-holiday if he cannot move the Public Service Commissioner to act, seeing that a weekly half-holiday is on the Labour platform?",12
73,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. No. In any case where a weekly halfholiday can be allowed a lettei carrier without interference with public business it is granted. It is not practicable in every case, as mail arrangements will not permit, but in none will a letter carrier be required to work more than forty-four hours per week. The weekly hours have been defined by the Arbitration Court, which disallowed the claim made by the letter carriers for a compulsory weekly half-holiday, recognising that the conditions under which departmental business must be carried on makes it impracticable in every case. 2.

ESTIMATES , 1914-15. - In Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed from 25th June, vide page 4447): - POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. Division 107 (Central Staff), £32,232. Mr W . ELLIOTJOHNSON (Lang) [3.57] - I desire to bring a few matters under the notioe of the Postmaster General, but I wish to preface my remarks with a general endorsement of what has been said in commendation of the service rendered by the letter carriers' branch, and I may include also the sorting branch. I think that the letter carriers have been unjustly aspersed in some quarters. My experience of them in New Sputh Wales has been that they go to great pains to render emcient service to the public, and that they have succeeded admirably in so doing. I have known many cases where they have gone to infinite trouble in the performance of their duties; indeed, to a far greater extent than would be officially expected of them. In testimony of the efficiency of the Department in the delivery of correspondence, I may mention a little episode in my own experience. At a time when I was not engaged in public life, and tlierefore not as well known as I am today, I received a letter which was sent from a foreign country, and was addressed 3imply "" W . E . Johnson, Australia, near New Zealand."" The fact that the letter readied me safely and without very much delay is a tribute to the care and trouble that the officers take in securing the proper delivery of letters, and is also an illustration of the efficiency of those engaged in the letter-carrying service. I wish to bring under the attention of the Postmaster-General the delays which sometimes take place in the delivery of telegrams in the suburbs of Sydney. On more than one occasion I have lodged telegrams between 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock in Melbourne for despatch to my home in Sydney, and they have not been delivered until the next day, though on one or two occasions my people have been rung up about midnight from the chief telegraph station in Sydney, and have been informed of the contents of the telegrams over the telephone. should be taken to secure the moreexpeditious delivery of telegrams. In connection with another matter, I haffre received the following letter from Mr D . N . Morrison, the town clerk of St. Peters, New South Wales: St. Peter's, 24th June, 1915. SIB, I am directed by my council to forward herewith copy of a communication received from the Postmaster-General's Department in connection with the removal of a telegraph post at King-street, Tempe, and to ask if you would kindly take the matter in hand, with a view to having, if not all, a considerable portion of the charge demanded by the Commonwealth Department for the removal of the pole in question, reduced. The pole is situated in a position that is_ not dangerous to the traffic, in fact in a position that it has occupied for the last two years since the road has been widened, and there has been no complaints received by this council in connection therewith, and is considered could well f be left in the present position, without placing the council to the unnecessary and, in its opinion, the unjust expenditure, part of which it is pointed out they have to pay in connection with the removal. It appears to them rather an excessive charge, and as the Department consider that they only have the right to charge a portion of the expense of the removal in this case, the question now arises as to why the council were charged the full expense in connection with the removal of the first pole? The removal of the pole in question is tl.e subject-matter of the following letter, signed by R. Nelson, electrical engineer, on behalf of the Deputy Postmaster-General, which has been forwarded to the council:Postmaster-General's Department, G.P.O., Sydney, 15th June, 1915. SIR, .It has been brought under notice that a 40-ft. pole, the property of this Department, is standing in a position dangerous to traffic in the roadway about 15 feet in front of the Pulteney Hotel, King-street, St. Peters. 2. An alteration was made in this locality some time ago which necessitated the removal of another 40-ft. pole, and the cost of the work, namely, £30 19s. 6d., was borne by your council. The fact that a second pole would also be standing in the roadway if the council proceeded with the alterations which it had in view, was represented at the time. In a communication dated 22nd October, 1913, however, your council intimated that it was the intention to remove the footpath out, so that the telephone pole would be on the alignment, and that there would, therefore, be no necessity to remove the pole. 3. It would now appear that the council has not adhered to its original intention in this matter, and has carried out the alterations, with, as already stated, the result that the pole in question is left standing in the roadway. Some steps 4. The total estimated cost of removing the pole is £48, of which, approximately, £26 representing the cost of the irrecoverable material, labonr, cartage, fares, and supervision, will be chargeableto your council. 5. As the pole is in a dangerous position, structions have been given for it to be removed witli the least possible delay. It is not easy to understand the great discrepancy which is here disclosed between the cost of removing these two telegraph poles. To my mind, the cost of removing a single pole appears to be excessive. I do not know what items go to make up the total cost of £ 4 8 for removing one telegraph pole a few yards. . Mr LAIUDSMITH - How many .wires were on the pole?",15
107,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Th same number, presumably, as were on the other pole, the removal of which cost £ 19s. 6d. But, apart from the apparently exorbitant charge, an explanation is quired of the reason why the entire cost of removing the first pole had to be borne by the council, whereas, in conthese nexion with the removal of the second pole, only the cost of the irrecoverone, able material, labour, cartage, & c , is to be debited to Ehe council. other Surely the practice in this respect should be a uniform one, and if the portion of the charge borne by the council in the second instance is represented the cost of the irrecoverable material, labour, cartage, & c , it sbould bave charged only that proportion in the first instance, and a proportionate refund should be made council. I would suggest to the Postsuflicient master-General that the regulations remade garding the apportionment of 'post connection with the removal of poles municipal areas-removal s which are sometimes necessitated by alterations road alignments-sboul d be revised, a view to the more equitable distribution with these matters. of that cost, and to preventing municipalities being called upon to bear the whole or an excessive part of it . I hope the honourable gentleto man will give m y suggestion favourable consideration. Another matter to which. I desire to direct attention has reference to the delay which is sometimes experiOffice enced in the erection of public telephones, after the necessary authority for erection has been forthcoming. back as February last I received an in timation front the Department that proval had been given to a proposal install a public telephone at the Terminus Store, in Stony Creek-road, West Bexley. Yet, on the 22nd June, I received f in Mr A . W . Wood, the proprietor of the store, the following communication:DEAR SIR, The residents of West Bexley were, indeed, very pleased to hear that a public telephone had been granted them. Your letter notifying me of the above has been in a prominent position in my window since I received it-5t h February, 1915. The patience of the residents is well nigh exhausted, and they have asked me to write you and see if you can expedite matters for us. Of course, I recognise that some little delay must be experienced before these e public conveniences can be provided. But, in m y judgment, the period which 3 0 has elapsed since approval was given to this particular work is excessive. I ask retlie Postmaster-General whether he cannot devise some means of securing greater expedition in providing the public with necessary facilities, especially in places where the population is a growing and where frequent telephonic communication is necessary for business and purposes. A good, deal of the delay is probably due to the fact that there is not prosufficient material on hand to carry out all the works for which approval has been by given. I have often held the view that many of the complaints which we make been here, on behalf of our constituents and the general public, arise, not from slackness or neglect on the part of the officials to the of the Department, but from the fact that financial provision has not been for supplies of materials in anticii n pation of necessary extension and exi n pansion of facilities which we look to the Department to provide. I doubt in whether any blame attaches to the offiwith cers of the Department in connection It should attach, rather, to the members of the Government, who have not seen that sufficient sums have been placed on the Estimates enable the Department to lay in a stock of materials in advance of requirements. I have often complained in this House, in the past, of a tendency to starve the Post vote; and the congestion of work in the Department, which is the source their of so many complaints at the present As f ar time is, no doubt, due to the cutting down - of earlier estimates for supplies. There was apa time when the Post and Telegraph Deto partment was considered to be comparatively unimportant, and when it was believed that the Minister cliarged with ita r o m administration enjoyed a sinecure, bu* that time has gone by long since, and the Department is now one of very great magnitude. The Postmaster-General and his chief officials should see to it that adequate amounts are included in the departmental estimates to meet all the requirements of the ensuing twelve months, and to cover the extension and expansion of all branches of the Department. In connection with another matter, I wish to direct attention now to what, in ray opinion, is a very serious matter in deed. I am not sure that the remedy lies solely within the province of the Postmaster-General. I think that, perhaps, it may be a matter for consultation between him and the Minister of Defence. Some time ago, my attention was drawn to a letter sent by a German now in Germany, who was formerly a resident of Australia. The peculiarity of the communication is that, while it is dated from Mainz, Germany, it does not bear anywhere on the envelope a German postmark, or any external evidence of its German origin. It was evidently sent under cover to some one in the business firm of "" Jones-Rausch Company, Manufacturers and Importers of Turpentine arid Resin, New Orleans, La., United States of America,"" for transmission to Australia, in order that the origin of the communication might not be. known. The envelope bears the New Orleans postmark of . 15th May, and the Melbourne postmark of 28th June. The evident intention of the writer of this letter is to undermine the loyalty of our people, to create a spurious sympathy for Germans, and a detestation of the British . I shall leave out the name of the person to whom the letter is addressed, and, after making one or two quotations from it , I shall be prepared to hand it , with the covering envelope, to the Postmaster-General, in order that he may go into the matter more f u l ly at his leisure. The letter is dated "" M a in z, 24th A p r i l , 1915,"" and beginsOne enclosure. Enclosed I beg to hand you report No. 12. This is evidently the twelfth communication of a series of this kind which has been sent, and I presume that several similar communications have been sent to other people. As a matter of fact', another friend of mine in Sydney received a letter probably from the same source, because it came in the same firm's envelope, "" JonesRausch Company,"" and bore the New OrM>. W. Elliot Johnson. leans postmark, and was without any German postmark at all. I sent one of these communications to the Minister of Defence some time ago, but it appears that these letters are still coming in , and, so far as I can see, no attempt is being made to prevent their admission or delivery, or to censor them in any way. The writer of this letter saysI also beg to mention several items which .1I have read in the papers, "" An American about England."" From the private letter of a prominent American citizen, one of the leading men of science, we glean the following lines : - I belong to one of the oldest families in the States. My ancestors belonged to those Puritans which went over in the Mayflower, the pioneer ship. My great grandfathers fought against the British for their independence in 1776, my grandfathers fought against them on account of their malice and perfidity in 1812, and also father fought against their machinations and deceitful treachery in our Civil War in 1361-65. With all the Saxon blood in my veins, I have never forgot that England has been the treacherous, malicious foe of the United States, as long as they exist. We have our personal individual friendships, you, as well as I , Germans, French, Austrians, Russians, belong to my warmest friends, but I seek in vain amongst the English for a single friendship, which would be more than a polite esteem, and so I feel very strongly, that England is immoral in the eyes of the entire world, and that she deserves to be censured before the wliole world and must be awakened out of her lethargy. She continues still to spread her lies about the war, over the English speaking world, and deserves for this action a very strong censure. That is a deliberate falsehood so far as I know, as nothing of the sort has been done. It is further necessary to speak to England plainly of the wrong which she is doing by obliging her innocent and fair-thinking colonies, like Canada, to fetch for her the chestnuts nut of the fire. And her actual attitude against us, a neutral country, is in the highest degree exciting, especially as compared with the attitude of Germany. Three months agothe letter is written on the 5th March-Eng land might have won the favour of a great portion of our people by a clever diplomacy, but now she. has lost what she might have won. . . . Every well-educated person knows to-daj' that Germany leads in the world as regards culture, that she is in the vanguard nf civilization, ancl that in every respect. . . . I have read in the paper the following remark :The American 'Consul Thompson. The retreat of the American Consul Thompson from liis office-Ai x la Chapelle-ha s caused a great deal of surprise in the United States. This Consul has given up liis situation as a protest against the position taken by his superior Secretary of State Bryan ancl the funny part played by the United ""States in the neutrality question. Mr Thompson is shocked about the lies which have been spread in the United States since the beginning of the war. Mr Thompson has the intention to direct an open letter to Mr Bryan in which he will show that Germany has not been treated justly by the Americans. He will dedicate himself to the defence of Germany against the detestable calumnies of the entente. It must be mentioned that Mr Thompson's wife is of English birth, and that his brother-in-law is in the English Army. He was several years in England, and is a thorough judge and connoisseur of German and English matters. When the war is over, it will be found that England or her Statesmen and a great deal of the English nation has played a very nasty part. When the war is over the Right Honourable Sir Grey""Eor Brutus is an honourable man, "" So are they all, all honourable men. will be able to say, like the kins? in Hamlet: 0 my offence is rank, it smells to Heaven, and the entire chorus of honourable men, that brought about this war, to serve their own selfish ends, may say like Hamlet"" Foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o'erwhelm them to men's eyes."" Mark my words. . . . When the war is over, we will speak more of it . If the English are too stupid to compete with the Germans in the works of peace, they will spoil tliem by destruction of their factories. But the English pirates will catch it this time. 1I have read in the Frankfort Gazette an article of a Professor Dr Otto Maas (Munich). He had been in Australia at the outbreak of the war; there was, I think, a Congress there at the time of men of science, and the German members received later on the permission to leave the country, at least those that were beyond the military age. He says that Australian papers printed the following nonsense :"" Thnt the Russian Kossacks had reached Johannisberg, a town world-famed for its wine, near Wiesbaden, and they spoke of the keen raid of the Kossacks. But Johannisburg in eastern Prussia and Johannisberg half-an-hour from Mayence are two pairs of boots. This shows the utter ignorance of Australian newspiiper scriblers. Further, tliey said in the paper, that in the Garibaldian legion there were s t ill many of the 'original Garibaldian legion, i.e., of the followers of the famous Garibaldi. But it appears that the stupid Australian scriblers do not Know that Garibaldi made his famous raids in Italy about 60 years ago, so that the men who took part, in them must be now about 80-78 years old at least, supposing the youngest had been 16-20 years old at the time. As far as I know, there are still a few of these men alive, but history and geography are not the particular strength of the Australian scriblers. Of football they know more. Mr Maas says, also, tlmt the conduct of the Australians against the Germans has not been n very correct one. The German Club in Melbourne, he says, has been stormed by the populace. I have read some descriptions about it in German papers-ou t of letters that have been brought out. I must say Australia has forfeited every consideration of a civilized country. However, when the war is over, it will be found that the English statesmen and the English nation has heaped for ever on them the name of liars ancl swindlers and pirates. Mark my word. Truth will bring it out. May be that England and the other countries will try to continue her lying practices, but I dare say that the German Government will find means how to force them to avow the truth , that they have behaved like mean contemptible liars. I have not quoted it all, but that is the kind of stuff that runs all through this communication, and it comes here apparently without any attempt being made to interfere with its free delivery to Australian citizens. An y one can see that the underlying object of the letter is, by means of gross fabrications and misrepresentations of fact, to undermine the loyalty of our people, and create a spurious sympathy with Germany. I propose to hand the letter to the Postmaster General, so that he may look more full y into the matter of allowing, uncensored, delivery of letters having the same firm's name on the envelope.",17
108,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Barrier) [4.27] - I do not propose to spend most of the time - it my disposal in criticising the Postal Department, although I do not regard it a« perfect, because, of course, no Department .controlled by man is perfect; but, while a good deal has been said in criticism of it , it is only fair to show the other side of the picture a l it t l e . I am glad that the Committee is able to discuss the Estimates of the Department with the financial report before it . This has been so for the last two or three years, but durin g the eight or ten years that the Liberal party were in office they apparently took no steps to see exactly how the Post Offico was being run. We could not tell whether the telegraphic branch, or the telephone branch, or the postal branch was paying, and it remained for a Labour Government to alter that state of affairs.",19
109,Sir JOHN EOEREST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,And I suppose you are the man.,19
110,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I did not say who the man was. I said I was glad that a Labour Government made an alteration. They appointed Mr Triggs and Mr Haldane, who, by the way, came from Western Australia, and to whom a good deal of credit is due for the way in which they placed the financial position of the whole Department before Parliament. Mr. Triggs has since left to take up in New Zealand an even better ap-. pointment than he had here. I believe it took tliose gentlemen about three years to do the work for which they were engaged- a fact which shows the chaotic state of the Department in regard to finance at the time. I am specially pleased to see that the postal branch is paying, even though we have established penny postage. A profit of over £24,000 was made last year in this branch, and I hold that if the Department had nothing more to its credit, it speaks volumes for it that in a continent such as this we can carry on penny postage at a profit.",19
111,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"We brought it in , and you all voted against it .",20
112,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"That is not so. I was always an advocate of it . I do not know of any other country which under similar circumstances is giving the same facilities as we are. America, including Alaska, is a little larger than Australia, but it has a population of 100,000,000. Canada is somewhere about the same size as Australia, but has 50 per cent, more population than the Commonwealth. In neither of those countries are the same postal facilities given as in this country. I understand that, in Canada, before there is a letter delivery in a town the population must be 10,000, and the revenue from the Post Offi.ce £2,000. In America, I believe it is necessary for atown to have 5,000 people, and a revenue of £1,000 before a letter delivery is provided. Some years ago the conditions in America were the same as in Canadaa population of 10,000, and a revenue of £2,000-bu t I remember reading a few years back tEat the authorities brought the requirements down to 5,000 of a population, and a revenue of £1,000, and they spoke of it as a wonderful reform. Supposing we had exactly the same regulations in Australia as in Canada, we could do away with a whole army of letter carriers, and the sorters would be able to do their work under very difierent conditions, because they would not have anything like their present quantity of night work. I am not advocating that we should not make the early deliveries, but I am only pointing out that, in Canada, which has 50 per cent, more people than Australia, the same facilities are not provided. It is very satisfactory to know that the Post Office is making a profit, and providing better facilities than are provided elsewhere. If we were to run our Post Office Department as is done in England and other countries, our permanent buildings would b© provided out of loans, and not out of revenue.",20
113,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Why not?,20
114,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"If we did, our profit would be greater than at present;; but I am not advocating that policy.",20
115,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,We could give more facilities.,20
116,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The profit, of course, would be greater. Another matter which I consider is rather unfair to the Post Office is the subsidy of £170,000 a year now paid to the Orient Company. I am not saying for one moment that the amount is too great, but I contend that it is unfair that the Post Office should be charged with the whole of it .",20
117,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,What Department should be charged ?,20
118,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I should say the Department of Trade and Customs, and I think the Minister, when he asked the question, knew the answer he would get, i because this is a view I have advocated previously. Our arrangement with the Orient Steamship Company is not one merely for letter carrying. It is also one for Trade and Customs work, and I think that, say, half the amount-£85,000 should be chargea to the Department of Trade and Customs. That would be a fair allocation, and be fairer to the Postal Department than the present arrangement. Coming now to the vexed question of telephones, I notice that last year the loss on this account was £296,424. Here, again/ I want to make a comparison with Canada and America. In both those countries, the telephones and telegraphs are in the hands of private enterprise, so that if our Po&t Office system were on the same lines there would be a profit instead of a loss on the system, because private enterprise would be carrying on the business of telephones and telegraphs.  nearly all in the city, is it not?",20
119,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Nearl y all. I desire fco point out that the loss on the telephones would be converted into a profit if we were to levy the same charges as in England, which, perhaps, affords the best comparison, because in the Mother Count r y the telephone system is a Government, monopoly. In England the charge is £ 5 ground rent, and I d . for each ring. Assuming, therefore, that we had the same number of telephones as under the present system, and charged £ 5 ground rent, and I d . for each ring, there would be a profi t of over £100,000.",20
120,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,What did you Canadian charges were?,21
121,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I do not know; but I am dealing with England, which affords the best basis for comparison. I know that, in some parts of America, a payment of £ 1 3 is required as a ground rent.",21
122,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,How does the charge in England compare with ours ?,21
123,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I am about to tell the Committee. In England the charge is £ 5 ground rent, and I d . for each ring, whereas in Australia the charge for ground rent is £ 4 , £ 3 10s., or £ 3 , according to circumstances, and £d. for each ring. Our revenue from ground rent was £473,704, and from tolls £285,997. We have about 120,000 telephones, so if we - kidded £ 1 to the ground rent, that would bring the revenue on that account up to £593,704, and with a I d . charge for calls the revenue from that source would be doubled. If we were to charge a ground rent of £ 5 , or £ 4 10s., or £ 4 , as the case might be, and a penny a call instead of a halfpenny, we might not have the same number of rings. But suppose that the telephone was used exactly as it is used today, and the English charge was adopted here, we would have a profit of £109,373 a year instead of the loss which we sustain. It should be remembered that there is a difference in the wages paid to employees in the two countries. I do not think that we pay too much: I do not advocate for a moment that we should pay any less; but certainly our .wages are considerably liigher than are paid in England for exactly the same kind of work. Besides, a plant is obviously cheaper in England than it is here, because most of the plant we use has naturally to be imported. Even if our plant were made in the Commonwealth, the cost of a plant would still be a little cheaper in England than here. Therefore, our plant is more expensive, our wages are higher, and our charges are less than those levied in England. I am not very keen on urging that the Postmaster-General should charge more for the service: but I am pointing out that there are those who complain about the Government service and control, and at the same time refer to the loss upon our operations. We simply reply that we are not charging even so much as is charged in other countries where the wages and the cost of the plant are not so say the high. Whilst I think I was righ t in bringing in the toll telephone, and doing it in the way in which it was done-and it did not prove to be such a f r i g h t full y disastrous thing to the communityas was predicted-ther e was one thing in which I believe I did make a mistake, and that was in granting the concession that when there were over 2,000 rings the charge should be a third of a penny a call instead of a halfpenny. I confess that were I the Minister now I would not hesitate for a moment in doing away with that concession, and providing that for all rings, irrespective of whether the number was 2,000 or 3,000, the charge per call should be one-halfpenny; because most of the rings over 2,000 are connected with big warehouses and large business firms, and are worth infinitely more than a halfpennj* each to the person who rings up. Besides, I believe it would do the public themselves a certain amount of good to make the change, because there are in Australia business men who, I am afraid, have not yet begun to understand the full value of the telephone to them.",21
124,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Tak e it away from them for a while.,21
125,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I admit that if the telephone were taken away for a day or two there would be a great outcry. When I introduced the toll telephone a prominent business man in a large capital had his telephone disconnected, and stated at a public meeting that he had taken that step in order to bring me to my senses ; but three days afterwards hewent round to the Deputy Postmaster-General and begged that his telephone might be put back. He went on strike for three days, and that was quite sufficient to convince him that he had made a mistake. There is a number of business men who endeavour to save a little by crowding the rings on some of their lines in order to increase the number on a particular line over the 2,000 calls, so that they can have the calls at a third of a penny each. If the Postmaster-General were to do away with that arrangement, and make a charge of a halfpenny for every ring, there would be no particular interest in crowding a line, and I believe that some business men would put on other telephones, and instead of having two or three they would have four or five, because the added cost to them would be only the ground rent of £ 4 . That is an idea which I give to the Postmaster General gratis, and, if he likes to do something in that direction, I shall be pleased. I notice, in conuexion with our telephone system, that the loss in Victoria is £60,384. I did read in a leading metropolitan paper here that in Victoria there was no loss, but t l i at . in Sydney there was a loss. There is a loss even in Melbourne. If the figures are examined, it will be seen that the working expenses of the Melbourne service are met by the revenue, but other expenses have also to be met, such as the interest on the buildings, the interest on the plant, and so on. In Victoria, the annual loss is £60,384, but in New South Wales the loss is £171,000.  incurred in Sydney?",21
126,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Most of it . It was mentioned in a newspaper some time ago that the Postmaster-General was to receive a report-h e is "" g r e at "" on getting reports-as to why the loss is more in Sydney than in Melbourne. I do not know whether he has received the report yet, but, if it has been received, I think it would be rather interesting to the Committee to know why it is that so much more loss is made"" in Sydney than in Melbourne.",22
127,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"In Sydney there are twenty-nine exchanges and 35,000 subscribers, and the cost of putting up and running is altogether different from the cost here.",22
128,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"It would be very interesting to see the report. Of course it may be that the present charges are too low for the cities, especially Melbourne and Sydney. Clearly, the more telephones there are, the larger will be the loss, because there is a certain loss on each line. The telephone service does not stand in the same position as most businesses. Ordinarily, the more customers a man has, the less becomes the expense of running his business, but that is not the case with telephoning, and, unless an adequate charge is made, the more subscribers there are connected the greater will be the loss on the service. Will the Postmaster General say whether he has received the report I referred to just now?",22
129,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Lon g ago. There are reasons for the disparity, which I will explain by-and-by.",22
130,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I think it would be very satisfactory if the report were laid on the table, so that we might, see for ourselves why the cost is greater in Sydney than in Melbourne.",22
131,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I proposd to give that information, and a lot of otlier information, when we have the new charges.",22
132,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Ver y well. I know there are some business men who say that they are prepared to pay anything so long as they are provided with a good service. Their main idea is to get a good service. They declare that in England and other countries a good service is provided, but I venture to say that there is no better service in England than in Australia. In London they have two services; I understand that there is a national service, which used to be in private hands, and. the new service, one which has been started de novo by the Government. When a subscriber was on a portion of the latter service, it was all right, but immediately he got in contact with the other service, trouble began, just the same as occurs here, where we have the metallic circuit and the old earth return. Immediately we are on the metallic circuit, we are all right, but when we get in touch with the other system, a little trouble begins, bufc that, I believe, is being obviated rapidly. I venture to say that in England they have no service which is more up to dato than our automatic service. I speak with some experience of the automatic service at Brighton. Whilst it does go out of order now and again, especially after a storm, because most of the wires are in the air, generally speaking it is satisfactory. Altogether the service in Australia compares favourably with the service in England, and it is supplied at a cheaper rate here.",22
133,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,How do you account for the service in New South Wales being so much inferior to the service in V i c to r i a ',22
134,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"-I do not think that the service is as good there as here. Some years ago the service in Victoria was so f r i g h t full y rotten that the Governinent, when they took it over, did not try to patch it up, but started gradually to build a new exchange, and a very fine exchange they - have today. Consequently, although the Melbourne telephone service was for years worse than the Sydney telephone system, it is now better than it . In Melbourne the Department started de novo, but in Sydney it tried to patch up the original exchange, which is too crowded in the accommodation provided at the General Post Office, from which i should have been removed years ago. The telegraph service, like the®telephone serto vice^ is not paying. One reason for that is obvious: the cliarges are too low. I know of no country in which wages are anything like so high as they are in Ausever, tralia where telegrams can be sent across a continent at the rate of ls. for sixteen words. The telegraph rates of the United States of America and of Canada are much liigher than ours.",22
135,Mr CARR,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"On e has to pay 2s. for sixteen words to get a telegraph message through in reasonable time.  "" urgent "" wires.",23
136,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"My experience is that the ordinary rates are suflicient, though many persons pay urgent rates to get precedence. It may be that we have not enough lines, but our rates are certainly lower than those of any other country. Many persons in this community, and some members of the Committee, contend that private enterprise would perform all these services more cheaply and in better manner than they are performed by the Government. At one time the Pacific Cable connected with a land lino across Canada which was privately owned, as well as with a privately-owned cable across the Pacific; but the blunders made on the privately-owned land line prevented the cable from being as successful as i should have been, there being ten mistakes on that land line to every mistake on the Government-owned land lines of Australia. The .mistakes on the Canadian privatelysays owned land line were so many that at last the Pacific Cable Board succeeded in obmendation taining control of the line. I hope that the Postmaster-General is doing some of thing to bring about the nationalization of the Atlantic Cable.",23
137,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Why did not the honour the able member, when Postmaster-General, try to have that cable made a StateThe owned concern I",23
138,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The honourable memin ber for Wimmera at one time never made a speech, no matter what the subject, here without introducing the Atlantic Cable, but when his party was in office, and the fate of his Government depended on his der vote, he had nothing to say about it . I hope that he will do what he can now to bring about the nationalization Atlantic. Cable. Were the cables of the t world nationalized, we should have fuller information regarding what is happening our boys at the front , though I admit that it would be very difiicult to bring Ubout the general nationalization of cable lines at the present time. I hope, howthat the Postmaster-General will do all that he can to induce the British Government to consent to the nationalize tion of an Atlantic cable, so that messages may be sent between Australia and England over lines that are entirely Government owned.",23
139,Mr ARCHIBALD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Does the honourable meinber think that the British Government will take the matter up wliile the war is on ?,23
140,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I think that this is the time to take the matter up, although I am unable to deal with the subject at any length just now. In England people are writing as they never did before in advocacy of this proposal. The British Government must now depend entirely upon private cable companies for the sending of messages between Great Britain and a America and Australia, but I believe that, were the Postmaster-General to stir himself, something could be done for the nationalization of an Atlantic cable. We have been told that the United States is the home of private enterprise; that it flourishes there and does wonders, There the telegraphs and telephones are t entirely in private hands; they are not, as here, under the control of the Government. Y e t this is what the Postmaster General of the United States of America in his report for 1914The Postmaster-General renews the recomembodied in his last annual report that Congress seriously consider the question declaring a Governinent monopoly over all utilities' for the transmission of intelligence, and that steps be taken as soon as practicable to incorporate into the postal establishment telegraph and telephone systems of the country. recommendation was made in 1913, and emphasized in the report for 1914, which this statement also occursThe firm conviction of the Department is reiterated that telegraph and telephone service is inevitably monopolistic, and, when operated' under private control, does not renthe maximum of public service at the minimum cost to the whole people.",23
141,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The honourable of the member's time has expired.  not altogether agree with the remarks of so? the honourable member for Barrier, who says that he believes in penny postage, cause the greater the number of letters the better the postal service must pay, and yet in the same breath contends that the telephone service will not pay unless the telephone rates are increased.

A great deal has been partment. said about the loss incurred by the services which are under the control of the year. Postmaster-General, but, so long as there is no waste, and the public gets value for the money that it pays, I think that no exception need be taken to that loss. The Post Office is really an advertising medium; the Department is not a revenue producing one.",23

There may be a loss of £500,000 a year - on the working of the Department, but - there are compensating gains which shadow it . Australia is a vast continent, and the policy of every Government should be to increase settlement i back country. Those who live in cities cannot realise the comfort given by teleelated phone communication to those who live from in remote districts. I have often, on arrival of a country mail, noticed the Crowley's - eagerness with which letters are seized and read.

143,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I say that the firms send out catalogues by way of advertising their wares should pay the cost of their transport.  these catalogues country people are ensaid couraged to trade with the people in - cities, to the benefit of all classes. newspaper postage, it is not the proof prietors of the newspapers who pay it .",24

To do this, we must give all the conveniences we can furnish to the people in the f the country. For that reason we should not is be over-critical regarding the annual loss by the Postmaster-General's De",24
145,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"But it is increasing every  the country. The graduated land tax produces something like £1,500,000 a year, most of the money coming from taxpayers living in the country, and it provides more than the loss on the working of the Postmaster-General's Department. I hope that the Postmaster-General will not act the advice of the honourable member for certainly I trust that he will not increase country telephone rates. The country telephone services are paying, and any loss that is being incurred is incurred in connection with the working of the big city exchanges. I was very pleased to reThe Postceive the information from the Postmaster-General's Department that"" a sum of £60,000 had been set aside to give relief to needy mail contractors, but I am sorry that the granting of relief is so overslow. On the 20th May a motion was moved in the House affirming that relief should be given, but only a few days ago n its I received the following letterSm,-Wit h reference to the communication the 29th April last, presented to you Mr J. A. Atkinson, mail contractor, Trundle, requesting that his subsidy for the the conveyance of mails between Trundle and be increased, I have to intimate that the matter has received consideration, but as contracts are let both in good and bad years, provision doubtless being made by tenderers the prices submitted to meet the vicissitudes the weather, and as increased payment would unfair to other tenderers for the service, the request cannot, it is regretted, be acceded to. who I shall be glad if the Postmaster-General will make a note of this matter, and see that these applications are dealt with speedily. A few days ago, I received a of note from a mail contractor in which he that chaff was practically unprocurthe able. As the New South Wales GovernAs to ment has practically commandeered most the chaff, and fixed the price for it , the Postmaster-General might endeavour bo come to an arrangement with the Government of New South Wales, whereby the mail contractors could be provided with the fodder necessary to fulfil tlieir tracts at the price fixed by the State Government. There is another matter which, I think, must have been overlooked. recollect that, during the term of office of the Cook Government, Mx. Wynne announced that he was introducing a system by which produce could be carried fro m the country districts to the metropolitan area. He stated that the system was being introduced in Victoria, and if it proved a success, it would be extended to New South Wales, and subsequently to the other States. This system would work for the benefit of the people in the city as well as those in the country. It has operated with success in Germany, and I believe satisfactory results have attended its introduction in America. By means of this system country producers would be able to send butter, eggs, ham, bacon, cheese, f r u it and vegetables, up' to a weight of about 40 lbs., to the nearest railway station, the railways would deliver the goods to the metropolitan area, and there the Government would distribute them to the addressees. I h this way the country people would come into direct contact with the consumer in the city, and the middleman's profits would be saved. The consumers would receive their commodities cheaper, and in a fresher condition, and in every way the system would be an advantage to every member of the community. Another idea of the late Postmaster-General was that, instead of having six Deputies, Australia should be divided into a number of zones, numbering probably nineteen or twenty, and that for each there should be a Deputy. At the present time, the administration of the Postal Department is too centralized, and I believe that if each State were divided into a number of zones, according to its area and population, the people would have speedier access to the Deputies, and greater efficiency would result. pleased to know that the present Postmaster-General has given wider powers to the inspectors, thus obviating a great deal of extravagance and reducing expenditure. I remember being told that a letter-box in a country town had been shghtly damaged, but before the box could be repaired the postmaster had to communicate with the Deputy Postmaster General, and after a delay of a few weeks a labourer was sent from Sydney to effect repairs. The cost to the Department was about £ 2 , whereas the damage could have conbeen made good by local labour at the modest cost of 6d. If the Postmaster General will continue along the lines he is I how following he will effect a big saving in his Department.",24
146,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Barrier) [5.11] - I desire to thank honourable members for permitting me to continue ray remarks at this stage in order that I may finish the quotations which I had begun earlier in the debate. It is with greafc pleasure thab I read the extracts fro m the American reiport, because America is looked upon as the great home of private enterprise, and there is a good deal of talk in Australia about handing our telephone and telegraph systems over to the control of business managers. In America they have had experience of business managers, because there the systems are controlled by private enterprise, and the result is a recommendation from the Postmaster General that these systems be taken away from private control and handed over to the State. Continuing the report from , which I quoted earlier, the Postmaster General of the United States of America saysI t is an interesting fact that, whereas policies of government have been advocated, and some adopted, the constitutionality of which have been seriously questioned, the principle of Government ownership and control of the telegraph and telephone finds its greatest strength in the Constitution. This opinion has been shared by practically all Postmasters General of the United States, who have held that the welfare and happiness of the nation depend upon the fullest utilization of these agencies by the people, which can only bo accomplished through Government ownership. It is therefore recommended that early action be taken by Congress looking to the accomplishment of this end. It is also recommended that the telegraph and telephone facilities of Alaska, Porto Rico, and the Hawaiian Islands be at once taken over and operated by the Post-office Department. ThiB recommendation is based on an exhaustive investigation which disclosed that I am the conditions in these Territories are generally such as to favour the change. A large part of the property involved is already Government owned and"" operated in Alaska by the War Department, and in Porto Rico by trie Insular Government. The services are so detached geographically as to preclude complicated relationships with neighbouring systems, and are yet sufficient in extent to afford valuable experimental demonstration for the Postal Service looking to the administration eventually of a complete national service. This action will have the effect of strengthening the Nutional Government in its outlying Territories, and is especially recommended because of the expediency of taking over the private ownerships before elaborate and costly extensions and duplications of service have been built up. The Secretary of War has suggested the transfer of the control of cable and telegraph service in Alaska to the Post-office Department. Anticipating favourable action by Congress, an item of $300,000 has been inserted in the Department's Estimates for the ensuing fiscal year, to cover the expense involved in operating this and the insular services during the first year after their acquisition, tive draft of a Bill for effecting the transfer of ownership and authority is included in the report on page 64. T.do not think that Government ownership is perfect, but apparently it compares very favourably with private enterprise. We have heard a great deal of complaint about the mismanagement of the Postal Department, and in this connection it is interesting to read the reports of the Royal Commission on Postal Services. We know that that Commission was not liurried in its investigations- I think the inquiry lasted two years-and a great deal of useful and valuable work was done. . The officials in the service were asked io bring their complaints before the Commission, and I do not think they hesitated to do so. When the time comes that there are no complaints from those in the service, the millennium will indeed have arrived. Some of the complaints made must have been justified, because the grievances have since ""been rectified. The Commission was appointed to deal, not only with officials, but also with the public. Evidence was received in Victoria from the Chamber of Commerce, the representative of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and certain shipwrights formerly employed by the Department. What were the complaints of the public against the Department as disclosed by those witnesses?1. There is an absence of business methods in the Department. That is a general statement. 2. Errors occur in the sorting and delivery of letters which display carelessness and lack of discipline. That condition of affairs is not what it should be, but, liaving regard to the millions of letters that are sorted and delivered, we may well marvel that more errors do not occur. 3. There are instances of non-delivery and delay in delivery of telegrams. I can quite understand that. Mr TJiomas. 4. The Melbourne telephone service is most unsatisfactory. 5. The Department employs untrained fitters at less than standard rates. 6. Pole-dressing is executed by non-tradesmen. Those represent the whole of the grievances of the general public of Victoria against the working of the Department in this State. In South Australia the complaints were1. More business-like management and deand a tenta- centralization are necessary. I believe that the Postmaster-General has endeavoured to decentralize some of the work. 2. Postage rates and stamps are not uniform. Penny postage and a Commonwealth stamp should be introduced. We eifected that change as soon as the finances would permit. 3. Delays occur in delivery of telegrams. 4. Receipts for telegrams should be introduced. 5. In telegrams a lower rate should be charged for words in excess of first sixteen. 6. Department should not retain private telegrams of advice in connection with telegraphic money orders. Department should advise payee. 7. Telephone service, Port Adelaide, is most unsatisfactory. 8. Telephone service between Adelaide and Port Adelaide is very bad. 9. Gawler Post-office accommodation is inadequate. 10. The office arrangements at Kapunda are defective. 11. Post-offices at Mount Gambier and Kapunda are undermanned. 12. Delays have occurred in furnishing private letter boxes at Kapunda. 13. A telephone trunk line is required between Kapunda and Adelaide. 14. Telephone trunk line charges are too high. 15. Charges for extension of country telephone subscribers' lines are excessive. These are some of the complaints that were brought before the Postal Commission by the general public-no t by the officers; their complaints, I admit, were numerous. The Telephone Department was said to be unsatisfactory. I can quite understand that. But the Postal Branch of the Department was reported upon differently, and to me it was marvellous that the general public had so very little to complain of when the opportunity was given them to bring their complaints before a Commission. I do not say that there are no complaints, and I am ready to admit that probably the country has more to complain of than the city, for I believe that there is a difficulty in supplying the country with the necessary postal services. I am prepared also to say that in most places there is an absence of business method in the Department, and I can quite understand that business men would not apply the same system to their own businesses as is sometimes applied in the Post Office. Whilst I claim that, in the main, Government control is better than private enterprise, I am prepared to admit that in some ways private enterprise is better. One instance of this rather impressed me while I was connected with the Post Oflice. I asked Mr . Peacock, who is, I understand, a business systematizer, and a very able business man, to go through the Central Administration and see where he could suggest improvement.",25
147,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,On the line of the present inquiry by. Mr Anderson?,27
148,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I think it was. A f he had finished, it was my intention to send him to the General Post Office, but before that time arrived I went to the Department of Affairs, and my successor, Mr Frazer, did not think the inquiry I had suggested was necessary. But a fundamental difference was pointed out to me   cock said he did not know how we were going to get over it . In a private business concern, 'if a person in charge of a department with four or five clerks under him can point out to his superior, or to the owner of the business, that under a new system the department could be worked with, say, four instead of five clerks, the business man would look into the proposition, and, if satisfied, would either dismiss the fifth clerk, or appoint him to some other department, whilst the man responsible for the suggestion would probably receive an increase of wages because the department was being worked more cheaply than before. In a Government Department, however, the position is quite different. If a person in charge of a Government Department with four clerks under him can increase the work so as to get five clerks instead of four, then his salary goes up, because he has five men under him instead of four. I am prepared to admit that there is a f u n damental difference between the two systems, and I should be glad if something could be done in our Public Service to see that men are paid, not as a result of the number of letters that are written, but because they can reduce the necessity for writing so many. At the time. I was Postmaster-General we had a conference of Deputy Postmasters-General in Tasmania.",27
149,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Do you not think that one should be held every year ?,27
150,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I think it would be a very good institution. It was my idea, and if I had remained at the Post Office, the conferences would have been continued. However, just before that Tasmanian conference was held, I received a letter from the late Sir Henniker Heaton, sending me copies of sixty-five recommendations that he had submitted to the Postmaster-General in England, thinking that if they were adopted they would i m prove the English postal service. .Some of these suggestions could not possibly t e r have been introduced here, because they had to deal with telegraphic and telephonic rates between England and the Continent; but a number were applicable External to Australia, and I was glad to discover that all but one had been already adopted. I rather favoured this'one suggestion ; but in discussing the matter with the Deputy Postmasters-General, I saw that I was wrong, and did not press it , because they convinced me that it would not be quite satisfactory. The incident, however, does not speak badly for our Postal Department. I do not think the Department is perfect. There is probably a great lack of initiation, and very few new ideas seem to come forward.",27
151,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Are they not discouraged by the Department?,27
152,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"That is a point I wish to-come to. A r e they discouraged or not? The men say they are. The oflieers say they are not. If they are not discouraged, then it does not say much for a Department employing so many thousand men that they do not suggest some possible improvements. One would almost be inclined to believe that the encouragement desired is lacking. I am bound 'to admit that on one occasion I had a rather peculiar experience, which perhaps reflected slightly on two oflieers of whom I thought very highly, and which, perhaps, rather tended to support, to some extent, what the men say. One of the men had an improvement, which he brought to me and asked if I would look into it . I said, "" If you send it through in the ordinary way, it shall be inquired in to . "" He said, "" I am afraid I shall never hear anything more about it if I dot"" I told him I would guarantee that he would hear of it again. gested that he should send it along, adding that if after two or three months he did not hear anything he should let me know. Nothing was heard of the matter, and when 1 inquired why, I was told by Sir Robert Scott, who was a very valuable officer in the Department, that he had received it , that it had been turned down in the Sydney Post Office; but that he had sent it on to Melbourne, in order to make sure that it received fair consideration. He promised to make inquiries. Subsequently the matter came before me officially, and I discovered that it had been turned down all along the line. I remarked that it seemed very strange; and when I was explaining to Sir Robert Scott what it was, he said that suggestion had been adopted in Brisbane for a number of years, and that it had been introduced there by Sir Robert himself. Y e t it was turned down in the Sydney and Melbourne offices, and turned down by Mr Bright, who came from Brisbane, who probably had not time to look into the matter himself, and merely signed approval of the action of his inspector. I know that there are a large number of ideas which come forward in respect to the Post Office that are absolutely of no use - Some of them resemble the grain of wheat that is hidden in bushels of chaff. Y o u search all day for the wheat, and when you have found it , it is discovered to be not worth the search. But it is, nevertheless, rather a pit y that we do not hear of more inventions coming from our own Department. If it be the fact thaf the officers do not give proper consideration to new ideas, all I can say is that it is a very unfortunate thing.",27
153,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Are you willing to more power vested with the Deputy Postthat masters-General, and the Central Office practically abolished ?",28
154,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"No , I am not. There has been a good deal of talk about giving more power to the Deputy Postmasters General, and I am in favour of vesting them with a good deal of power. But think they have already got all the power that they have asked for. At the Conthat ference in Tasmania I asked the Deputy Postmasters-General what power they wanted. They told me, and practically gave them all they asked for. I should like to know, also, what the honourable I sug- member means by the Central Administration ? I do not know what is in the honourable member's m in d; but no man would be happier in this House than the Postmaster-General if all the work were lef t to his Deputies, so that no honourable member could bother him . But what member of Parliament is anxious to hand over more power to the Deputy Postmasters-General, and leave the position such that we should not have the right to come to the Postmaster-General with suggestion or request ?",28
155,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,He would not be Postmaster-General at all then.,28
156,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"We l l , he might draw the salary. There must be a central authority, if only to interpret the A ct of Parliament. Sometimes it is possible to read an Act of Parliament in one or two ways. I recall the occasion when I was piloting through the Bill establishing the penny post here. In answer to a very urgent and able request from the honourable member for Darling, who is now Postmaster-General, I conceded a point about "" books published and printed in Australia.""",28
157,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,I led you astray tliere.,28
158,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"This is now in the Act, and nearly every Deputy Postmaster-General reads the reference in a different way, so that it is necessary to have one authority to decide between conflicting readings of a section. - Mr GROOM - It is like the definition of newspaper.",28
159,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Exactly . I am in favour of giving the Deputy Postmasters General great responsibilities; but I think they have already got as much power as it is desirable to give them. I am inclined to think f h at the difficulty is that we do not back up our Deputy Postmasters-General as we should. see A Deputy Postmaster-General who knows he is likely to have his suggestions turned down is not calculated to act with the same amount of vim that he would possibly sliow were the situation otherwise. Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan)[5.85]. - I wish to direct the attention of the Postmaster-General to a matter which is I of much importance to the rura l communit y of Western Australia, and, indeed, to of the whole Commonwealth. I refer to the carriage of mails by railway. Under an agreement made with the State I Commissioners of Railways, mails are carried by rail on a poundage basis at a certain price per mile. Tbis system has given rise to great difficulty in the constituency which I have the honour to represent, and certainly is not giving satisfaction to the community as a whole. In many places, especially in rural districts, spur lines are built, and for a long time after their construction the Department is unable to despatch mails over them because of the expense involved. found that the mail matter can be forwarded by road for, perhaps, one-half the amount asked by the Railway Department. Taken as a whole, the system works very badly.",28
160,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,The right honourable gentleman says that the charge is too high.,29
161,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I am not going to deal at this stage with the question of price; it is the system I wish to discuss. The Postmaster-General's Department is, I understand, aware of the difficulty, and is now endeavouring to remove it. My contention isi that the trouble should have been rectified long since; and I sincerely hope that the present Postmaster-General will endeavour to make a more satisfactory arrangement. I should be inclined to advocate that the mileage of the whole of the railways of Australia, or, if preferred, of a State, should be computed, and that the amount now paid for the carriage of mails by rail-whic h totals, I understand, several hundreds of thousands of pounds for the whole Commonwealth-shoul d be divided upon a mileage basis. In that way the Department could arrive at a rate at which it might agree with the States to carry all mails by rail, or each State might be dealt with separately, for a period of two or three years, with an understanding that if, during the currency of the agreement, any new line is opened, mails shall be carried upon it at the same rate per mile. If that were done, as soon as a new spur line was opened the people served by it would have an opportunity to get their mails carrifid by rail, which, at present, is not possible. Mr Si-iATtrE - Is the right honourable gentleman talking of Government railways when he speaks of these spur lines ?",29
162,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Yes . For a long time after a new line is opened the mails are not sent over it, because the charges made by the Railway Department are far greater than those incurred in despatching them by road. In many cases for this reason the mails are not being sent by rail. I hope this state of affairs - will not continue. I have found it difficult to understand why the State should appear to be so determined to deny their own people the facilities of postal communication.",29
163,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,This is practically a It is State matter.,29
164,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"It relates to the Postal Department, but, in a sense, it is a State matter, since it is in the interests of the States, who own the railways, that postal facilities should be extended to their own people. The extension of postal facilities means the promotion of settlement. When I have been approached on the subject, I have always said to those concerned, "" You should approach your representatives in the State Parliament, and induce them to agitate for the facilities to which you are entitled. You should not be inconvenienced in this way."" It is most annoying to people in country districts to see a train drawing into their stations daily, and yet carrying no mails. It is difficult to understand why the States should drive such a hard bargain with the Commonwealth with regard to the carriage of mails over these branch or spur lines. There should be no obstacle in the way of an arrangement to carry all mail matter at so much per mile, and to j)ay that rate in respect of all new spur lines.",29
165,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,We are aiming at a new basis.,29
166,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I hope that the matter will be speedily settled, for the present system is not conducive to the progress of the country. I trust that the Postmaster-General will see that as soon as a new railway line is opened the Postal Department shall have the right to send mails over it at a recognised rate based upon the mileage of railways in the State or all over Australia.",29
167,Mr ABCHIBALD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Mak e it the same on land as on sea.,29
168,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Some system of the sort should be adopted to enable new lines to be used for the carriage of our mails. There should be no difficulty in the way, since the people concerned are citizens of the States which own the railways. I appeal to the Minister to put an end to the trouble; if he does he will give great satisfaction, especially to who live in rural districts.",29
169,Mr YATES,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,It will be a good thing when the mails for the Northern Territory are carried by rail to Oodnadatta.,30
170,Sir JOHN EORREST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I suppose mails are carried by rail to Oodnadatta, although the train service is not at present a very frequent one; but with a good season in prospect, I hope that the service on that line will soon be improved. I shall be much obliged if the Minister will look into this matter, for the present system is retarding the progress of the country, and is very inconvenient to all residents of outlying districts.",30
171,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,We have started negotiations.,30
172,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Denison) [5.44]. - I have listened with much interest to the discussion of the Postal Estimates, and, whilst I am anxious that the Department should be a paying one, I quite disagree with the view expressed by the honourable member for Oxley as to how this should be brought about. The honourable member, speaking in general terms, said, "" Let the business firms pay for the telephones."" He seems to overlook the fact that if we increase the rates which business firms using the telephone system have to pay, the consumer will have to make good the difference. Every business man makes an effort to charge up all his expenses to the consumer. Having given the matter careful consideration, I have formed the conclusion that, with the exception of Norway and, perhaps, Denmark, Australia has the cheapest telephone service in the world. In Chicago telephone subscribers have to pay about £15 for a service that here costs £6 per annum. Seeing that the Commonwealth telephone service is so cheap in comparison with those of other countries, i to me that at the present time, when our resources, because of the war, are taxed to the uttermost, business people would not object to a fair and reasonable increase in the telephone rates, provided it could be shown that the cost of construction had been reduced to the minimum. We should do well to endeavour, first of all, to effect a saving by giving the Chief Electrical Engineer complete freedom in carrying out his important duties. We have what may be described as three distinct zones, the first consisting of city lines, where the those poles carry a large number of wires; secondly, main trunk lines. This work is beset with engineering difficulties and is necessarily of costly construction. Then we have lines in many cases carrying only a single wire, which need not be so carefully constructed and in respect of which economies can be effected. We constructed many such lines when contracting in Tasmania.",30
173,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Was the honourable member a contractor? Mr LAI RD SMITH - My father was the biggest telephone contractor in Tasmania. He and I were largely the pioneers in telephone and telegraph line construction. Many years ago we built a line from Circular Head to the Montagu for £11 10s. per mile, and it is working quite satisfactorily twenty years later, although we had to use the old instruments, and had not the metallic circuit. It is absurd that in country districts huge poles, 30 feet high, strutted by poles 18 feet long, should be used to carry either a copper or a light iron wire. Such heavy poles are unnecessary. An important con-' sideration is the cutting of poles. This should be undertaken at this time of the year, when the sap is down. Men should be sent into the bush to select the areas from which the poles required by the Department are to be gathered. They should not choose areas of rich volcanic soil, where the timber grows rapidly and is not close grained. Rather should they select areas of poor country, and they should be careful to cut at the present time of the year, when the sap is down. If that were done, perfect poles would be secured. In days gone by we generally used square poles nut out of heavy timber. Rounded poles are now being used, cut from young timber, and a large portion is being dressed off them. Recently, while t seems passing a line-yard in one of our cities, I saw some of these poles, the cost of preparing which, in the yard, could not have been less than 8s. to 12s. 6d. each. The poles are dressed, a piece of wire is placed around the top of them, and they are then stacked. I noticed, however, that many poles had great splits at the top, and were therefore practically useless. The Launceston Corporation sends a man into the bush to select and cut timber at the right time of the year. It uses a pole with a covering of Huon pine at the foot, which will last for years. It is in these respects that economies can be effected. I agree that up-to-date engineering methods are necessary in regard to the heavy city lines, but I think that the cost of light country lines is being largely and unnecessarily increased by the present system, under which big poles are used, and an engineer is sent along to report, and is followed later on by an inspector. In this way, I am told, the cost of country lines, which we used to build for about £ 1 1 per mile, is now running up to £ 3 0 per mile. If savings were made in the directions I have indicated, we might then consider the desirableness of introducing a more costly service. We certainly have in Australia a very fine service. When in London, in 1911, I was astonished to find that its telephone service was exceedingly inferior. State and company-owned lines were compsting against each other. The position, I understand, is now improved, the State having taken over the whole service, but at the time of my visit the London telephone service was far behind that of Australia. I found the same state of affairs in France, Switzerland, and other parts of the Old World that I visited; indeed, at no place could I see anything at all to boast about. I was told, however, by an engineer that there is a very good service in Norway, under which almost every farm house is connected at a remarkably cheap rate. I happen to represent a city constituency, but it goes without saying that I am desirous of seeing the telephone made as cheap as possible in the isolated parts of the Commonwealth.",30
174,Mr RODGEKS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Do you know that in Victoria there is a line constructed at £ 6 per mile, irrespective of wires, spindles, and insulators?",31
175,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"That may be, and it is all right when the line is'miles from other lines. If , however, there is a parallel line, there is induction, and this may lead to mistakes in conversations, and so for t h , resulting in loss.",31
176,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"But that objection does not apply in sparsely-populated spaces, where there is no chance of a second line.",31
177,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,I know the line of which the honourable member speaks.,31
178,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"You once called it a "" j e r r y - b u i l t"" line, but it is not.",31
179,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"At any rate, I cannot understand how there can be any but a "" jerry-built "" line for £ 6 a mileWe have heard a great deal about homemade insulators, and I am of opinion that these insulators might be easily manufactured here. As the Postmaster-General knows, very high insulation is not required for telephone work, though, of course, it is for telegraph work, owing to the leakage. If , for instance, one is working a duplex or quad-duplex line, the balance might be interfered with ; but in telephone work, over a long distance, there is no necessity for very high insulation, provided you can get the ringing signal through. I am now, of course, speaking of country lines. In the city, where a lot of important business is transacted, over even a short distance, the line must be carefully constructed. I may here refer to a service that I myself installed in Tasmania, over a distance of 7 miles, on which much business was done on race days and other occasions of importance. In that 7 miles we had thirteen telephones working successfully, with all the rings coming oufc most distinctly; and the reason was that the bell coils were wound to a very high resistance. This experience shows what services may be provided in any part of Australia, particularly where the climate is dry. If a line is properly constructed, there wil l not be that induction which is now so bitterly complained of. The telephone operators are not always to blame for the failure to raise a subscriber. The other day, wheu I was in an office, a gentleman was rung up but paid no attention for several minutes, and the probability is that the unfortunate g i r l at the switchboard was blamed by the person who made the call.",31
180,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,What does the honourable member suggest as an improvement?,31
181,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,I have already said that what is required is careful engineering-carefu l construction of the line. Repeatedly I see four or five men going round pushing a hand-truck; but surely it would be possible for the Postmaster General to provide - an ordinary car to meet the circumstances.,31
182,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,The honourable member forgets that we are getting motor lorries.,31
183,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I am glad to hear that, as it never pays to treat men like bullocks. Then, again, some saving might be made by buying wire and other necessaries in the cheapest market; and young men, of whom we have plenty, who are willing to go to the bench, ought to know that the way is open for them to go to the "" to p of the tree.""",31
184,Mr YATES,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Is that not possible at present time? Mr LAI RD SMITH - Apparently , it has not been so in the past. There seems to have been a halo cast around the head of gentlemen from the Old World. In the early days there was a great rush of operators from the Old Country, but they could not hold their own with our operators here. I am delighted to hear, however, that the Postmaster-General has turned certain slow-working lines into fast lines, and is able to put on expert operators-wher e the great saving comes in. What we require are men to send and receive forty words a minute; and this may be done with advantage if we have good operators on duplex or quadduplex lines. This means a great increase of business; and, no doubt, proves it is great mistake to put slow operators on duplex lines. I may give here the concrete case of a man-who , I may say, has not approached me, and who, I hope, will not be involved-and , as an operator myself, I can appreciate the position. There is a line working to Hobart vid Flinders by cable, and in one day there may be two or three distinct climates to be contended with, making it very difficult indeed to adjust a long line of this character. The line is a duplex one, and should have six fourth class officers to work it . At the present time, however, there are only four fourth class officers and one fifth class officer. This man works this line day after day for, I am informed, six and a half hours, but he is taken off during the slack time, between 12 and 1 o'clock, for twenty to thirty minutes, and is put on another line as a fifth class man. It is said that because he is not continuously employed on the cable service he must not be rated in the fourth class, and hence he is paid £210 instead of £235. This is regarded as a great saving. is always necessary, however, to have expert operators; and it is no simple thing to fill the position. All these men read by sound, there being no tapes; and the most important press and other messages go through. For hour after hour these men take telegraphic communications at the rate of forty words per minute without a mistake, most of them writing the messages on a typewriter. Surely these men should not be irritated by little "" pin-pricks."" These pin-pricks are not administered by the the manager of the branch, nor by the Deputy Postmaster-General, but by a gentleman from outside. Whether that gentleman is or is not an operator, I have yet to learn; but I understand that he claims to be making a saving of something under £50 by the arrangements that I have indicated.",32
185,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Who is this outsider?,32
186,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I understand the Public Service Inspector-the deputy of the Public Service Commissioner. I emphasize the fact that it never pays to put a slow man on a fast-working line. These men, I may say, are not only capable of taking messages, but capable of balancing a quad-line or a duplex line, and doing other important work. Further, when a a fault is discovered they can, if it be a simple one, right it in a very short time. Doubtless this is work of a highly technical nature.",32
187,Mr MAHONY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,The Public Service Commissioner does not understand it.,32
188,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Quite true; otherwise he would not take the risk of putting a slow man on the line I speak of. The remarks I have made may apply to other lines that are much longer. I am told that through lines of 1,000 miles are being worked in Australia, and anybody who knows the system will realise what that means in careful adjustment in order to get the messages accurately. There may be rain in one section, dry weather in the middle, and rain again at the other end-condi tions which all tend to the upsetting of the adjustment of the line-and under such circumstances, if there be not a competent man in charge, the whole thing may be upset. I do not wonder at there being delays, because everything depends on having the telegraphic system outside in first-class order. It is just as essential It to have good linesmen and inspectors as it is to have good operators; the man who can keep his line in good order is doing much to facilitate the sure and early conveyance of messages. Examinations for linemen are held repeatedly, and men are asked to pay fees in connection with them, but that is the last they hear of the matter. I have in my possession a letter from a married man who some time ago passed one of these examinations and applied for work, but cannot get it , although, as he saysj single men have since been put on. I have asked this man for permission to use his name in the matter, but, as he pointsd out that the mention of his name might penalize him , I cannot make use of it . I hope that the Postmaster-General will take the advice of his expert omcers in preference to that of a gentleman who classes operators as clerks. He may be doing his work very well, but, as he has to deal with all omcers throughout the Public Service, he cannot have that detailed expert knowledge that the experts OL the Department possess.",32
189,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,What is thegood of repeating these matters to the Postmaster General if he has no power to act?,33
190,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I hope that the Postmaster-General will exercise what power he has. .1 think that he has some say in the matter. If it can be shown that certain important work is not being carried out effectively owing to the incompetence of the men engaged, he has a perfect right to take action.",33
191,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,We always hold the Postmaster-General responsible.,33
192,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"We do. I in tend to keep on bringing forward these matters until there is some redress. think it will be admitted that with over twenty years' technical service I should know a little of what I am talking about. I wish now to speak about the females who work in our telephone exchanges. Honourable members should realise the experience of a telephone operator sitting hour after hour with a receiver on her head and listening to all sort of requests; for instance, "" Will you kindly put me on to So-and-so, I cannot find the number?"" and, with shutters falling down all round, and somebody saying, "" I am the honourable member for So-and-so ""-firs t letting her know who he .is in order to get her to fear him - "" put me on to So-and-so; I cannot find the number.""",33
193,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,We should have the automatic system.,33
194,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Unde r automatic system the subscriber will have to find the number himself, and will understand the trouble to which these operators are now put. greater nervous strain than that on the telephone operator sitting hour after hour switching on and off, and so o n ; and the women who do this work should receive the same pay as men. They are capable of doing the work, and they do it most effectively; they are more gentle in their language than male operators- I have never heard a woman operator use an unkind word-and their voices are more even and more effective, especially where they have the contralto pitch. They are entitled to a higher maximum pay, and I hope that the Postmaster General will see his way clear to giving it to them.",33
195,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,What about th© other wages in the Department ? Are they high enough ?,33
196,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I do not say that they are high enough, but the conditions are considerably better, and wages are better than when I was in the service. My men had to sleep in a railway truck and cook their meals over a nailcan pierced with holes. A cook is now provided for so many men. Nice tents are supplied. Very often dining tents are supplied. The men have an ideal time compared with the old days, when I was ashamed to ask men to go out and do work at 5s. .6d. or 6s. a day, which the Government insisted on paying them, while giving them no camp allowance. There is now a camp allowance of 3s. a I day in addition to about b's. or 9s. a day minimum wage. I have not heard the men complain very bitterly about their present conditions and wages. No doubt the Postmaster-General has a very uph ill fight. Owing to business having fallen off during the war conditions may be somewhat easier; but there was a great demand for telephonic connection, which exercised the energies of the engineering and mechanical branch to their utmost capacity. It was difficult to get telephones and suitable instruments in order to give the good service that was required. If it is intended to charge interest on capital cost, the Sydney charges will always be higher than the Melbourne.

198,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"In all tropical There is no and semi-tropical portions of Australia lightning storms are frequent, and the lightning, being a very high potential, runs down the lines and burns everything. To secure an effective lightning arrester is very difficult. However, every day the service is improving, and becoming more effective; but, at the same time, where we have these great storms, we must maintain a big staff, capable of attending to the maximum number of faults. That is why telephone maintenance is very in places where we have to contend with the elements.",33

A trend of recent legislation has been to protect females from night work. Factory Acts have strong provisions in that regard. The British Parliament has have a union. passed Acts preventing women from working after a certain hour at night. Our inlaide. dustrial awards protect women from working at night. It is astonishing find that our Postmaster-General will allow any system to be brought into existence, or to be extended, calling on women to work all night.",34
203,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,The telephone girls Adelaide asked to have that system estabService lished.,34
204,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I do not believe that statement. If a man has a daughter the telephone service, will he allow her be out all night at work? There must have been pressure brought to bear in women. Adelaide to get the girls to do this. However, in Sydney they are protesting against the proposal. When they passed their examinations the conditions made no mention of night work, but specified certain hours at certain wages, and this night work is an innovation. Our factory legislation protects women and prevents them from being worked at night, and even in the State Legislatures an arguGeneral ment in regard to the early closing of hotels is the fact that late closing keeps women working in the bars late at night. Yet we have a Labour Government which propose to compel these young women to now work in the telephone service all night.",34

I to look to the Postmaster-General to protect the lives and health of these young",34
217,Mr JOHN THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Cowper) [6.20] - There are two or three matters on which I have not been able to get justice from the Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney, and as they are matters of policy, I take this opportunity of bringing them under the notice of the Minister. We all remember with satisfaction the remarks of the present Postmasterwhen he was in Opposition, in the matter of telephone extensions in the country, and giving facilities to country people in the shape of postal services. I desire to bring under his notice the position of some guarantee telephone lines. The particular Hne to which I desire to direct attention is that from Bellengen to Gleniffer. The? period within which this line must be taken over from the guarantors has alcarrying most expired, and yet they are now being called upon to spend a considerable sum of money in effecting repairs to it. Pracceeded tically, they are being required to conintimated struct a new line before the Department will take it over. I may mention that this line has not been erected more than eight years; yet the guarantors are being asked to erect fifty new poles along a tance of 4 miles of it, on account of the old ones being rotten. Obviously the Hne as originally constructed must have been very defective, otherwise fifty new poles of much shorter poles. would not be required within such a brief period. I contend that it is unfair to ask these guarantors to hand over to the Department a new line in lieu of a Hne which could not have been a good one in necessary. the first instance. I ask the Postmaster General to look into this matter. A simifour lar case has occurred at Comboyne. In the erection of these lines the Departpoles ment did not exercise sufficient care to that the poles used were of durable timto ber and properly erected, so as to insure their having a reasonable Hfe. Otherwise it would not be necessary to replace them within the short space of seven or eight years. I also desire point out that the Postmaster-General has two sets of guarantors and two sets of guarantees in connection with of line. Up to a few years ago the guarantors of these lines were required to conthe tribute practically the whole sustained on their working. Now, however, the Department is prepared to bear tralia. 50 per cent, of that loss. The particular lines of which I have been speaking were laid down under the old system, with the result that the residents are required to have indicated ? make good the whole of the deficiency instead of having to contribute of it, as are the guarantors of lines erected during recent years. I ask the Postmaster-General to look into this ter, with a view to seeing if all these cannot be placed upon the same basis, so that the Department itself may bear 50 per cent, of any loss incurred. One the things that we expect from the Postal Department is that the lines to country districts shall be constructed on as easy terms as possible. I am further of opinion that, after people have signified [163] |p their willingness to contribute to any loss sustained in the working of these lines in remote districts, undue delay occurs in out the works. I think that the Postmaster-General ought to ascertain how it is that these lines are not prowith immediately the settlers have their willingness to accept the terms imposed by the Department. Then I wish to urge a complaint in regard to the length and size of the poles that are specified in connection with some of these dislines. A Httle while ago the honourable member for Wannon interjected that telephone lines were being constructed in his district for £6 per mile, by making use I have in my mind a line which has been put out of the reach of residents because the Department has prepared specifications for long poles, the use of which is absolutely unI t asks them to contribute £48 16s. 8d. towards a line containing poles each 28 feet in length, seven poles each 25 feet in length, and forty-two each 18 feet in length. Of course, see I recognise that telegraph poles require be a certain height above the ground wherever the lines cross existing roads. But it is not necessary in other places.  to are used instead of poles.",34
218,Mr JOHN THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,I think that there is a happy medium between a fence this class and an 18-ft. pole.,35
219,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,In Victoria we get over difficulty by erecting telephone lines of the loss inside the fences.,35
220,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,We do that all over Aus,35
221,Mr JOHN THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Then why are the people to whom I have referred asked to contribute poles of the size I,35
222,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,It may be part of a line only half which will be extended.,35
223,Mr JOHN THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"No . The case I have cited is one in which there matis not the slightest probability of the lines poles ever being called upon to carry a and second line. We are all anxious that settlers in remote portions of the country, of who are perhaps far removed from a doctor, should have the best telephonic facilities possible. Will the Postmaster-General see wliether shorter poles cannot be used in outlying places all over Australia ? I wish now to say a word or two in regard to a matter which is mentioned in the Herald of this evening. Under the head ing, "" Wrappers Bear A p p e a l "" and. "" E x t r a Postage Required,"" I find the following: Because the wrappers bore a rubber stamp: impression of the words "" Remember Australia Day, July 30, and give freely,"" Nicholson and Company Limited have been notified by the Postal Department; yesterday, that mail matter, comprising IOS gramophone lists posted the previous day, required extra postage. It was explained that similar notices wero being forwarded to other firms whohad used the rubber stamp patriotic appeal on their mail matter. . I say t l i at anybody who is sufficiently patriotic to put a rubber stamp appeal on his wrappers ought not to be required to pay extra postage. I think, that thismatr ter needs only to bementioned to insuresteps being taken to prevent a repetition of the occurrence.",35
224,Unknown,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.£5 p.m.,36
225,Mr JOHNTHOMSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I wish to fer now to some matters connected with the mail service. The Postmaster-General is aware that many country districts do not enjoy the convenience of train mail services. In many districts important, towns and centres of considerable population are dependent upon the carriage of mails by horse and by coach. This has given rise to a good deal of complaint, and attempts have been made to induce the Department to provide quicker means of transit for the mails by the use of motor lorries or motor cars. I regret that tha Department has not, so far, kept up with the times in this direction. In my own district two or three contracts have been accepted for the conveyance of mails by motors, but in many districts the Department cannot be induced to move in this direction. Tenders are now being called for services for 1915-16, and I think it will be found that, owing to. the high price of fodder, the cost of conveying mails by coaches will be considerably increased. In the circumstances I ask the Postmaster-General to consider seriously whether the public might not be much better served by the adoption of a more expeditious method of carrying the mails 1 The dav has gone by with most of our people when, if they do not get a mail this week, next week will do. We all now want our mails delivered as quickly-as possible, and a coach travelling at about 5 miles an hour in districts where the roads aire good can scarcely be said to be up to our modern requirements. By the use of. motor vehicles; we could, get a better service at ai very slightly increased, cost to the Department.. I.have a.word to say now Sydney, Wednesday. on. the subject, of - the-payments made to persons in chargeof allowance offices. I have reason to believe. that it . is in , the. minds of responsible officers of the Post and. Telegraph Department to reduce the amounts, at present, being paid to persons keeping allowance, offices. The Postmaster-General is as well aware as is any 1 other honourable member of the Committee of what is required from these people. Most of them, are living in. little wayside places in remote districts, and they are expected to provide at these places the facilities which we look for at the Sydney General Post Office. They are expected to get up at all hours of the night, or to leave the work of their farms or their kitchens, to sell a few stamps, and the remuneration paid to them is miser 1 ably small. These people do not expect' re- to make a living out of the allowance offices, but when they are prepared to go to a considerable amount of trouble, and spend a great deal of their time in looking after the offices, they are entitled to some consideration from the Department for the work they do, and we should not look too closely into the allowances paid to them. I have been told that it is proposed to reduce the payments, now beingmade to some of these persons, and the Postmaster-General will find that there will be considerable opposition to any proposal of the kind from honourable memberson both sides. Those who have charge of allowance offices are not under the same regulations with respect to holidays and half-holidays as those employed in official offices. They find room, light, and other necessaries for the convenience of the public, and they are at the beck and call of the public at all hours. In the circumstances, it would be most unfair to deprive these people of the very small allowances now made to them for the services' they render.",36
226,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,There is no proposal to reduce their payments.,36
227,Mr JOHN THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The proposal mav not yet have reached the Minister, and I am taking advantage of this opportunity toenlist his sympathy before it does reach him. I can assure the honourable gentleman that a responsible officer of the Department told me, in acasual"" way, that such a proposal was to be made:",36
228,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,-It is being done now.,37
229,Mr JOHN THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,The honourable member for Hunter informs me that it is .being done now.,37
230,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"No ; the honourable member is quite wrong. An y reductions that take place are automatic, in accordance with the scale of payments that has been adopted. There is no proposal to the scale.",37
231,Mr JOHN THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"If the M in ister means to say that those in charge of allowance offices are being paid according to the number of letters they handle, I .say that it is not fair to ask them to keep these offices going for £ 1 or £ 5 . a year. They give a considerable amount of their time to the work, they find rooms and light for the convenience of the public, and they should not be remunerated under any hard-and-fast scale according to ' the number of packets they make up, or of mails they despatch. The Postmaster General, from his large experience of life in the country districts, will not, I hope, .allow himself to be tied to a scale in dealing with payments of this kind, and will give careful consideration to the question before he permits £ 1 to be deducted from the allowance paid to any of these persons. If he errs in the matter at all, it should be in the direction of a more liberal remuneration for these services, and, if he takes that view of the matter, I am satisfied that he will receive the support of every honourable member of the Committee. Quite recently, a new system has been adopted in connection with letter-boxes in country post-offices, and increased rents are being charged to the subscribers. The Department goes further, and asks these people, some of whom have - been renting letter-boxes for many years, to deposit 5s. before they can secure the keys of their boxes.",37
232,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,That has'been done away with.,37
233,Mr JOHNTHOMSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I am afraid Melbourne. that the people who have been responsible for this charge have uot done with it yet. In some cases, respectable business people who have had letter-boxes for from five 'to fifteen years are asked to pay a deposit of 5s. before they are given a key worth ls. 6d. Mr SPENCE:- I have directed that that - practice the abolished, .and the deposits returned or credited to the subscribers' .accounts with the .Department. [163]- 2",37
234,Mr JOHNTHOMSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I am very glad to hear that statement from the M in ister. I have now to raise the question of the rents charged for these letter-boxes. As the Postmaster-General is aware, they are of two or three .different sizes, but the people take whatever box is given them by the Department. In my own district the boxes used were taken from the Sydney alter General Post Office. They were removed for the. convenience of the Department, and in the interests of economy, which I appreciate. At the same time, they happen to be big boxes, and many of those who rent' them do not require boxes of that size. They are charged a certain rent for them because the boxes are of a certain size. It should not be forgotten that the renting of these letter-boxes is as much a convenience to the Department as to the subscribers, because the Department is not called upon to deliver the letters addressed to those persons, siuce they come to the Post Office for them themselves. They should, in the circumstances, be more liberally dealt with. The mails are very infrequent, and for the service rendered 30s. a year for one of these, boxes is a very heavy charge. These matters give rise to friction between the Department and the public, and are not worth the trouble and annoyance they cause. People should not be charged a rent of 30s. a year because boxes of a certain size have been put in to suit the convenience of the Department, when smaller boxes would serve the purpose of the subscribers. There is still another matter to which I should like to direct the attention of the Postmaster General. Whether it is because the officers are pushed for time. I do not know, but we frequently receive telegrams in writing which are difficult to understand. I received a telegram two days ago, and I do not yet know what it means. The illegibility of one of the words seems to have destroyed the sense of the telegram. This telegram was received from the Telegraph Office, I think that arrangements should be made to have telegrams typewritten, and type-writing machines might be more liberally distributed amongst telegraph offices in the country districts. Where funds are not available for the - purpose, the Postmaster-General might consider a proposal to allow assistants in - the offices ""who have tvpe-writing machines a reasonable rent for tlieir use. It would - avoid a - lot of difficulty if telegra-ins were type-written.",37
235,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,How does the honourable member propose to meet the additional expenditure involved in what he suggests],38
236,Mr JOHN THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,The honourable member for Oxley suggested a means himself in some remarks he made on F r i day last.,38
237,Sir ROBERT BEST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,A tax on bachelors is what the honourable member suggested.,38
238,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Not for this purpose.,38
239,Mr JOHN THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The honourable member and some other honourable members were discussing the amounts charged by the Railways Commissioners in the different States for the carriage of mails. I am inclined to think that if the Postmaster-General went into the matter of the payments made to the Railways Commissioners for the carriage of mails he would find it possible to make a considerable saving. If the honourable member for Oxley would look into the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department, he would probably find that economies might be effected in many directions. The Postmaster-General himself referred to one the other night which led to a saving of £20.000. That is the sort of thing I like to hear about. Apparently, however, it is more to the .taste of the honourable member for Oxley to suggest that there should be a tax upon newspapers posted to country districts. People in the country districts who have sent their sons to the war are anxious to receive newspapers to find out what has been their fate; but the honourable member for Oxley suggests that we should tax these people by asking them to pay extra postage for the newspapers they receive.",38
240,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,The honourable member knows that I do not.,38
241,Mr JOHN THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"That is all the sympathy the honourable member has for people who have sent their sons to the front . I am satisfied to bring these matters under the notice of a more liberal man, in the person of the Postmaster General, who, I am sure, will extend to honourable members credit for any suggestions they make, will accept their criticisms in the best spirit, and will give them every consideration.  are one or two matters which I wish to bring under the notice of the Postmaster General. For the past two years I have been trying, without success, to secure telephone communication of any kind, and not additional communication, along the routes of the railways constructed on Eyre's Peninsula. There are two hnes of railways through 'that country-on e running nearly westward, and completed now for over 300 miles, and the other running north for about 150 miles. The South Australian Government have considered the country good enough to put those railways into it , and yet, do my best, I cannot get telephone communication for the people who are settled there. If the State Government was as parsimonious as the Post and Telegraph Department, there would be no railways in that district, and none of the land would be taken up. The Minister of Home Affairs knows the country to which I refer, and when it is opened up by railway communication the least the Commonwealth can do is to provide telephonic facilities - for the people settled there. A f t e r the first 40 miles from Port L in coln there is no telephonic or telegraphic communication. Some time ago I thought I had the matter arranged, as it was suggested by the DP t m e n t that e ar the State railway authorities might bear half the cost, and thus save the expense of duplicating lines. W it h in the last week, however, I received an intimation from the Secretary of the Department that the arrangement under which the State railway authorities would come in was not very satisfactory, and that, as there was an estimated deficiency of £ 9 7 , the Department could not see its way, in the present state of the finances, to erect the line either under a joint arrangement with the State or on its own account. Consequently the whole of these people are practically shut out from the rest of the world. This puts them at a serious disadvantage, in view of the approach of the wheat season. Everything points to a good harvest; but these farmers will be out of touch with the city as regards prices, and entirely in the hands of the local wheat agents. It has been the practice in the past to construct certain lines as trunk lines, debiting the cost to the general account, and not asking the residents for guarantees. If there are any lines in Australia that can be considered trunk lines, these undoubtedly can. When finished, one of them will extend nearly 450 miles, and the other, when linked up with Port Augusta, as it will be, will stretch for 200 odd miles in another direction. They are purely trunk lines, and cannot be regarded in any sense as feeders to a main line. I urge the Postmaster-General to ask for a f u r ther report, and see whether these lines in Victoria. ought not to be constructed as trunk lines. The first 40 miles have been put up as trun k line.",38
242,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"On which railway?  to Cummins. The railway branches off at Cummins, and extends in a northerly direction for 100 miles to Darke's Peak. I ask that that also shall be treated as trun k hne. The original Port Lincoln Cummins line goes on to Thevenard Bay, areas, 300 miles from Port Lincoln. This is to all intents and purposes a trunk line, and the settlers ought not to be asked for guarantee. Men battling with the ments out back ought to be helped by the Department at least to the extent of being brought into touch with the main centres, so that they may be able to get current prices for their produce. Many of these settlers are over 100 miles from the nearest doctor, and telephone facilities would materially shorten the time taken to secure the attendance of a doctor in case of sickroom for some re-arrangement. ness. If ever there was a case demanding the favourable attention of the Postmasterbetter General, it is this. The residents have fairl y reasonable mail service through Bailway Department; but over the whole of that huge area there is an entire absence of telephonic or telegraphic communication. There are hundreds of farmers already scattered over the councountry try, and thousands of blocks are being every month, with new settlers coming i The case is urgent, and I base my request for the construction of the lines as trunk lines on the hitherto invariable practice of the Department, and on the fact that the State has already realized that the country is good enough to put a railway into.",39
243,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Hunter) [8.7] - Th time has arrived to take action in regard in the metropolitan areas. to the Telephone Branch of the Departpaying ment, in view of the very large deficit announced this year. We should, as far as possible, make all Departments selfcomplaining supporting; but in that one branch alone there is a deficit of about £300,000. Either there are conditions in the workas ing of the Telephone Branch that urgently call for remedy, or the charges for telelay phone services are too small.  South Australian service.",39
244,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,I am glad to hear it.,39
245,Sir ROBERT BEST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,And-ther e is none,39
246,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"That is not so. a There is a loss of £63,000 in Victoria, and £170,000 odd in New South Wales. That is a huge sum to lose on the telephone service in one year; but while this - condition exists we find the greatest difficulty in securing telephone extensions in country districts. As was pointed out by a the honourable member for Grey, telephones to are a necessity in sparsely-populated especially in cases of sickness. Although we have great difficulty in getting telephone services in the country, the fact a remains that the country telephones are elealmost paying. The Department is losing practically nothing on them. The loss is made in the large metropolitan areas, and is caused by the large businesses. It is fair to ask the Postmaster-General to see that this anomaly is rectified. If , as has been shown here this afternoon, our telephone charges are less than those in any other part of the world, there is indeed Our wages are higher and labour conditions than in England, and it , therefore, a stands to reason that we cannot expect to the run our telephones at lower charges to the users, yet our charges are only half those of the Old Country. The present system is very unfair to the people in the districts, because whenever they let make application for a telephone line, n . they are compelled to put it on a paying footing. Estimates are made, and the Department finds a certain proportion of the cost. The residents are then asked either to find the poles and to erect them, or to find the money to make up the deficiency, and in many cases they have to give a guarantee to maintain the line for a certain time. They are, therefore, in a e much worse position than are the people They are in full for the service, and are not given the facilities they ought to get. I have heard honourable members of the time that elapses between the Department agreeing to erect a line and the time it is put up. So far the cities are concerned, that period is infinitesimal in comparison with the dethat takes place in the country. If one has a line approved of, he will protho bably have to wait a year or two before it is erected. In fact, he is lucky if he gets it then; and yet it is the country lines that really pay. The big centres of population >can get '.telephone facilities without the slightest trouble .at cheap rates, which involve a great loss to - the community as .a whole. The big businesses get .the benefit, and the. general public have to make .the loss good. The large firms in .the cities are able to employ far less labour than they would require if they had no telephones. Honourable members can figure out how many messengers would be required to n m to the di-fer-ent parts of Sydney in connection with any big business, which now-can get connection by - telephone at a charge of - Jd. per call. The Telephone Branch .should certainly be made self-supporting, for to make good the deficits of different Departments out of the general revenue is to ""travel along altogether wrong lines.",39
247,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,That is the policy of the party on the other side of the House.,40
248,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Then it should be immediately rectified. The matter cries aloud for remedy.,40
249,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Do you think the ground rent is too high?,40
250,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The ground rent may be sufficient, and the charges per call may be insufficient. If I d . per call is charged in England, no one can reasonably argue that i d . per call is suflicient to charge here.",40
251,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,And the charge in England is less than in Germany.,40
252,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"That is .so, and in America the charge is higher still. I understand that there .a call costs 5 cents, or 2-Jd. ""We are giving a service equal to any other in the world, and those who are getting the benefit of it are not paying as mucli as they should. I feel impelled to take this opportunity to bring up what may be regarded as rather a parochial matter, but my excuse must be that I have waited so long that my patience is almost exhausted. Four years ago an amount was placed on the Estimates to build a post-office at Weston, in my electorate.; but not one brick has been put into the building yet. When the money was voted, I ascertained that the site had not yet been selected. It took the officers between two and three years to select a site, and they tell me that, liaving selected it, they have just completed the drawings, and are now arranging the specifications. At .the rate they are going, I suppose this will take another five or .six years. The local people are very impatient, .and have just wired me to know if there is anything - on the present Estimates for the work. A post-office is also required at Abermain, where one has beenpromised for a considerable time. Noplace in Australia has made more rapid' progress than that .district, owing to the development of the coal measures of the South Maitland field; and, though .a large pojmlation has now centred in that locality during the past few years, no* provision is made for a post-office there. I hope the Postmaster-General will take this into consideration. I understand! the Postmaster-General stated just now that no reduction would be made in r egard to allowance post-offices.",40
253,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,No reduction in scale.,40
254,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"At a time like this,, the scale should be liberalized, becausethere are many cases of hardship. I havereceived a letter from a widow who is keeping a post-office, for which she receives* £36 10s. per year. The people who keep* these offices are never done, for they have to be at the beck and call of every onewho comes along. They are going from, daylight to dark; going the whole of their time, and in return they receivethis paltry sum of money. According toa letter which this widow has received,, her allowance is to be reduced by £ 6 10s.. per annum. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is she in the country or the city ?",40
255,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Sh e lives in the> country. In addition, this good lady has to attend to the carrying of the mail four times a week todifferent centres, and has to keep a horse, and employ a l a d ; and she pointsout in her letter to me that, with the in creased price of fodder, if this £ 6 10s. is taken off, her living will practically betaken away from her. I ask the Postmaster-General to look into the matter and see if he can do something in thiscase. Probably he may be able to defer this matter with a view to dealing moreliberally with these country post-offices. I feel sure that the Postmaster-General holds the view that the Post Office should? not be made a sweating Department, but that reasonable conditions ought to beprovided for all employees to carry onwork satisfactorily. Tn a sparsely populated district, an office may serve a radius: of 5, 6, 8, or 10 miles, and while the> revenue may not be large, tliere are* people coming and going all the time to - these post-offices and the officers in charge have to be at the beck and call of callers at all hours. They should, therefore, be paid rates commensurate witli the work 'they give to the Department. As a rule, they give more work than is indicated by ""the revenue, and, in consequence, they ought to get what is really a fair - allowance. I hope the Postmaster""General will give every consideration to - this matter.",40
256,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Dampier) [8.19] - I feel very, pleased indeed that so many honourable members on the other sideare advocating that a little more considerat i o n should be given to the country districts. While I do not endorse all that the honourable member for Hunter has said in regard to the payments, given to the officials to whom, he referred, 1 would suggest that some of them might join a union. If they did, their position would, - no doubt, be very much improved. It seems to me that the lady he spoke of is worth hundreds to the - country, and I hope the Minister wiil try to look after the interests of these - people. As far as I am concerned, I - am not advocating anything in connection with the payments that are being made to officials in the country. We want mails; we want conveniences; and if these - conveniences can be given, the people themselves, should endeavour to assist the Minister, instead of trying to get high ^salaries attached to the positions created. The other day I mentioned apparent disinclination on the part of the Minister to permit members - of his staff to enlist. I withdrew ;the remarks which appeared in the .Argus on account of the statement made by the Minister; but, no sooner had I lef t this room, than I saw an officer - of his Department, who not only showed me a paper of his own, but of one other - official, indicating that the Department - I suppose without the Minister's knowHedge-were putting very great obstacles in the way of officers who desired to enlist. When we realise that there are - something like 17,000 odd officials on the rstaffs of the Post Offices, we must conclude, I am afraid, that very few of them have enlisted. I do hope that the Minister will make a solid pronouncementadvising the officers of his Department, if they desire to go to the front,, that - where it is at all possible ance will be given them, and informing them also that not only can they be quite sure of being reinstated, but. that,.' in fact, preference wiil be given to them on their return rather than toi tliose shirkers who stay at. home. Mr SPEN.CE - That has been done already.",41
257,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Well , let theM in ister make some solid pronouncement on the subject.",41
258,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I have done so.. I wired, t a the West to the Deputy Postmaster-General, to make sure about it .",41
259,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I have no desketo cast any reflection upon the. Minister; but here we have the Minister of Honae A\ffadrs, in a publication, showing' a. list of some thirty-sixof' hisofficers'- who have gone away. Mr SPENCE, - I think, we. have over 500 who. have gone,",41
260,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I . ask the Minister to assure his. staff, that he will do all he can to meet the wishes of those who desire to serve their country at the present time. The honourable member for Grey, and many other honourable members, have had a good deal to say in regard to facilities being given to the back country. I was. hopeful, when the present M i nister was appointed, that, from the knowledge he had acquired as the result of his travels and his work in the past, together with the experience that he must have gained of the great value of trying to develop the back country, the that the people out back would receive even better treatment from him than they had received from any other Minister in the past. Yet what has been the result ? The honourable member for Grey has pointed out that the-Government declined, after the State Government of South Australia had spent thousands of pounds on the construction of railways, to authorize the expenditure of a few thousand pounds to give the people telephone facilities, which mean so much to them. A telephone in the back country is not needed so much for ordinary trading transactions as for other purposes, such as. prompt communication with a settlement where there is a medical man in case of accident or sickness, and I was hopeful that the Minister would do somesthing in that direction. The Government, we have learned,, desire the States to hand over further powers to the Federal assist- Parliament, but when a State Government has expended hundreds of thousands of pounds in trying fco develop the back country the Federal Minister declines to expend a single sixpence u n t i l he is satisfied that the service will repay him. Surely we can ask for these conveniences. I hone that the country members' will demand that something be done to encourage the development of the back oountry. I asked a question of the Minister recently, and I received a letter in which he assured me that in the event of the State Government constructing railways, either the Commonwealth Government would erect telephone lines along those railways or they would arrange with the Railway Department for telephonic facilities. In my State no less a sum than £470,000 has been spent in the construction of one railway.",41
261,Mr BURNS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Where was that?,42
262,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"On the railway fro m Wongan Hills to Mullewa. This line was authorized some years ago, when I was in office, and it was taken over six months ago. The country served by it will , as it becomes settled, develop into a great wheat-growing area and carry a large number of stock. have said, the State Government spent £470,000 on the line, and at least another £50,000 in water supplies and roads. Now they ask the Federal Government to construct a telephone line, but have received refusal after refusal. almost monstrous that the Government should decline, time after time, to give these people any telephonicfacilities. Here we have a railway 190 miles in length, on which the State has spent over £500,000 in opening up an enormous territory, and the Federal Government will not spend £5,000-o r £5,500, to be exact - in giving the people - telephonic communication. It is too bad! Honourable members must realise the importance of developing the primary resources of the country. They have only to look at the exports to understand what this means, and surely, then, we can expect the Federal Government should do-something to further the efforts of the States. We have penny postage, but who receives the benefit of it? The big merchants. I notice that a balance-sheet has been issued by the Minister showing the position of the Department. How is it that Svdney is not asked to contribute a little more ? Tn that city the people have everything they want to their hand.",42
263,Mr SFNCLAIR,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,They have a wretched! telephone service.,42
264,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The balance-sheet for 1913-14, the last year for which we have a record, shows that in New South Wales the telephone shortage was no less than £152,000.",42
265,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Is that in the metropolitan area ?,42
266,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,I do not know.,42
267,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,There - is a very small loss in the country; it is nearly all in the city.,42
268,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,A country service should not be expected to show a profit. If there is a small loss in the country the city people could afford to make it up. They have every right to.,42
269,Mr WEST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,You cannot expect the city people to keep the country people going.,42
270,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I realise this, if the honourable member does not: That it is the country people who keep the people in the city going. I do hope that some consideration will be given in the way of telephonic facilities, especially in cases, where a State Government is trying to deAs I velop new areas. Country members on both sides of the House would do well to get together and show the Ministers that there is a big party determined to see that consideration is given to the people in the back country, not only It seems in regard to the telephone system, but alsoin regard to mail services. I do not blame the Minister entirely for the present arrangement in regard to the carriage of our mails on the railways, but it is a particularly bad one from a business point of view. I think it is about six years since the Commissioners for Railways throughout Australia entered into an agreement with the Postmaster-General, which provided that the minimum charge for the carriage of mails by rail should be not less than £ 7 10s. per mail. Although in Western Australia a railway 190 miles in length has been constructed, not one pound of mail matter has been carried on the line since it was taken over by the Commissioner. The present Government prefer to carry the mails for the district on a privately-owned railway, that is, the Midland Company's railway. The mails for the area served by the Wongan Hills-Mullewa railway, 198 miles in length, are carried on the Midland railway to Moora, then by motor to Dalwall in u , and thence along the State railway by motor for some 30 miles. Again, further north, the same practice is adopted to serve the northern area. That system, I believe, is adoptsd by the Department, not only in Western Australia, but in Queensland, and, according to the honourable member for Grey, in South Australia too. I believe it is followed in many places simply because an agreement was entered into some years ago. I am prepared to take my share of the responsibility. Although I was Minister of Railways in Western Australia at the time, I had nothing to do with the making of the agreement; but it is quite apparent that it is, at present, absolutely unworkable, and should be altered. Some time ago I asked the Postmaster-General if , when the State Premiers were in conference in Melbourne, he brought up this question with the view to trying to come to a compromise or better business arrangement, so that he would be able to give the people in the country a proper mail service. Imagine a train being run for a distance of 190 miles carrying goods and passengers but no mail matter! I am sure that the Minister will now see that an arrangement ought to be entered into with the Railway Commissioner whereby the Department will pay so much a year, either according to the weight of mail matter carried, or under such agreement as may be thought best by the various Departments. made a'condition that wherever the Commissioner runs a train he must carry mail matter in the train . It is absurd to have a train running for some hundreds of miles and the Government sending out motor cars or vehicles to carry the mail matter on the ground that they cannot afford to pay the railway rates.",42
271,Mr KING OMALLEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,They think it is business.,43
272,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"It is bad business; it shows that there is no business acumen in the Department, otherwise the agreement would have been altered long ago. It is absurd, I repeat, that a train should be run three or four times a week each way and not carry a pound of mail matter. Here is what a pioneer settler has to say on the subject in the Sunday Times, published at PerthAs an instance of the present mail service, a fortnight ago n, number of settlers came into the post-office (or, rather, receiving office), at 11 a.m. to catch the mail with letters, as the mailman, or some other authority, had instructed the receiver to close the bag at 12 noon. The mailman did not arrive until 5 p.m., so that all those settlers-som e of them coming from long distances-los t a full day. Most of them were waiting for horse feed, super, or seed, and many of them were disappointed in not even getting an advice. If their goods arrive before they come along again in a week's time, the Kailway Department will charge them demurrage on the trucks; so that they are being penalized in more ways than one. How can the farmers carry on under these conditions, and with increased freights and fares to make matters worse? I posted a letter by the antiquated mail (which leaves now on Thursday) asking for a small parcel urgently wanted in connection with seeding, to be sent by Monday's train, but got a reply by the Thursday fortnight following stating that the letter had arrived too late to put the parcel on the train leaving on the Monday night. Under ordinary business conditions, it takes fifteen days to get a reply to a letter. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is it any wonder that the Department does not pay?",43
273,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Imagin e a private concern being run in that way! If the Department would only give to the State railway the carriage of the mails to the Murchison Field, I would be quite satisfied. That is a very large gold-field area, carrying an enormous population, and touched by this railway. The Government could, if they chose to break the agreement with the private railway company, get sufficient mail matter even to It ought to be complv with the conditions under which they agree to pay a minimum rate of ' £ 7 10s. a mail. B ut they prefer to support private enterprise rather than give the State railway a chance to earn some money. That is a bad business arrangement. I am quite satisfied that a better agreement could be arrived at. I wish to read to the Committee something more with regard to this grievance from the same newspaper as I quoted just nowThe Sunday Times has received a number of complaints on this subject (furtlier reference to the matter is made by a correspondent elsewhere in this issue), and the decision of the Department to still continue in its determination to sacrifice efficiency to a false economy will come as a disappointment to all. If the Commonwealth Government really aims at cheapness, why not employ a bullock dray for the carriage of mails? Anything, apparently, will do for Western Australia: The Postmaster-General has had a big experience of the back country. He knows the difficulties and the dangers which the pioneer has to put up with. He knows how many accidents and cases of sickness occur. AVe have not at present a telephone service in this district, but if we had a reasonable train arrangement for our mails, the hardship would not be so serious as it is. I suppose that if a guard were to dare to carry a letter on the train he would be summoned for contravening a departmental regulation. It is a shame that a train is run along the line without a mail, not - only in one district, but at many places. The honourable member for Swan has told me how his own district Buffers in that regard. The Department finds that it is cheaper to carry mail matter by motor car or vehicle than by railway; but surely there is enough business experience and intelligence in the Department to insist upon an arrangement with the Railway Commissioner, so that, although the present charge may not be exceeded, but may be reduced, he musfc carry any mail matter which is available. I believe that the back country has the sympathy of the Postmaster-General, and I hope that he will insist upon an arrangement being made with the Railway Department so that when a train arrives the people will know that their mail matter will be carried also.",43
274,Mr WESIT,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,It is almost enough to make - one shed tears.,44
275,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"When I hear the honourable member, I feel that I am again visiting the lunatic asylum at Claremont.",44
276,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Order !,44
277,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I can quite .conceive that the honourable member knows nothing of the back country, and is absolutelycareless of its necessities. He represents a «ity, .and has not sense enough to realise the importance of the back oountry to the city. I am quite satisfied that the Postmaster-General has too much intelligence to consider for a moment the interjection. I hope that he will give consideration to the requests for better telephone facilities, a matter which I brought forward .at an earlier stage. I trust that the Government will agree that where the States themselves have spent enormous sums in the opening up of new territory, the Department ought to .show a desire to assist by providing telephone facilities for the people, and giving them a little of the comforts which are enjoyed by those who live in the city - pretty Mr KI NG O'MALLEY (Darwin> [8.40] - I could not help but be surprised last week, in listening to the honourable member for Oxley. He wanted to put a heavy tax on newspapers going from thecity into the country. His idea was toincrease the revenue offchePost Office by making the farmers pay extra for their newspapers. In the back-blocks there arethousands and thousands of farmers, and of men who help them to produce thecommodities which maintain the people in the great cities. Those men would never see a document or a paper if it cost a high, price.",44
278,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Why not give the-, country newspaper a show? Mr KING O'MALLEY - But my honourable friend did not offer to put a. high price on newspapers coming from the country to the city, because he knowsfchafc only little newspapers are printed in the country for the local convenience.. Is it not amazing how every city manwants to tax the settler in the back-blocks ? Is it not astonishing that city folk should' seekfcoprevent country people from gettingthe knowledge which come3 from the intellect of a great centre? The idea is to make the people in the country as stupid as possible, so that they will always have the saddle on their backs, while the city man will have the whip and spurready to ride them. I do not think, that the honourable member for Oxley invesfcigafced his subject before he spoke. As a rule, he is a very careful business man, but I do not think he went into the essence of the matter. After a. great newspaper has acquired a certaincirculation, and its supply of advertisements is upfcoits highest capacity, it is a. dead loss to increase the circulation. Suppose, for instance, that a newspaper hasa circulation of 80,000 copies, and all the advertisements which it can possibly publish; if the circulation isincreased to 120,000 or 140,000copies, that does not increase its wealth or producing power. It may increaseits political power, bub not its annual income, unless the rates are put up. I happened at one time to buy a newspaper in America. I had to take it over on a mortgage.",44

Theamusing part to. me is that the city man , who 1 has never been away from a post office-, a picture show, or a theatre, - can tell the farmerhow to. rum his. farm, - and' yet he may not know how to run his own circus in the city. The land and the workers of a nation are the very basis - of its prosperity and development.

284,Mr KING OMALLEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The wonderf u l thing is that nothing one talks about here has anything to do with business. I heard our chief pledge the Labour party at Maryborough, in 1913, to providing a line of Government steamers to give communication between Australia and Tasmania. Where are those steamers? Lord, tell mewhere I can find them!",45
285,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Steamer B could be bought from WesternAustralia.,45
286,Mr KING OMALLEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Those steamers, are, I believe,, going to. Germany.

Look atwhat our farmers have to: pay. There is an immense steam-ship monopoly operating between themainland and Tasmania, that, like a terrestrial serpent,, encircles, the whole island within itsi slimy folds. I ask thePostmaster-General when he proposes to establishtliis line of steamers ?",45
287,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,We have interned twenty German vessels.,45

Will the Postmaster-General wire over andsee if he can get a few? I do not? blame the present Minister for the position' of the Postal D'epartment, though Tote of people do blame him . What has ker got to do with it ? We have a machine that has been fifty orsixty years in building. It is all surrounded with trenches, andthereis fire in the trenches. You. cannot changethat machine unless you start at the top and reconstruct from top to bottom. The Secretary to the Department is a very able man, but he is not responsible, because he is the unconscious instrument of the machine.",45
289,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,We must begin by paying higher salaries to the men at the top.,46
290,Mr KING OMALLEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"No ; you must sectionize, and put each section under a responsible business man, and have one man at the centre. I would go outside and engage the biggest business man i u Australia. I would pick a man like Mr Sticht, who manages the Mount Lyell mine, give him £5,000 a year, put him under the Minister, and make him absolutely responsible. I know that in Parliament they are fond of sneering at the business man. I have talked to honourable members, and they have told me that So-and-So is the man, because he does not know anything about business. You would not like to make your will at twenty minutes' notice and make a man of this kind executor. You would not like to face your God and think that that "" rooster "" was running your b it for your widow, especially if she was good-looking.",46
291,Mr YATES,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Adelaide) [8.55] - I have listened to the speeches, made during the discussion, and especially to the advice that has been given to the Minister as to how to run his Department. The honourable member ""for Dampier spoke of honourable members on this side of the House as not being prepared to give to the people of ""the country the facilities they are ing for. I know that the honourable member was only answering an interjection; but I resent any suggestion that the party to which I belong has no consideration for the people in the country. speak on behalf of the working section of the community, and I tell the Committee that when I was a worker I never received a penny for which I did not give a quid - pro quo. If there are any men in the community who can be said to be getting any undue benefit from' the Postal Department, they are ""the banker and the merchant. The Labour man is able to look his boss in the face, because he takes only what he has earned. It is often said that the city man lives on the farmer. The farmers never gave me anything that I had not earned; but the employers and capitalists often rob the rural community of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Some honourable members on the Opposition side of the House do not know what a hard day's toil means.",46
292,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Then what are you getting so heated about""""?",46
293,Mr YATES,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Because I feel h u r t at what has been said. The making of sucli remarks is one 'of the fighting methods of our opponents. The Labour party is abetter friend of the farmer than the party on the opposite side; we will not bleed him. Honourable members opposite have a lot to say as to how telephone lines should be constructed, and what the charges should be. Looking through the Estimates I find a big sum in salaries for officers who are business men, or who ought to be business men. If they are not business men they ought not to be in the Department. One officer went into the Arbitration Court recently and said that ,men receiving 9s. a day were ""robbers,"" because they did not^give the country value for the wages they were receiving. What are the men receiving £1,000 a year doing? Let the Postmaster-General send for his expert officers, and ask them what they know about the work for which he is paying them £ 8 0 0 or £1,000 a year. Let hi m tell them that if they do not know how the Department can deal equitably with the farmer and the city man, and still pay its way, they must go. On the first page of the Estimates there is provision on the general staff for a Chief Electrical Engineer at £900 a year; an Assistant Electrical Engineer at £ 5 6 3 ; four Assistant Engineers, aggregating £ 1 , 8 0 0; one Assisask- tant Engineer, £ 3 5 4 ; and two Assistant Engineers, £480 . Presumably those officers are all employed on the general staff in Melbourne. In New South Wales there are sixty-two individuals, who ought to I know when to cut timber, what character of line should be constructed in certain country, and how to regulate those other matters referred to by the honourable member for Denison, and who are being paid £16,048 a year; there are fifty-one officers in Victoria drawing £ 1 1 , 9 9 6; fortyseven in Queensland, drawing £ 9 , 6 7 6 ; and in Soutli Australia, where the Postal Department makes a better financial showing than in any other State, there are only fifteen experts, at an annual cost of £3,294.",46
294,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Is that the lowest expenditure in proportion to the population ?,46
295,Mr YATES,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I have not worked out the proportion of expenditure to population, but it is the lowest expenditure on experts in any State except Tasmania. In Western Australia there are twenty-six officers, drawing £ 5 , 7 8 3 ; and in Tasmania, eleven, drawing £2,224. These figures give a total of 221 experts drawing £53,118 a year. That sum is being paid to those officers, who are supposed to know all about electrical engineering, the installation of telephones, aud the managing of an electrical system in the most economical way. They are men who do not belong to a trade union, and would not think of calling at the A.W.TJ. office and saying, "" Give me a ticket, I want to get a job."" I have not included in that list line foremen and line inspectors, and the dozens of other officers whose salaries would bring the Department's payments for expert advice up to £75,000, or possibly nearer £100,000. One officer stated in the Arbitration Court that from 5 to 10 per eent. of the letter carriers are robbing the Government- a proportion which the Judge reduced to 2 per cent - bu t what can be said of the efficiency of these high-salaried experts when the operations of the Department show a deficit of halfa-million pounds every year? I am inclined to think that the blame for that result should be put on the shoulders of those gentlemen, ancl we would be justified in saying that if they cannot make the Department pay, their jobs will be forfeited. I hope that when the Postmaster-General is considering his next Estimates, and is studying means to make ends meet, he will apply to the higher officers the same treatment as is given the workers in the lower grades. If a man undertakes to make a table and produces a duchesse pair instead, he is sacked immediately. That is the policy that ought to be adopted towards the experts. I propose now to deal with the attitude of Mr Skewes. I feel very hurt in regard to the manner in which that officer stigmatized the workers when appearing before the Arbitration Court. The practice of saying that the worker does not do his fair share is becoming too prevalent amongst oflieers in higher positions. A gentleman was telling me recently of his experience in a suburban council. One councillor came to the council meeting and remarked that the men who were scoring the roads would hurt the metal if they hit it with the pick as hard as they were doing. That councillor was challenged to try the work at which he said the men were loafing. He said* "" All right, I ' l l go out and have a try."" It was moonlight, and this gentleman went out, ancl began to use a 7-lb. pick. After he had been going about ten minutes he stopped, and said he would never again talk disparagingly about a working man and the labour he had to do. That is the position that most critics of the labourer occupy. They have never done a hard day's work. I do not say that there are not some who have worked hard, but those who have been "" through the m ill "" are generally more considerate than those who know nothing about it. Mr Skewes did these men an injustice when he made the statement to which I have referred. In the course of his reply to the debate on Eriday last, the Postmaster-General said it was unfortunate that the remark was made. But I asked the Minister to tell us how he proposes to deal with Mr Skewes, because the men who are employed in that Department feel that, if he still holds the opinion he then expressed, he will endeavour, on some future occasion, to justify it, although he was not able to do so before the Court. In the course of the hearing, Mr Justice Powers suggested that the remark was made in the heat of the moment. "" I am not clear as to what your Honour has in his mind as to the statement being made in the heat of the moment,"" replied Mr. Skewes, adding ""but if your Honour refers to my statement, it was made deliberately."" His Honour said he was very sorry to hear it, and Mr Skewes went on to say, "" It was a statement prepared three weeks ago."" He had prepared this statement, and placed it before the Judge, yet could bring no evidence at all to support it. And it appears that his calculations were based upon faults among 2 per cent, of all the men employed. I do not think the Commissioner had anything to do with postal men until he was made Public Service Commissioner; yet Mr Skewes said that the Public Service Commissioner, as the result of his thirteen years' experience, had a very definite opinion of this class. And, taking that opinion from a man of such large experience, he thought they were justified in asking his Honour to accept it as authoritative-to believe that men loafed and robbed. In declining to accept the opinion as authoritative, the Judge said that it might be entirely wrong. If he heard a complaint about an individual mo letter carrierlie could not say - whether temperature was 102 degrees in the or whether the man was sick upon that particular day, whilst it was possible the Commissioner had been wrongly formed. Therefore, he could not accept the'opinion. There was some humanity in the Judge who tried the case. He realized that these men have not got nice office to work in, and that dust, they do not work under the same has comfortable conditions as the gentlethe man who criticised them. In order to prove my point in this respect, let mequote a case from my own experisibleto ence of a Governinent office. If any Department can stand this sort of thing, months. then I can only wish good luck to the man who has the position. ""When I was secrehave tary of the Labour party I went into Government office at Adelaide at 12.30 one Saturday. The head of the office was not there, and a youth, sitting at the table, asked me if I would wait. I Department. waited for about twenty minutes, when a gentleman came in with a towel and piece ofsoap in his hand. He had been to a lavatory, and he handed the soap and towel to the next man, and proceeded brush his clothes, his boots, to put his on nice and straight. Then he went out. This was repeated about eight times, and consideration. each having signed something in a book, an went out. I had a look at the book.

But do not let all these accusations and denunciations be at the man who does a hard day's work, and who leaves most behind him as the result of his efforts. I want, however, to impress upon the Minister that something is not done to Mr Skewes-, I am no prophet if I do not tip that there correspondent. will be unrest and dissension-in the Postal Department. I would now like to Mr Yates. the the Minister'sattention to a little matshade ter that I hope will be given considerationfor the benefit of the City, that of Adelaide, and also of the workers inthere.

For the credit of Post Office, for the credit of the Department, and for the credit of Adelaide, I want the Minister to see if it is not posget the Adelaide Post Office thoroughly renovated during the next few",46

I know of nobody likely to be better qualified for a position of this description than an able and clever journalist- a man whose hurled duty it would be to send these tilings out, to be on the spot and to get information; and I think we have any number of such men in the Comif monwealth. Not long ago, applications were called for the position of official war The gentleman who is over there now-Captai n Bean-^-secured. draw that position. There were many applicants, and the runner-up for that position might prove to be highly qualified for the office I have in mind. I make thia suggestion to the Minister because I know that many relatives of the Australian soldiers at the front are in a condition of great anxiety as to their welfare. I know of no more burning question that the Minister might at once take in hand than that of at once putting Australia in as direct and immediate contact as possible with the seat of war. The Imperial authorities are primarily responsible in this matter, and I do not suggest that any officer we might send over should attempt to supersede the Imperial authorities, but rather that he should work as an auxiliary to them.",48
297,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,What would you expect him to do ?,49
298,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"If the Minister cannot imagine the duties which such an officer would perform, I wil l explain them to him. Just as Captain Bean is required to send to Australia, in the aggregate, the result of each day's fighting, so this officer might be made responsible for collecting as quickly as possible and forwarding; to Australia a list of Australian casualties and fatalities. I recognise that these lists have to be classified",49
299,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,That is done now.,49
300,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,We have cases where deaths at the front have not been reported in Australia until six weeks or two months after their occurrence.,49
301,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Where several hundred fatalities occur, we cannot get the news quicker than we do.",49
302,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,I am ashamed to think that the Minister is satisfied with the way in which the news of casualties to the Australian Eorces reaches us today. In many cases deaths are not reported in Australia until six weeks after their occurrence. Can such a system f u r nish any solace to the relatives of those who die at the front?,49
303,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"It is a question, not of being satisfied, but of what are the possibilities.",49
304,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,I make this suggest tion in no captious spirit; but I think it is our duty to bring forward these matters.,49
305,Mr BURNS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Shoul d not this have been discussed on the Defence Estimates!,49
306,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,I think not. MrJ . H . CATTS - A military officer makes up the casualty lists.,49
307,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"That may be; but the honourable member knows quite well that the despatch of cablegrams and m a i l' matter affects the Postal Department at both ends of the service. I recently gave in this House an illustration of what is occurring. A woman whose husband took part in the landing at Gallipoli recently received from him a letter saying that immediately after the landing he sent her a cablegram, and a second cablegram after an engagement which took place five days later, saying that he had got through safely. It was some comfort to him to believe that hia wife would know that he was well; but, although this letter reached her two months after the cables had been sent, neither cable message had been received by her. I am not going to put the responsibility for this on the Postmaster-General, but if Ministers are satisfied with such a system, I can only say that they are very complacent. As a member of this House I am not satisfied that we are doing our duty in this regard to those who have gone to the front. I have made the suggestion in all good faith, and hope that Mie Government will be able to see eye to eye with us. We have in this country clever organizers who would be delighted to take up the work.",49
308,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,It is organization that is wanted.,49
309,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Quite so. Whoever is appointed to organize the service should be given the assistance of an experienced officer.,49
310,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"There are very few, good organizers.",49
311,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I have one in my mind's eye whose name I do not propose to mention, but, if it were given to the Minister, I am sure he would recognise it as that of a young man eminently qualified for the work. I shall leave the matter at that; I do not wish to labour it , for I think the mere suggestion, without any illustrations, should be sufficient. Another subject with which we can deal witli a little less heat is that to which reference has been .made by the honourable meinber for Denison and the honourable member for Cowper. I refer to the question of telephone construction. Telephoneconstruction may be divided into two classes-cit y and town line construction,. and country line construction. regard to city construction, I have nothing at present to say. I listened with a great deal of interest to the speech made by the honourable meinber for Denison with respect to country telephone lines. It was an interesting and a highly-technical address. If it had one fault, it was that the honourable.member had found it necessary to repeat it two or three times in this Chamber. I mention that as a commentary, not on the honourable member, but on the Ministry, for it is strange that the honourable member should have to repeat himself so often in this House without any result. My experience of the Department, with respect to telephone construction, differs from that of the honourable member for Cowper and the honourable member for Denison, since it has been a very satisfactory one. I think that honourable members on this question should make their suggestions to the officers in charge. If they would seek interviews with them, and discuss with them the details of their proposals, the effect would be better than that gained by bringing them before Parliament. I was not long in this Chamber before I had requisitions for telephone lines from all parts of my electorate. I submitted them to the Department, and in due course received replies. The custom of the Department is, in each case, to send out an officer to inspect the proposed route. The officer makes a cursory inspection, and upon that inspection an estimate of the cost of the line is undertaken. according to the departmental regulations, three or four alternative propositions are put to the residents interested. In my electorate we have had very good results. When I put to the Department the applications submitted to me in the first place, we received practically only one suggestion, and that was that if the line would not pay within eight years then a guarantee must be given by the residents or a certain amount sbould be put up by them. I was not satisfied with the basis upon which the computation was made. We found that the specifications provided for practically the same class of construction as was required in the case of city lines. I brought the matter under the notice of Mr Agar Wynne, who was then Postmaster-General, and told him Mr Rodgers. With that the estimated cost was altogether out of proportion to the proposed service, and to the needs of my constituents. I requested to have an interview with the General Constructional Engineer, Mr. Hesketh. My request was granted, and at the interview which took place, we took two test cases as the basis of our discussion. I shall mention only one of them. In the case of a proposed telephone line from Harrow to Salt Lake, the Government estimated that the cost of construction would be some £560 if the specifications then in existence were adhered to. I objected to several parts of those specifications. I asked, for instance, why it was necessary to specify the use of long poles. Several yards of each of these poles, I pointed out, were bleaching and going to waste in country districts where only one line would have to be carried for years. I pointed out, further, that, under the system operating, poles had to be obtained 200 or 300 miles from the point at which they were required, conveyed a certain distance by rail, and then carted 50 or 60 miles along the route of the line. A body of men had to be franked after thern to carry out the work, aud they received all the allowances to which the honourable member for Denison has referred this afternoon. My contention was that shorter poles should be used, and that they could be obtained locally. It was then pointed out to me by Mr Hesketh that, under the Act, a 12-ft. clearance was necessary, in order that the Department might be free from Then, any obligation in the event of an accident. I suggested that the difficulty could be overcome by obtaining from landowners along the route, who were interested in the line, permission to erect the poles inside the fences, and that by the use of shorter poles, which could be obtained locally, the best local timber Would be commercialized, while we could also employ local labour in constructing the line. 1 We completed the section for £165, as compared with the original estimate of £560 odd, and, speaking from memorv, the length of the line was from 11 to 13 miles. Since that date every proposition I have made in this regard has presented an alternative that the local residents might undertake the work themselves. Under such circumstances local labour - was made use of, the value of the land was improved by the use of local timber, and cartage over hundreds of miles was saved.,",49
312,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,The Act had altered in view of the provision as to the 12 feet clear.,51
313,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,But no obligation rests on the Department when the poles are erected on private lands.,51
314,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,The Act had altered to permit of shorter poles.,51
315,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Originall y that was so, but the matter could have been dealt with otherwise. A corresponding saving could be effected in regard to all country . lines, and such a result could, I think, be brought about probably by members discussing the matter with the heads of the Department, instead of wasting time here by pouring information into the ears - of the Minister, who may forget what he has been told.",51
316,Mr WEST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"East Sydney) [9.27] - I tannot understand why honourable members are so hard on city people who have to use the telephones, and who have to pay every charge that is levied on them. My own opinion is that no person in Australia ought to be any considerable distance from a telephone, or from similar means of communication; and, so far as> I can, I shall facilitate telephonic extension in country districts. Some members have complained about the non-provision of post-offices, but I tliink I can present the champion grievance in this connection. About twelve or thirteen years before Eederation I was one of a deputation that waited on the late Mr Daniel O'Connov. the then Postmaster-General South Wales, with the request that a post office should be erected in Oxford-street, Sydney; but, although some twenty-eight years have elapsed, that post-office is not yet erected. As a matter of fact, I cannot understand how those at the head of the Post Office manage affairs. mechanic and a business man, I have been fair l y successful, and the muddle I find in the Post Office is amazing to me. In October, 1912, in reference to this Oxford-street post-office, I received the following : With reference to your representations regarding the acquisition of certain land nexion with the Oxford-street Post-office, I bog to inform you that, by direction of the Postmaster-General, your letter has been forwarded to the Department of Home Affairs, with a request to furnish you with a reply. In February, 1913, this letter was sent to meWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo, and previous correspondence, relativo to be to the proposed acquisition of a site for postal purposes nt Oxford-street, Sydney, I beg to inform you that no offers were received, in response to an advertisement, from persons willing to sell to the Commonwealth land suitable for the purpose indicated. The Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, reports, however, that two sites at the corner of to be Oxford and Crown streets are considered suitable, and that the question of compulsorily acquiring one of them has been referred to the Department of Home Affairs. He is being asked to cause the matter to be treated as urgentThat is f u n n y - "" treated as urgent"" after sixteen or eighteen years!and on receipt of a further report you will be again communicated with. There is no doubt that the Post Office officials are very lively at writing letters, and make full use of their typewriters, because, in March, 1914, this communication was sent to me- 0 I desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 20th inst., on the subject of the proposed acquisition by the Commonwealth of a site in Crown-street, Sydney, for postal purposes, and to inform you that the matter is receiving consideration. Now we come to 1914, when I received the following: With reference to the remarks made by you in Parliament some time since respecting the reported unsuitability of the post-office in Oxford-street, Sydney, &c, I am directed to inform you that the Minister has decided upon a site for postal purposes in the locality referred to, and the matter has been referred to the Department of Home Affairs for the necessary further action. of New I made it my business to view the site, which I found to run 300 feet from the main street to a back lane, with a grade of 1 in 6. To expect old-age pensioners and others using the post-office to make this climb is almost absurd. This site is between two lanes, and yet we are told As a that the authorities desire to do away with slum areas, and educate the people to some appreciation of architectural beauty. The site has a frontage of 24 feet to the main street, but as 6 feet of this is required for a right-of-way, there are only 18 feet left, with a depth of 100 feet, and, as I said before, a grade of in con- 1 in 6. I found that at the back premises were a butcher's shoo and an eating house, and that the refuse therefrom was most malodorous. An important fact is that this post-office is the fifth largest in Australia, and some idea of the business done with the present premises may be gathered from the following figures-: Amount of stamps sold, £7,223. Amount of postal notes sold, £11,024. Amount of poundage on postal notes, £230. Amount of telegraph revenue, £1,098. Number of telegrams received for delivery, 30,550. Amount of Savings Bank deposits, £22,677. Number of money orders issued, 5,077. Number of money orders paid, 4,579. Amount of nioney order commission, £108. Number of postal notes paid, 40,200. Amount of postal notes paid, £10,670. Number of old-age pension payments, 17,603 (approximately). Amount of old-age pension payments, £17,228. Number of parcels posted, 10,956. Weight of parcels posted, 45,608 lbs. Amount of postage on parcels, £866. The total revenue is £84,963, and other business is conducted as well. space available for the public is 100 super, feet, and the employees are so packed behind the counter that one man with large feet»had to be transferred because he was always treading on the feet of his fellow-employees. In the summer months, the officials have to hire a person with a very large fan about 5 feet in diameter, and as they cannot find room for him to wave it on the floor, he has to stand on the counter to do it. I hope that the public who complain of hardships will have some regard for the feelings of the persecuted employees in this post office. Within half-a-mile of this spot, the City Council have spent £2,000,000, and large warehouses have been erected. I have been urged to get a proper post office there because these firms allege that they have been put to considerable delay in transacting their business. I have been told that proposals are on foot to build a post-office in Oxford-street and at the Haymarket, but these proposals have been on foot for twenty-eight years in one case, and fifteen years in the other. might point out that the work of this office has been greatly increased of late years by the payment of old-age pensions, and payments to dependants of soldiers. Greater facilities should be afforded by the Department for the sale of postage stamps. I know that when I purchase postage stamps and have odd stamps over, if I happen to place them in my pocket they speedily become lost. The Department would lose nothing by being more liberal in giving people the opportunity postage stamps. A great many improveAfr. West. ments have been effected in recent years in connection with telephones, so much so that services originally put down have become obsolete, and have to be discarded. The Postmaster-General is Great Britain, in a recent report, congratulated the Department on the fact that the British Post Office was sustaini n g a loss of £1,000,000 as a result of the improvements that were being continually effected; and it is right that the general public should contribute something towards the cost of the Department, seeing that they gain so much by the application of science to the service generally. Before Eederation, the New South Wales Post Office was suffering a loss of £80,000 a year; on the other hand, the South Australian Post Office was showing a profit of about £25,000 a The year; but to compare South Australia with New South Wales is to compare a pockethandkerchief with a sheep station. A country with a large territory, such as Western Australia, can hardly expect the telephone subscribers to bear the whole cost of the initiation of' a telephone system.",51
317,Mr ARCHIBALD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,South Australia - built all its post-offices out of revenue.,52
318,Mr WEST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"No doubt South Australia is a marvellous State; in fact, it is the model State. Whatever may be said of the people of that State, they must at least be credited with the capacity toconduct their business on business lines. It will be generally admitted, I think, that country members have not received? any of the plums of the Postal Service. On l l t h December, 1914, I asked the Postmaster-General1. Is he aware of the unsafe condition, and also the unsuitability, of the post-office in Oxford-street, Sydney? 2. If so, will he take steps to insure the longpromised removal of the disability which theI public suffer in this respect? The reply forthcoming was1. I am aware that the present premises do not accord with the importance of the Oxfordstreet Post-office, and provision is being madefor the purchase of a site for a new office during the current financial year. I do not know who is the business genius of the Postal Department, but I am strongly of opinion that the greatestblunder committed since the consummation of Eederation was that of reto sell fusing to countenance the proposal of the honourable member for Darwin to resume .forpostal purposes the wliole area im the immediate vicinity of the General Eost - Office, Sydney. ' The present building - does' not provide a sufficiency of floor.space. The area in. question could have been acquired at the time of which I .speak for £800,000, but today I venture to say it could not be purchased for less - than £2,000,000. Its acquisition would have proved a remunerative investment for the Commonwealth, inasmuch as it would have returned at least 7 or 8 per - cent, interest upon the capital outlay. This site will have to be resumed one day if the business of the Department is to be efficiently conducted. As .Sydney is the financial and commercial centre of Australia, it is destined to expand very considerably in the near future. It is the duty of the Government to anticipate ""public requirements, and, consequently, effect should have been given to the proposal of the honourable member for Darwin. In the Oxford-street Post office people desirous of transacting business are packed together so closely as to touch each other, and if they have big .feet they are compelled to put them into a sack to prevent them being trodden upon. Those responsible for the selection of a site for any Commonwealth building should be careful to secure one upon which an edifice may be reared, which will constitute one of our land-marks, and which will be regarded by the people with feelings of pride. When public buildings are erected in side-lanes our officers are - denied a chance of displaying their abilities. I ' d o not know if it will ever be my lot to preside over a public Department,, but if it is, I shall want to know why - certain urgently-needed reforms are not - carried out. When we put a man into a Ministerial chair we expect hi m to rise to the occasion, nnd to show a little initiative.. I remember saying to a member of. the New South Wales Parliament that he was. a slow-coach to be in Parliament, and ought to be "" chivvied,"" and his answer to me was, "" Well, you know, Jack, I take the line of least resistance."" That indicates a spirit which we do not want in Federal politics. We expect the members of the Federal Government to keep up with the ideals of the people of Australia, which, are as high as are those of people in any other part of the world. Our people have better opportunities than have the people of other countries, and that they should set an example to others. in. forms of government, and humane social conditions, is only what we have a right toexpect. We have adult suffrage in Australia, and of what use is it if the same old Tory crowd that used to run affairs in Australia in days gone by, and who had no idea beyond the filling' of their own pockets, are to be returned to our Parliaments?",52
319,Mr RODQEKS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,The honourable member is very rough on the Postmaster-General.,53
320,Mr WEST,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I . am not rough on him at all. I . speak as the honourable gentleman's, .friend, and I am. asking him to do things, which, if he does them, will earn for him the respect of the people. I am pointing out to the honourable gentleman how he might become an ideal Postmaster General,, and we certainly want one in Australia. I am sure that he is pleased with the remarks I have made. I have riveted his attention upon the Oxfordstreet Post-officej and if he does not get a move on there I believe the people of East Sydney will do something to remove him. I may say that the representatives of city constituencies are entirely with the representatives of country districts in their desire for the extension of postal and telephonic facilities. Honourable members on the other side, as well, as honourable members on this side, have every reason to be grateful to the first Fisher Government for having put £3,000,000 on the Estimates for the Post and Telegraph Department. It may be said that the operation of the Braddon section of the. Constitution prevented adequate expenditure upon the Department previous to that time,, but the action taken by the first Fisher Government, almost as soon as their commissions were signed, showed that they were alive to the necessities of the Department and the wants of the country districts of the. Commonwealth.",53
321,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,53
322,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Richmond) [10.0] I am aware that honourable members desire to get through the Estimates to-night, and at this hour I do not propose tooccupy more than, a very few minutes. I havei listened to a similar debate on the Estir matesof the Post and. Telegraph Department every year sinceI have been a member of this House. We do. not seem to be any further forwardto-day than we were four or five years ago. ""We seem rather to be going back, because the loss on the Post and Telegraph Department is increasing every year. The more I look into the matter the more convinced I am that the trouble lies, not so much in the actual charges made to the public as in the lack of real business management in the conduct of the Department. A reference to the ngures presented for the consideration of honourable members in the Budget-papers in connection with the Estimates for the year which has just expired will provide the greatest confirmation of the statement. I have just made. I wish to pvit some of these figures on record. I find from the Budget-papers that in 1902-3 there were 10,259 employees in the Post and Telegraph Department, who were paid a total sum amounting to £1,241,330, or an average salary of £121 each. In 1914-15 the number of employees in the Department had risen ito 21,395, who were paid a total sum of £3,011,958, or an average salary of £140.7 per employee. If we look now to the revenue figures, we shall find that in 1902-3 the earnings of the Department were £2,404,730, or an average of £234 per employee. For 1914-15 the estimated revenue was £4,566,000, and I believe that about that revenue has been realized. This gives an average earning per employee of £ 2 1 3 . That is to say, in twelve years we have more than doubled the receipts of the Post and Telegraph Department, but, while we are paying our employees, on the average, nearly £ 21 per head more, the earnings of the Department per employee are £ 2 1 less than they were twelve years ago.",53
323,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Nex t year the salaries will be still higher, because of the awards.",54
324,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"T he Postmaster-Genetricts ral will see that the point of these figures is that we have here a huge business Department which in twelve years has managed to more than double its receipts, and yet, per employee, the business is earning £ 2 1 less than it earned twelve years ago, whilst it is paying each employee £ 2 1 more. I have not a word to say against the increase in the salaries paid to the employees, and I do not believe that the work of the employees today is less satisfactory than the work we got from the employees of the Department twelve years ago. Giving that in, the figures point most emphatically to the fact that there must be a great lack of business management for the Department to require, in the first place, more than double the number of employees in twelve years to earn only double the amount, while we are paying the employees more to earn less per employee than they earned twelve years ago. If the concern were managed upon business lines, on doubling its earnings it should be able to show that, per employee, it was earning more than before. - Mr SHARPE - Does the honourable member suggest any new scheme?",54
325,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,T . believe that we shall never get any satisfaction from the Post and Telegraph Department u n t i l its management is placed in the hands of a commission of thoroughly trained business men.,54
326,Mr LVNCH,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,What chance would the country districts have then?,54
327,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I believe that under a commission the interests of the country districts would be full y safeguarded. As a representative of a country constituency I would not say that if I did not believe it. The fact remains, from the figures I have quoted, that if , per head, the Post and Telegraph employees were earning what they earned twelve years ago, the Department would show a better return by £300,000 per year than it shows today. I ask the Postmaster-General to give his serious attention to that aspect of the question. I believe that the Department should pay, and can be made to pay. I do not mean to say that mail and telephone services in outlying districts should pay. Parliament should be prepared to do something for the development of Australia by subsidizing mail and telephone services in outlying districts, but in the more thickly settled disand centres a considerable profit might be shown upon the business transactions of the Department. The manner in which the Department treats people who apply for private services on new exchanges is not at all satisfactory. I could quote a number of in stances, but one will be sufficient for the present. Near Mullumbimbe, in my electorate, there is a littl e district called the Pocket, and another called Bill i nudgel. A number of would be telephone subscribers there paid a year's rent, but when they applied for their telephone, about eighteen months ago, the Departinent, after a considerable delay, wrote to them and told them they must put up a second year's rent before it would erect the lines. They paid their second £ 3 a year, making £ 6 in all ; and although that ' was eighteen months ago, not a single telephone line has been installed on those two exchanges. The same thing has occurred in quite a number of districts in my electorate, and in others. The money has actually been paid at the request of the Department, and months have gone by witnout the people being given the service they expect. I trust the Postmaster-General will look into this matter. In the case of a certain trunk line, the Department asked for a considerable donation from the residents before it would erect the line, which, according to the officials, would not pay. was eventually agreed that the residents should supply and lay along the line the whole of the poles. The residents f u l filled their part of the contract, but the Department let the poles lie on the ground for nearly twelve months before putting them up. That is not a fair way to treat the people. In that instance, the contribution was not justified, but it was demanded and made; and I believe it was only last week, or the week before, that the Department actually started to erect the poles. In that case, the Department eventually asked the residents to find the labour, and a man who had interested himself in the line set to work and found the labour; but the men were kept hanging about for three months before they could do anything. give the Postmaster-General dozens of similar instances' of the aggravating delays that occur every day in the erection of country telephone lines. I urge him to look into the matter, and see whether it is not possible to shake the Department up, and have the business done in a business-like way. I am certain that a great deal of the trouble arises from the duplication of effort. The matter is passed on from one officer to another, and this more probably than anything else is the reason why the Department is not paying. It is not properly organized, and I believe that is the reason for a great deal of the loss and delay. If the Postmaster-General will devote his full attention to the matter, and if he eventually succeeds in placing the Department on a thorough business basis, he will have done a great service to the country and its inhabitants.",54
328,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Cook) [10.10] - I have been in this Parliament now for about ten years, and the administration of the Postal Department has been a failure for the whole of that time. There is a magnificent opportunity for a Minister to make a reputation that will endure as long as Australian history endures, if he has the capacity to seize the opportunity. It may be too early to pass an opinion The present Minister may be maturing arrangements which have not yet been carried out; but one cannot touch the Department anywhere without finding that it is in a state of chaos. One finds' the same thing in the interminable delays and unsatisfactory replies to one's correspondence with the Department. In the General Post Office, Sydney, everything It is upside down. No man can carry on his business properly in a crowded office, with insufficient space to sort and file his correspondence and analyze and allocate his administrative arrangements. That is exactly the condition in the Sydney Post Office. There is not enough room to organize the work properly. You cannot have system without room; aud under present conditions there can be no proper system or proper organization in the Sydney General Post Office. I agree with the honourable member for East Sydney that one of the greatest opportunities ever put before any Administration was put before the Government in the suggestion of the honourable member for Darwin-that the Post Office block in Sydney should be compulI could sorily acquired. It is the most valuable block in Sydney, and the Government could have let the frontage on the ground floor for shops. The postal work could have been done in the centre of the block, or on the higher floors, with electric lift s installed. Not only would this scheme have cost the Commonwealth nothing, but the Commonwealth would actually have reaped a handsome revenue from the ground floor rents. It was one of the most magnificent business propositions ever put forward in this country.",55
329,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The Postal Commission recommended it before Mr O'Malley ever dreamt of it , as you will see from their report.",55
330,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I was not aware of it . I heard it from the honourable member for Darwin, so far as my recollection goes, before the Postal Commission's report came out. Wherever the suggestion came from , the Commonwealth Government missed a great opportunity in not adopting it . Sometliing will have to be - done. The longer action is delayed, the more it will cost. Probably, the block - could not be acquired for less than £2,000,000 today. It could have been acquired for £800,000 a couple of years - ago. I have frequently lieard the suggestion that Commissioners should be appointed - fco take charge of the Department; but my view is that the first essential of a successful administration of the Department is a Minister who has the organizr ing capacity, or understands what organisation means. A great many people who t h i nk tliey are organizers know nothing .about it . You will not get more than one really competent organizer in every 100,000 of the population. Organizers .are born, not made. They are men born - with the organizing faculty in them. If a man has not an organizing, analyzing, and methodical brain, it cannot be put into him. The first thing to do is to obtain such an organizing brain afc the head. If a Minister is not an - organizer, how can we be assured that he will put organizing Commissioners there,for if he has not the capacity himself he will not be able to discover it in others. What is required is system, organization, distribution of work, and co-ordination of - effort. If a Minister has a thorough appreciation of the position, he will say, *' I cannot run every detail of this Department myself, so I will find capable business men, and put them in under me."" Commissionersmust be under the control of the. Minister. I cannot see myself that the mere act of putting in Commissioners would any cure for the trouble in the Postal Department. The Minister has power at any time to do that. Wc want a Minister who appreciates the position, and a Minister who has sumcient influence in Cabinet-suflicien t force of character in himself-to insist upon Cabinet giving - effect to his ideas, and to insist upon being allowed to run the Postal Department. That is what we want, and, unlesstlie Minister has force of character and* possesses organizing ability, we shall have no improvement in the administration of the Postal Department. Members come into this Blouse and make - suggestions, but I would like to know how many of those suggestions are taken: Mr J. JT. Catts. notice of by Ministers ? This is the greab fault with the administration of public Departments, and it starts with the officers firsts Aprivate employee earning 10s. a day might make a suggestion, bur. perhaps the man on top, who may be receiving- £1,000 a year, thinks, it beneath his dignity toaccept suggestions from a working man. There are cases im which actual loss occurs because these administrators think it beneath their dignity to adopt suggestions made by subordinate officers. They are not big enough. If they were, there would be a suggestion box to encourage men to come along with suggestions for which, if adopted, they could be rewarded.",55
331,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"They are supposed to have it , too.",56
332,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The same thing occurs in this Chamber. In the pages of Hansard there will-be found any number of suggestions made by private members, but how many of them are noticed by the Ministers? "" We have responsible government,"" they say. This means that one individual takes upon himself responsibility, and if somebody else makes a suggestion to improve the administration of the Department, very often it is beneath the dignity of the Minister fco ac-r cept it . Apparently, it is thought that it would be tantamount to a confession of failure to accept suggestions from a private member. To crystallize suggestions into concrete form, upon which members may definitely pass judgment, I have moved a motion or two in this House lately. To take that course brings coals of fire on one's head. But the only way to get a suggestion be really considered is fco move a motion. The Minister and members then have to make up their minds one way or. the other.  Mr J . H . . CATTS - The Government whip is quite right. There are ways ofi side-tracking; but if any side-tracking is done, the public of Australia can then see what is going on. ",56
333,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"A great many of the public can see what is goiug on and will know when an attempt is being-made to hoodwink themv For many years there has been a great opportunity for the proper organization of the Postal Department. The opportunity exists now. present Postmaster-General has the reputation of having organized one of the greatest unions in Australia. Australian Workers Union, with all its ramifications throughout Australia, is regarded as a very successful organization. I am not in a position to say, of my own knowledge, how much of"" the success of that great organization is due to the gentleman who is now Postmaster-General, and who is its president, but it is said that he had a very great deal to do with it. If so, he is the class of man one would expect to set about the proper organization of the great Department over which he now presides. He has not been there long, and I hope he will live up to his reputation. He will either add'to his reputation or else lose it, and people will say, "" Oh, probably he was responsible for the great work of organizing the Australian Workers Union, but he is no longer fit for work of that kind."" Or else they will say, "" This talk about Mr Spence being a great organizer is all moonshine."" I hope that will not be said of the Postmaster-General. trust the honourable gentleman will not lose his reputation, but will add to^ it by his administration in the great office he now occupies. Method and organization, the application of up-to-date business principles, the capacity to choose the right men for various posts, distribution of work and responsibility - these are some of the essentials required in postal administration. Until we have a Minister who combines these qualities with the executive power to give effect to them, we shall have the "" Post Office muddle."" There are two or. three other matters which I now feel it my duty to bring before the Minister affecting the working conditions and discipline in the management of the Post Office. A great many postal employees are resident in my electorate, which is one of the city constituencies of ISTew South Wales, and it is my duty to these men to bring these matters forward. I would like the Postmaster General to take note of them, so that they may be looked into. Half-holiday to postmen. A statement was made recently by the Public Service Commissioner that this half-holiday was given as a matter of grace.  award.",56
334,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"They went before The the Arbitration Court, and it appears that the Judge said he would not interfere with that matter, but would leave it,, presuming that it would be canned out. satisfactorily.",57
335,Mr BURNS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"In some places they get the half-holiday, and in others they do not.",57
336,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Yes . It does not seem to be a regular system, and this: causes dissatisfaction. Privileges of thiskind ought to be embodied in the regulations as a matter of right, and not held up as a privilege and an act of grace which may be given in some cases and taken away in others.",57
337,Mr EODGERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"You do not propose to make the half-holiday uniform, do you?""",57
338,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"It may be that,, in the working of the Department, somediscretion should be allowed, and that thehalf-holiday should be given on one day in some districts, and on another day in, other districts. I understand that an exI cuse is made that if an employee has not worked over forty-six and a half hoursper week, or ninety-three hours for thefortnight, the holiday cannot be given",57
339,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Forty-fou r hours a week..,57
340,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Yes ; but there is= a certain amount of overtime allowed before overtime payment commences, I understand.",57
341,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Yes .,57
342,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"For instance, in a case where a man has almost finished his day's work, and a quarter or half-anhour would be necessary to terminatewhat he is doing, overtime does not start until a certain time has elapsed. Another excuse is given that there is no onev to relieve. I ask the Minister in that case to see if the matter cannot be puton a definite basis. He will know from his long experience in industrial matte rathat if the cause of the dissatisfaction and uncertainty was removed, it would dispel the idea which men get that favouritism ispractised in some cases, and make for thesmoother working of the Department. Mail Branch Assistants. On Saturdays it is stated that these men go to work, in many instances, at 11.30 a.m. and work to 9 or 10 p.m., with half-anhour off for lunch and tea, and in thoso cases no half-holiday is allowed. Minister might look into that matter, loo. Male Telephonists.' I was instrumental in arranging for a deputation to the Minister which took place on 15th February of this year. He stated, so it is said, that a strong case had been put before him, that ho would have an investigation made, and a reply given later. The reply has not, so far, been given. If the Minister would expedite a detailed reply to the deputation on the points then placed before him, it would relieve the minds of the officers concerned, as well as cure the in definiteness and uncertainty that prevail as to what the Minister's determination is on the matters referred to him.",57
343,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Are they technical matters that it takes four months to get a reply?,58
344,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"There has not been a detailed reply from the Minister yet. I believe that there have been general statements made by some of the officers, but that is not satisfactory. I do not know what justification there is for the length of time which has passed. There may be every justification, 'but I bring the matter before the Minister now so that he may expedite a reply. Boards of Inquiry. I want to say a word or two, first about an instance of the working of a Board of Inquiry, and then about Boards of In q u i r y generally. I shall be very brief. The latter part of section 49 of the Public Service Act readsIn any case where a charge against an officer is submitted to a Board of Inquiry, a copy of all documents intended to be used at such inquiry shall, where practicable, be furnished to sucli officer at least seven days before such inquiry is held. In the case under notice, the officer charged made two applications to inspect the file, but he was given to understand that it contained no statements which would interest him. When witnesses came before the Board of Inquiry, they swore that they had already signed statements. Those statements must have been on the file, but they were not supplied. On the first day of the case the officer applied for leave to inspect the file, but the officer co'nducting the case for the Department objected, and the application was disallowed. The case went on to the second day, when the employee asked a The second time to be allowed to see the file which was being used by the officer conducting the inquiry, and the chairman told the employee that all that he wanted was to be quizzing at the departmental papers. Yet those papers were used in the prosecution of the case. What I wish to ask the Minister is whether in those circumstances the officer charged is not entitled to see the file which is being used to prosecute him, in order to find out what he is really up against ? If the officer has not adopted the correct procedure, will the Minister have the matter investigated, and state what the right procedure is, so that the information may be published through the staff, and they will know the means to go about securing their rights ? Appeal Boards generally. I have dealt with these before. It is an entirely unsatisfactory arrangement. At present a Board comprises two departmental officers and one employees' representative. To begin with, it is a lop-sided arrangement. The two departmental officers are interested in maintaining what they call the discipline of the Department. Their ideas, in the main, all run in one channel, and they think that anything done by the officers is right and that everything done by the employees is wrong. There should be an in dependent Appeal Board, or Board of Inquiry, or whatever you like to call it , with a magistrate- a trained legal manas chairman. Let there be an officer from the Department elected by the Administration and an employees' representative, nominated and elected by the employees. That would be a fair Board. Then let us have a legal chairman, who would see that evidence was admitted in a proper legal way. I have had some experience. I went to Boards of Inquiry in Sydney and conducted two cases. I have had many years of experience in conducting cases before similar Boards. The arrangements I saw at Sydney were, as I said before, typical of the general chaos and disorganization which are found to exist wherever you touch the Post and Telegraph Department. For instance, the complaint against the officer had been orally made. The Assistant Engineer would go to the Chief Engineer and make a complaint orally. Then he would go before the Board of Inquiry and state the complaint he had so made. A case may be fairl y conducted, but it is always open to the suspicion that the officer is able to shift his ground sufficiently to defeat the employee on his appeal when the charge is not reduced to writing and put in some prescribed form . I saw evidence admitted tliere which absolutely amazed me, which I am sure would not be admitted in any Court in the irregular way in which it was admitted there, and which certainiv would not be admitted by the Railway Appeal Boards which I have had anything to do with in an experience extending over a number of years.",58
345,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Did you raise objection ?,59
346,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I did. First, it is a Ion-sided Board; and, secondly, the records are extremely loose. There is no business system in keeping the records on which the officers are dealt with and punished. You cannot have justice unless there is system in keeping the records. A f t e r the Board hears a case, it draws ur> a report and sends it on to the Public Service Commissioner, who is hundreds of miles away. You can probably get an idea as the inquiry progresses that the officers conducting it have arrived at a certain decision in tlieir own minds. Yet, privately- I was going to say through a subterranean channel-the report goes on to the Commissioner. know what the officers have reported; you do not know whether their report is in accordance with the evidence given or not. You may get justice, but if you do the case will be exceptional. The wliole system is subversive of justice. If you get injustice and dissatisfaction it seems to me that it is a natural crop frpm such a system. I had one case before this departmental Board. The records and evidence put forward by the Department were so poor that no case was made out against the officer concerned, and I said to the Chairman. "" There is no case to answer."" For that reason I refused to put the appellant into the witness-box to make a case for the Department. My view was that it was for the Department to prove its case. But in the report to the Public Service Commissioner, the Board said that the fact that the man would not go into the witness-box and deny the accusations made against him proved that be was guilty. On that report he was '' outed."" I understand that in French Courts one has to prove his innocence; hut the British principle is that every man is innocent until proved guilty. The Boards of Inquiry appointed in the Post Oflice appear to have reversed this principle. There will never be satisfaction in the Department until this matter is put right. Surely the Minister can investigate the procedure. I put one case before him, but the reply I received was rather special pleading in support of the wrong that I considered had been done by the Board of Inquiry than an independent review of the evidence. No doubt it is much to expect of the Minister an that he should go through all the evidence, the taking of which may have occupied a Board of Inquiry several days, to form an independent judgment; but he could relieve himself of the odium which attaches to the endorsement of wrong-doing by putting these Boards on a proper basis, so that justice might be done by them. If he makes inquiry himself, he will be convinced that the present system should be altered, and I hope, remembering the force of character with which he has been credited, that he will then insist on putting the wrong right.",59
347,Mr SHARPE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Oxley) [10.38] - I wish to again bring before the Minister a matYou do not ter of serious importance to the linesmen of Australia. Speaking last week, I said that a linesman receiving less than £ 1 5 6 per annum, and insured for £ 2 0 0, had to pay an annual premium of £ 1 7 . I have since ascertained that the man's salary is £ 1 3 8 per annum, and his premium £15 10s. In another case a linesman, in sured for £ 2 0 0 , pays a premium of £ 1 7 ls. lOd. This man sat for examination to qualify for the position of line foreman. Had he passed, his salary would have been increased to £ 1 8 0 per annum, with the possibility of a rise to £ 2 1 0 , and he would have been compelled to insure for another £ 1 0 0 , which would have in creased his premium by £ 1 0 18s. 6d. a vear. I bring these cases under notice because I wish the Postmaster-General to mention the matter in Cabinet, with a view to inducing the Government to in troduce an insurance scheme which will relieve these men of the necessity to pay <such heavy premiums.  Act which compels them to insure. Mr SHARPE.. - My point is that, the Government should, insure them.. There - are 2,016 linesmen in Australia, leaving - out of aceount South Australia, and the average of their premiums is probably £ 1 5 a year. I think, therefore, that it is high timeto consider the establishment of a Government Insurance Department. Until such a Department is established, these men are not likely to be satisfied. There are other matters, that I had intended to mention,, but I do not now propose to refer to them to-night. Mr CARR, (Macquarie) [10.43] - I wish to refer briefly to the matter of forage allowance. The Minister has promised that our complaints, shall be attended to ; but I ask him why honourable members are not notified of what is to be done? When we approach the Department, we should receive definite replies to our requests. I have written about several cases, in some of which widowed women are concerned, but I do not know yet whether anything is to be done. These people are constantly writin g to me on the subject. Apparently the Department wishes them to come to Melbourne l o state thei r case. I have stated the cases of several to the Department, and desire a reply. I am sufficiently conversant with the circumstances to know that these persons have had a hard struggle. .have taken contracts at low prices, and whereas the Government have reserved the right to cancel any contract at any tune, the contractors are bound to carry - out their agreements, no matterhow circumstances may change. Many of these contractors are now being, bled, and I am sure .that the country does not desire that poor people should be treated hardly when bad times come. Surely justice and a little mercy might be extended to them by the Government. If the Postmaster General were to ask honourable members to submit specific cases again, we should be ready to do so. I have waited in vain for information from the Department. - cannot tell my correspondents anything. Some time ago the Postmaster-General - sent a circular letter to public bodies in the country, and, I presume, in the cities, invitin g them to state their troubles to the local inspectors.",59
348,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,-We have lieard nothing of it in the citv electorates.,60
349,Mr CARR,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Thes e public bodies are to l d , in effect, not to m in d their local ffiiember; that they may save time and trouble by going direct to the fountain of justice-the . local inspector. Whilst that may mean economy, it is opposed to the established principle of representative government. If . the local members are not wanted for this purpose-and I am certainly not looking-for work-the y will be more* despised than they are now in many quarters. Members of this Parliament are belittled quite enough without the Postmaster-General going out of his way to further belittle us. Whilst these permanent officers may give satisfaction for a time, they will ultimately become so seeiTre in their positions* and so independent of control, that the exercise of their powers will bea distinct menace to justice. We cannot depend on men, who are beyond the reach of authoritative control, to always do the right thing and to deal judicially with everything that comes-before them. It is absolutely necessary that the principle of representative government should be maintained; that the local people should know that their representative is always accessible, and that, if they cannot get satisfaction by a direct appeal, they may set the wheels of legislation in motion* through their member, and be heard on the floor of this House, if necessary with the weight of a party They behind their case. That system is more satisfactory than to leave these matters entirely to the caprice of a local officer. I do not think we can be too severe in our condemnation of such a principle as that to which I ' have alluded. There is another matter which has been brought under my notice by the secretary of the Telegraphists Association. Some years ago the Department introduced a, certain number of typewriters into the operating room. They were in use for a time, but the machines, being operated by all hands, soon became unworkable, and were cast aside. I do not understand much about I the mechanism of a typewriter, but I am told that it has something of a psychological character, and that if everybody bangs away at the machine it soon gets out of order. The Department recognised this fact, and arranged for the telegraphists to purchase their own machines, for which the Department would allow each officer £6 per annum as hire.. That system has been in operation for some time, but now comes this notice from the Postmaster-General's Department to a ll those telegraphists who are using their <rwn typewritersI n connection with tlic abolition of typewriter allowances, this Department is prepared to make you an - offer for the transfer of your machine under the following conditions:- The total life of a machine wdl maintained may lie taken as ten years. The Department can obtain new machines of n-suitable type at a cost of £14 <-ach, and, providing your machine is in good order and condition, is prepared to take it over at a valuation calculated as follows:Initial cost of machine, £14. That is the standard price assumed by the Department, regardless of what, the telegraphist may have paid for his machineLess four years' depreciation, at rate of .£1 Ss. per annum, calculated on the length of time your machine has been in use, £5 12s. Present value to Department, £8 Ss. If you accept this valuation, the - present scale allowance of 10s. per month will continue until the sum of £10 10s. is paid to you. This is indeed high finance; I never heard anything like it . An honourable member asks if I still say the officials are not business men. They can be business men without being absolute Jews. This is a Jewish proposition. To mention specific cases, one man has been offered £5 12s. for a machine for which he paid £30 some - time ago. Another man has been offered £ 8 8s. for what he paid .£20 10s. for two years ago; that man's case is certainly very hard.",60
350,Dr CARTY SALMON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Has the Department arranged to pay interest as well?,61
351,Mr CARR,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The Department undertook to rent the machines at 10s. per month, and I contend that the existing arrangement should not be disturbed u n t i l each machine is practically worn out. I realise that the hire cannot continue in definitely, but there should be a more equitable assessment than .is proposed. Another telegraphist was offered £10 10s. for a machine for which he paid £18 18s.; another man was offered £S 8s., and had paid £ 2 7 ; another is offered £7 14s., and had paid £ 2 2 ; another was offered £9 2s., and had paid .£22; another was offered £7, and had paid £22; another was offered £9 15s., and had paid £ 2 2 ; and another was offered £9 15s., and had paid £27. I admit that the length of .time that a machine has been in use is a factor to be taken into consideration, and in someinstances the arrangement may be practically fair, as in the following case : Initial cost of suitable machine, £14. Less eight years' depreciation, at the rateof £1 8s. per annum, calculated on the length of time your machine has been, in use, £11 4s. Present value to the Department, £2 16s. If you accept this valuation, the present scaleallowance of 10s. per month will continue until the sum of £2 16s. is paid to you. That relates to a machine for which the telegraphist paid £20 eight years ago. ",61
352,Mr CARR,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"It is an annulment of a contract without proper consideration toone of the parties. The Department made a deal, and is now backing out of it.. I do not say that the contract was a wise one in the first place, but after it has. been operating for a couple of years it is hard that a' man who has paid £ 2 0 for his machine should be compelled to take so much less for it . The former case is,, perhaps, not such a bad one as some of the others, as the man has been paid £ 6 per year for eight years, and therefore he has received £ 4 8 in respect of the rental of his machine. I admit that he has had 1 a fairl y good innings, but if a deduction had been made at the rate of 28s. per year to cover depreciation, without any account at all being taken of the sum paid for rent, the position would have been fairer. I have another instance where a man was similarly written to. The initial cost of his machine was put down at £ 1 4 . Two.and a half years' depreciation amounted to £3.10s., leaving the sum of £ 1 0 10s., the payment of which was offered at the rate of 10s. per month. This - man paid £ 2 7 for his machine twoand a half years ago. He has had the rental that he was entitled to during thisperiod, but yet he will not get his outlay back; and it is not fair that he should have to accept the sum the Government offer. When the Government, in the first instance, made a bargain, good or bad, they should stick to it ; but, in any case, surely a man isentitled to be paid in cash. Why does the Department want to put a levy like this upon its wage-earners? There is nohigh finance about matters of this kind, and I ask the Postmaster-General to 'see that these machines are at least taken at. bheir original valuation, less a fair sum for wear and tear. The sum of £ 1 8s. per year seems a fair thing for depreciat i o n ; but I think the Department should ignore altogether its rental payments o) 10s. per month when assessing the value of a machine.",61
353,Dr CARTYSALMON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Grampians) [11.0] - There are two matters of policy that I wish to say a word or two about. I am sorry to see the Postmaster-General bas issued orders which will have the effect of reducing the allowances paid to persons at the allowance offices-the people in the Postal Service who receive the smallest remuneration.,62
354,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,There is no reduction in the scale. No such order has been issued.,62
355,Dr CARTY SALMON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Then somebody is acting without authority. I have a letter dated 23rd June, in which it is stated that the sum to be paid in future will be much less than £ 2 8 .",62
356,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"They are being paid on the scale of business done. If the business goes down, that may account for reduction; but there has been no change prised. in the scale.",62
357,Dr CARTYSALMON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I want to ask the Postmaster-General whether he in regard to my district, at thinks at this period, when everybody suffering, and when his Government begging employers not to reduce their tracts last year, before there hands or their remuneration, that the Postal Department should act in this very bad way indeed. way and give people less than a living wage? It cannot be contended that £ 2 8 10s. per year is sufficient payment to fer is also a question of policy. these officers where premises are provided. In the case I refer to, it is not only post-office, but there is a telephone atif tached, and, in addition, the contractors, or whatever they may be, called, have had thrust upon them extra work in consent nexion with the revision of the rolls without any extra payment. Now they It was properly addressed. are being told that at the end of this month they will receive considerably than they have been getting up to the pay an account at the warehouse. present time.",62
358,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Perhaps the revenue is going down.,62
359,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,A great many others have got more.,62
360,Dr CARTYSALMON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"It may be that the revenue is decreasing, but does the Postmaster-General think that the sum of £ 2 8 10s. is enough for the Government to pay to any person who gives the use of his house, looks after the postal business, the telephone, and the revision of the rolls?",62
361,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Some are only getting £12.,62
362,Dr CARTY SALMON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,Then I say it is a shame.,62
363,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,It is for services rendered.,62
364,Dr CARTYSALMON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"I have heard the Postmaster-General and many of his friends argue that payment should not. always be limited to services rendered, but that there should be a minimum below which no one should be allowed to go, notwithstanding what the conditions are.",62

The other matter to which I wish to reHere the Department is seeking to shelter itself a behind the Postal Act, which provides that anything is 'lost within the Post Office the Department shall not be responsible for more than £ 2 . A constituent of mine a chenue by registered letter to one of the leading warehouses in Melbourne. The letter contained a cheque for £ 6 ls. 3d., which less was crossed, and which was intended to The money was not received, and inquiry was made. The Postal authorities said the letter had been delivered to a representative of the firm, that he had signed the book, and that was all about it , so far as they were concerned. Further inquiries, however, showed that the letter was delivered to some unauthorized person, that the cheque was cashed at a public house in Bourke-street, since when the man who cashed the cheque had not been seen. The Postal Department refuses any redress whatever to this person, who took every care to insure the safe delivery of the letter. Under the circumstances, I think the Postal Department is acting most unfairly i u sheltering behind an Act which protects them in a certain degree; and here, again, I appeal to the Postmaster-General personally not to refuse to pay to a person, from whom they have taken money for the safe delivery of a letter, an amount which I say they are in honour bound to return. I do not wish to attack the administration, but I do say that it is a remarkable thing that this should occur in the Melbourne General Post Office, where we have a box-room for letters delivered on behalf of those who pay a fee. More postmen would be necessary were it not for the number of people who pay fees to the Department for the privilege and the convenience of having their letters placed in private boxes, and surely the Department ought to exercise some care with respect to the delivery of r e -' gistered letters through that box system! In. this case a pink card was placed in the box belonging to this warehouse intimating that there was a registered letter which could be obtained on application ut the window. That is the ordinary practice, and it is a proper one. Registered letters addressed to this firm are collected from day to day, and sometimes three and four times a day, by a lad who is well known personally to the officials in the office where such letters are delivered;' but the Department employs a man who is so careless that in this case, although it was well known that a lad always called for the registered letters, he handed the letter to a man. It is known that the pink card was presented by a man of whom a description was supplied by an hotel keeper to the police, who made in quiries on behalf of the person who lost the money. The official on duty at the time knew that the person who applied was not the usual representative of the warehouse, and yet he handed over this registered letter to him. For all he knew it might have contained hundreds of pounds; but he made no inquiry as to the bona fides of the individual who signed the book. This I regard as gross carelessness. The Department is responsible for carelessness on the part of its employees, just as any other employer of labour should be, but although the matter has been under consideration 3ince last November, no satisfaction has been obtained. I received from the Deputy Postmaster-General a few days ago a letter intimating that, after full inquiries, it was found that no responsibility could be accepted by the Department. I am loath to move for a reduction of this item, in order to give the Committee an opportunity to direct the Postmaster-Genera! to pay the unfortunate woman who addressed this registered letter to the warehouse in question, but I am afraid I shall have to do so. As a matter of fact, the money was advanced to her by a relative to enable her to pay a trading account. She is compelled now to suffer the loss and to again pay the whole amount, owing to the most extraordinary method adopted by the Department in first of all sheltering itself behind an Act of Parliament, and secondly in employing persons who are so wanting in a proper sense of their responsibility that they will hand over a registered letter to any one who presents a card of the kind I have described. It has been said that this particular firm lost a key to their box some time before this incident occurred, and the idea is that the person who found it used it on this particular occasion. That explanation, to my mind, is a little too thin. Any one who had found the key, and had desired to use it , would have employed it more frequently. In such circumstances it is not likely that only a card relating to a registered letter would have been removed from the box. Since the loss of the key many unregistered letters containing money have been placed in the box; but all that has been taken from it is the card in question. In all these circumstances, I am surprised that the Department presided over by a Minister such as we have at the head of it at the present time, should shelter itself behind an Act of Parliament, and allow this unfortunate woman to lose her money in this way.",62
367,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The Minister will in quire into the matter, and see if he cannot do justice. .Dr CARTY SALMON - The Postmaster-General does .not seem to be inclined to favourably view my request. .I shall, therefore, ask the Committee to divide on the question. I appeal to honourable members to support me in urging that those who .send valuable articles through the post, and who take the precaution to register them, are entitled to the exercise of ordinary care by the Department, so that these articles may reach those to whom they are addressed.",63
368,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"The honourable member would not divide the Committee without an inquiry on the subject? .Dr CARTY SALMON - There have been months of inquiry, and I am tired of the delay. I move That the proposed vote be reduced by £1.",64
369,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Melbourne Ports) [11.11] - I should like to see justice done to the individual who sent the letter to which the honourable member for Grampians has just referred, but T do not think that I should be called upon to vote blindly for the amendment - If the fault rests with the Department, then, I think, a refund should be made; but I think an inquiry should be held. The incident referred to by the honourable member is not the only one that might be cited as showing the unbusiness-like methods of the Department. In my electorate the carriage of mails between the post-office and the railway station is conducted under the primitive system which was followed .sixty years ago. At South Melbourne and Port Melbourne every day at noon two young men may be seen pushing a hand-cart containing the mails from the post-office to the railway station, and returning with mails for inward delivery. At a certain time of the day, however, a motor car leaves the General Post Office for Port Melbourne, South Melbourne, and Windsor. Why that motor car is not used for all deliveries I do not know. If it were, then mails for my electorate could be cleared at the General Post Office later, md delivered at the suburban post-offices earlier than is now done. The ex-Postmaster General promised to consider this matter, but nothing has yet been done. If the Department cannot adopt up-to-date methods, there must be something wrong. I ask the Postmaster-General to take at - note of .my complaint and to deal with it. I wish now to :refer to one of the biggest miscarriages of justice that has ever taken place in connection with the Department. The present - postmaster 'at  years acted as Postmaster and Divisional Returning Officer at South Melbourne.. He is not a political friend of mine, since he is one of those nasty old Conservatives who vote against our party, so that I am not led to speak for him because of any political motive. I knew him for years as Postmaster and Divisional Returning Officer at South Melbourne, and can say that he was always most assiduous in the discharge of his duties. No-"" boss"" can always please his men, but  was at South Melbourne, will say that he carried out his work in . a way that was a credit to himself aiid to the two Departments which he served. A position became vacant at Geelong, and this officer applied for it. I may state that this new position would have given him £20 a year more; but, although he had only five years to go before the statutory age of retirement^ and had an unblemished record as a postmaster, he was passed over in favour of a man whowas earning £80 a year less. Of course, we know that under circumstances of the kind there are always complaints, but it docs seem peculiar that such a case as this should have arisen. It certainly offers noinducement to any officer to give - any special attention to his duties; aud 1 should certainly like the Postmaster-General to look into the matter. I believe that one of the reasons given is that this man is sixty years of age; but a reply to that is that, if he is not fit for the position at Geelong, he is not fit for Ms present .position. The Postmaster-General ought to see that grossly unfair action of that sort is not permitted in the Post Office in the future.",64
370,Mr SINCLAIR,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Moreton) [11.19] - I was very much hurt'on Friday at the contempt which was exhibited towards the Postmaster-General when he got up to make an explanation or ""mark time""whatever it might be. When a gentleman, is returned by a constituency, and then selected by his own party to fill an important Ministerial position, he ought,'at least, to command the respect of those - who sit behind.him. I think it was very unbecoming of members, of the Ministerial party to treat the honourable gentleman in the way they did . I regret very much that for quite a number of years there has been a huge loss on this Department; but, before putting any further burden, on those who use the telepnone or other agencies .of the Department, the Postmaster-General might look into the management'as a whole, and see if much of the waste cannot be avoided.",64
371,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"That has been done already, and a big saving ought to be effected.",65
372,Mr SINCLAIR,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Something has been done, but there is room for quite a number of improvements. For instance, I believe that the old system prevailed that where there is a revenue of £ 1 5 0 per annum a continuous telephone service is granted. The pubhc in country places do not require a continuous service, but an extended service. The Department has said r i g h t through, that a district must either take an eighthour service or a twenty-four hour service; and T believe that some, time ago tests were made in Queensland as to the number of calls between midnight and 6 o'clock or 9 o'clock in the morning, with the result that, over a period of some months, there was only one call. - call, I may say, was by some pressman on unimportant business. In smaller country towns I am sure that an extended service of twelve hours per day would be very much appreciated, and would relieve the congestion of the trunk lines, with the additional advantage of returning more revenue and saving expense in the matter of attendants. I hope that, whatever is done, the ground - rent for telephones will not be increased. have a cheap and good service in Australia , and if there is any deficiency it should be made up by increasing the rate per call, and not by increasing the ground rental. To many a private family a rental of £ 3 or £ 3 10s. is a good one; and is the large business firms, who are calling some one up every few minutes, that cause the extra expense. There is much room/ for improvement in the matter of the use of trunk lines. I can give an instance in the Laidley and Brisbane t r u nk lines; aud I have, myself, waited from an hour to an hour and a half in order to communicate with Brisbane. My own opinion is that . in all.country places* near to a city there, should be omnibuslines with exclusive use. A good deal, of the congestion on the t run k lineis. caused: by intermediate stations cutting in for hours and hours, and depriving the trunk, lines of the revenue which rightly belongs, to them. If the line I have mentioned, were in constant use. for eight hours, it would earn something like £ 1 4 per day; and yet we are told that such lines are not paying. I think that with a httle b it of management a great saving could be made. I think the: minimum chargesf o r calls are ridiculously low. It may, of course,, in some instances be regarded as a hardship that the users of telephones have to pay a little more; but I can assure the Postmaster-General that in quite a number of towns the peoplewould keenly appreciate the opportunity to use a telephone by paying doubleor three times the minimum amount. As to the rateof a penny for the first 15 mileSj I do not think it is worth whileswitching on that, distance for that sum. In most towns the residents are asked to. guarantee any deficiency; and-1 think the public will be quite willing to pay 2d. or 3d. a call. The telephones would pay if the Government would only depart from their present hard-and-fast rule. A good deal of revenue is lost in the way That I have indicated; but, as I have suggested-, a minimum of 3d. per call would not be regarded as unjust by the users of country telephones. In many instances the Department have dilly-dallied with contractors to whom they have owed money. They have kept them waiting from six to twelve months and have only come up to the mark when threatened with prosecution. As the Department is not short of money, when a We contract is completed it should be paid for. Not only does the Department delay in paying, it also retains the contractors' deposits; and as many contractors are men of moderate means-in fact, are poor men who have to live on what they get it from these small contracts-the y cannot afford to be kept out of deposit money, let alone contract payments. I hope that the Department will display more energy in regard to the construction of telephone lines for which sanction has already been given. Right throughout Australia there are men out of work, so that there can be no excuse advanced that men cannot be obtained, and as in many instances half, and even more than half, the cost of these lines has been contributed by the settlers, the Government should get a move on. If they have not the permanent staff to do the necessary work they should let contracts, or take on temporary hands, as they see fit; but, above all, they should get the work done, more particularly at a time when so many men are looking for work. There is no excuse on account of lack of labour, and there is no excuse on the ground that the money cannot be found, because, in the cases that I have mentioned, the money has already been voted by Parliament. I hope that the Minister will give a gentle hint to his omcers to see that this work is expedited'.",65
373,Mr SPENCE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS IN,"Darling-Postmaster General) [11.29] - As every honourable member knows, we are anxious to get these Estimates through, and as there is no opportunity to-night to reply to much that has been said in debate, I shall take the statements of honourable members out of Hansard and have every one of them carefully inquired into. I should like the honourable member for Grampians to withdraw his amendment. I shall have a full inquiry made into the matter. It certainly has not come up to the central office, so far as I know; but I cannot see that the oflicer could have done anything else when the card was presented to him. There is a great deal of carelessness on the part of box holders. In one month keys were left in boxes by twenty-four box holders, and twenty-seven boxes were lef t open. The Department cannot be charged with carelessness in that regard.",66
