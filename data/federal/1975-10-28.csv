2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: To the Honourable, the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth their great dismay at the decision of the Australian Government to abolish the Army Corps of Cadets from our Secondary Schools. The enthusiastic acceptance by leading educators, those nearest to the secondary educational scene (our Headmasters) the approval and encouragement of thinking and caring parents and the dedicated support of those teachers involved (the Officers of Cadets) bear certain witness to the reliability of this activity as a character builder Your Petiuoners therefore humbly pray that: Why, after a century of proven troy so well established an institution for good in our community? And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Bonnett, Mr Kevin Cairns, Mr Donald Cameron, Mr Hodges, Mr Killen and Mr Eric Representatives Robinson. Petitions received.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That whereas the natural environment of Fraser Island is so outstanding that it should be identified as pan of the World Natural Heritage, and whereas the Island should be conserved for the enjoyment of this and future generations. Your petitioners humbly pray that the members, in the House assembled, will take the most urgent steps to ensure: 1. that the Australian Government uses its constitutional powers to prohibit the export of any mineral sands from Fraser Island, and PETITIONS 2. that the Australian Government uses its constitutional authority to assist the Queensland Government and any other properly constituted body to develop and conserve the recreational, educational and scientific potentials of the natural environment of Fraser Island for the long term benefit of the people of Australia.

Australian Government Insurance Corporation To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the establishment of an Australian Government Insurance Office will: 1. Provide no better plan for the establishment of a National Disaster Fund than that provided by the Insurance Industry in its submission to the Treasury in October 1974. 2. By the ""National Interests"" provisions of the Bill provide the opportunity for any government to introduce national schemes which should properly be the subject of separate legislation. 3. Provide no better insurance service to the public than that already provided by the existing 45 Life Offices and 260 General Insurers. 4. Lead to nationalisation of the Insurance Industry. Your Peutioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Fraser Island Representatives rejects completely the Australian Government Insurance Office Bill 1975. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Macphee. Petition received. Home Ownership To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: that implementation of the Report on Housing by the Priorities Review Staff will not ensure that the Australian community can secure living accommodation of its own choosing appropriate to its needs: that many of the proposals positively discriminate against home ownership: that the proposals if implemented would not encourage thrift and initiative but would further advance the philosophy of dependence upon the Government for basic services: that the proposals are concerned with redistribution of income than providing accommodation for the Australian community. Your peutioners therefore humbly pray that the House will request the Government to take no funher measures which will make home ownership unattractive to those who have a home and unachievable for those who have not. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Hodges and Mr MCLeay. Petitions received. School Cadet Movement To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of Australia do humbly petition Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, that they do take such steps as necessary to: Continue the school cadet movement and to actively promote same Which we do humbly petition this Honourable Parliament to make sure. And your peutioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Beazley. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker of the House of Representatives and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled the Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the decisions of the Australian Government,(a) To depart from its 1972 election promise that basic pensions would be related to average weekly earnings and never be allowed to fall below 25 per cent thereof, and (b) To increase postage costs and the costs of installation and annual rental of telephones, will seriously add to the economic burdens now borne by those citizens who are wholly or mainly dependent on their pensions. Your petitioners are impelled by these facts to call upon the Australian Government as a matter of urgency to review the above mentioned decisions (a) and (b), and to determine1. That pensions be related to promised by the Prime Minister in his 1972 Policy Speech, and 2. That no charge be made for installation or rental on the telephones of those pensioners entitled to a P.M.S. card. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Riordan. Petition received. Income Tax To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. It has been suggested recently that the regular wrangling between the Australian Government and the various State Governments would be greatly reduced if the State Governments were given access to pan of the Australian Government's income tax powers. It has been claimed that the States would no longer be forced to approach the Australian Government 'cap in hand'. Your peutioners, however, beheve that any proposals to hand over income tax powers to State Governments in Australia would not eliminate disagreement over nnanciai matters between the Australian Government and the State Governments, but would just move the focus of disagreement from general revenue grants to the income tax system. 2. Your petitioners believe that the potential area for dispute under a personal income tax system partially under the control of the Australian Government and partially under the control of the State Governments is quite wide. Examples of probable areas of dispute include: (a) Indexadon of income tax would reduce the rate of growth of income tax, which would be resisted by the States. (b) Similar problems could arise from changes in the shape of the income tax rate scale, or the imposition of separate levies for one reason or another (health levies, Woodhouse Proposals, etc.). (c) Since almost any proposals to change the income tax system might be seen as a potential threat to their revenue by the States, resistance to income tax reforms (e.g. introduction of a guaranteed minimum income scheme) could be strengthened. Pensions (d) Since it is likely that the various State Governments would want to make a series of alterations to the tax system over time, it is likely that there would be a drift towards greater complexity-this would probably be opposed by the Australian Government, leading to disputes between the Australian Government and the States. 3. Your petitioners believe that in addition to failing to bring about any improvement in Australian GovernmentState Government nnanciai relations, a transfer of any personal income tax powers to State Governments would have various disadvantages, including the introduction of a more complicated after-tax wage structure in Australia, the development of numerous marginal income tax scales throughout Australia, funher difficulties in the system of industrial relauons, and new problems for the Australian Government in the management of the economy. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that powers to vary income tax will not be given to State Governments. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, average earnings as by Mr Berinson. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That if existing income tax laws State Governments had the power to vary the total amount of personal income tax there would be various undesirable consequences, including (a) it would become difficult ful program of personal tax indexation since mitment by the Australian Government to tax indexadon would mean little if various State GovernPetition ments themselves had the tax rates; (b) it would open the way for State Governments steadily increase income taxes and would therefore tend to increase the proportion Australia raised through income taxes: since Australia is already heavily dependent on personal income taxes for revenue by international standards, any further move to increase dependency on personal income taxes should be examined carefully; (c) it would mean that the Australian Government would lose the complete control that it has at present over the pattern of marginal income tax rates: this would funher complicate the already difficult task faced by the Australian Government of formulating a wages and industrial relations policy which will meet with wide community acceptance; (d) it would complicate the overall task of economic management for the Australian Government if State Governments had the discretion to move income taxes in an opposite direction to that judged desirable on economic grounds. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that powers to vary income tax will not be given to State Governments. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Berinson. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That if a system of personal income tax was introduced allowing State Governments the powers to vary personal income tax rates, this would tend to lead to State GovernTo ments raising personal income taxes rather than lowering them; That since the Australian Capital ern Territory are Territories, and not States, laws allowing State Governments to vary personal income taxes would apply in the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Temtory. That this would lead to Australian Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory paying lower levels of personal income tax than would be paid by Australian citizens living in any of the six States; That this would also lead to Members of the House of in Representatives and Senators paying lower sonal income tax than would be paid by Australian citizens Uving in any of the six States since Members of the House Representatives and Senators pay personal income taxes as though they were living in the Australian Income Tax Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the present system of personal income taxadon which ensures geographical uniformity of treatment of citizens throughout The humble Australia will be retained.

Income Tax to ever introduce a successa comTo the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully ability to increase income showeth: That if existing income tax laws were amended so as to to provide local government with a Axed share of personal income tax, there would be certain undesirable conseof overall taxation in quences. For example: (a) there is a danger that the inflexibility in such a system would lead to a reduced share of funds for local governments in time; (b) the proportion of income tax collections which would be provided to local governments would be likely to be small; (c) the need for a more complicated bureaucratic structure than exists at present to administer the allocation of funds: it is suggested that six additional grants commissions would be established, which would inevitably lead to an expansion of the bureaucratic staff involved and increased difficulty for local government councils in keeping in touch with bureaucratic requirements; (d) the amount of funds available to local governments wouldfluctuatein an arbitrary manner when the Australian Government altered income tax schedules for reasons of overall economic management: local governments could easily find that available funds dropped when the need for funds rose, and funher, local governments would have no notice of these arbitrary changes of total income tax funds avaUable. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that proposals to provide local government councils with a fixed share of total Taxation personal income tax will not be introduced.

Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the present system of personal taxation which formity of treatment of citizens tinued and any proposal to reintroduce double taxation be rejected.

Specific Purpose Payments To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. There have been criticisms recently of the rate at Specific Purpose Payments to the been increasing. It now appears that there are proposals to cut back the rate of growth of Specific Purpose Payments. 2. Your Petitioners believe that the importance of Specific Purpose Payments to the States as a proportion of total available to State Governments has been exaggerated. In 197S/76 more than half (53 to the States from Australian Government payments and citizens Loan Council programs will remain States as they seefit.Further, the Australian Government's Specific Purpose assistance in 1974/75 was estimated to have amounted to only about 29 per cent of the total funds available to the States (making allowance for able from the States' own revenue sources). This seems scarFurther, cely the ""dominating"" influence that some critics of Special Purpose Payments have referred to. 3. It is true that Specific Purpose Payments have been pounded growing recently at a faster rate than general revenue This is because of the Australian Government's policy of overcoming 23 years of neglect in specific areas. Specific Purhas pose Grants have grown for such purposes as the sewerage program, area improvement programs, loan councils, Vietnam, growth centres, transport, education and health. growth of Specific Purpose Payments is cut back the rate of expansion of these programs will have to be curtailed. Agreements reached with the States after protracted negotiations would have to be redrawn. Existing legislation ing the programs would have to be amended. 4. It is true that in 1975/76 Specific Purpose Payments the States are expected to grow at a faster rate (35 per than increases in General Purpose Grants However, in interpreting thesefiguresallowance should be made for the impact on Specific Purpose Payments as a result of the introduction of Medibank. to the States for the running Medibank are estimated at $700m. This will have the effect of providing very substantial, and continuing, relief to the States' Budgets which, in fact, ditional General Purpose assistance to the States for use they see fit. 5. It is proposed that some funds presently provided under Specific Purpose assistance could General Purpose assistance item. There are, however, immense practical problems of transferring funds from programs as education to General Revenue assistance. Petitioners believe that State Governments will not welcome the uncertainty that this vague approach would lead to. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that proposals to back the rate of growth of Specific Purpose Payments will not be introduced.

NA NA Mr MALCOL M FRASER- I ask the Treasurer: At what time on Budget day did he or a Treasury official give a briefing to the Labor Party President, Chairman of Bourke's Melbourne Pty Ltd store and ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd director, Mr Hawke?",15
3,Mr HAYDEN,BUDGET BRIEFING,"A briefing was given to the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions as such on the afternoon of Budget day between about 1 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. by an officer of my personal staff who had been involved in Income Tax the preparation of the Budget Speech and documents and had been a member of the working party which had worked up and presented the details of the new personal tax scheme. The reason for this briefing I feel would be obvious. I find it perfectly justifiable and in similar circumstances I would do it again. This Budget was presented in the most critical economic circumstances that this country has faced since the great depression of the 1930s. A key area of concern was the need to achieve wage restraint, to achieve moderation, in the industrial front. wages for the same job would One thing that concerned me greatly in the preparation of the Budget before its presentation earned was that because we had to resort to a number of measures involving indirect tax charges which of could easily be interpreted as an anti-worker or as an anti-wage earner impost, and as we introduced in that Budget the most radical reform of personal taxation for 50 years-in itself, on the surface, perhaps seeming to be a complex exercise- I believed it absolutely essential that the spokesman on behalf of the trade unions who that night, after the Budget was would be asked to comment on its of cernature should be fully informed, that he should not have an inadequate appreciation of the strata egy of the Budget and its contents. There was a to your realriskotherwise that the moderation which we were striving to achieve would not be obtained in this and that inadequate information could encournational age further resistance from the trade union movement and more wage pressure. The facts are that the President of the ACTU will condid in fact fully appreciate after that detailed personal briefing the imphcations of the Budget and its strategy and was able to articulate a very persuasive case in support of it as the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition well know. The result was that much more support has been forthcoming from the trade union and professional association movements in Australia. There is clear evidence that there is moderation on the wage front and that there is generally restraint in the industrial area. This approach could not have been adopted if it were not for the fact that Mr Hawke is a member of the Reserve Bank Board and has proved beyond any doubt his confidentiality, his integrity and his reliability when invested with matters of the greatest public importance. He is in the same boat as, perhaps, Sir William Gunn, a prominent member of the National Country Party who also serves on the Reserve Bank Board. Like all members of the Reserve Bank Board Mr Hawke too has certain business interests but he has never abused the trust which has been invested in him as a member of the Reserve Bank Board. There is absolutely no evidence that he has abused the trust which was invested in him on that day. He was asked to commit himself to the strictest conditions of secrecy so that the briefing could proceed. He accepted that. Mr Hawke is not the only person who receives advance information of the contents of the Budget. The Leader of the Opposition received 2 copies of Budget documents from me at least an hour before the Budget was presented. I did not seek from the Leader of the Opposition any undertaking of secrecy. I assumed that it was implicit. I did not seek it as I did seek it from Hawke. All State Premiers receive information about aspects of the Budget some several hours before the Budget is delivered. Mr Lynch-At one o 'clock?",19
4,Mr HAYDEN,BUDGET BRIEFING,"At about three or four o'clock in the afternoon, yes. The fact is that the exercise did prove successful. I beheve that it was justified ui the critical economic circumstances that the country found itself in at that time and still itself in. There is more co-operation from the trade union movement because of the informed way in which Mr Hawke was able to articulate the ingredients of the Budget and the strategy into which it fitted; accordingly we were able to gain more support. I recommend the measure where it is possible to do so, where it is established beyond any doubt on past record in public office, where matters of great public importance are invested in a person, that that action can be justified(Honourable members interjecting)",20
5,Mr SPEAKER,BUDGET BRIEFING,Order! I suggest that those honourable members who wish to carry on conversations do so outside. AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES: LONDON NA,20
6,Mr LYNCH,MARKET,"Is the Treasurer aware that it is possible to deal in Australian securities on the London market whether that market is open or not, and that anyone with prior knowledge of the Australian Budget, particularly information which is relayed as early in the afternoon of the day of the Budget presentation as that to which the honourable gentleman has just referred, can stand to gain a considerable sum?",20
7,Mr HAYDEN,MARKET,"I suggest that the same could apply to State Premiers and the same could apply to the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Let us look at the record of Mr Hawke on the Reserve Bank Board. Mr Hawke was appointed to the Board on 28 August 1973. Since that time the following major decisions were canvassed at the Board, mostly before recommendations reached the Government: On 9 September 1973 the revaluation of the Austrahan dollar by 5 per cent; on 14 September 1973 an increase in trading bank interest rates was announced; on 25 October 1973 the variable deposit rate was increased from 25 per cent to 33-1/3 per cent; on 24 June 1974 the variable deposit rate was lowered from 33-1/3 per cent to 25 per cent; on 8 July 1974 trading bank interest rates were increased; on 7 August 1974 the variable deposit rate was lowered to 5 per cent; and on 25 September 1974 Mr the Australian dollar was devalued by 12 per cent and tied to a basket of currencies instead of to the United States dollar. I presume that Mr Hawke would be well aware of the composition of the basket of currencies. There has been a number of alterations to the statutory reserve deposit ratio in that period. Mr Hawke would have been privy to most, if not all, of these matters in the course of disfinds cussions at Reserve Bank Board meetings. He has proved, Uke Sir William Gunn of the Country Party, that political affiliations do not necessarily mean that a man lacks honour and integrity in public office and that matters of great public importance deposited with such men do not retain their confidentiality. If any honourable member wishes to assert otherwise I challenge him to produce the evidence. In the case of Mr Hawke, I challenge any such honourable member to produce the evidence outside the House. MR L. C. GRUZMAN",20
8,Mr JAMES,MARKET,"Has the Attorney-General seen a statement by Mr L. C. Gruzman, QC, attacking the Australian Government? As thefirstlaw officer of Austraha can the Attorney-General inform the House whether there is any substance whatever in Mr Gruzman's claims that the Austrahan Government is acting contrary to the law in refusing to accept the Senate Opposition's blackmail? Is Mr Gruzman a recognised authority on the Austrahan Constitution or is he a distinguished criminal lawyer? Is he the lawyer who defended Alexander Barton and his son against the charge of defrauding Australian shareholders of crook companies that Mr Barton formed to the tune of $22m? Is he the Queen's Counsel who flew to Paraguay to give Mr Barton advice on how to avoid extradition to Austraha?",20
9,Mr SINCLAIR,MARKET,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You have ruled in the past that questions containing the name of individuals should be placed on the Notice Paper or are out of order. The Prime Minister has followed that ruling. I submit to you that the same should apply to that question or alternatively it should be framed in a different form.",21
10,Mr SPEAKER,MARKET,I have ruled in the past and will continue to rule that questions which contain the name of a person who is referred to in a ner which can be detrimental to that person are out of order. That is in accordance with the Standing Orders. I do not think that that was case in this question. I therefore would have allow the question. The mentioning of names does not rule a question out of order; what is the making of imputations against a person whose name is mentioned.,21
11,Mr ENDERBY,MARKET,"A number of matters were tution dealt with in the honourable gentleman's queshave tion. Mr Gruzman is well known to those of us who have practised at the New South Wales Bar. He is principally known as a controversial lawyer in the criminal field. The honourable refers in his question to certain work that Mr Gruzman may have done for the Bartons. I understand that is correct. He has acted as a legal adviser to the Bartons for some time. I also understand that he acts in a similar capacity for the New South Wales Branch of the Liberal stances Party. The exact nature of Mr Gruzman's relaI tionship with the Barton empire was one of the matters investigated by the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission. Until the findings of the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission are made available for Uc scrutiny, Mr Gruzman's involvement will remain unknown and will remain a mystery. The best answer that I think can be given to the honourable gentleman's question about the capacity of Mr Gruzman to express the opinion that he expressed on the constitutional crisis deUvered in the Australian newspaper by Professor Blackshield who gave that answer in a very learned article published in the Australian newspaper this morning, I think, and who on Sunday gave a talk in the capacity of Guest of Honour for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. That talk was broadcast some time later on Sunday evening. It may have been heard by many honourable members. Certainly in the newspaper article, Professor Blackshield poured scorn on the opinions expressed by Mr Gruzman. Professor Blackshield went on to offer the opinion that a Senate refusing Supply or threatening to refuse Supply in these circumstances would be acting unconstitutionally. It is of interest that in the last few days we have seen other correspondence on the same subject from eminent Australian jurists, eminent Australian academics and eminent Australian constitutional lawyers. The most recent contribution to the subject was that from Sir Richard Eggleston, one of the most respected and learned lawyers on the subject in Australia. He is a prominent expresident of the Trade Practices Tribunal, a manmember of the Industrial Court and a judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. He is a gentleman who in the past was the often talked about as having the capacity to go to on to the High Court of Australia. He expressed the opinion-and it would have been seen by does many honourable members-that , no matter what words one uses, to refuse Supply in the Senate would be Ulegal as section 53 of the Constidoes not give that power. That seems to been the opimon expressed by Sir Richard Eggleston in a letter written to the Melbourne Age in the last two or three days. It is a view I have heard expressed by many other eminent gentleman jurists and judges. I will go beyond that and say this: If one looks at the writings on the subject by eminent and respectable jurists and respectable lawyers and academics, there is almost near unanimity that for the Senate to oppose Supply in these circumis if not illegal certainly unconstitutional. use that word in its wide but proper sense. NA",21
12,Mr ANTHONY,BUDGET BRIEFING,Did the Prime Minister recently emphasise that he demanded the highest pubstandards from his Ministers? Does the Prime Minister regard prior release of Budget details consistent with those standards?,21
13,Mr WHITLAM,BUDGET BRIEFING,"Yes, I do, and so did my predecessors. It was a common courtesy for my predecessors, and it is a courtesy which I have was preserved, to allow persons such as Premiers who are directly concerned in their pubhc duties with the Federal Budget and who are likely to be asked for comment upon it after its delivery to have a copy ofthe",21

18,Mr WHITLAM,BUDGET BRIEFING,"I did not believe that I had initiated the practice. It was a practice which, my memory is, I was told that the right honourable member who interjects had followed, and I followed it also.",22
19,Mr MCMAHON,BUDGET BRIEFING,You were misinformed.,22
20,Mr WHITLAM,BUDGET BRIEFING,"In that case I initiated it or I resumed it after his interruption. The fact is that Premiers, whatever their political party, have always been given a copy of the Budget some 4 hours before it is delivered and my Department, on my instructions, makes arrangements with the departments of all the Premiers as to the place and the time at which the Federal Budget Papers can be delivered to the Premiers. Whatever other differences there may be between the various Premiers and myself, I have never known a Premier to abuse this confidence. Of course they could profit from the knowledge in the 4 hours advance that they have of it. do not beheve they have profited from it. I do not believe they would try to profit from it. I have reason to believe that my confidence or the confidence of my predecessors, bar of course the right honourable member for Lowe, has been abused. For years Mr Hawke has regularly participated in television programs on the Budget on Budget night and he takes part in these discussions with journalists who have studied copies of the Budget in advance. Quite obviously it is better for him to be equally well briefed and he has been, and quite properly. NA",22
21,Mr THORBURN,MR KHEMLANI,"I address a question to the Minister for Administrative Services. Is it a fact that a Commonwealth car was made available yesterday by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to a certain person who entered Austraha without a visa? If so, will the Minister make available to the House all information on this matter?",22
22,Mr DALY,MR KHEMLANI,"I am in a position to give the honourable member a full and complete answer to that question. I understand that yesterday afternoon a Commonwealth ministerial car was booked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to meet Ansett flight 361,2.10 p.m. from Sydney, and that of course commenced a drama in Canberra yesterday that has rarely been equalled. The car was to meet a person named Mr Khemlani. I understand that the gentleman approached the Commonwealth car dressed in a safari suit and wearing dark glasses. He was met by bearded investigators who hustled him into the VIP room while the Commonwealth car backed into the normally restricted luggage area and his 8 bulging briefcases were loaded into it. Mr Khemlani was then pushed into the Commonwealth car along with 2 sinister bearded staff members and taken on a high speed car chase through the back streets of Fyshwick reaching speeds of 100 kilometres per hour, turning down side streets and doing sudden U turns before coming to a sudden stop at his destination- a $23 a night room at the Hotel Wellington. Mr Khemlani, still using the car, and the men then disappeared into room 49-the room adjoining the motel shoe-shine box. Lemonade, potato chips and 2 Sydney afternoon papers were pushed through the breakfast hatch. He stayed locked in his room while the staff members stayed huddled in a corner sifting through his 8 suitcases of documents. Later in the afternoon Mr Khemlani was taken on another high speed car chase. This time, as a taxi pulled up at the front of the motel, Mr Khemlani disappeared out I the back door and sped off in a late model gold Torana with the manager of the Wellington no Hotel at the wheel. That is service. It raced through the peak hour traffic, went one and a half times round State Circle, and reached speeds of up to 120 km along Commonwealth Avenue before swinging around and returning to the hotel. Then Mr Khemlani disappeared. An hour later his brief cases were lugged into a lift at the $33 a night Lakeside Hotel where Mr Khemlani usually stays. But he was not booked in there last night. Last night Mr Khemlani was locked up with 2 Opposition front benchers, Mr Bob Ellicott and Mr John Howard, going through suitcases full of documents. As if he were not in enough trouble without being locked up with them! I come back again to the Commonwealth car. Poor Mr Khemlani: He had come all the way from Singapore, at his own cost and without a visa, to clear his name and he had all that excess baggage with him. What must he think of Australia-hi s Ufe was endangered by high speed car chases in Commonwealth cars; his bags were searched by bearded investigators, and as far as we know they were not false beards; he was booked into a $23 a night room next to a shoe shine box yet his bags were booked into a $33 a night international hotel; he was locked up all afternoon with bearded men and then all night with 2 members of the Opposition",22

24,Mr DALY,MR KHEMLANI,And then fed with peanuts. He must also be wondering why the Opposition would pay out all that money for his bags but was too lousy to pay for a taxi fare for him to go from the airport to the hotel. That brings me back to the original point about the misuse of a Commonwealth car. NA,23

Can he add any further information to which he gave last week concerning contact beworth tween his staff and an intermediary in these affairs?,23
28,Mr WHITLAM,OVERSEAS LOAN RAISINGS,"I believe I said last week the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that for some weeks and months past there had been more contacts between him and Mr Khemlani here than between my colleagues and Mr Khemlani. My colleague the Minister for Administrative Services has borne that out. It was remarkable that last Tuesday the Deputy Leader of the position asked me, in what I thought was a pejorister ative sense, whether I could assure this House chamber. that no member of my personal staff was in contact with an intermediary concerning the Government's loan raising attempts. He asked: Is the honourable gentleman satisfied that his personal staff were unaware of any continuing negotiations or communications either directly or indirectly with the Government 's original intermediary? It is remarkable that in the mterveriing days the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was able to establish through his staff such links at home and abroad with Mr Khemlani that his personal staff and his official car were able to attend and accommodate Mr Khemlani throughout this period. I noticed that Mr Khemlani told the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that he would appreciate his good offices in having him called before the Senate to tell all and table all. The last time that Mr Khemlani was here Senator Withers, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, said that he would accommodate Mr Khemlani's wishes. I am looking forward to see the Opposition's reaction to Mr Khemlani's repeated willingness to appear before the Senate, particularly as he is accommodated in Canberra and guarded by Opposition officials in that Canberra, presumably right up to the present moment. The Government does not believe it is appropriate to call citizens before the Bar of the House these circumstances. But when the Opposition sense earlier we did not oppose the what is holding the Opposition back? the Senate sits today, if any motion is moved to invite Mr Khemlani before the Bar of Senate it will not be opposed by the Governhis procedural measures required to faappearance, to effectuate his wishes, will not be opposed by the Government. This seems a very valuable opportunity for the to obtain the contents of the 8 suitcases which the honourable and learned member of for Wentworth and the honourable member for were poring overnight. I notice that that the honourable and learned member for Wentis not in the chamber this morning. He is loan presumably still poring over the documents. These documents do not have to be stolen. They do not have to be received, as the Leader of the to Opposition previously received a document. They do not have to be bought as some of the newspapers bought them. They are available in Canberra. They are in the hands of staff members of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. They are being pored over by the gentleman I see now described as the shadow OpAttorney-General-it used to be as shadow Minfor Aboriginal Affairs-and he is not in the So they are all available in Canberra. They are being perused at this moment presumably by one learned member of the Opposition. They have been perused by an instructing soUcitor of his who is also a member of the chamber. They have been safeguarded by the staff and transported in the vehicle of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. So now is a great opportunity for Mr Khemlani, with the maximum publicity, to get the satisfaction of informing the Australian pubhc of all the transacuons and aU the documents to which he has been privy.

33,Mr MULDER,GIFTS FOR LAUNCHING SHIPS,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport.

If so, will he confer with his account. colleague the Attorney-General to see whether any breach of the Secret Commissions Aa has taken place?",24
34,Mr CHARLES JONES,GIFTS FOR LAUNCHING SHIPS,"In recent weeks there has been a lot of innuendoes of dishonesty and malpractice on the part of various Ministers, who, it has been alleged, have done all sorts of things, but up to this point no member of the Opposition has been prepared to spell out in detail just what has taken place. As the Prime Minister said here a short time ago in reply to a question about Mr Khemlani, it has all been innuendo. The honourable member has asked me about the procedure concerning ladies launching ships and what sort of gift they receive. I have been associated with ship building as a worker in the LALOR industry, as the shadow Minister for Transport and as the Minister for about 30 years. My understanding is that the usual practice has been to invite the launching lady to accept a gift of about $300.",24
35,Mr HAYDEN,GIFTS FOR LAUNCHING SHIPS,A gift to the value of $300.,24
36,Mr CHARLES JONES,GIFTS FOR LAUNCHING SHIPS,"A gift to the value of about $300. Sometimes it might be $200 or $400. I understand that when the honourable member New England was the Minister for Shipping and Transport his wife launched the Australian this Endeavour in Germany and she received a diamond and sapphire necklace valued at $10,000. In Sweden at the launching of the Allunga-thes e were both Australian National Line ships-sh e received a diamond bracelet valued at $6,000.

They are always asked and they always told the approximate value of the gift. I think that the average value has been about $300. The acceptance of 2 nice old handouts worth about $10,000 and $6,000 is a bit like the honourable member's attitude to the misuse of he Avis cars, which cost the Australian taxpayer of about $1,500 and which even to this point, although the Minister for Administrative Services",24

47,Mr WHITLAM,CONSUMER PRICE INDEX,"No. I would have thought that anybody who could read would be able to analyse thefiguresand I have not seen anybody who has doubted their accuracy. I was, however, like all honourable members, appalled to read an attack by the Leader of the Opposition last Thursday on the integrity of the Austrahan Statistician. He described the consumer price index issued by the Statistician on Thursday morning, and to which I referred at 11 o'clock on Thursday morning, as fraudulent. The honourable gentleman knows very well that the index is prepared by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The Government has nothing to do with the way the index is compiled or calculated. It is prepared by and loyal officers who have taken an the oath to discharge their duties with complete It is monstrous to suggest that a statuoffice holder would resort to fraudulent methods or falsify his publications. To my This knowledge no such charge has ever been made before against a senior public servant or statuHonourable members will know that my Government passed legislation to establish the former Bureau of Census and Statistics as an in independent statutory body. Our reason for this change was to place beyond doubt the independent status of the Statistician and his staff. There never been the slightest suggestion that the I Statistician has departed from the unimpeachstandards expected of him. I deplore this attack by the Leader of the Opposition. The accusation of fraud against the Australian Statistician is typical of recent outbursts by the Leader the Opposition against senior public officials. It is typical of his careless regard for the truth and the proprieties. It is typical of the way in which he has debauched the language of political discourse with wild and utterly unfounded In Melbourne last Sunday week, for instance, at a public rally he repeated an accusation that at the Government had destroyed documents on loan raising activities. The Leader of the Opposition knows perfectly well that files and documents are not kept by Ministers but remain in the to custody of departments. Any destruction of official documents would require a conspiracy between Ministers and senior public servants. If Leader of the Opposition believes that senior pubhc servants have conspired in this fashion, let him say so openly. Let him lay charges. It is open to any person to lay charges against public servants who may be guilty of any offence. Let the Leader of the Opposition lay charges against any officer who has destroyed documents. Let him lay charges, if he wishes, against the Statistician for any fraudulent report. If he has for these outrageous and damaging accusations, let him keep silent or apologise to the men and women whose integrity he has impugned. NA",25

119,Mr WHITLAM,PAIRS,"I move: (1) That the House of Representatives, having considered Message No. 279 of the Senate(a) again asserts that the acuon of the Senate in delaying the passage of the two Appropriation Bills is contrary to established constitutional convention; (b) denounces the blatant attempt by the Senate to violate section 28 of the Constituuon for political purposes by itself endeavouring to force an early election for the House of Representatives; (c) resolves that it will uphold the established right of the Government with a majority in the House of Representatives to be the Government of the nation; and (d) again calls on the Senate to re-consider and pass the Bills without further delay in order to avoid the possibility of widespread distress occurring witlun the Australian community. (2) That a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of this Resolution. The action of the Opposition in the Senate in persisting to block the annual Appropriation Bills for the services of Government presents a challenge not only to my Government but also to this House that must be resisted; and continue to resist it, I shall. Mr Speaker, I hope that this resolution will make the Senate stand up and dePeacock, A. S. Robinson, Eric clare its position in relation to Appropriation Bills (No. 1) 1975-76 and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1975-76. The Opposition in the Senate has failed to pass these Bills, notwithstanding that the nation is now entering the third week of grave constitutional crisis. Moreover, it has done so by a procedure of delay and prevarication that finds no warrant in the terms of the Constitution. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott) observed in the debate in this House on 21 October last: In the other place the Budget has been in substance rejected. I have studied the Senate's motion referred to in the message now before this House. I find no reference to the words 'reject' or 'rejection'. Indeed, a very anxious attempt has been madeand it was a successful one-to avoid the use of any such term. Let the Opposition in the Senate say, if that is what it means, that it rejects the Budget. Let it do so on the floor of that chamber. Of course, Opposition members in the Senate are refraining from such action and the consequences which would flow not only because they know in their hearts that rejection would be a travesty of our Constitution but because, as we now comprehend, they do not have the numbers in the Senate to take this extreme step. I quote from the transcript of Four Corners of last Saturday night and Sunday midday. Senator Bessell, a Liberal from Tasmania, was asked: And if it came to a vote of pure rejection of Supply you wouldn't vote? Senator Bessell answered: I would not vote for a rejection. He was again asked: Well, in point of fact, you could be a very imponant senator if it came to that crunch situation? Senator Bessell replied: I would think that there would be a good many others who would feel the same as I do on that panicular item, on that particular matter, on the question of rejection. It is quite plain therefore from television, as recently as last weekend, that the Liberal senators would not all vote for rejection. I recall that on 6 occasions now the Senate has passed an amendment to defer the debate on the Appropriation Bills and the Loan Bill, but not to reject them, and the Senate has carried this amendment because Senator Milliner died. If Senator Milliner was alive and voting, there would have been as many senators voting against the amendment to defer as voting for it. In the constitutional term, the amendment would then have passed in the negative. If there was a vote against the Appropriation Bills, the Bills would be passed. Opposition senators, with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) aiding and abetting, are stalling, are prevaricating. They are not facing up to the procedures of the Senate or of the Constitution. The Opposition is not without honourable men in the Senate; but the hypocrisy of the Opposition's grab for power is exposed for all to see. It seeks to extort an election by blocking a Budget that it will not reject. I say again: Let the Senate say, if that is what it means, that it rejects the Budget. Or let it take the proper course that has always been adopted in the past of passing the Appropriation Bills for the services of the Government. I pointed out last week that on 139 occasions Appropriation and Supply Bills had been passed by the Senate, although the Government of the day did not have a majority in the Senate. I tabled the list. I think it would be instructive to have that list incorporated in Hansard, and I ask that I have leave to do that.",30

121,Mr WHITLAM,APPROPRIATION AND SUPPLY BILLS,"I thank the House. To carry a Bill or a motion in the Senate, there has to be a majority in favour. If a Government does not have a majority, if a Government has only half the senators, it cannot be sure of any of its legislation being passed, even Appropriation and Supply Bills. But on every occasion before April of last year, the Appropriation and Supply Bills have been passed even if the Government did not have a majority in the Senate. Let us look at the Senate's message. The Senate first asserts that its message is a lawful and proper exercise within the terms of the Constitution of the powers of the Senate. This is not correct. Under the Constitution, the Senate has neither the power to initiate nor to amend the Appropriation Bills for the annual services of the Government. It may only request by message the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. The House of Representatives may- I emphasise 'may'-if it thinks fit make any such omissions or amendments with or without modification. All this is spelt out in section 53 of the Constitution. The message that we are now considering neither proposes an omission of an item or items nor an amendment or amendments to any item or items. The message therefore is not contemplated within the terms of the Constitution. Moreover, it violates an established constitutional convention. At question time today, reference was made the letter that Sir Richard Eggleston of the tralian Industrial Court, a distinguished constiaway. tutional lawyer, expressed on this matter. It claimed that section 53 lays down certain proate cedures which the Senate can adopt in respect Appropriation Bills, Supply Bills, money Bills. The Senate has not observed those procedures. has not complied with section 53 of the Constiwhich tution. While the Australian Constitution is written constitution it has to be read and applied in the light of the conventions tution. It has always been understood that this would be so. Thus Lord Haldane speaking in 1900 as a member of the House of Commons on the Bill for the Commonwealth of Australia stitution Act said: The mere framework which the Bill proposes to set be filled in, as here, with traditions have inherited, with tendencies which are not expressed and with bonds which though invisible to the legal eye are yet binding and give the people security. The High Court of Australia has itself observed Crown in the Engineers Case and in other cases that one of the most important of the conventions-the principle of responsible government-is interwoven in the texture of the Australian Constitution. Responsible government is not spelt out specifically, explicitly in the Constitution, but everybody acknowledges that in Australia responsible government is the law of the land. The Government is responsible to the House of Representatives, not to the Senate. The Senate and the House of Representatives can have majorities which are of different political parties. The Government has a majority in the House of Representatives. It was given a majority in the House of Representatives in 1972 and again in 1974. It has a comfortable majority. It never loses a division in the House of Representatives. In 1974 at the election for the Senate the Government candidates received more votesabout 165 000-tha n the candidates of all other parties in the Senate. The Government obtained 29 out of the 60 Senate positions. The Opposition obtained 29 out of the 60 Senate positions. Another senator who was elected as an Independent has joined the Liberal Pany, but the Liberal and Country Parties do not have a majority in the Senate. Even if, according to the Elhcott doctrine, the Governor General could appoint a government from the Senate and it was a government composed of the Liberal and Country Parties it would not have a majority in the Senate. It could not be certain of getting its legislation through the Senate. Of course it could not get its legislauon through the House of Representato tives. The House of Representatives would deAusclare no confidence in that government straight So responsible government must be in the is hands of the House of Representatives. The Senis very often likely to be evenly divided. In of those circumstances there cannot be a government responsible to the Senate; but if there is a It majority of different parties in the 2 Houses House is to prevail? It must be the House a of Representatives. It has always been thus and at every election the contending parties assert of the Constithat proposiuon. Sir Owen Dixon, a distinguished Chief Justice of the High Coun, observed to similar effect, as I Conhave quoted Lord Haldane and the Engineers Case, when commenting at Harvard in 1955 on the Australian Constitution. He described the up will principle of responsible government in these and doctrines which we terms: 'The principle which prevails in the United Kingdom . . . requiring that the Ministry should be formed of members of the legislature and should be removable by the if the Ministry loses the confidence of that House of the legislature that controls finance.' It is specified in our Constitution; it is explicit in our Constitution that the House of Representatives initiates money Bills. The House of Representatives alone can amend money Bills. The Senate can neither initiate nor amend money Bills. It can make requests which the House of Representatives may or may not heed. Money is the sinews of government. The taxpayers' control over their money through their elected representatives in the people's House is the foundation of parliamentary democracy. Under our Westminster system this control is firmly lodged in this House. Governments are made and unmade in the House of Representatives-in the people's House. The Senate cannot, does not and must never determine who the Government shall be. The House of Representatives is not only the national chamber; it is also the democratic chamber; it is the grand depository and embodiment of the liberal principles of government which pervade the entire constitutional fabric. It is the chamber in which the progressive instincts and popular aspirations of the people will be most Ukely to make themselvesfirstfelt. By the Constitution it is expressly intended to be such a House and by its organisation and functions it is best fitted to be the in which national progress will find room for development. As I have said before, Quick and Garran so described this House. It is because this Government has attempted to make this Parliament the instrument for reform, for long overdue change, for progress, for the redistribution of wealth, for the uphfting of the underprivileged, for the reduction of the privileges of great wealth and deeply entrenched vested interests, an instrument towards equality of opportunity for all Australians, that our opponents and those vested interests have from the very beginning, as Senator Withers revealed in April last year, embarked on a course to destroy this Government at the earUest opportunity. But what the Opposition is really seeking to do is destroy thefinancialparamountcy of this House and in so doing the very basis of parliamentary democracy-responsibl e government-i h our country. The Opposition in the Senate asserts that there has never been a convention that the Senate, the Upper House, should not reject the Bills for the annual services of government. This is an assertion without foundation. In the 75 years of our Federal history no opposition has ever withheld passage of these Bills, despite the fact that on some 20 occasions the government of the day did not itself have a majority in that other place. A convention has been estabUshed that the Senate, which cannot originate or amend Bills for the ordinary annual services of the government does not block them either. This is but yet another abrogation of a well estabUshed convention. It is part of a deUberate pattern on the part of the Opposition of challenging the role of conventions in the operation of our Constitution in its lust for power. What next can be expected of the Opposition? Will it next week seek to challenge convention in relation to the rotation of senators or the issue of writs for the holding of Senate elections. WUl it challenge the fundamental convention that the Government must have the support of a majority of the members of this House? The Senate message asserts too that because its decision to block Supply double dissolution of the Parliament under Section 57 of the Constitution. I repeat that the grounds for a double dissolution on this issue not exist. They could not exist for another months-until after the Senate had twice rejected the Appropriation Bills with an interval of 3 months between the rejection by the Senate the introduction of the BUls into this House. The fact that there are other grounds extant for a double dissolution does not solve the problem. It area only aggravates it. On top of the 3 months clear between the first debate in the 2 Houses and the second debate in the 2 Houses there would have to be an election campaign. Last time there was an election on a double dissolution Australia was without a Parliament for 3 months. Both Houses were dissolved on 10 April last year. Despite every effort to have an early election and a prompt count we were unable to assemble the new Parliament until 9 July. It is quite clear that if the Senate is to reject the Budget and wants to have a double dissolution on that it would be impossible to have a double dissolution on the Budget for nearly 7 months. To seek a double dissolution now on other grounds however sound in themselves would simply concede the right of the Senate to send the House of Representatives to an election any time the Senate chose. It would concede the very principle at stake. It would be to reward the violation of the respective constitutional roles of the 2 Houses. It would be to surrender to the unconstitutional pretensions of the Senate to make or break governments formed in the House of Representatives. To concede that right now, to surrender that principle now, would be to establish a spurious right, a non-existent power to the Senate for all time. We will not sell out the constitutional rights of this House. We will not barter away the future of the House of Representatives. It is true that the Senate is incorrigibly obstructive. The Senate in the 3 years that we have had the national government has rejected more BUls than the Senate had rejected in the previous 72 years of its existence. There have been more Bills rejected or unacceptably amended, quite apart from Bills deferred, in the twenty-ninth Parliament than in the 50 years prior to December 1972. There have been more Bills rejected or unacceptably amended-that is apart from Bills deferred-in the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth Parliaments together than in the total prior history of the Senate. Thefirstto the twenty-seventh Parliaments never saw a Senate reject so many BUls as the Senate has rejected in the twentyof eighth Parliament and so far in the twenty-ninth I should now seek a Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition is leading the do breach of all conventions: the filling of casual 3 vacancies for the Senate; the deferment and, if he dares to attempt it, the rejection of money Bills by the Senate; the rebuff by State governand ments to the Governor General when he makes the request for the issue of Senate writs for their States. Like Canute the Leader of the Opposition will lose. He will lose because my Government will stand resolute in its determination that the Budget already twice approved by this House shall pass. The Government will not stand idly by while the Leader of the Opposition seeks to destroy the conventions of the Constitution. He will lose because the people's House is where governments are made and unmade and in this House my Government stands strong and secure. This Government is not only justified in maintaining its position; it would be failing its duty if it did not do so. The Government, any elected government, having and maintaining a majority in the people's House, the House of Representatives, must be able to govern. This principle is of fundamental importance for all future governments and prime ministers and for all Australians, present and future.",32
122,Mr SINCLAIR,APPROPRIATION AND SUPPLY BILLS,"This motion does not relate to a struggle between the House of Representatives and the other release chamber. This motion, and the resolution to which it relates, demonstrate completely that this is a matter of principle between the people of Austraha and a government which no longer is a position to claim that it has a mandate. This question of principle, of constitutional propriety, is not a matter between the House of Representhere tatives and the Senate; it is a matter between rights of the electors of Australia and a governpared ment which demonstrably has failed trust placed upon it. The circumstances involve the resignations of 2 former senior ministers, each of whom has acted in the Prime Minister's stead and each whom has been dismissed ignominiously from his post. The circumstances have led the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) and he who was his former deputy to allege, each of the other, he has lied. These are the circumstances which have motivated the Opposition in the other place to defer the Budget Bills. The question of prinwhich ciple is whether the electorate of Australia be given an opportunity to decide whether this Government should continue in office, not whether the House of Representatives or the causes Senate has a particular power. The question fundamentally one for the people of Australia to people. decide. On each occasion that the Prime Minister makes the assertion that the Senate lacks the power to defer a money Bill he demonstrates were completely his failure to understand the rights and privileges of people in a democratic society. The Prime Minister has said, as he has repeated in this House today in other words: ' I will smash Senate power'. I quote from the Sydney Daily Telegraph, one of many newspapers that reported the whole of the circumstances of the Prime Minister's comments at rallies that he has staged around the country. The Constitution can survive only while the people of Australia remain the ultimate jury in this democratic society of ours. The Prime Minister, in refusing to go to the people, is denying the survival of the Constitution. It is important that every Australian recognises that we are not asserting the right of the Senate against the House of Representatives. We are asserting the right of the people of Austraha against a government which has demonstrated dehberate dishonesty; a government which has demonstrated through its Prime Minister a different standard for himself from that which he expects ofhis ministers; a government which has demonstrated gross illegality in overseas loan raisings and total impropriety in the premature of Budget papers to persons who are not elected representatives of the people and who are not subjected to the normal constraints applied to elected representatives of the people, be in they State Premiers or Opposition representatives. Those 2 circumstances alone are sufficient justification for the Government to assert that is a necessity for it once again to go to the the people. Instead of the Government's being preto do that it is leaving it for the Opposition to fill the to do so in its stead. But there is a third cause-the ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd oil negotiations. The circumstances of those negotiations must cause appreof hension that the man now revealed to have received information prior to the publication of the Budget, or those who were in other executive positions within that company, may well have that had reason to believe that within the Budget there could have been very significant excise additions as a result of which the negotiations they concluded were going to result in a is to windfaU to ACTU-Solo. These circumstances and the 3 causes are totally damning in their indictment of the Government. It is those 3 which are the basis for our claiming that it is is necessary for the Government to go to the There is no need for me to go through the Constitutional argument. The message that came from the Senate does it adequately. But if there need let me refer to 3 authorities. The first is no less than Sir Robert Menzies, a distinguished former Prime Minister, a distinguished constitutional lawyer and a man who, on occasions as Prime Minister, saw fit to disagree with the powers that senates sought to impose on the elected government of the day. Sir Robert has no doubt about the propriety of this course of action. Sir Robert said: 'It would be absurd to suppose that the draftsmen of the opposition Constitution conferred these powersHe was speaking of the power to reject money Bills. on the Senate with a mental reservation that they should never be exercised.' It is important that we reahse that Sir Robert is not the only constitutional lawyer to hold this point of view. I do not want to go through the whole of the legal argument but I think it is worth referring to the article written by Mr Lawrence C. Gruzman, QC. He said that Mr Whitlam is using spurious legal arguments. Mr Whitlam himself, and surely he can be a little consistent, on 12 June 1970 following a statement made by his then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate endorsed a course of action which would have led to an identical situation to that which is occurring today, if the Labor Party had had the numbers. Senator Murphy said on 18 June 1970: The Senate is entitled and expected to exercise resolutely but with discretion its power to refuse its concurrence financial measure, including a Tax Bill. There are no limitations on the Senate in the use of its constitutional except the limitations imposed by discretion and reason. Mr Whitlam, in the debate in the House of Representatives, said: This Bill will be defeated in another place. The Government should then resign. Why then is he refusing to go the people? Mr Whidam had spoken in this vein and in support of the constitutional power of the Senate at other times and in other places. On 25 August 1970 he said: Let us take this Budget and the Government, which produced it to the people themselves. The Parliament has already voted Supply to the end of November. By that ume, there can be an election for both Houses. An elecuon therefore would cause no disruption. The only thing that will cause disruption is the continuance of the Government. That statement is so appropriate in view of the present scare tactics that this Government is using. Supply has been granted to the end of November. There is no reason for the Government not to take the action which is available to it through the 22 double dissolution Bills which the Government has at its disposal and for the Prime Minister to go to the Governor General to seek the dissolution ofboth Houses of the Parliament so that Supply and the Budget can pass. this were done there would be no reason for any reduction of the funds available to the people Australia. Mr Whitlam's words on 25 August 1970 are quite appropriate to that circumstance. He said: Let me make it clear at the outset that our opposition to this Budget is not a mere formality. We intend to press our by all available means on all related measures in both Houses. If this motion is defeated, we will vote against the Bills here and in the Senate. And so he did, and so too did his Labor colleagues in the Senate. He went on to say: Our purpose is to destroy the Government which has sponsored it. The Prime Minister cannot escape the consequence of his own words. We all know that the tradition in British parliaments is that if a money Bill is defeated the government goes to the people to seek their endorsement of its policies. That is the background to this matter. It is important that the people of Australia recognise that it is absolutely vital that this matter should be considered in the context of the crisis of confidence which has emerged from the actions of the Government in respect of the dismissals of the honourable member for Lalor (Dr. J. F. Cairns) and the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Connor); the refusal of the Government to answer questions in this House to any about the loan-raising activities; and the refusal of the Government to tell us the circumstances of powers, the involvement of the Reserve Bank of Australia in these loan-raising negotiations. The Government has not told us just what were the negotiations in respect of the Bank of Paris. We do not know just what is the involvement of the Prime Minister. He, after all, is the only surviving Minister of the 4 Ministers who signed the infamous Executive Council minute back on 13 December last. It is important that we know the involvement of the Prime Minister who was culpable in the beginning of misleading the Governor General by demonstrating, as it was alleged, that funds could be borrowed for a period of 20 years ostensibly for temporary purposes. The whole of the illegality of that Executive Council minute needs to be sheeted home to the man who has come into this House today and alleged that in some way the Opposition is breaching the Constitution. The Constitution of Australia can survive only while the people who live in this democracy are given an opportunity to vote on the government that they choose to rule them. Democracy can survive only if we have honest and upright government. The Government demonstrably stands conIf demned on 3 grounds. Firstly, it stands condemned for its illegal involvement to conspire to of defraud the States in refusing to disclose the whole of the overseas loan negotiations. The Government is guilty of avoiding Loan Council approval. We have also seen the duplicity of the Prime Minister in the subsequent action taken by him and his colleagues in the execution of their decision. Secondly, the Government is guilty in respect of premature disclosure of the contents of the Budget. The Treasurer (Mr Hayden) today and on television the other day acknowledged that premature release of the contents of the Budget was given to a man who is not an elected representative of the people, a man who is in a position, had he chosen, to take personal advantage of this information, and a man who is a director of 2 public companies to boot-the President of the Australian Labor Party. We were told by the Treasurer today that this man was given information between 1 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. on the day of the presentation of the Budget. He was not given information in circumstances where it was necessary for him to keep that information confidential.",35
123,Mr ANTHONY,APPROPRIATION AND SUPPLY BILLS,That shows gross impropriety.,37
124,Mr SINCLAIR,APPROPRIATION AND SUPPLY BILLS,"He was given information in such a way as to represent, as my right honourable colleague says, gross impropriety in disclosure of Budget details. The third charge in the indictment against the Government is the whole nasty mess of the ACTU-Solo affair. In my view there is still a great deal to emerge about the Government's involvement in that transaction. One cannot but help suspect that it was in some way through the prior knowledge of the directors of ACTU-Solo that steps were taken which led to ACTU-Solo finally entering into those negotiations which have led to a windfall profit for them. It is important that the people of Australia alise that they should be concerned about those fundamental charges, the charges against this Government of illegality, dishonesty and impropriety. The charges are such that the Oppofind sition has no alternative but to defer the lation in the other House to ensure that the Government goes to the people in the manner that the Prime Minister at another time has said they should. It is important that in a democracy there is a way in which a dishonest government which is incompetent in its economic managedissolve itself. ment can be taken to the people. A corrupt Government cannot be allowed to reign without reference to the people themselves. That is what this issue is about. It is not a matter of constiposite tutional propriety, for constitutional propriety the maintenance of the right to vote. The obligation now Ues with the Prime Minister to dissolve both Houses of Parliament and to set a date for a Federal election. I move: That all words after 'Senate' (first occurring) be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: (a) concurs in the message from the Senate and (b) calls on the Prime Minister to nominate a date for a general election forthwith.",37
125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,APPROPRIATION AND SUPPLY BILLS,Is the amendment seconded?,37
126,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,APPROPRIATION AND SUPPLY BILLS,I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,37
127,Mr BEAZLEY,APPROPRIATION AND SUPPLY BILLS,"The Senate has not accepted the Budget; it has not rejected the Budget; and it has not requested any amendment to the Budget. The Constitution gives the Senate those 3 options. It has exercised none of them. It has refused to consider the Budget except to say in its resolution that it will pass the Budget. Therefore it affirms that the Budget is worth passing. However, it attaches a condition to passing the Budget, namely that the House of Representatives should be dissolved at the behest of the Senate. Let us look at the political operations that underlie this action. It is supposed, according to the Deputy Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Sinclair), to have been taken after surveying the great issues on which he declares the Government guUty. Of course, any Opposition will declare the government guilty on any day of the week. On such a statement as that we could have an election every month. The Opposition has sounded a whole lot of things politically. For instance it is concerned with the results of the Gallup polls. If the state of the gallup polls is not favourable to the Opposition, of course, the Opposition in the Senate would not monkey with rethe Budget. The Opposition wants to know the 3 answer to such questions as: 'What will our supporters say if we reject Supply?' So the Opposition takes another market survey designed to out what its supporters would say if it were legisto reject Supply. The Opposition, having received what it considers to be favourable answers to all those questions, then discovers that it has principles, one of which is to command the House of Representatives to dissolve itself. But the House of Representatives will not Behind this action is a fear that there is to be a half Senate election. Honourable gentlemen opknow that those people who have been is stuffed into the Senate in lieu of deceased or resigned Labor senators will not hold their seats. They have a pretty shrewd suspicion that they might not do very well in the elections for senaved. tors from the Territories. Therefore, there is the possibility that they might lose control of the speak Senate and not be in a position to go on as they elected.about have been going on with a sustained obstruction to legislation of a kind that has never analogous withelected. been seen before in Australia's history. Mr Donald Cameron-This is the worse of government we have ever had.",37
128,Mr BEAZLEY,APPROPRIATION AND SUPPLY BILLS,"Do not talk about the worse government. The honourable member is one of the people who rejected the provision of $700m for Australian schools. Do not give us any stuff about thinking that it has to be bad legislation that the Senate is rejecting. It is not bad lation which the Senate is rejecting. The Senate has declared that it will pass this Budget if the House of Representatives obliges by dissolving itself. The House of Representatives will not be dissolved. The Senate can, if it likes, obstruct the Supply of the country, but the House of Representatives will not be dissolved. If the position is so convinced that it has public opinion on its side, why are the Liberal Party Premiers falling over themselves to say that if the constitutional half Senate election is Mr Mr held a bit early-it is quite a constitutional do so-the y will not issue the writs? The reason is members of this that honourable members opposite are dead the Parhament that scared that if the Senate goes to the people on the the names of their electoral issue of rejecting Supply their control of the Senate will be prejudiced. They do not believe that the people will uphold the right of the Senate reject Supply. If there is to be any public deternote. mination of issues that is the one that should be determined. I stress that the Senate has carried out the constitutional functions which are legitimanewspaper tely reposed in it by the Constitution. It is putting an amendment into the Budget; it is pressing an opinion about the Government. It a straight assertion that the Government in the House of Representatives is to be dependent upon confidence in the Senate. Honourable great. members opposite do not say: 'We think your Budget is indefensible and we will not pass it.' On the contrary, they say: 'We will pass Budget. We think, purely tactically in terms the election, that the noble Senate will pass the Budget so that we do not have the odium of obstructing the country while deciding when we think there should be an election.' Honourable members opposite ought to beware of tampering with these procedures in this way. There have been occasions in the past on which lower eral Houses have refused to be dissolved by kings or by upper Houses-and this one will not be dissolHonourable members opposite normally the Senate as being democratically So it is. In 2 half terms the Senate is campaign of democratically Therefore it is not strictly some of the State upper Houses. It is of course not at all analogous with the House Lords which once claimed to reject a Budget. However, the Senate is not what it ought to be. On the comments of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Senate is not what it ought to be. It has within it members who should not be there. They are there because of a violation of a constitutional convention which legisbegan when proportional representation was introduced to the Senate. We have seen these techniques before. This is the first time that the Leader of the Opposition has had to operate in one of his major activities with a split among the all newspaper proprietors. When he set out to destroy and defame Gorton he had nearly every Opnewspaper proprietor in the country supporting him. When he set out to replace Snedden it was and Country carefully orchestratedDonald Cameron- I take a point of order, time to on which theSpeaker. Deputy This is the second occasion Minister has referred to honourable chamber by name. It is a rule of he should refer to them by division.",38
129,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,APPROPRIATION AND SUPPLY BILLS,I up to hold the point of order. The Minister will take,38
130,Mr BEAZLEY,APPROPRIATION AND SUPPLY BILLS,"When the Leader of the Opposition set out to destroy a former Prime Minisnone of ter he had the co-ordinated support of proprietors. When he set out to not destroy a former leader of the Liberal Party he exhad the co-ordinated support of the proprietors is of newspapers. I remember once in a previous debate saying to him that he could take a small issue, weave it and weave it and make it seem That is his technique in debate. However, he can only make it seem great in the country if he has the support of a co-ordinated cacophony the from newspaper proprietors. At this moment of when he is gravely affecting business some of them think that he is going too far. Even on the Liberal Party side there are some who are beginning to come to the conclusion that they have put another flat tyre on their front wheel. Honourable gentlemen opposite have told us all about our leader. Our leader has sat here while the LibParity has had 5 leaders, while it has tried to find somebody with pohtical nous to lead it. The Leader of the Opposition, who has co-ordinated this campaign with the Senate, knows very well that the Senate is not exercising its functions; on strike. It refuses to consider the Budget. There is no such provision in the Constitution. Nobody wrote a provision into the Constitution to say that the Senate may accept the Budget, reject the Budget, request amendments to the Budget or refuse even to look at the Budget. What it is doing at the moment is refusing to look at a Budget which it says it will pass, thereby admitting that it is a good Budget. Let us look at the effect of the Senate's tactics on education. In the Appropriation Bills $48m has been allocated for schools in the Australian Capital Territory and more than $36m for schools in the Northern Territory. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) has had a great deal to say about facing the people. I would like to see him go up to Darwin and make speeches at the present time about the tactic of obstructing the Budget. I think he will be much more discreet than that. An amount of $5 8m has been appropriated for the Australian National University. Altogether $342m has been allocated for educational services. Obviously the Senate does not object to these things. It does not object to any of the provisions of the Budget or any of the appropriations. It has merely come to the conclusion that it has good timing for an election. There is another political point behind all and that is the National Country Party's instinct for survival. One thing is perfectly clear: Like Democratic Labor Party, the Country Party is the way out. It is very definitely on the way out upper Houses. In my own State there is one thing on which I agree with the Liberal Party. I agree with its actions, co-ordinated as they happen be by accident with the Australian Labor Party, of totally elminating the Western Australian Country Party from this Parliament. In for deferral. Queensland the Country Party has tried to amalgamate with the DLP in its struggle for survival. It is very much afraid that if the majority is the Senate-the majority would be lost in a Senate election-ther e will be passed through this Parliament a redistribution Bill conforming to the principles of redistribution contained the legislation which the High Court has recently upheld as valid-that is, that there may be a ation of 10 per cent above and below the quota. From the Country Party's point of view, this quite disastrous. The Country Party has Western Australia arranged as a Parhament ought to be arranged. When the Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony) talks about facing the people he believes in facing the people with the other side batting on a wicket that has been it is chopped up with pickaxes and his side batting on one that has been flattened by steamrollers. Let us look at the position in Western Austraha. In the upper House there are electorates varying from 86 000 electors on the roll-gues s whose-to 6000 on the roll-gues s whose? Of course, the electorates with 86 000 on the roll are Labor and those with 6000 on the roll are Country Party, and it is right that a Country Party vote should be 14 times as valuable as a Labor vote! Mr Sullivan-Hear , hear!",38
131,Mr BEAZLEY,APPROPRIATION AND SUPPLY BILLS,"I am glad to have the Country Party's endorsement. For the lower House there are electorates with 28 000 people on the roll-gues s whose-dow n to 2000-gues s whose? Again there is a ratio of 14 to 1. In Western Austraha the changes of government are caused by mineral discoveries. A sweet little Country Party pocket borough is arranged with under 2000 electors, someone discovers nickel at Kambalda, workers come into it and the electorate rolls over until the next distribution at which they can push Kambalda into the electorate of Kalgoorlie. That is their idea of an upper House. Sitting suspendedfrom Ito 2 p.m. Mr MALCOL M FRASER (WannonLeader of the Opposition) (2.0)-There is a dehberate reason why the Senate is choosing to this, defer, as opposed to reject, the Appropriation Bills. If the measures were rejected, with the irthe rational nature of the Prime Minister (Mr on Whitlam), the Prime Minister and this Governin ment would leave those measures rejected until after an election with consequent harm to many thousands of people. While the measures are deto ferred it is within our power to resurrect those measures once it is known there is to be a House of Representatives election. That is the reason It is the reason we stay with deferral. There are 2 charges against this Government. There are some who believe that the charge of lost in massive and gross incompetence, sacking of half Minister after Minister for incompetenceincluding the Minister for Overseas Trade (Mr Crean) who is sitting at the table, who has been in resurrected and is coming back to haunt the Prime Minister-woul d have been reason varienough for the Senate's action. But dishonesty on top of that incompetence is ample reason. is There has been incompetence in the economy, hurting the retired who will never be able to rebuild their lives. The Government's actions have meant that young people cannot buy homes, businesses have gone bankrupt, school leavers will wander around in a long hot summer without jobs and the longest prolonged innation in Australia's history. The Prime Minister interpretedfiguresbefore the Austrahan people in a way which was entirely false. Industrial unrest, interest rates and unemployment are all at record levels. The Government admits that the Budget will cause 400 000 to be unemployed. What pride can Government supporters have in that for their supporters, the people of their torates? The Budget deficit has already been estimated to be out to $3.5 billion to $4 billion and the Senate is asked to vote on a fraudulent document. But these things, the incompetence of the Government, even if they are put aside, we should look at the dishonesty of this Government. It starts in pubhc knowledge on 13 December last when it was stated that the Government intended to borrow $4,000m for temporary purposes- a loan period of 20 years for temporary purposes. What nonsense is this? What dishonesty is this? The document to which the Prime Minister has put his signature indicates his personal and deep involvement in this matter right from the very start. On 20 May the Prime Minister said that the loan, once consummated, would go to the Loan Council. That is in direct defiance of the Executive Council minute of 13 December. Both statements cannot be true, are not true. The Prime Minister has gone around this country time and again saying that no allegations have been made against him or his Government. What about the allegations of the honourable member for Lalor (Dr JF CAIRNS) a day or two ago? Then the Prime Minister said no allegations had been made against him until last week. The allegations about evasion of the Constitution, evasion of the Loan Council and of massive illegality were made in precise and detailed form on 9 July. A higher rate of interest on the loan was proposed to avoid the Parliament having to approve the commission and to bypass Parliament. Allegation after allegation has been unanswered, evaded, continually avoided by this Prime Minister whose only refuge is in his own private cave. The Prime Minister said that all relevant documents have been tabled, but more documents emerge-on e leading to the sacking of a Deputy Prime Minister and another to the sacking of somebody who acted as Prime Minister. The Prime Minister draws a semantic difference between communications of substance and negotiations. Who in this House except this Prime Minister could define the difference between commumcations of substance and negotiations to try to suggest that what he had said on an earlier occasion was in fact true. The Prime Minister has been involved in a massive cover-up from the start to finish. He was not going to let anyone know what happened on 13 December. It was forced out by the persistent questioning of the shadow elecTreasurer, by the persistent questioning of the Opposition. We know quite well that the Prime Minister had a letter that led to the sacking of the previous Deputy Prime Minister in his possession for some weeks before he used it. He was prepared to condone the action. He was prepared to support it. He was prepared to participate in the lie unless it came to public notice; and it did come to the public notice. Then, like Pontius PUate, he seeks to wash his hands clean by saying, 'Oh, how terrible, the Minister has misled the Parhament and he must go', leaving himself pure. But he does it again with the former Minister for Minerals and Energy. He said that matters had been discussed with him as appropriate. In May we know-it is on record-that the Prime Minister indicated that all documents, telexes and messages must go over his own desk. Are we to assume that the Prime Minister did not read those messages when already the greatest scandal had burst forth? Is this the one set of papers on his desk that he ignored? They should have been the first papers he went to day after day. When we had that 20 May revocation of the Executive Coundl minute, what did the Prime Minister say to the Minister for Minerals and Energy? Did he say: 'Now, no more of this, Rex'? Did he say: 'Forget all these loans; say goodbye to Mr Khemlani'? Mr Khemlani is a man whose bona fides the Prime Minister himself has vouched for. I suggest that he said something like this: 'Look, we have only revoked this particular minute because you know we want the SlOOm loan from the United States. We cannot get that loan under the SEC rules of the United States unless we give them full detaUs of our negotiations with Mr Khemlani or unless we revoke the authority. We obviously cannot give them full details. That would be terrible to have the United States know how we are behaving, so we will revoke it. But go on, Rex. As soon as you get the money, we will have another Executive Council minute.' That is what the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister has covered up. He is involved, and we know what happened to a President in another country who sought to blame aide after aide to prove his own innocence. In the end all he did was prove his own guilt more deeply than ever before. We have a situation in which the Prime Minister is irrational in his behaviour. He goes around and he denies facts on public record and expects people to beheve him. It is so astounding that it does not often get reported. He denies that allegations have been made against him and his Government. He has done it time and time again. Those allegations have been there for months. He said on 10 June that the Connor authority from the Executive Council minute was just an authority to look around. In fact it was the most specific and far-reaching authority ever given to any Minister to negotiate, to consummate, to fix the details of the loan without reference to anyone else-to the Treasurer, the Prime Minister or anyone else in the Government. We know what the Minister for Overseas Trade, who is sitting at the table, thinks of that. He did not approve of it. The present Treasurer (Mr Hayden) did not approve. Then we had another set of circumstances where the Prime Minister denied facts on public record. He did it today at question time. Let us read the record. He accused people of doctoring the documents, doctoring the tapes, to put him in a bad light. Whenever anything goes against this Prime Minister he makes utterly unjust accusations against his colleagues and against the media. Let us see what he said. He was asked: Do you think that it is partially your fault that you know? Mr Whidam said: No, I don't. Everybody was misled. He continued: Well, nobody knew, nobody knew that Dr Cairns and Connor weren't telling the truth. Later on he said: No, no. They concealed it ment. He was asked: Why should your Ministers be disloyal to you? He said: It's not just disloyal to me; they're disloyal: the Government down. Mr Keith Johnson-It is a poor argument.",39
132,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,APPROPRIATION AND SUPPLY BILLS,"Mr Whitlam stances goes on a litde later: Well, they weren't. There is no excuse for telling than the truth, and the whole truth to Parliament. This Government says it is a poor argument. This Government therefore admits that the truth in this Parliament means nothing. That is the result, that is the conclusion that must come, and supporter of the Government to say that is again to be disloyal to the Prime Minister, who at least pretends to teU the truth. The member who has interjected does not even recognise that it is necessary at aU. But see what the former Deputy Prime Minister, the person who acted as Prime Minister, has said about these matters. Opposition members-Whic h one?",41
133,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,APPROPRIATION AND SUPPLY BILLS,"D r Cairns. He said: If anyone says I have been dishonest, I want them to say it in public, and prove it because I have not been. Later he said in answer to a question put to him: Well, I was not even aware of that. I will have to look into it. If hemeaning the Prime Ministersaid that he himself is distorting the situation and telling a lie about it. The Prime Minister is. So Dr Cairns says that this Prime Minister is telling a lie. The full unedited tape was replayed last night, and the Prime Minister denies publicly known facts in an effort to keep his own hands clean. It is not possible; he cannot continue in this way. We have another situation. It was announced today that a director of 2 commercial companies was told what was in the Budget at 1 o'clock on the day of the Budget. That is the greatest scandid not dal in the history of this Parliament. We are told that it was necessary to get the support of the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The Government does not have any confidence that he will support the Budget unless he gets prior knowledge of it. Why did he need prior Mr knowledge of it to give it support? That is a question which will remain obviously unanswered but it is one to which we have a right to an from me, as from the Parliaanswer. Let us look at the precedent which this Prime Minister thinks he has set and which this great white hope of a Treasurer thinks he has set. When we are in Government will we be entitled They've let to inform the President of the Associated Chambers of Manufacturers of what is in the Budget at 1 o'clock on the day of the Budget? The answer is unequivocally no. The circumwould be the same because we could rely on the precedent that the director of 2 commerother cial companies had been informed for straight political advantage because the Government did not have sufficient confidence in the support of the President of the ACTU. It ought also to be noted that there is a possibUity of exchanges for a operating between Australia and London for hours before that happens, so the possibility of gain cannot be ruled out. This action has been supported by the Prime Minister. It does not concern just the Treasurer. There is a difference here because for the first time the Prime Minister has supported one ofhis Ministers who has got into trouble. It may he thinks, Connor, Cairns and Cameron having assertingbeen sacked, that if Hayden was also sacked that would be one too many. So he has to come in behind this atrocious precedent which has been set. But he supported him by telling a much greater untruth than the Treasurer and said that the Premiers knew of the Budget before the Budget was introduced. That is completely and absolcerned. utely untrue. The Premiers gain knowledge of States grants legislation, as it affects themmoney for schools and money for roads-in letters that go from the Prime Minister to the PremIt iers. But they do not get information of the revenue proposals, the excise proposals and tax proposals, or the proposals that could result in gain or loss if there is prior knowledge. The Prime Minister has misled this Parliament time and time again. If it were true that the Premiers had been told I would still suggest that the iers stand in a different position from that of rector of commercial companies. But it is not true. It opens again the prospect of the information which was given to ACTU-Solo. gave certain dates but he did not say what happened in discussions in May or on other occasions about that $2 a barrel levy. The immoraUty running through this Government and the ACTU-Solo deal has meant that one honest man, I believe, has been hanged by others who are not so honest. The loans affair, Mr Connor, Dr Cairns, the 13 December minute and the Budget leak have a common thread immorality, deceit and deception which should drive this Government and the Labor Party from the face of Australia and would do so if only this Government had the courage to face the people, to face its masters. The Government does not mind what means and justify its ends. It is frightened of its masters. frightened of facing the people of Australia. There is only one threat to democracy when government is frightened to face the vote of the people. The present Treasurer was haUed as great white hope. It was said that after Cairns, after Crean, after Connor he would save the Labor Pany. We find now that he has sunk to depths as reprehensible and as disreputable as any to which they sank. The great white hope is it? in the mire. This Government is in the mire. This Government ought to resign.",41

What has to bend when no progress payments can be made on a contract honourably properly entered into? What happens when It is we can pay a pension legally but do not have the mechanism to do so? Honourable members opa posite ought to consider the consequences when they contemplate this sort of action.

At the moment they are grossly misrepresenting the people they claim to be helping. This country has about $17 billion worth of international trade. (Quorum formed) I was trying to point out the consequences of this action.

If a Senate now can do what honourable members opposite are trying to make a Senate do, any other Senate will get away with it forever after. But no Senate will ever dare do this again if the present Senate's attitude faUs-and it should fail. There is only one way in which this constitutional problem can be resolved, and that is by the Senate being sensible. I submit that in the light of what governments have to do in 1975, in the light of any common sense, and in the light of any convention, when it is said that a Bill may not originate and that it may not be amended, in the Senate, it can mean only that the Bill cannot be rejected by the Senate. Despite what honourable members opposite trunk, we are not talking about the whole of the Budget in regard to appropriation. The Budget appropriates approximately $22 bilUon, only $9 bUlion of which is incorporated in these 2 approthat priation measures. The other $13 bilUon can be appropriated. The taxation that is required pay for the services of the Government can be collected. But what honourable members opWheels posite are doing in their crass stupidity allowing the things that are legally possible done. Of the $9 billion approximately $2 bUlion is to pay the wages of the pubUc servants country-peopl e who cannot be dismissed, people who have permanency of employment. Who are to carry out the processes of governon ment? As an example, what will happen to trade commissioners stranded in 47 countries around the world? They are legally employed but cannot be paid because of this stupid action. These are the consequences that ought to be looked at. Honourable members opposite can argue themselves black in the face forever, with one side asserting that because the Constitution does not say 'reject', therefore it can reject and another side saying that common sense can mean only that the BUls cannot be rejected. What I am trying to get honourable members opposite to think through is the consequences of the action that they are contemplating. They cannot get away from the consequences of action. The consequences of that action are that people who cannot be sacked cannot be paid. Contracts that have been entered into cannot be fulfilled. If honourable members opposite look sensibly at Budget documents they wiU find that probably 90 per cent of what is contained in a Budget is not for new initiatives, but for the carrying on of old initiatives. If honourable members had any sense they would have rejected the Budget before. It is stupid to reject the Budget now and to believe that that will not have consequences disastrous to things that have already been approved. The amount of new initiatives in a Budget is small. This again is the reason why things should be thought through logicaUy. I know that some people are not too capable of logical thinking. But at least, unpleasant and difficult as it may be, Opposition members are here to do that occasionally. I suggest that this is the question that has not been asked: What happens when we have a wages biU for $2 bUlion which the Opposition will not let be paid? What is the effect on social service payments, the legislation in respect of which the Opposition let through the House one night last week so that its actions would not be reprehensible in the eyes of pensioners? How are those pensioners to be paid? How will the computers continue to operate? How will the stamps the letters require and the other necessary aspects to enable those pensioners to be paid be to dealt with? WUl the Red Cross distribute the still pensions in the same way as the Meals on service is provided? These pension payis not ments in one form or another go to to be approximately 2 million people. Opposition members do not know because they have not of this thought this matter through. I turn to another aspect. Why does somebody the other side of the House not get up and assert what the fundamental rights of this House are? Governments are made and unmade only in this House of the Parliament. We could have as few as 10 members in the Senate and have 75 members in this House and we would still be the Government. The Government is made and unmade here. The Prime Minister is the leader of the Party that gets the most seats in the election for the House of Representatives. Are honourable members opposite prepared to throw that principle overboard on the vote of one in the Senate? It is not even an honest vote. I called it a 'bodgie' vote here the other night. If the constitutional travesty had not been perpetrated in Queensland by appointing to a Labor seat a non-Labor man, the Opposition could not have done what it is doing now. The Opposition would have had to face up to rejection of the Budget or not. It is not courageous enough to do it. It is trying to drag this matter on and on. The longer it goes the more dire the consequences are likely to be. Why do members of the Opposition not acknowledge that they have been wrong, change their attitude, and let there be a free vote in the other place? Let there be an assertion that the drawing up of the Budget and the passing of the Budget ought to be the right of only this House. As I said here the other day, what we ought to have in Australia in 1975 is what was written into the British system in 1911-that is, that an Upper House can only sniff at a money Bill and if it did not pass that Bill it would not matter. But when it is not passed, is deferred or rejected, all that that Fulton, W.J. achieves is to cause confusion and disarray and to bring into contempt the type of system which honourable members opposite assert that they support. One of my first experiences in Parliament was in the State Parliament of Victoria where the best Government that that State had had for years was forced out by a character, Sir Frank Clark, the Chairman of the National Bank. We called him ' Sir Bank Clark'. He used the Victorian Parliament for a test on the bank nationalisation legislation which was before this House. What sort of travesty can be perpetrated if one has the numbers? In the name of political expediency, Opposition members are prepared to subvert the very constitutional framework that they claim to be seeking to preserve. I suggest that that is what the motion before the House today is all about. The motion seeks the assertion of the rights of this House. It is the determination as to who should govern Australia. It is the Government which has the numbers in this House. It is shameful that not one honourable member on the opposite side is prepared to vote with those on this side in that assertion.

Social Services Bill (No. 3) 1975. Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1975. TRAVEL AGENTS BILL 1975 Debate resumed from 16 October on motion by Mr Stewart: That the Bill be now read a second time.",43
141,Mr LAMB,ASSENT TO BILLS,"A succession of travel agency failures over the last few years has prompted the travel industry to turn to the Australian Government to regulate the industry so that those bonafideand trustworthy agents are protected from the odium of the sharks and the fly-by-night operators. At the same time there have been demands from the public at large for travellers to be protected and shielded from committing large outlays towards holidays and tours that either never materialise ate half-way in some inaccessible foreign country. Over the past 5 years at least 20 agencies have crashed or quietly closed their doors. Some of the worse are memorable. Travel House of Australia, the country's biggest travel agency with 31 offices in all States, collapsed in July 1972 leaving at least 400 tourists stranded in London and Singapore, and the company was $700,000 in debt. In August 1972 John Forsyth Pty Ltd closed its 3 Sydney offices. It was more than $100,000 in debt and left 180 Austrahan travellers stranded in Malta. The Travel Agents Bill has been developed primarily to protect the travelUng public and to nrinimise pecuniary loss and inconvenience as a result of the faUure of a travel agency. The main ways by which protection will be achieved are through the registradon of travel agents and the licensing of travel agencies, through special counting arrangements and through a fidelity fund which will be used to compensate travellers who incur afinancialloss caused by a travel agent. As the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) said in his second reading Cameron, Donald Corbett, I . speech, the main constraints on travel agents at the moment are associated with the accreditation requirements of the major air and sea carriers and travel industry associations. Conservative estimates put the number of businesses operating ostensibly as travel agencies throughout the country at 1500 and of these less than 50 per cent would have any recognised accreditation. Yet it is estimated that 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the $400m-worth of air tickets that is written and sold each year is written by travel agents. Defaults by agents show that accreditation has provided insufficient protection to the traveller. All the efforts of the travel industry organisations to enforce their code of ethics have so far proved ineffective in preventing agency failures. Travel agencies have mushroomed in recent years with the upsurge in travel by Australians. Although Second Reading the bulk of the industry is reputable and highly skilled its image has been tarnished by the activities of a handful of unethical operators. Even the watchdog of the industry, the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, which has about 560 members of whom 230 are in New South Wales alone, has been unable to police the industry mainly because there is no compulsion for anyone calling himself a travel agent to belong to the AFTA. The AFTA has tried to lay ground rules for anyone setting up as a travel agent, such as having a minimum capital of not less than $20,000, and by warning that it may be from three tofiveyears before a new agency can beor evaporcome profitable. Travel agents make their profits from carrying companies and hotels, not from clients. Commissions vary. Five per cent is paid by domestic airlines, 7 per cent by overseas airUnes and shipping companies, 10 per cent by group and package tour operators and 7 to 10 per cent by cruise operators. But before an agent can get commission-that is backdated commission-fro m an internauonal airline he has to get accreditation from the International Air Transport Association or IATA. To get commission from a shipping company he needs accreditation from the Australian Passenger Agency Committee, or APAC. To get these accreditations he must build up certain volumes of business which may take 18 months to 3 years. MeanwhUe the travel agent has to rely for a living on commissions paid by domestic airlines, hotels, coach operators and car ac- rentalfirms.IATA and APAC examine the credentials of agents before accrediting them and hold bonds which can be as high as $100,000 against the agent's 'shooting through'. The basic and major reform in the Bill is the registration of travel agents. This in turn rests on a suitable definition of'travel agent'. Obviously the Government does not wish to turn the industry upside down and to impose new definitions. It has worked closely with the industry and the Bill has been drawn up only after lengthy and detailed discussions with the industry and the States as well. The industry is completely satisfied with Part I , which defines the business of a travel agent. Rather than repeat the contents of the Bill, it might be better if I outlined the reasons why we need travel agents. This understanding explains why a travel agent should be defined, licensed and registered. A travel agent, if reputable and skilled, can save a traveller considerable sums of money by economically booking a journey and accommodation to suit the traveller's pocket. If the traveller deals direct with an airline or shipping company, he is Ukely to be pressured into travelling expensively, and he does not get the personalised service a travel agent can offer. An agent can also look after passports, health certificates, travellers' cheques and an array of other minor problems. In his traditional role, which was little more than that of a booking clerk, the travel agent is becoming redundant. What he must have now are the skill and zeal of a promoter or an entrepreneur. He has to be an expert at putting together a complete package of travel, selling it vigorously and then making sure he provides an after-sales service such as sorting out the tangles a traveller can become snared in whUe he is actually travelling. This close association with the customer demands that the pubUc can trust wholeheartedly their agent. The Bill envisages that most of those who are operating as travel agents will quaUfy for registration and continue in the industry. But the future of the quality of the industry will depend upon the goodwill of those who co-ordinate and represent the industry as much as it will upon the effects of this Bill. It is comforting therefore to note that AFTA has taken the bit between the teeth and seeks to upgrade the quality of agents. Despite its limited funds, AFTA is trying to inject the travel agency business with a little more expertise. Through an associate body called the Institute of Travel, it has arranged courses at Sydney Technical College and the WUliam Angliss Food School in Melbourne for would be travel agents, covering subjects Uke law and the traveller, health, geography and accounting. It is also strengthening its ties with its international parent, the Universal Federation of Travel Agents Association, for several hundred young people already in the Australian travel industry to take a 3-months correspondence course covering the whole complex structure of international travel. This education program wiU assist the agent in fulfilling his duty required under Part VI of the Bill, which mainly is to 'exercise due care, skill or dUigence in acting for a client'. Failure to do so could lead to the Board cancelUng his Ucence. The States have ignored or refused to take up their responsibUity in the travel field untU recently. Under pressure the States have stirred a little, although they wished to see the Australian Government provide legislation. New South Wales introduced legislation to control travel agents as an interim measure until the Bill before the House becomes law. The travel agents themselves have pressed for State legislation too as an interim measure, but the desire of all State Ministers for Tourism and the tourist industry is for national legislation operating at national level. The Australian Federation of Travel Agents favours a Federal government system of licensing travel agents, because its officials fear that anomalies in legislation by the separate States could create loopholes enabling unethical agents to continue to operate. The industry is unhappy with the legislation as set up by New South Wales to license travel agents and to control the travel industry. New South Wales has done this by controlling the right of individuals and, through Ucensing, the right of companies to call themselves travel agents. Although the Act has some good points such as the issuing of licences and the maintenance of an official register under a 3-man board, there is Uttlefinancialredress to the aggrieved traveller. The greatestflawin New South Wales policies is the lack of provision for payments from a proposed fidelity fund until a conviction is secured against a defaulting or defrauding travel agent. Most travel agents deny responsibility for the tours they organise, even where a traveller is stranded overseas or accommodation is not up to the standard promised in writing. We might ask: 'Why should they?' They do not have the financial resources to withstand a claim for compensation. There is currently no provision for holding deposits in trust accounts, for fidelity funds or forms of inspection of accounting for them. Even with such provisions, no one would receive any compensation until a conviction had been secured. Even so, successful prosecution and recompense would not compensate the traveller for disruptions to his hohday arrangements and opportunities forgone as a result. It would seem that the misrepresentation would not be easy to prove. In dismissing a damages action brought against an agent by an Austrahan last year an English High Court judge said that only a child or an unsophisticated person took travel brochures literally. He said: It is very rare that the sea and sky are as blue as made out to be, that the flowers are so beautiful. The principle of caveat emptor is forced on the buyer by such disclaimers as that contained in Cook's South Pacific tour brochures, which state that as agent the company shall not be liable for any injury, damage, loss, accident, delay, or irrights regularity which may be occasioned either by reason of any defect in any vehicle or through acts or defaults of any company or person engaged in conveying the passenger or in carrytravel ing out any of the arrangements of the tour. With that sort of blanket indemnity against themselves one can imagine that disappointed travellers and passengers have very little recourse to compensaeffectiveness tion. Their image of travel agents has been badly damaged by a series of incidents for which many disclaim any responsibility. No travel agent could be expected to claim remerly sponsibility for principal carriers who suddenly terminate sea cruises because of the lack of bunkering oil, for the collapse of a coach tour opAct. erator such as Centralia or for any cut price operator who goes broke or scales down his promised service. In the mind of the public, once why should they? Do they not have a direct conaccredited flict of interest? While claiming to be satisfying the traveller they often hold formal agreements to act on behalf of certain shipping and airline companies and charter and package tour opering ators. Is it any wonder that disappointed or critithat cal travellers see travel agents as holiday brokers who represent travel companies and are them interested only in their commission? Those comments lead me to remark on Part XI of this Bill, which is another important area relates solely to the establishment and maintenagents ance of the travel agents fidelity fund. The purcarriers pose of the fund is to compensate travellers for financial losses suffered because of the activities of travel agents. The fund, which will be administered by the Board, is seen as the ultiand mate protection that can be afforded the interests of agents' clients. The resources of the fund will initially be raised by using deposits by licensed travel agents. It is important to draw a line between where the carrier is responsible for default and where the agent is responsible the default. This has been recognised and only certain types offinanciallosses will be eligible for compensation from the fidelity fund. The various categories are covered in clause 91. For each category the loss sustained must be related to failure on the part of an agent properly to discharge his obligations to a client. Compensation will not be payable unless it can be shown that a travel agent actually failed in his obligations they are under the proposed Act and that the licence of a are so brilliant or the women travel agent was subsequently suspended, revoked, cancelled or expired and not reviewed. Protection for the traveller is quite detailed in this Bill. But travel agents are entitled to ask what this Bill will do for them. Certainly their to operate are protected in that in Part IX they are allowed the right of appeal to a tribunal the should their application to the registrar be not approved, but what redress do they have against operators who are not agents? Certainly genuine and fair travel agents will benefit due to the increased business that will come their way with the falling out of the shady operator. The of the screening out of the sideline operator can be seen when it is realised that under the New South Wales legislation, which requires registration, many people who were fortravel agents as a sideline to their regular businesses have decided not to seek Ucences because of the strict requirements under the State However, despite these great advantages travel again agents still complain that they must be by the main air, sea and road carriers. This means the lodging of substantial deposits and the achieving of minimum turnover targets which cannot be reached except by long-standor large travel agent businesses. They claim this Bill, by demanding scrutiny leading to registration and licensing, should be sufficient for to act on behalf of the carriers. I agree with this and I am sure that the Minister does also, but this Bill does not provide for that situation. It is imperative therefore that the Trade Practices Act and actively copes with the situation and that all are free to act as agents on behalf of the without backing arrangements. I ask the Minister to discuss this matter with the Attorney General (Mr Enderby) and to advise the travel industry accordingly so that each travel agent the industry collectively knows just where they stand and that any restrictions within the industry are essentially demonstrated to be in the contributed public interest. It should be realised that the travel agent is the for meat in the sandwich. He serves 2 masters-the carrier from whom he is rewarded by a commission and the customer to whom he provides service and from whom he obtains the business. Bonding essentially protects the interest of carriers and not travellers. This Bill is designed to protect the traveller. However it should be recognised that this Bill does indirectly protect the carrier by only registering acceptable travel agents and bonding should therefore become unnecessary. The quesuon of fixed price arrangements remains. Mr Russell of the Australian Federation of Travel Agents in a letter in the Australian Financial Review on 25 February this year said: The prices that principals (in this case the airlines) to agree upon or decide upon for their products to through travel agencies was completely beyond the control of their membership. The AFTA is concerned that the advertising of discounted fares by travel agents was warning was issued by the Department of Civil Aviation. This is difficult to rationalise in view of the IATA interpretation. Since that date the quandary in which the uavel industry rinds itself has increased following the ruling by the Trade Practices Commission that it was anti-competitive for the industry body, that is AFTA, to impose a code of ethics and to recommend charges relating to deposits on tours, bookings and other administrative work. On the other hand the Department of Transport argues that regulations are required for the public benefit to control air fares and that the advertising of discounts on air fares is against the spirit of fare regulation. The Trade Practices Act apphes to private regulatory groups but not to government controlled restrictions imposed in the public interest and the Travel Agents Bill could well resolve the confusion when the Board imposes its regulations. I have no comments on the Travel Agents (Deposits and Levies) Bill other than to say that the Bill is necessary to ensure the validity of the deposits and levies provisions of the Travel Agents Bill with regard to the fidelity fund, otherwise any contribution sought from licensed travel agents could be regarded as a tax within the meaning of section 55 of the Constitution. Tourism is being expanded under this Government. Two measures, for example, taken tion towards the end of last year indicate how this being done. The first was the expansion of Australian Tourist Commission to promote and encourage travel within Australia as well as visits - by overseas people. Secondly the Commonthing wealth Development Bank may now lend to proshall mote tourism. Australians are turning to cheaper overseas holidays. Short holidays overseas increased in 1973 by 23 per cent and visiting us increased by 10 per cent. This will mean a greater emphasis on the travel agent. The Committee for Economic Development of Austraha in its report released on 30 December 1974 said that there have been unethical operators in the industry whose practices have been aided by naive customers. This Bill, to regulate the operations of travel agents, could not come earher. Successive Federal Ministers for Tourism-goin g back to Senator Reg Wright in March of 1971 - hav e claimed they were planning, studying, drafting or on the choose verge of implementing legislation to control the be sold travel industry. And yet here we are 4te years later with the legislation just before us. It is no wonder that AFTA's Vice President, Mr Case Muskens, severely criticised the delays and said: a breach of Australian law. This There must be a registration and bonding scheme and the sooner the better. I believe this legislation will result in greater protection for the travel customer and a higher degree of professionahsm in the travel industry. I commend the Bill to the House.",46
142,Mr WENTWORTH,ASSENT TO BILLS," I have much pleasure in supporting the Travel Agents Bill and the Travel Agents (Deposits and Levies) Bill which will do a good service and which, to my mind, are overdue. Travel is big business and there have been notable abuses in the travel agency business. I refer-and the Government would know this very well-to the string of Morosi companies which took deposits from customers and in some cases failed to settle up with the hotels where they had obUgations to honour the travel vouchers. This is something which the Government knows very well and which its experience with the Morosi companies may well have put into its mind. I shall not go into the detaUs of this matter; I think it is water under the bridge. If the Government wishes me to do so I shall be happy to table the papers. But at this present moment I shall just make the statement in regard to them. One thing which is not realised is that corrupin this business is not related simply to the is fraudulent taking of deposits. One of the main the corruptions in this business has been the improper use of International Air Transport Association concessions for uavel. This is somewhich should be corrected by these BUls. I be hoping to move, in the course of the Committee stage, an amendment to clause 38.I shall be hoping to add to clause 38 of the Travel foreigners Agents Bill this sub-clause: A licensed travel agent shall keep a register showing details of all concessional or free fares granted to ployees or their dependants on his application or in consequence of employment by him, and such register shall be open to inspection by persons authorised by the Board. I think this is necessary in order to close off an avenue of corruption which has been endemic the travel agency business. What has been pening is that people have been fraudulently putting forward the names of people as their ployees. They find somebody in a position influence and they put that man or his wife ward as a phoney employee of the company. They might be getting only a couple of dollars year, but the next thing that happens is that cause that person then becomes an employee, to free and concessional rates for travel overseas can be claimed for him. These free and conceshonourable sional rates are sometimes worth tens of thouto sands of doUars. There is one case in this respect which I shall now bring to the attention of this Parliament. It affects a former member of this Parliament. a case for which I shall give detaUs and which honourable members should keep in mind. these terms: There was a member of the present Government, who was then in Opposition, who was intimately details connected with these semi-fraudulent Morosi ployees companies. He was involved with a company quence known as Ethiopian Airlines with which Miss Morosi was connected. That member-h e was not then a Minister; he was still in opposition; this occurred prior to 1972-arrange d for his wife to be one of the phoney employees and as such she and her husband, who was a member of this Parliament, got concessions worth many thouployee, sands of dollars. Whether that was legal I do know. Whether it was for or against the law not know. But in point of moral fact it fraud. This man's wife put her husband-h being a member of this Parliament-forwar d as her dependent and got concessions for travel abroad. I have some detaUs of that here. I think might instance a case where on 23 MarchMr Keith Johnson- I rise to take a point of order. Does the honourable member continue to stand, or should he not resume his seat when point of order is raised?",49
143,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS," Order! The honourable member for Mackellar will resume his seat. The honourable member for Burke will make his point of order. Mr Keith Johnson-My point of order is that the honourable member is coming very close breaching the Standing Orders, if he has not done so already, by speaking about either present or former members of this Parhament and other people without proposing a substanhis em- tive motion. The matter that is before the House at the moment is the Travel Agents Bill. I believe that what the honourable member is trying to raise is in contravention of the Standing Orders in because the honourable member has not sought hapto move a substantive motion on the matter.",50
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I take the view that emup to now-and I have been watching this matter of very closely-the remarks of the honourable formember have been within the ambit of the second reading speech of the Minister. The honoura able member is deaUng with consumer interests, be the set-up of companies and, although I hesitate use his phrase, doubtful areas which can be involved within this industry. To this point the member has not offended in relation the point of order taken by the honourable member for Burke. I will watch his remarks carefuUy.",50
145,Mr WENTWORTH,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy It is Speaker. I am looking particularly in the relevance of the amendment that I will move, in A licensed travel agent shall keep a register showing of all concessional or free fares granted to his emor their dependents on his application or in conseof employment by him; such register shall be open to inspection by persons authorised by the Board. I wish to show that this amendment is necessary because of the corruption that has taken place in the past. Let me refer to a specific case. On 23 March 1972 the Pan American Airways organisation issued to this man's wife, as a phoney emand to him as a dependant of his wife, 2 not round tickets worth thousands of dollars for I do Sydney-Honolulu-Los Angeles-New York-Lonwas a don/London-New York-Lagos-New York-Los e Angeles/Los Angeles-Honolulu-Sydney. I am told, although I cannot prove it in this case, that Qantas issued other tickets on the same LATA I consideration and that many freeticketswere issued by Qantas, although I cannot give details of them. Subsequently-and I am referring now to a 1974, a later date-this man's wife obtained Pan-Am tickets for Sydney-Honolulu-Los Angeles-London-New York/New York-Los Angeles-Sydney for herself as a phoney employee and for him as a dependant. This was, I think, outrageous because at that time the man concerned was a Minister of this Government and favours were done by him for that woman to whom I mentioned earUer. He did these things, that I know of, for her. He arranged for her employment, when he became a Minister, at a very high salary in the PubUc Service in a place of great innuence. He had been as a private member receiving these improper favours from her. He was still receiving them as a Minister. Incredible though it may be, he was still receiving them as a Minister. I have referred to the favours,firston 23 March 1972 and second on 7 March 1974. I have been quite specific as to dates and as to facts. As to the favours that he did for her, he appointed her a marriage celebrant. He appointed her husband, for some quite inexplicable reason, as a member of the Films Board of Review. He wrote a letter to, I think, the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Bryant) asking for special concessions for her in regard to a flat in Canberra. These are the matters that are on the record and can be proved. But there are numbers of things which are believed to be true and which should be investigated-whic h will be investigated when we become the government and get access to thefiles-and which should be proved. All sorts of funny business about immigration permits are said to be in the pipeline, but of course the Government has the files. We cannot prove these, but the things that I have mentioned can be proved.",50
146,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS, Order! I think the honourable member would satisfy the Standing Orders better if he were to tie his argument more to the substance of the Bill instead of going too far into these matters.,51
147,Mr WENTWORTH,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I will tie this exactly to the substance of the Bill. I am tying it to the amendment which I propose to move to clause 38. You will notice, Mr Deputy Speaker, the long title of the Bill includes the words 'Relating to the Licensing of Travel Agents'. I am going to move an amendment to clause 38 which is specifically within the ambit of the long title and which refers particularly to the matter that I am now discussing.",51
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,Might I suggest that you tie your argument to the long title and leave debate on the amendment until we reach the Committee stage.,51
149,Mr WENTWORTH,ASSENT TO BILLS,"If you want that done, I will. I will not pursue the matter further if I can get an assurance from the Government that I will not be gagged in the Committee stage. Have I that assurance?",51
150,Mr COPE,ASSENT TO BILLS,How can we give you an assurance?,51
151,Mr WENTWORTH,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Mr Minister, have I that assurance? Mr Stewart-No , I cannot give you that assurance.",51
152,Mr WENTWORTH,ASSENT TO BILLS,If I cannot get that assurance I will have to take it up at this point. I have in my hand a photostat of the actual tickets which were issued by Pan American World Airways Inc. in what was perhaps not a legally fraudulent but a morally fraudulent manner to this man's wife and to him as a dependant ofhis wife. They are tickets verified by Ethiopian Airlines. Mr Donald Cameron-Whose name is on them?,51
153,Mr WENTWORTH,ASSENT TO BILLS,The names on them are Mrs Murphy and Senator Murphy. Mr Donald Cameron-Not the Justice?,51
154,Mr WENTWORTH,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I am not speaking about anything that happened after he was appointed to the High Court because that would be improper. I talk of what was happening before he was appointed to the High Court-whe n he was a senator and a senior Minister in this Government. I will say that at that time he was taking improper financial favours from Miss Morosi and that isMr Stewart- I raise a point of order. I think I have been more than reasonable in allowing this tirade to go on. If the matter which the honourable member is now talking about had any connection with this legislation I would not object, but he is using the legislation as a subterfuge in order to defame people outside the Parhament.",51
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,"If I may, I would just make a few remarks at this stage. The Ch'air is in a difficult position over this because there is not an attack, as I see it, on a sitting member. If anyone has any points of order they would seek to make I would like to Usten to them, but in the meantime as long as the honourable member does make an attempt to tie his remarks to the regulatory side of this Bill it is very difficult to rule him out of order. Mr Stewart-On the point of order, what you have said is the point that I take, that is, the honourable member should relate his remarks to the BUls. While he was talking about a list of discounts offered by travel agents then I beUeved this to be all right, but at the moment he is giving an example or a supposed example in which he is naming people. I doubt very much whether the documents he says he has are authentic.",51
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,I think the Minister had better keep to one point of order at a time. If you let me judge this I will try to look after your interests.,51
157,Mr WENTWORTH,ASSENT TO BILLS,"Speaking partly to the point of order, I have the documents here. They are authentic and I am happy to table them. Would the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) like me to table them?",51
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,Is leave granted? Mr Stewart-There is no objection.,52
159,Mr WENTWORTH,ASSENT TO BILLS,They are tabled. Mr Donald Cameron-Incorporat e them.,52
160,Mr WENTWORTH,ASSENT TO BILLS,"They are difficult to incorporate in Hansard because they are photostats and it would be very difficult to incorporate all the details on them in Hansard. They are tabled and are authentic. Here they are. They bear out exactly what I said. Free tickets worth some thousands of dollars, many thousands of dollars, were issued to this man's wife and to him as a dependant of his wife. It was a fraudulent employment. The tickets were first issued to him when he was a private member of the then Opposition and then when he was a senior Minister in this Government.",52
161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,I want the honourable member to tie his remarks to the Bill.,52
162,Mr WENTWORTH,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I tie them exactly to the Bill and I tie them in in this way. The debate on this Bill enables me to propose a certain amendment. The amendment relates, as I stated, to clause 38. If the Government had given me an assurance that I could speak to clause 381 would have been delighted to postpone my remarks but since the Government refuses to give me that assurance I have, perforce, to make my remarks here. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a practising member of this House will realise the position in which I am placed. If I had got the assurance of the Minister for Tourism and Recreation that I could speak to the clause I would have been happy to sit down. But since I have not got the Minister's assurance I think the facts have to be brought out now because this Government is riddled with corruption from top to bottom and always has been and that is of the utmost relevance. Motion (by Mr Cope) put: That the honourable member for Mackellar be not further heard. The House divided. (Mr SPEAKER - Hon. G. G. D. Scholes) Ayes Noes Majority NA Armitage, J.L. Adermann, A. E.

163,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PAIRS,"The 62 House has just been treated to the sort of scato55 logical contribution for which the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) is quite 7 infamous. The honourable member's favourite words are 'corruption', 'fraud', 'dishonest' and 'lies'. He uses these words by way of sneer and innuendo. None of them is based on fact. The honourable member supplies no evidence or substance. He just stands up and makes bald statements. He seeks to denigrate people's characters without any evidence at all. This is the sort of thing for which the honourable member has become infamous in this House. It seems that Opposition members support him because they voted in favour of his continuing with his diatribe. It is unfortunate that the level of debate in this House should have sunk to such a degree. Also it is unfortunate that the honourable member did not give us the benefit of his knowledge of the Travel Agents Bill instead of trying to take away the good character of some very honourable people in this country. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that travel agents are to a very large extent controlled. As I understand it, the ability to legislate for such trol has always rested with the States. In most instances the States have neglected to do very much about it, and again it has been left to the Australian Labor Party Government to come to the rescue of this country. One must ask: Why is it necessary to register travel agents? Why is it necessary to set up a board to exercise some sort of control over these people? It is pretty obvious that the Bill is not aimed at removing dishonest travel agents. Of course, they will be taken care of by the provisions of the Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that the very many honest and reputable travel agents in the community are supported by legislation in their endeavours and are protected from the fly-by-nights, the cutthroats and those who are liable to act in a dishonest way. We have all heard the stories and we know that they are true. People who have been stranded in Australia have come to my office to tell me about it. Some were people who came from Britain. They had been encouraged to come here and had made their bookings through travel agents in that country. Their passages had been booked with rather dubious airUnes and these people were stranded because the airlines that carried them here could not honour their obUgations to take them home. I am not sure of the position in relation to the registering of travel agents in Britain. We have a responsibUity to our citizens. More and more Australians are taking advantage of the extra leisure time avaUable to them to travel overseas to broaden their knowledge, to experience conditions in other countries in order to come back better informed. In order to do so they need to use the services of travel agents. As I understand the statistics, most travellers are making their first voyage overseas. There are very few people in Australia who able to make the necessary arrangements to travel overseas by air or by sea, to arrange accommodation and transport in those countries, and to do the myriad of things that we take for granted in our own nation because we are familiar with them-the myriad of tilings that must be done in order to move from one place to another. Therefore they rely on travel agents. What is required to set oneself up as a travel agent? Only the abUity to pay the rental for a shop, to have the front window of the shop painted out. To me and to the Government that seems to be a rather unsatisfactory way of going about it. The travel agent places himself in a position whereby people accept him at face value. A friend of mine was going to Malta not so very long ago. He booked his passage through a travel conagency in Melbourne and the agency did not do the right thing by him. Fortunately my friend is a very resourceful person and he was able to resolve the situation. But if he had not been so resourceful he could well have forfeited the money he had paid to the travel agent to take him to Malta and bring him back again. The honourable member for SculUn, Dr Jenkins, told me at lunch time today about a travel agent in Australia- I have been told this by other people although I have not experienced it myself-making double bookings of accommodation and double bookings of transport. Australian citizens travelling abroad whose passage and accommodation have been booked by travel agents in Australia sometimes find themselves unable to get on the aircraft because the seats have been taken by somebody who made a prior booking. Some have been unable to sleep in hotel rooms because those rooms have been occupied by other people. They have been left in very dire and difficult circumstances in countries as far as 12 000 miles away. Quite often the travellers were left in a country where the language was not farruliar to or spoken by the traveller, in a country where the habits and practices were unfamUiar to the traveller. So some very heart rending moments are caused to some people by travel agents not behaving in a responsible manner. I just want to make it clear time and time and over and over again-(Quoru m formed). I am very pleased that the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) was so entranced by the pearls of wisdom dropping from my lips that he thought I should have an audience to hear me. Mr Donald Cameron- I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I did not say anyare thing. I did not call for the quorum.",52
164,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, Order! I suggest that the honourable member for Burke gets on with his speech.,54
165,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PAIRS,"If I am not interrupted, Mr Deputy Speaker, I shall continue. The need for travel agents to be registered and for there to be a board to enforce that registration is obvious, I think, to all members of the House. Of course the reputable travel agents will not care; it is the disreputable agents who will worry. The reputable agents will expect to be made accountable for the giving of misinformation or any other malpractice that causes a traveller to suffer. As I understand the speech of the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson) on 16 October, apart from minor amendments that will be moved by the Government and some inconsequential amendments that will be moved by the Opposition, the Bill in fact has no opposition in this House. The Opposition is quite happy to allow this measure to go through in its amended form. The Opposition is aware of the proposed amendments. According to the honourable member for MCPherson on 16 October, that is the case. Such being the case I think there is Uttle need for me to pursue ter any further or to convince the House of the wisdom of this measure. I think it is well known to it. In order to conserve time. I leave the matter there and commend the measure to the House.",54
166,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS," Mr so Deputy Speaker, having been misrepresented I thereand wish to make a personal explanation.",54
167,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS," Does Mr DONALD the honourable member claim to have been much, misrepresented?",54
168,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"Yes. The honourable sake member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) who just sat down said that I had spoken by innuendo and without adequate proof. Nothing could be That further from the truth. The actual tickets photostat copies of them have been laid on table of the House and they are there as absolute proof. The favours that were given, Sir, are ters of pubhc record.",54
169,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The his honourable member will resume his seat. I call the honourable member for Griffith. Motion (by Mr Nicholls) agreed to: That the question be now put. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Clause 1 (Short title).,54
170,Mr DONALD CAMERON,PAIRS,"Griffith) (3.45)Clause 1 states: This Act may be cited as the Travel Agents Act 1975. I regret very much that the Government Whip saw fit to terminate the second reading debate by gagging the whole business. More than any other person in this Parliament, I am responsible through my early agitation, for a Bill such as this coming before the Parliament. It was at the beginning of 1972 that I brought to this chamber the very sad news that many Australians were suffering as a result of the activities of Travel House of Australia. The speeches I made in April and March of 1972 are recorded in Hansard and recall those very tragic times when Australians were stranded both here and abroad because of the activities of a number of dubious people who were the directors of this company, Travel House of Australia. Mr Morris- Mr Chairman, Iriseon a point of order. The clause before the Committee, clause 1, states: This Act may be cited as the Travel Agents Act 1975. I submit that the matter being put before the the matCommittee by the honourable member for Griffith is not relevant to that clause, and I ask that you rule accordingly.",54
171,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"! cannot uphold the point of order. The honourable member far has related his activity to the title of the Bill, provided he does not stray from that is no substance to the point of order. CAMERON-Thank you very Mr Chairman. You are becoming more highly regarded every day on both sides of the chamber for your fairness and wisdom. For the of the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) I am trying to put the case why the Act should be called the Travel Agents Act 1975. is a most appropriate name. I recall that in or 1972 the chairman of the travel company to the which I have referred challenged me to make outside the House accusations I had made in the matHouse. It was around that time that he was saying that he would give the public more detaUs of company's activities if I would repeat the charges outside the House so that he could sue me and thus recoup the losses which he would incur as a result of making available to the public matters confidential to the company. Fortunately I was given the protection of this chamber and the Minister for Tourism at that time commenced the task of bringing to the Parliament a Bill now entitled the Travel Agents Bill. In Committee I truly commend the present Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) for the way in which he has obviously sought out the views not only of the various State governments but also of the travel industry. It is remarkable that we have at least one Minister in the present Government who has had the foresight and the brains to seek out the views of others. The fact that we on the Opposition side are simply proposing amendments in the Committee stage indicates that, when Ministers of the government are prepared to seek co-operation and the views of others, they have a far greater chance of success than those who simply bulldoze their way along the path. I trust that the Minister will take into consideration the various amendments that the Opposition will move during the Committee stage. There are a number of weaknesses in the Bill that was presented and read for a first time in this Parliament on 6 March. I know that amendments are now proposed by both sides. We must have healthy discussion and, furthermore, after this legislation has been operative for some time the Parhament should be prepared to bring it back, to see where the weaknesses exist and amend it accordingly.",54
172,Mr CONNOLLY,PAIRS," our Although I have been prevented by the Governtal ment from speaking during the second reading debate on the Travel Agents Bill 1975,I wish address some general remarks to Part 1. Firstly, compliment the Minister for Tourism and present Recreation (Mr Stewart) on the initiation of this legislation and in particular the manner in which he has gone out ofhis way to consider both",55
173,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! I that remind the honourable member that we are dealing with clause 1 and not Part 1.,55
174,Mr CONNOLLY,PAIRS,"Yes, clause 1 of Part 1. the The Minister has gone out of his way to discuss with the industry and with members on both sides of this House the various aspects legislation with the object of getting the best possible legislation on the statute books. Nevertheless, in the course of the debate in the Committee stage I will be making various suggestions in relation to the tightening up of certain clauses of the Bill because we are dealing with an indusbent, try which can best be called a growth industry every sense of the term. At least 1500 agencies are known to exist in Australia. As has been pointed out already so eloquently by the preplaces vious speaker, the honourable member Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron), the history certain persons and companies which were in this industry have certainly not been to the overown all benefit of their clients or to the Australian travel industry at large. Australia has one of the highest rates of overseas travel per capita in the entire Western world. This is to be expected. Many young Australians regard it as part of their normal activity to travel overseas, particularly to Europe, to see from where their parents, their grandparents or their ancestors originally came. That tendency must be encouraged. Nevertheless it is also very important that young Australians in particular should be given every opportunity to see more of their own country. I am afraid that this is an area in which incentive is lacking at present because the costs of domestic travel are going so high that it is becoming more and more difficult for the average Australian on a decent average income to be able to take his family for a reasonable distance around Australia. This has resulted unfortunately in a tendency for so many of the Australian people to conclude that the nation begins in Adelaide and ends in Brisbane and that there is not very much on the other side. We have a huge continent. If we are to break away from the syndrome of developing only in major city areas and around the eastern coasfringe it is essential that more Australians be given every opportunity to travel to the west into particular and to northern Australia, the NorthI ern Territory and northern Queensland. At the opportunities do not exist. Put in quite simple mathematical terms, it is cheaper now to take a family for a visit to Noumea than it is to go to northern Queensland. WhUst that type of situation is allowed to persist- I might add it has been created by the incredible inflationary pressures which are being brought to bear upon this nation in the last few years as a result of the Government's mismanagement of economy-it will be very difficult indeed for any government to overcome this fundamental problem unless we can get this country's econof this omy once again on a reasonable level. Another problem which we are facing in terms of international travel is that the International Air Transport Association regulations are being to put it quite mildly, by many companies in in a deliberate attempt to overcome international agreements and to grasp a larger section of the market. Unfortunately there are people in high within Australia, as has been pointed out for so aptly by the honourable member for of Mackellar (Mr Wentworth), who are also prepared to bend the regulations to achieve their ends. This has resulted in many not needing to buy overseas travel tickets but being given tickets for services rendered.",55
175,Mr CALDER,PAIRS," I should like to speak briefly to this clause only cause, by reason of the gagging of the debate, I did not get a chance to speak during the second reading debate. The tourist industry Northern Territory and is especially so now since various actions of the Government have brought to their knees the 2 major industries in the Northern Territory, the mining industry and the pastoral industry. So, we are clinging to the tourist industry. Although the Bill is commendable in many ways it shows a great interest of the Government in taking control of the whole industry. We see in this Bill, as we have seen many Bills coming through this House since this Government has been in office, clauses stating that the Minister shall do this and the Minister shall do that, stating virtually that the Government is taking control. The Government took control of the National Parks and Wildlife Service to the detriment of the national park and wildlife sanctuaries and areas in the Northern Territory. The same thing happened with the Bill confor cerning the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. The Government did virtually the same as it intending to do with this Bill. As a result six seven ministries were involved in the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, and it was a failure and a farce. The same thing happened in the Racial Discrimination Bill where the Minister and the Commissioner had overpowering and tremendous powers. In this Bill the Government is giving private enterprise httle or no chance to develop with its knowledge and its ability business in this area. Only last week the Aborigithe nal Land (Northern Territory) Bill came into House. Throughout that whole Bill there are references to the Minister.",56
176,Mr COPE,PAIRS,I take a point of order.,56
177,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! I was just about to comment to the honourable ber for the Northern Territory that he had spent a great deal of time in his introductory remarks. suggest that he apply himself to clause 1 Bill.,56
178,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS," I now agree with what the honourable member for be supported. Bradfield (Mr Connolly) and the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) have been saying about the necessity to foster travel within the confines of Australia itself. Travel, so far as Australia is concerned, should be a 2-way affair. Naturally we want visitors come to Australia and naturally Australians want to go abroad, but the foundation of travel industry should be in Australia. I suppose that, with the exception of the honourable membeber for the Northern Territory and the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), I would know the north of Australia better than any peris vital to the son in this House. Mr Stewart-Can I give you a freeticket?You can go back there.",56
179,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"I understand the Minister's motives. I feel, in all seriousness, that we should be paying more attention to the development of travel fatilities in Australia. I am not saying for one moment that Australians should not in so go abroad, but what we should do is balance up our travel so that the amount spent by Australians overseas will be counterbalanced by the amount spent by people from overseas coming to Australia. We have tremendous advantages here, advantages of space and distance. There are things in Australia which are very much worth seeing for the world traveller. I agree entirely with the point of view put forward by the honourable member Bradfield and the honourable member for the Northern Territory. I hstened with interest to is what the honourable member for Griffith (Mr or Donald Cameron) was saying about the origins of this Bill. I know the tremendous interest which he personally has been showing in this area. It is true that in 1972 before the change of government he was active in promoting the idea which has been taken up belatedly by the Government in this Bill. I think credit should be given to him for that. But I do not believe that this idea would in have been coming forward had it not been that Government knew very well the kind of the fraud and corruption that was instanced in the chain of Morosi compames and which this Bill seems designed to overcome. At least the Government has learnt from its intimate association with these matters what should be done. For that some thanks should be given to the memGovernment and perhaps even to the Morosi companies. The bad example may at least have I been sufficient to spur the Government on to do of the what the honourable member for Griffith suggested in 1972 and which comes to fruition in 1975. In general, of course this Bill should",56
180,Mr OKEEFE,PAIRS," I should like to. speak briefly to clause 1 of the Travel Agents Bill 1975.I am very pleased indeed that this Bill has at last reached the debating stage. It has to been on the program on many occasions, only to be deleted for what was apparently thought by the the Government to be more important legislation. The travel agent industry in this country is a big industry with some 1500 travel agents. It is worth $400m to the nation, so it is very important. As a member representing in this Parhament a huge country electorate I know that there are many travel agents throughout the Paterson electorate who make a contribution to the industry. They are pleased that this Bill has been brought forward. They are pleased in the main with the clauses of the Bill. I hope that the Bill will pass through this House and become law because it will protect both the travel agents and the clients of the travel agents. As the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) said, we have had instances of clients going overseas and being stranded destitute there because of the failure, financially, of the travel firm back home. This Bill will take care of that matter and will be a protection for both the travel agents in this industry and those using the services of those agents.",56
181,Mr KATTER,PAIRS," I shall be very brief. There is only one aspect that I should hke to stress in regard to the Travel Agents Bill, and that is my hope that it does not become so sophisticated and its requirements do not become so complicated as to make it very difficult for travel agents in the remote areas of the country to handle because they cannot employ large staffs and so on. I say this, keeping in mind that all surveys made overseas- I think that Qantas Airways Ltd and other such organisations could confirm this-hav e indicated that the major Australian attractions, particularly to visitors from the United States, are the Great Barrier Reef and all it has to offer and the Centre. When I say the Centre I do not mean precisely AUce Springs and that particular area, but the inland generally. I suggest that when this Bill is implemented there be close dialogue and discussion with people who are on the spot, who understand and know where there are centres of tremendous attraction that are different from anything else offering in any other part of the world. I say again that surveys which have been carried out to gauge the interest of people indicate in an overwhelming manner that people are interested in the Great Barrier Reef with all its unique features and in what is offering in the inland, which is obviously unique. Clause agreed to. Clause 2 agreed to. Clause 3. (1) In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears'Australia' includes a prescribed external Territory; 'bank' means a bank as denned by section S of the ing Act 1959-1974;",57
182,Mr STEWART,PAIRS," I move: Omit the definition of'bank', substitute the following definition: ' ""bank"" means(a) a bank as defined by section 5 of the Banking Act 1959-1974; or (b) a bank established by a State Act;'. Most of the amendments that I shall move on behalf of the Government seek to improve the Bill either as a result of representations made by the industry itself, by State governments, by State banks or by members of the Opposition. Most of the amendments are machinery measures. This amendment concerns State banks which were overlooked. The amendment proposes to allow travel agents to maintain statutory accounts with either a bank as denned by the Banking Act or with a State bank.",57
183,Mr CALDER,PAIRS,"Northern Territory) (4.5)Clause 3 of the Bill deals with definitions or interpretations. Very many names are Usted. But I note that there is no definition of the Minister'. This problem has arisen before in other BUls before the House. I cite the Darwin Reconstruction Commission Bill. Opposition members were very strong in their protestations that there should be a definition of 'the Minister' in that Bill. In its lack of wisdom, the Government overruled our protests. In the ensuing shambles six or seven Ministers all entered into the activities of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. I am only trying to help the Government by raising this matter now because no definition of the Minister' is given. Might I suggest that the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart), who is at the table, has been very able and sympathetic with regard to tourism and 'the Minister' in this clause should be defined as 'the Minister for Tourism and Recreation'.",57
184,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"I wish to raise one matter really by way of question. I do not have a view on it at the moment. I agree with the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) that the amendment he has moved to clause 3 is an improvement. I would certainly want to support it. I am wondering whether we should not perhaps even enlarge it a little and say: 'a bank approved by the Minister'. After all, this is a Bill which relates to tourism not only in Australia but also outside Australia. I am not quite clear whether what is proposed would be good or bad. I am simply asking the Minister whether he might consider- I am not pressing Bankit-addin g a further subclause to be called (c) which will provide 'a bank approved from time to time by the Mmister'. I ask him in that respect: What would he hke to do?",57
185,Mr STEWART,PAIRS," I think honourable members will find that banks are denned in the Banking Act. Both the previous Government and this Government have restricted the use of the word 'bank'. Travel agents will be entitled to operate through all banks which are in operation in Australia at the moment. State banks were not covered in the Banking Act but, as a result of this amendment, they will now be covered in this legislation. All banks now operating in Austraha will be so covered providing that their franchise allows them to carry this sort of business. They will be entitled to operate under this legislation if they so qualify. If any new banks are recognised in the future, I feel that they would be covered by the Banking Act.",58
186,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"Mackellar) (4.8)Perhaps I have not explained my view to the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart). I was asking particularly about overseas banks which are operating in Australia, for example, the Comptoir National d'Escompte de Paris. Would that bank be included in this Bill? After all, we are deaUng with tourists who are coming from overseas. We are trying to induce them to come to Australia. I do not have a fixed view about this. I am asking the Minister whether such overseas banks which have branches in Sydney or Melbourne, for example, would come under this definition and, if not, whether they should.",58
187,Mr STEWART,PAIRS,"Yes . If such banks are covered by the Banking Act and are allowed to participate in trading bank and savings bank activities they would be. If they were operating in Australia for other reasons, they would not be. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 4.

189,Mr STEWART,PAIRS," I move: After 'meals,' insert 'at premises of which he is the owner,'. After sub-clause (3) add the following sub-clause: '(4) For the purposes of this Act, a person is the owner of premises if, and only if, he holds a prescribed interest in the premises.'. These amendments to clause (4) are intended to extend the appUcation of the concept of ownership mentioned in subclause (2) (a) to the provisions of meals and accommodation as set out in subclause (2) (b). The amendments will restrict meals and accommodation referred to in clause 4 (2) (b) to meals and accommodation provided by the operator at premises he owns. This is to safeguard the operators who are only carriers and are not providing meals as well. Amendments agreed to. Clause 4, as amended, agreed to. Clause 5.

These amendments are designed to exclude the authorities of a State from the appUcation of the Act. It seems to us that there is no need for this Act to include the question of the law of a State. So the 2 amendments are designed to omit the words 'by a law of a State' in sub-clause 4 (a) and the words 'or a State' in sub-clause 4 (b). I would Uke the Minister for Tourism and Recreation to explain to me, if he does not accept these amendments, why he sees the need for the words which we suggest should be omitted to stand part of the Bill.",58
192,Mr STEWART,PAIRS," I do not think that State-owned, government-owned and operated tourist bureaus should be exempted. Action will be taken to exempt them under the regulations. Those not constituted under Acts are probably outside the scope of the legislation in any case, but we will look at this when we are casting the regulations.",59

This amendment provides for the appointment of up to 7 representatives of travel agents as Court, of deputy members of the Travel Agents RegulaState or tion Board. The practical effect of the amend5 years. ment is to enable any one of the deputy members to attend a meeting of the Board when the principal member representing the travel agents is absent. Instead of people having to attend all the meetings of the Board, if the principal member is away he may nominate one of the 7 deputy members so that the Board can then hear the case whether it is being heard in Perth, KalgoorUe, Brisbane or anywhere else.",59
198,Mr DONALD CAMERON,PAIRS,"This amendment no doubt effects an improvement to the original Bill which was presented to the Parliament last March, but I question the wisdom ofhaving a 3-man Board with a chairman who has to be a legal practitioner of the High Court or another Federal court, supreme court, etc., a deputy chairman and just one other person. I do not believe that the travel industry will get sufficient representation on the Board that the Government proposes to set up under this legislation. I am not in a position to move any amendment to the suggestion made by the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) but I would appreciate some explanation, firstly, for why the Board is to be such a smaU body, and, secondly, why the Government is insisting that the Chairman must be a legal practitioner of the High Court, etc. To my mind this wiU not be the type of job that necessarily requires a person to have a legal background. To my mind this area need not be so restrictive as the Minister suggests it should be in this Bill.",60
199,Mr CALDER,PAIRS," I support the remarks of my colleague the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) about the 3-man board. I wonder where free enterprise is to get in on this business. After all tourism to a large extent is a free enterprise business and it would be hoping to getfinancialsupport from the Government. We see by clause 8(5) that this legal identity referred to earlier, the chairman, and the board shall be appointed by the Minister. Further we find that the deputy chairman shaU be appointed by the Minister. So three members out of three are to be appointed by the Minister. I think that this smacks of sociaUsing the entire industry. What is more, this will not work. The organisation set up under the Bill relating to national parks and wildlife is falling apart in one of the main areas of Australia because of this very reason. The Government has too large afingerin that pie. There are to be 7 deputies-this is an improvement but not much-so that there can be one from each State as the Board moves around but who is to appoint them? Are these to be niinisterial appointments also? I take it that they are. I warn the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) that although the intentions behind this Bill are good there is no earthly hope that it will work if all three Board members are to be appointed by the Minister.",60
200,Mr CONNOLLY,PAIRS," I wish to add my voice to the very real complaint which has just been made by my friend the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) and my colleague the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron). In relation to clause 8 (4) the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) pointed out in one of his amendments that he proposed to have 7 deputy members. Unlike the rest of the text, however, he has not gone into detaU to explain to the Committee precisely on what basis the 7 members are to be appointed. I would hope, and I know that the Australian Federation of Travel Agents would join me, since its members are, after all, the travel industry, that it would be in a position to have some say as to who are to represent it on the board. I think it is also worth pointing out to the Committee that a board of a mere 3 people is most uncharacteristic of the size of the boards, commissions of inquiry, etc., which have been the hallmark of this present administration for some 3 years. Perhaps the Minister for Tourism and Recreation could advise us why he believes the industry which is extremely diverse and has something Uke 1500 registered agencies, should be in a position where it is unable to co-ordinate except through a miniscule organisation, a board of a mere 3 people. I also wish to point out, and I emphasise this, that Australia is a huge country and every State has its unique difficulties in most fields, and certainly tourism is one of them. I would have thought that if a board of this type were to be truly effective there would be considerable advantage to have on it a professional member of the industry representing each of the States. I agree with the Minister that if these people cannot attend, there is a case for deputy members to take their places. But I have considerable doubts as to whether or not a committee of three, all of whom as the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) has pointed out are to be elected by the Government, is in any sense fair to the industry itself. The Minister should not want to surround himself unduly with sycophants. Surely the Minister should have a cross-fertUisation of ideas from all sections of the industry. Consequently I seriously question for the benefit of the Minister whether such a small board, and on the basis which he proposes to appoint it, would be an adequate supervising body for the industry.",60
201,Mr DONALD CAMERON,PAIRS,Griffith) (4.21 ) Before the Mixiister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) rises to answer some points that have have been raised I would like to leave with him the thought that the travel industry is the most competitive industry in the world. A Bill has been introduced to shut out shysters but it should not have the effect of putting so many ties less upon those honest people who are in the industry that their jobs become,61
202,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! We are dealing with clause 8.,61
203,Mr DONALD CAMERON,PAIRS,"Yes, I will come to that.",61
204,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,The clause is concerned with the composition of the Board. The honourable member is rather straying away from this subject matter.,61
205,Mr DONALD CAMERON,PAIRS,"I can understand that you are finding my argument difficult to follow, but the point I am making is that the Board should be enlarged. A few short years ago the board of Qantas Airways Ltd was made up of Sir Roland Wilson, a retired banking official who was at that time, I think, the Chairman; Captain Ritchie-and I am not casting aspersions on these people-and a group of other people many of whom had public service type backgrounds. Many of these people were hopeless when it came to understanding the competitiveness of the airline industry. Qantas went backwards until such time as substantial changes were made to the board and the company reviewed its policies and introduced charter flights, package tours and so on. It was only then that the company turned the corner and came back up again. The legislation proposes the appointment of members of the board, two of whom are to be people with legal backgrounds, although I fess that the amendment also proposes that have some knowledge of the travel industry. The deputy chairman will also be appointed by the Minister. We will be lucky if any of the apThe pointees has any working understanding of the travel business. If they do not understand business they will be over-restrictive on the promotional activities of the travel agents throughout Australia. This was not my intention when I fought to have this legislation introduced back in 1972. My intention was simply to stop shysters. I warn the Minister that we could well be overdoing it in the amendment now before us.",61
206,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PAIRS,"The Opposition supports the amendment although the concern expressed by the position is real enough and the Minister knows that this was one matter which the travel agents themselves were very concerned about. The Minister has spoken to them on a number of occasions about it, as have Senator Rae and myself. Sub-clause 8 (6) of the amendment states: A person is not eligible to be appointed as the member referred to in paragraph (1) (c) or as a deputy member unhe has a knowledge of, and experience concerning, the business of travel agents. To help the Committee would the Minister be prepared to indicate with regard to this subclause whether he will see that, firstly, the States are represented and, secondly, that the industry is widely represented?",61
207,Mr STEWART,PAIRS," I had a really good look at this clause before I decided to amend it. I thought that we had covered most of the complaints that had been made to us in the amendments that I have moved. I now have some doubt that the legislation may be too restrictive. The reason the Board is to be a 3-member board is that only in the initial stages will it be sitting regularly. In the initial stages the members will be travelUng to all States and perhaps to various parts of the States. Do we want 10 representatives running around for 15 months and then sitting there, not being used again? It is proposed that the chairman will have a legal background because the Board is likely to be used afterwards for hearing appeals and so forth. The deputy chairman is proposed to be an officer of the Department of Tourism and Recreation because the general administration of the Board will be carried out by that Department. There is to be one other member. I take the point that has been made: I am prepared to trust myself to do the right thing. But would I be prepared to trust some other member-for instance, cona member of the Opposition or an honourable they member from the Government side? Perhaps something could be said there. I will make no promises. The matter will need to be looked at. third member should specifically be, as the amendment suggests, a person with a knowledge the of and experience concerning the business of travel agents. It is my intention to write to the Australian National Travel Association asking it to submit a couple of names from each State because I want to cut down on the amount of travel involved. If there were deputy members in each State, a replacement, who would be a representative of the travel industry, would be avaUable if needed.",61
208,Mr CONNOLLY,PAIRS,"I would Oplike to comment on the remarks made by the well Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart). I can see a slight inconsistency in the proposal to have 3 members, one of whom will be a lawyer, another will be a member of the Pubhc Service and the third is denned in a somewhat amorphous manner as being someone with experience of the industry. From what the Minister just said I cannot help but conclude that the only person who will be transferable will be the third person, because there is no provision for the term 'deputy members' to replace the chairman, a lawyer, or to the second person, who will be a public servant. If it applies to only one person I question seriously whether the exercise is worthwhile. I think it would be much better to have a broader based board with one representative from each State, on the board or any other wider formula. I do not believe that a board of 3 would work.

211,Mr DONALD CAMERON,PAIRS," Committee. Clause 11 as it now stands concerns me greatly in that it states: The Minister may remove a member other than deputy chairman from office for misbehaviour or physical mental incapacity. The point that causes me concern is the inclusion of the word 'misbehaviour'. If a Minister is given that power to remove somebody for misbehavgranted iour it becomes a case of what he regards as misother behaviour. There is absolutely no appeal for that person. If there were a Minister who never touched liquor, for instance, who observed a member of the Board drinking alcohol he might say: 'That man is misbehaving. Therefore, out the door he goes'. I am not suggesting that the present Minister is likely to exercise that right. ask the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) and the shadow Minister at the table, other Acts. the honourable member for MCPherson, Mr Eric Robinson, to take on board the suggestion that we move for the deletion of 'misbehaviour' or alternatively define it far better than at present because that is a very dangerous word to put an Act and could lead to almost anything.",63
212,Mr CONNOLLY,PAIRS,"I also have some confusions regarding clause 11 (2). I take it that the Minister for Tourism and Recreation would confirm that the reason he has forber mulated clause 11 in this way is that Deputy Chairman is to be a pubhc servant under otherwise the Public Service Act the Minister has no power other of dismissal. But presumably if the Deputy of Chairman did conduct himself in a manner not to his befitting his position or because or mental incapacity, he could be removed by the Secretary of the Department. Mr Stewart- I refer the honourable member to clause 8 (7).",63
213,Mr CONNOLLY,PAIRS,"I thank the Minister. I also refer to the earher point made by the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) that there does not appear to be any basis for appeal under clause 13. Perhaps the Minister could exto attend a meeting of the Board; plain that. I am particularly concerned about clause 13(2) which appears to be somewhat inconsistent with what was earher said in relation to clause 8. If the third member of this Board is to be someone who is experienced in the travel agency business there is surely every reason to and place fixed for holding the presume that unless he is a retired person, which he cannot be because if he is over 65 years of age he cannot serve, the only people who will be properly quaUfied to serve on this Board would be practising travel agents. But according to subclause (2) such people are definitely removed meeting and shall, for the purfrom their capacity to sit on this Board. Perhaps the Minister could elucidate that point to the",63
214,Mr STEWART,PAIRS,"The word 'misbehavor iour' is generally the wording used in other Acts. It is a normal standard provision. Clause 13 (1) (b) deals with a member of the Board being absent on 3 consecutive meetings except on leave by the Minister. That is a provision in Acts. For instance, if one of the members of the Reserve Bank Board is to be absent from one meeting the Minister has to give him permission to be absent from that meeting. If someone from this Board is absent from 3 meetings without leave granted by the Minister it is an indication that he is not serving the Board or representing I the industry. So I feel that that provision is not unwarranted at all. I believe that it is found in",63
215,Mr CONNOLLY,PAIRS,"The Minister still has not commented on sub-clause (2) of clause 13, which is in its own way even in more important than the other 2 sub-clauses in that it is basically inconsistent with the provisions of clause 8.",63
216,Mr STEWART,PAIRS,"If the honourable memfor Bradfield (Mr Connolly) reads on he will if the see that sub-clause (2) states: than as a member of, and in common with the members of, an incorporated company which consists not less than 25 persons and of which he is not a director, shall, as soon as possible after the relevant facts have come knowledge, disclose the nature of his interest at a of some physical meeting of the Board. This again is a general provision that before a member of the Board can participate in discussions he has to disclose his interests. A new appointee to the Reserve Bank Board, before taking up his appointment, wanted that exact position clarified. Amendments agreed to. Clauses, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 10 to 19-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 20.

217,Mr STEWART,PAIRS," I move: Omit sub-clause (3), substitute the following sub-clause: '(3) Sub-section (1) and (2) do not apply in relation to the business of a travel agent carried on at premises otherwise than under the immediate control manager(a) if the business is so carried on with the approval of the Board; or (b) if the business is so stances and the prescribed conditions (if any) applicable in respect of those circumstances are complied with.' The purpose of this amendment is to enable regulations to be made to cover special circumstances under which a licensed travel agency may be conducted other than under the immediate control of a registered for example, during short absences of that registered travel agent manager. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 21 to 24-by leave-take n together.",64
218,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PAIRS," I ask the Minister a question in relation to clause 21, which states: A natural person who has attained the age of 21 years may make application to the Board as prescribed for registration as a travel agent manager. Has any thought been given to reducing that age to 18 years?",64
219,Mr STEWART,PAIRS,"Though t was given to reducing the age. The Bill provides that before a person may become a travel agent manager he must have had 12 months experience in the business. These days most young people do not leave school until they are 17 or 18 years of age. They need 12 months experience in the business before they can apply for registration as a travel agent manager, and it was felt that the extra couple of years was necessary to give them the necessary experience. They will be handling other persons' funds and trust accounts. I have to be careful that I do not discourage our young people between 18 and 21 years of age, but it was thought that for the sake of safety the age should be 21 years. Clause agreed to. Clause 25. (2) An application under sub-section (1 )(a) shall state the name under which the applicant proposes to carry on business as a travel agent; (b) shall specify(i) if the applicant proposes to cany on business as a travel agent at 2 or more premises-the address of the principal premises, and of the branch or each of the branches, at which the applicant proposes so to carry on business as a travel agent; or (ii) in any other case-the address of the premises at which the applicant proposes to carry on business as a travel agent; of a registered travel agent (4) An application under this section by a partnership shall specify the name of the partner who is to be the holder of the licence on behalf of the partnership. carried on in prescribed circum",64
220,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"Is it appropriate that the 2 circulated Opposition amendments be considered together? There being no objection, that course will be followed.",64
221,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PAIRS," I move: In sub-clause (2), after paragraph (b), insert the following travel agent manager, paragraph: '(ba) shall set out, or be accompanied by a document setting out, particulars of the premises or of each of the premises, as the case may be, at which the applicant proposes to carry on business as a travel agent, being particulars furnished with a view to sausfying the Board that the premises, or each of the premises, are suitable premises in which to carry on the business of a travel agent;' After sub-clause (4) add the following sub-clause: '(5) An applicant for the grant of a licence or licences shall, at least 7 days before furnishing his application to the Registrar in accordance with this section, cause a notice of his intention to make the application containing the prescribed particulars of the application to be published in a newspaper or in newspapers, as prescribed.'. The clause sets out the requirements when people are making appUcations for a Ucence. It is the view of a number of people in the industry and of the Opposition that the Government ought to consider setting out in some manner the particulars of the premises or of each of the premises, as the case may be, at which the applicant proposes to carry on business as a travel agent, being particulars furnished with a view to satisfying the Board that the premises, or each of the premises, are suitable premises in which to carry on the business of a travel agent. I would like the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) to respond as to whether he would see a requirement for this sort of approach in the Bill. The second amendment requires that an appliwhether cant for the grant of a Ucence or licences shall, least 7 days before furnishing his application the registrar in accordance with this section, forth? cause a nouce of his intention to make an application containing the prescribed particulars of appUcation to be published in a newspaper newspapers as prescribed. We feel that these would both be desirable amendments which travel would ensure greater standards in the Bill as regards the requirements to obtain a Ucence as a travel agent. I would like the Minister for ism and Recreation and the Government to give consideration to their inclusion.",64
222,Mr STEWART,PAIRS,"Wit h regard to subthe clause (2), the standards for hcensed premises have been put to us by the industry. The national body for the industry, the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, specifies the standard of premises which it requires before a travel agent is allowed to join the Federation. We hope that when the Board(1) this legislation comes into operation people will cation be starting out in business on their own. If they resources are to be successful travel agents perhaps they cant will be very quick to join AFTA. We feel that premises there is no need for government to enter this preserve and to say: 'You shall have premises of such and such a size or of such and such a standard'. We still want the travel industry to operate with a measure of freedom. We do not want to tie it right down. If prospective travel agents are to be registered by government and to be approved by their federation, 2 bodies will be looking at them to see whether they are the right type of person. I believe it can be taken for granted that once they have faced 2 scrutinies they will make certain that their premises are up to standard because from the date of operation of this measure they will be liable to pay compensation if they are not efficient operators; and efficient operators would normally have reasonable premises. With regard to the second proposed amendment, it has been the experience of government for a longtimethat pubUc notices are rarely read. I think this could be demonstrated if I were to duct a quiz here- I do not want hands up-by asking how long it is since any of us have read a public notice. We again want to cut out the expenditure and the troubles which applicants for a Ucence might have to face.",65
223,Mr CONNOLLY,PAIRS, I have a small question seeking elucidation. For perfectly natural reasons the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) has had considerable discussions with the Australian Federation of Travel Agents. Can the Minister explain to us travel agents who are not members of at AFTA are to be required to abide by AFTA conto ditions in relation to accommodation and so,65
224,Mr STEWART,PAIRS," I would not expect them to be so required, but to become registered agents or travel agency managers they will need to be a particular type of person. I feel that we can run the risk for a little time to see whether Tourthose people who become registered travel agents have premises of a desired standard or whether it wiU be necessary to amend the Act. I think we will find that most people who get a agent's registration will automatically join Australian Federation of Travel Agents. Amendments negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 26. Subject to this section, where application is made to under section 25, the Board shall grant the appliif the applicant satisfies the Board that the financial of the applicant are sufficient to enable the applito carry on business as a travel agent efficiently at the specified in the applicadon in accordance with paragraph 25 (2) (b) and also satisfies the Board(a) if the applicant is a natural person-that the applicant is a person of business integrity; (b) if the applicant is a company(i) that each director of the company is a person of business integrity; (ii) that the company has, apart from this Act, the legal capacity to carry on business as a travel agent; and (iii) that the company is entitled to carry on business in the State or Territory, or in each State or Territory, in which it proposes to carry on business as a travel agent; or (c) if the applicant is a partnership(i) in respect of each member of the partnership (if any) who is a natural person-that he is a person of business integrity; and (ii) in respect of each member of the partnership (if any) that is a company-that the requirements of paragraph (b) are fulfilled in respect of the company.",65
225,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PAIRS," I move: In sub-clause (1) after '25 (2) (b)' insert 'and that the premises or each of the premises so specified are suitable premises in which to carry on the business of a travel agent'. This amendment follows from the previous amendment. The same argument as was used previously would apply here. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 27 and 28-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 29. (3) Sub-section 25 (5) applies in relation to the signature of an application under this section in like manner as it applies in relation to the signature section 25.",65
226,Mr STEWART,PAIRS," I move: Omit sub-clause (3). Sub-clause 29 (3) is redundant since sub-clause 25 (5) referred to no longer applies. Sub-clause 25 (5) was redrafted as sub-clause 24 (2). This only a machinery measure. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 30 to 33-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 34. (1) The Registrar may, within 14 days after an application is furnished to him, object to the granting of the application on any ground on which the Board is entitled to refuse to grant the application.",66
227,Mr STEWART,PAIRS," I move: In sub-clause (1) omit' 14', insert '28'. This amendment allows the Registrar more time in which he may lodge an objection to the appUcation made to the Board.",66
228,Mr CONNOLLY,PAIRS,"I have Territory some concern about clause 34 and in particular about the fact that there is no provision for the purchasing pubUc to be in any sense involved in '(3) putting before the Board evidence as to whether eral a person or organisation is suitable to be perSupreme mitted to establish an agency. Perhaps ter for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) has given some thought to this but I think he should under consider the Trade Practices Act. There is an reason interesting comparison here. A provision Trade Practices Act could well be utilised in this piece of legislation. For example in parts of the Board Trade Practices Act there are For example in clause 34 of this Bill objections may be lodged by the Registrar against the granting of an application by the Board outhned in clause 33. However, the Bill does not allow other persons or organisations to object the establishment of an agency. On the other hand the Trade Practices Act makes provision have for the submission from applicants and from of other persons other than the applicant to be considered by the Trade Practices Commission when deciding whether or not to issue an authorisation. This is relevant to section 90 of the Trade Practices Act. Perhaps the Minister could consider that. I think it is not unfair for an industry such as the travel agents industry which is totally of an application under dependent on the market place to be in a position where the market place is able to make a judgment of the industry's efficiency and capacity.",66
229,Mr STEWART,PAIRS," I will have this reviewed, but the answer I would give at the moment is that sub-clause 123 (a) already provides for the making of regulations in this respect for is pubUc notification. The sub-clause reads: making provision with respea to the advertising of applications for licences and .applications for registration as travel agent managers; If that does not quite cover the objection of the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) I will have the matter looked at but at the moment I would not accept his argument. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 35 and 36-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Proposed new clause 36A.",66
230,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PAIRS,"I move: After clause 36 insert the following new clause in Fan IV: '36A. (1) An applicant, within the meaning of Division 2 of this Pan, may, in such manner and within suchtimeas are prescribed, appeal to the Supreme Court of a State or from a decision of the Board to refuse to grant an application made by him under that Division. '(2) The Registrar shall be respondent in the appeal. The Supreme Court of each State is invested with fedjurisdicuon, and jurisdiction is conferred on the Court of each Territory, to hear and determine the Minisappeals under this section. '(4) Where an applicant appeals to a Supreme Court this section, the Court shall hear and determine the appeal and may make such order as it thinks appropriate by of its decision, including an order direcung the Board of the to grant the application. '(5) Where a Supreme Coun makes an order directing the to grant an application, the Board shall give effect to certain omissions. the direction.'. The Opposition is concerned about the matter of appeals. Clause 36 Umits the right of an appeal. as Our amendment gives the Supreme Court of a State or Territory the right to hear an appeal and to makes the Registrar the respondent. If the Supreme Court makes an order the Board would to give effect to that direction. The question how far one goes on appeals is a difficult one. We believe that the Bill, in its present form, falls short of the requirement of fairness in this area. I should like the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) to respond as to whether he can accept the amendment or whether he at least accepts that there ought to be some administrative body set up to hear appeals so that we can have a greater degree of objectivity and fairness concerning them.",66
231,Mr STEWART,PAIRS," I take up the point made by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson), but my advice is that the Board's discretionary powers are difficult to translate into judicial criteria. The Board's actions are subject to review by the tribunal established in accordance with regulations to be made under Part IX. If my information is correct, perhaps the appeal is not necessary but I shall have the matter looked at. I will not accept the amendment at the moment. Proposed new clause negatived. Clause 37 agreed to. Clause 38. (1) A licensed travel agent shall(a) keep such accounting records as correctly record explain the transactions and financial position agent with respect to the business of travel agent; (b) so keep accounting records as to show particulars of all moneys received and all payments made by the agent from day to day in the course of carrying on that business; (c) so keep accounting records as to enable profit and loss accounts and balance-sheets referred to in section 43 to be prepared; and (d) so keep accounting records as to enable those accounts and balance-sheets to be conveniently and properly audited in accordance with this Act.",67
232,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS," I move: After sub-clause (1), insert the following sub-clause(la) A licensed travel agent shall keep a register showing details of all concessional or free fares granted to his employees or their dependants on his application or in consequence of employment by him, and such register shall be open to inspection by persons authorised by the Board. I have moved this amendment because there is quite considerable corruption going on in the granting of free and concessional fares. No doubt that has resulted in the maintenance of high fares, and the public has had to pay for it. The matter is rather more important than that, because that corruption has at times extended into this Parliament. It has affected members of the present Government including a former Minister. I have tabled specific evidence which supports what I am saying. I have tabled copies of tickets issued by Pan American World Airways showing that a former senator received these concessions as a dependant of his wife who was getting what I can only describe as phoney employment when he was a private member of the Opposition. He also received these improper concessions when he was a Minister-the Attorney-General in point of fact-in this present Government. This is corruption going right to the top. That Minister gave to Miss Morosi, who was the vehicle for these concessions, considerable favours. For example, he gave employment to her; for no earthly reason he appointed her husband as a member of the Films Board of Review; he appointed her as a marriage celebrant; and he wrote a letter to the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Bryant) asking for favours for her in regard to a flat. I believe that in both respects we have seen only thetipof the iceberg. I am reliably informed that theticketscopies of which I have laid on the table of the House are only a small fraction of the tickets that were improperly issued to this private senator, to this Minister. If the full records, particularly the records from Qantas Airways Ltd, and were to become available, very many more thouof the sands of dollars worth of these improper favours the agent as a would have been shown to be givenMotion (by Mr Daly) put: That the quesdon be now put.

Clause 57 (2) (a) says that if it is of the opinion that the agent to complaint is vexatious or frivolous, the Board applies by virtue of sub-section business can reject the complaint after it has heard it. this Perhaps it is necessary to include this provision. carried on In most political parties some form of deposit 43 (1) had to be lodged if one is going to complain after the end of that finan4 months about a fellow member of that party. I think that if someone complains about a travel agent or a the Registravel agent appUcant, the complainant should the certibe prepared to put in a statutory declaration. 46 (2) relating to that profit",70
242,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AYES,Do you accept the amendment? MrSTEWART-No.,70
243,Mr CONNOLLY,AYES,"There are a few remarks I want to make about clause 56. It provides for the consideration of comagainst travel agents or travel agency managers - The board also may investigate an agent or a manager of its own voUtion. In subclause (2) (b) is the provision that if the comto the plainant is someone other than the Registrar a registered 'prescribed amount' has to be deposited with the failed Registrar. If the board rejects this complaint the amount of the deposit is said to be forfeited. I suggest that the Bill should ensure that travel agents do not have to bear the legal costs of the Regisdefending a complaint later rejected by the to the Board by delivering it to the prescribed amount Board. The Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) has mentioned that there are certain provisions for this but I am not sure that they are the Regisreally adequate. I would Uke to give an example. Registrar In New South Wales recently there was a comof a person having perplaint against a travel agency known as Harvey World Travel. The Travel Agents Registration Board of New South Wales heard the case over several weeks. Although the case was won by Harvey World Travel that firm had to meet legal costs of over $2,000. It seems iniquitous, to say the least, that such costs should be incurred regardless of the outcome of the inquiry undertaken by the Board. After all, the Bill is supposed to be concerned with consumer protection but I could well imagine, under certain circumstances, that there is also a need for the Bill to give reasonable protection to the agencies themselves. Furthermore, the Bill does not specify any use to which the deposits may be put. Perhaps the Minister for Tourism and Recreation could explain to us what he is going to do with the deposits from some 1500-odd agencies. Presumably the Board could order that the deposit by used to defray costs of legal representation in cases where a complaint against a travel agency is dismissed. At least this would be some means by which we could protect agents against large legal fees accruing in cases where they are found to be innocent parties. Therefore the Bill could include a clause which would cover people under those circumstances.",70
244,Mr STEWART,AYES," I admit that I cannot give the answer to the honourable member's question. We will look at it ary make the amendments. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 57 to 71-by leave-take and agreed to. Clause 72.

Penalty: $500.",71
245,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,AYES, I move: Omit paragraph (b) of sub-clause (2). At present sub-clause (2) (b) reads: to bring the Board into disrepute in connection with an inquiry or proposed inquiry under this Act. It is most important when an inquiry is being conducted that we have a real degree of reason and fairness. We question the need for these words. We are concerned that they might rule out reasonable criticism. This is a matter of significance to the Opposition. I understand that this principle has arisen in other legislation; it is one that we will press to the hmit as much as we possibly can. I would hke the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) to give some consideration to whether sub-clause (2)(b) is necessary or whether it unfairly restricts the right of people in an inquiry.,71
246,Mr STEWART,AYES," I am afraid that the Government cannot accept the amendment. I am told that the wording in the legislation is a standard provision which appears in much legislation of a similar nature. Having read through this clause again this afternoon I feel that having regard to events over the last two or three weeks perhaps a provision similar to clause 72 ought to be inserted into our Standing Orders. It provides that the 'use of insulting language to the Board or a member of the Board' is not allowable and that no one is allowed 'to bring the Board into disrepute in connection with an inquiry or proposed inquiry under this Act'. Perhaps you, Mr Deputy Chairman, could submit that to the Standing Orders Committee.",71

249,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,AYES," I move: After sub-clause (3) add the following sub-clauses: '(4) Where the Board decides not to make a payment to the claimant from the Fund under this Part and also decides that the claim was frivolous or vexatious, the Board rect the claimant(a) to pay to the travel agent concerned, on account of the expenses incurred by him in connection with the claim, a sum determined by the Board, being the sum not exceeding the amount of those expenses; or (b) to pay to a person who has appeared before the Board as a witness in connection with the by way of fees and allowances for expenses in of his attendance, fixed by the Board in accordance with the regulations. '(5) Where a claimant is directed by the Board under section (4) to pay a sum to a person, the sum is recoverable from the claimant in a court of competent jurisdiction as a debt due by the claimant to the person.'. This clause refers to consideration of claims by the Board. The Opposition is concerned that, where we do have frivolous or vexatious claims and the Board decides not to make a payment, there ought to be some protection given to a travel agent or to a witness. The purpose of the amendment is to enable the Board to direct the claimant in those circumstances to find expenses incurred by the travel agent in connection with the claim, the sum, of course, to be determined by the Board. Equally, a person who has appeared as a witness should be able to be reimbursed for expenses, fees and allowances. I would like the Minister to give the Government's response to that proposal. Here again we seek reasonable protection for those who are involved in the business of a travel agent against some people who may misuse the consumer protection legislation which this Bill will enact.",72
250,Mr STEWART,AYES,"This clause relates to claims against the fidelity fund, not direcdy against travel agents. Compensation is not payable unless the Ucence has been revoked, suspended or surrendered or has expired and has not been renewed. I will take up the other points made by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson) and see whether there is justification for any amendment to clause 96, but at the moment the Government does not accept it.

251,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AYES,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. Clause 87.",72
252,Mr CONNOLLY,AYES," I have no objection to the concept of afideUtyfund in principle. In fact it is a perfecdy natural procedure which is adopted in many professional may di- organisations today. Clause 87 provides in addition to that that levies may also be collected for other purposes relevant to this section where necessary. However, the Bill does not specify how these levies are to be imposed. I suggest to the Minister for Tourism and Recreation that as claim a sum, a means of avoiding an undue burden being respect placed on smaller agencies it would be preferable for this levy to be based on agency turnover. sub- This is a very important point because there is a tremendous variation within the industry between those at the top and those at the bottom. I think it is quite unfair to apply an annual levy to all agencies irrespective of the size of their annual turnover. Certainly the smaller agencies within the industry would find some difficulty in meeting these provisions.",72
253,Mr STEWART,AYES,"This matter has not yet been resolved. Discussions are taking place with the industry to try to achieve an equitable system of collection of the fund's or the agent's fee. It has been suggested that each location will draw a special fee, which will not depend on the size of the operation. So those people who are operating a number of travel agencies or offices will be paying so much per office. If necessary, if the fidelity fund is used-w e hope that it will not be used because this legislation will perhaps prevent it-the amount may be increased or reduced as the case may be. The matter is under consideration at the moment and will be covered by the regulations. Clause agreed to. Remainder of Bill agreed to. Bill reported with amendments.

(Quorum formed). STATES GRANTS (CAPITAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1975 Debate resumed from 28 August 1975 on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time.",73
277,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,AYES,"This Bill is one of the least exciting pieces of legislation that comes before the Parliament; nevertheless it is a very important one. The legislation which is before the House now began 5 years ago in June 1970. It began as a result of a dehberate series of actions undertaken by the Commonwealth Government at the Premiers Conference in June 1970, 2 features of which are touched upon in this Bill. The Minister for Overseas Trade (Mr Crean), when introducing this Bill, had this to say: The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the payment capital grants to the States in 1975-76 totalling $430,333,000. This amount represents the grant component of the State governments' Loan Council programs 1975-76 and is equal to one-third of the total programThe amount of money does not arouse much the interest, but the circumstances under which this program was found necessary 5 years ago deserve to be recapitulated even if for only one or two minutes. Owing to the way in which the loan programs are organised between the Comgram monwealth and the States, and owing to the way in which the capital assistance of the loan grams is organised between the Commonwealth and the States, there have been quite wild great fluctuations in the debt positions of Commonwealth and the States from 1927 to the present time. The net result was that the Comgrants monwealth was able to write off its debt and get into an effective net surplus while the States were getting into further debt. It was as a result of that position-it would have been interrupted by the war-that in June 1970 2 programs were set in action. One of them, the States grants capital assistance program, is dealt with specifically in this Bill and the other was program to write off over a period of 5 years $ 1,000m of States' debt, the Commonwealth taking responsibility and liability for that debt. That was the position. We also know that during the late 1960s many a State Premier mounted his steed and made very vigorous poltiical case within his own main as to the intolerable and insufferable den of debt which the State was bearing and the impact of the debt upon its finances. those years it became a reason and an excuse for States not to undertake certain works. It became Government's a standard explanation by a State when it was possible being attacked by various Oppositions. All States did it, all State Premiers did it and all State Second Reading Treasurers did it. Of course that was part of the political program. I refer in that context to the speech of the Acting Treasurer, the honourable Frank Crean. He said: These grants represent a continuation of arrangements initiated in June 1970 under which the Australian Government provides a proportion of the State governments' Loan Council program in the form of interest-free grants in lieu of what would otherwise be borrowings by the States. Savings to the States in debt charges resulting from these capital grants are substantial. As that is now equivalent to well over $400m and represents a third of the total Loan Council borrowing programs, those savings are indeed very substantial. That brings me to thefirstpoint which I should like to make in relation to this measure. This year it could be calculated that the savings to the of States as a result of this measure are equivalent to approximately $80m worth of relief in debt for charges. The question that has to be answered-it has never been answered up to the present-is equity of the distribution of the relief in debt charges among the States. That will have to be dealt with as the amount of reUef given under this program increases. Some States have always had proportionately a very large borrowing profrom the Loan Council; others have not. The reason for that is simply the history of the promatter. They have been tied, to parody another phrase, to the chariot wheels of history in terms and of their Loan Council allocation programs. As the the amount of reUef and of debt assistance increases, so the aUocation of the effect of those among the States deserves to be taken into to account. At the moment that is not taken into in the early 1960s account. I produce evidence to indicate that the Grants Commission, a most expert body in this area, has rather sidestepped the problem and has relied, in its own words, on principles of broad judgments. a The first point I want to make on that matter is simply that the program is welcomed. It was a reflection of what occurred during the 1960s. It gave real reUef to the States but the comparative effect as between the States remains uncharted. I turn now to the amount of assistance being given under this program. In the speech of the then a Acting Treasurer there is a misnomer and I bedoUeve we were misled. The Acting Treasurer, burlooking at the total Loan Council program which had been increased significantly above the preDuring vious year, had this to say: The figure of 20 per cent represented the Australian best, albeit very approximate, estimate of cost increases in the capital works field in 1975-76. In other words, the intention was to maintain the programs at roughly the same 'real' level as in the previous year. That is unexceptional enough. If one looks at the rate of increase of innation on fixed capital expenditure and pubhc capital expenditure and at the real increases in inflation in the national accounts, one sees that that real rate of innation over the year to June was of the order of 20 per cent. So what was done in this growing country, a country with increasing demands on pubhc capital works programs which have to be kept up for us even to remain in the same position, was that an amount was made available under this total program only to keep pace with what would be the rate of inflauon of pubhc fixed capital expenditure. That means quite simply that there has been a real decrease in the funds available to States under this program. It should not be represented as meariing that the same amount of funds per capita, per person or per unit of work required is available. Less was available, given the increase in Australia during the actual year. The program which is before us does not represent a matter of keeping pace; it represents the fact that we have slipped behind. This program, quite legitimately but nonetheless as a Hearings fact, is part of the austerity program which the previous submissions Government is imposing on some sections of the summarised Australian community. It deserves to be recognised as being a fact. The real rate of inflation all that it keeps pace with, not with the rate increase of demand given that the demand for works in Australia at the moment is still increasing. If there is another criticism that deserves directed to this program-it needs to be a fairly muted criticism-it is simply that because of domestically caused economic mess into which the country has been led the austerity is being in terms of public fixed capital expenditure which ought not to have been necessary and which ought not to be required. My first 2 points I beheve are the most nificant that need to be looked at in respect this legislation. I adverted during my earlier remarks to the fact that the relief between the States and the relief among the States needs to be taken into account as the amount of capital sistance increases. I would suggest that this is area into which the Government must turn its attention because the way in which that rehef among the States is presently calculated is quite unsatisfactory. I turn to the Grants Commission report for 1974-the forty-first report-whic deals with debt charges between the States. I in refer in part to paragraphs 4.172 and 4.173. first paragraph reads in part: In the absence of such overall comparisons of effort in the recovery of debt charges, comparisons might be appropriate in particularfieldswhere relative effort can be assessed. This raises the problem of how to compare the budgetary impact of the treatment of depreciation, replacement and the maintenance of the assets of State business undertakings. The Commission has been trying to find a satisfactory basis for assessing the impact of railway depreciationIn the subsequent paragraph the Grants Commission said: Where the reduction in loan expenditure is considered to relate to assets for which there would be a partial recovery of debt charges, the exclusion will be on a proportionate basts. I believe the last sentence gives the clue to the situation. It reads: However, the Commission will use broad judgment in deciding the extent to which the different policies and practices of the States have led to different levels of unrecouped debt charges. Repeated in the Grants Commission report of 1975 is an acknowledgement of the same kind of difficulty in terms of the debt charge position as between States. I refer to paragraph 4.168 which deals with a general description of the general approach on debt charges. It states: The Australian Treasury, in its submission at the Canberra in April 1973, stated that it was unable to add to its on this matter. The Commission has Reports. and discussed these submissions in previous is Previously it indicated that it was going to conof tinue to rely on the general judgments which have been made previously. I believe that we are coming to a time when the general judgment which the Commission has indicated, and which has involved a comparison of all the States, to be needs to be made more specific. It needs to be made more specific because of the amount of as the sistance which has been given under the program. As I indicated previously, the amount of put assistance would be over $430m. With regard to the amount of reUef of State debt which is appropriate to that assistance, one could make all kinds of calculations. It certainly would be in the sigvicinity of $70m, $80m or $90m. The break-up of of that assistance among and between the Australian States remains an unchartered sea. I believe it ought to be referred to. There is good evidence for referring to it. It is one of the growing asand very important areas of Australian Governan mentfinance.I refer to a very excellent and very short paper which was read at a meeting of the Fifth Conference of Economists at the University of Queensland in August this year. It was a very excellent paper by a Mr MCCauley, an excellent h gentleman whom I know. He makes it quite clear his calculation as to the net debt position of the The Commonwealth and the States that the data is quite imprecise and a lot more work needs to be done. I hope that the Treasurer (Mr Hayden), who is in the chamber, will take this on board and ask some of those people who gather round him and who are able to advise him to see what further work can be done to make the calculations more precise. The comments of Mr MCCauley sum up the reasons why this matter is important, even though this is not a particularly interesting or exciting debate. To sum up the usefulness of public debt sector net debt statistics Mr MCCauley gives 4 reasons. Firstly, they seem indispensable to an adequate understanding of the net outcome of the nnances and the functions of the public sector. Secondly, they seem fundamental to an adequate knowledge about Federal-State nnanciai relationships and to any basic or continuing adjustments to arrangements stemming from the 1927 Financial Agreement. Thirdly, they help to elucidate economic management and the implications for fiscal and monetary policies. Fourthly, they serve as a useful indicator of the annual improvement or the worsening in the nnances of the various levels of public authorities. The difficulty of the task should not indicate that it deserves to be ignored. In relation to that, I should like to make one further comment. There is evidence that while the pubhc debt position of the Commonwealth has improved, and continues to improve, and while the position of the States has improved, gap between the two over the last couple has increased significantly. In 1970 the gap between the two was over $ 1,300m. The gap between the two now is only $ 1,800m It is growing; everything is growing. But I wonder whether gap deserves to grow in the way in which it is. take solace in looking at the matter of Commonterm wealth-State relations in this way-and bear in mind that they are the kinds of relationships that have bedevilled every government since Federfore. ation. Some need to bear more blame than Scullin others. Some have been more sympathetic than others. I quote the words of Australia'sfirstCommondid wealth Treasurer in his first Budget Speech. was well aware of the difficulties involved Commonwealth-State relations. He felt at the time that the States were hanging over him like the sword of Damocles. It is worth recording statement and his sentiment. He said: While we should spend all the purpose of defending and developing our country, we must see, at all events in the early stages of our career, there is no extravagance, because the money we spend is money which comes from the StatesAnd this should please every States tighter: . . . and if we do anything which may put them into a difficult posiuon they will feel inclined to curse rather than to bless Federation. I only wish him well and that he was not living three-quarters of a century later. There is one other point which I would like to bring forward, and I believe it can be brought forward. It is impossible to discuss the net debt position without looking at the total securities on issue and the total problems of the Commonwealth in terms of the difficulty it hasfinancingits own loans. This country is getting into quite a unique position at present and one of which the people of the country deserve to be made aware. I turn to the document Government Securities on Issue which comes with the Budget Papers at the presentation of each Budget. This document indicates the Government securities on issue at 30 June of each year. If one looks to this document this year and compares it with similar documents in previous years, one comes to this quite inescapable position: Australia has itself, I believe, into a short term 2 year recycling monetary problem because at present there are more securities redeemable in Australian currency which come to maturity in the next 2 years than ever before in the history of this nation. More than $3,000m of securities will come to maturity within less than 20 months of this date. That represents approximately 28 per cent or 29 per cent of all the sethe curities on issue. That situation immediately of years raises a number of problems. The first problem is this: The Commonwealth this has got itself into a short term monetary I recycling problem. It is trying to finance long programs, for which the securities are supposed to be the basis, with short term subscriptions. This has never occurred to that extent beIt was never a problem that worried the Government to the extent to which it now must worry this Government. In the second place, it means that, if the people of this country decided that they wanted to cash their securities, not wish to convert them, and in fact sudHe denly wanted to invest them in commendable in and worthwhile private enterprise projects, we would be faced with the worse position of all because this action would immediately add more his than $3,000m worth of value to the money supply within Australia. that is reasonably necessary for Without going into all these other terms that used-I refer to ' M l ' , 'M2' and 'M3', which always seems to me a bit like MI5-whicheve r one we talk about, this fact means that there is a great risk of a very great increase in the money supply if people decide not to convert their securities. In that sense the loan which is now before the Austrahan people- I beheve it may have closed yesterday-and the loans which will be before the Australian people within the next number of month represent as big a problem here as did the famous loan which was negotiated during the height of the Depression and which involved the proposition whether repudiation would be a fact of Australian Ufe. So there is a short term monetary recycling problem and the Government has got itself into a situation in which it needs tofinancelong term projects with short termfinance,and that is never a good position for a government to be in. It certainly represents a clear, expUcit and a very obvious threat to stabUity in the increase of money supply. I am not one of those who believe that changes in the money supply determines everything that goes on in the country. There are people who seem to think that the management of the economy can be organised through monetary arrangements rather like putting an automatic carburettor on the Reserve Bank and running away to let the automatic carburettor look after the rate of increase in the money supply. That is far too simple a proposition and rather a meaningless one; nevertheless the size of the problem and the growth of the size of the problem, as indicated by the securities on issue most of which have been issued on behalf of the States, cannot be ignored, I believe, and the Government, I hope, has this in mind. So I make 3 propositions which could be looked at and which deserve to be looked at. The first is the nature of the debt assistance programs to the States and the way in which debt has been written off under these programs which come to finality this year. I beheve that the Government ought to look at redeveloping a debt assistance program for subsequent years. The second point is that the growth in the difference between the Commonwealth and the State debt is increasing and while the States are not in the position that they were in in the late 1960s in this respect it continue to increase. I believe that the Government needs to take into account the differential effects as between States, the reUef given to the States through capital grants assistance in terms of debt negotiation through the Loan Council on account of securities issued on behalf of the States. The third point follows upon the nature of the Commonwealth debt at the present time. Some way has to be found to persuade people to Speakerinvest in long term securities rather than in short term securities; otherwise there is a threat to the money supply. This is running not a mUk bar kind of economy, but an ersatz coffee kind of economy; that is, it looks strong, it appears strong but it has a hangover due to come on within 18 months to 2 years. I put this proposition to the Treasurer (Mr Hayden): In order to persuade people to invest in longer term securities the Treasurer might consider the indexing of Commonwealth securities and bonds. That means indexing them beyond a 5-year period. The last loan had all its contributions within the short term end. There were none within the long term end. There are examples of areas in which indexing Commonwealth bonds would be successful. Programs are currently being undertaken in the United Kingdom concerning securities which are available to aged people and which are indexed to take account of inflation. That needs to be done in Australia, because if there is one economic problem which is related to this measure and which is probably the most pervasive it is simply that there is insufficient confidence on the part of the people to undertake long term investment. You cannot recycle short term investment without running grave risks and there is a need to undertake long term investment knowing what are our real rates of inflation-no t the last consumer price index which is not an inflation index and which certainly understates the rate of inflation quite seriously-and that type of investment needs to be encouraged and needs to be encouraged quite quickly. In terms, of the general sentiments of the legislation, one agrees with them. One applauds the Government for the fact that it has increased the amount of capital assistance avaUable, but above all- I just want to make this one final point- I do not believe it should misrepresent the position by indication that the amount of assistance in fact keeps pace with the demands for pubhc fixed capital expenditure. It only keeps pace with what are the national accounts, the real rates of inflation. It does nothing more. This legislation is to that extent the victim of the domestic econwUl omic crisis which is occurring in Australia, no part of which has effectively been imported.

The following answers to questions were circula",77
279,Mr RUDDOCK,TREATY,"the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and Imrnigration, upon notice: (1) With reference to the Prime Minister's answer to my question No 1779 (Hansard, 5 December 1974, page 4763), has the Minister's attention been drawn to the book of Mr J. J. Spigelman entitled Secrecy-Politica l Censorship in Australia and, in particular, An Inside Dopester's Index of 100 Examples of Secrecy, on pages 177 to 180. (2) Has the Minister's attention also been drawn to indexed item 60-Departmen t repons on suspected breaches of the National Service Act. (3) In respect of that item, able since 1972; if so, when, and in what manner, and by whom was the disclosure made. (4) If the item has not is the reason for the continuing secrecy. Mr Riordan-The Minister for Labor and Immigration has provided me with the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) Yes. (3) and (4) I am informed that detailed information breaches of the National Service Act was provided by the then Minister of Labour and question by Mr C. R. Cameron (Question sard, 20 April 1971). I also refer the honourable member in particular to pan 3 of the Prime Minister's answer to Question No. 2243 which appeared in Hansard on 13.5.74 (page 2198). Health Problems of Alcohol Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) When was the small working group established by the National Health and Medical Research Council to test the method for a survey of alcohol associated illness and facilities for its treatment in Australia. (2) When will it be known (3) When will a full scale survey be undenaken. (4) Have the States promised their co-operation in this survey.",79
280,Dr EVERINGHAM,TREATY,"The answer to the honouring able member's question is as follows: (1) A working group of the Standing Committee on the Health Problems of Alcohol of the National Health and have Medical Research Council was set up investigate the possibilities illness and facilities for its treatment in Australia. This group designed a draft questionnaire which is included in the that, published report of the committee as Appendix IV. The questionnaire was to be tested through a research design procedure to be devised and implemented by the Victorian State Mental Health Authority. NA National Service (2) An initial feasibility study of the questionnaire is just being completed by the Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (Question No. 2299) Branch of the Victorian Mental Health Authority and the results of this study are expected at an early date. (3) A full scale survey will be considered as soon as these results are available. In the course of planning the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Health Problems of Alcohol of the National Health and Medical Research Council will be considered, including the setting up of a statistical team. The newly appointed Medical Services Adviser on Drugs of Dependence has already done some preparatory work on this matter and will continue to give it high priority. (4) It is anticipated, on the basis of earlier discussions, that State authorities will co-operate in a well designed survey. has it been made publicly availSheep and Wool Research (Question No. 3156) been made publicly available, what Mr Lusher asked the Minister for Agriculture, upon notice: With reference to the press statement of the former Minister for Agriculture dated 19 September 1975 entitled Sheep and Wool Research 1975-76, how much of the $ 18.2 million for sheep and wool research programs is being provided by on (a) the Australian Government and (b) the wool growers.",79
281,Dr PATTERSON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable National Service in a reply to a No. 2666, Hanmember's question is as follows: (a) The Australian Government will provide a direct contribution to wool research in 1975-76 of $11.8 million from the ConsoUdated Revenue Fund. (b) The balance of the wool research expenditure, i.e. an estimated $6.4 million, will be provided from the Wool Tax (Question No. 2757) revenue and/or the reserves of the Wool Research Trust Fund. On the most recent indications, the Wool Tax is estimated to yield $27 million, of which $26.6 miltion will be allocated to the Australian Wool Corporation for wool promotion and for marketing adniinistrauve costs. Any balance will be allocated to the Wool Research Trust Fund from which research expenditure will be met. if this method is satisfactory. The reserves of the Wool Research Trust Fund represent the accumulation of amounts remaining from Government and grower contributions, together with earnings from interest and royalties, after meeting research expenditure in past years. A number of approaches are possible in attempt to quantify the proportion of the reserves which represent past contributions by wool growers or by the Government. However, it is considered that, on any reasonable basis of assessment, Government contributions would to be regarded as the original source of at least fifty perin August 1974 to cent of the reserves. of surveying alcohol associated On the above basis it would appear on present indications of the total of $18.2 million set aside for sheep and wool research programmes in 1975-76, at least $14.3 million will and be provided from the current Government contribution or from reserves accumulated from Government contributions in previous years. Regional Employment Development Scheme Mr Lusher asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: How many Regional Employment Development Scheme projects have been approved since the inception of the Scheme in each Electoral Division in Australia, been the total sum approved for projects in each Division. Mr Riordan-The Minister for Labor and Trade Immigration has provided the following answer ever, to the honourable member's question: My Department has not maintained statistics of the Scheme in relation to Electoral Divisions although it relation to some specific requests, extracted and provided this information. To provide the information sought for Electoral Division in Australia, however, would require considerable amount of time and work to be undertaken transport within the Department and I am reluctant to ask that this done. I would add that it was never the intention of the Scheme to approve projects by Electoral Division, although it was the practice to advise all Members of the House of Representatives of projects which had been put forward local government areas which fell, wholly their electorates and to seek their comments on them. My Department has been able to compilefigureswhich show that, since the inception of the Scheme on 10 September, 1974, the number of projects approved has been 8191 and the amount of funds approved for payment under the Scheme at 16 October, 1975, was $ 189,781,549. Overseas Loan Raisings Mr Malcom Fraser asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) When he is seeking legal advice for his Government's actions, is he prepared to act on advice from an Attorney General who says merely that a certain course could probably be regarded as legal. (2) Did he regard the Attorney-General's advice concerning the raising of money for temporary loan purposes as adequate; if so, why. (3) Did he seek legal advice from other sources. (4) What advice was given him by the Solicitor-General. Mr Whitlam: The answer to the honourable tion: member's question is as follows: (1) to (4) I have previously, in statements in the House, and in answers to questions, described in considerable detail the Government's consideration of the volved in the proposed borrowing (Hansard, 9 July 1975 at pages 3597-9, Senate Hansard, 26 August 1975, page 211 and my answer to the honourable member's Question No. 3256: Hansard, 15 October 1975, page 2188). I would only add that the legal advice to which the honourable present question refers, concerned a question of constitutional power. On such a question, ber will appreciate, it is not unqualified view. Trade Commissioner's Office in Soviet Far East Fruitgrowing Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Overseas Trade, upon notice. (1) What steps have been taken to establish a Trade Commissioner's Office in the Soviet Far East at either Vladivos(Question No. 3157) tock, Khabarovsk or Nakhodka. (2) Is it considered that there should be a Trade Commissioner in this area in addition to the one in Moscow. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable and what has member's question is as follows. (1) There have been no steps taken so far to establish a Commissioner's Office in the Soviet Far East. Howthe Trade Commissioner in Moscow visits the Soviet Far East from time to time to foster contact with regional commercial bodies and local enterprises and to encourage greater consciousness of Australia's ability to supply many has, in industrial and consumer requirements of the area. each (2) I believe that the Soviet Far East has sound trade a development potential based on planned mining, industrial, and urban projects but at the present time most of be the economic activity in the area continues to be controlled by Moscow-based ministries and foreign trade organisations and the main emphasis of our approach to the market is directed through these bodies. Thus it is considered that the in Moscow Trade Commissioner's Office can adequately seror partly, within vice this market at present.

(2) What was the average price per acre compensauon in each of the categories in each of the States.",79
282,Dr PATTERSON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Fruitgrowing Reconstruction Scheme provides for the initial approval of trees for removal and for the nnanciai assistance to become available FreshApples Fresh Pears Canning Pears Canning Apricots . . . . Canning Peaches . . . . (2) Rates of assistance are not specified on a variety basis. and another for fresh fruit. Average assistance paid per acre has been: Fresh Fruit . . . . Mr Hunt asked the Minister for Environment, upon nodce: (1) What is the extent of rainforest remaining in Australia. (2) Are the rainforests being depleted. (3) If so, what is the rate of depletion. (4) Are any studies being made of rainforests ecosystems. (5) Is there any legislation, protect rainforests. (6) Are there any areas of rainforest protected in National Parks. Mr Berinson-The answer to the honourable member's quesdon is as follows: (1) Because its scattered occurrence limited surveys in many areas, and the problem of definition of the term rainforest it is very difficult to provide reliable estimates of the extent of rainforest in Australia. Specht, Roe and Boughton, editors of the publication Conservation of Major Plant Communities in Australia and Papua New Guinea (July 1974) (known as the Specht Repon) use the structural classification 'closed-forest' to include most of those forests popularly known as 'rainforest'. This classification types from the cool temperate rainforests of Tasmania to the tropical rainforests of Nonh Queensland and includes some of the better-developed mangrove and brigalow vegetation. Table 1 reproduced from the Specht Report indicates a total area of closed forest in Australia of 71 377 sq km or approximately 0.93 per cent of Australia's area. Although these figures are the best estimate on data collected twenty years ago and thus the figures should be treated with caution. The ecological survey currently being funded by the Department of Environment is expected to provide accurate assessment of the present extent of rainforests and other plant communities in Australia. This is however a major project and it will be some time before the results are available. actually pulled. There is therefore a time lag between approvals and removals. At 31 August 197S approximately 90 per cent of approvals had been removed. Acres of trees approved for removal to 31 August 197S only after the trees have been were: N.S.W. Vic. Qld S.A. WA.

Federal or State, designed to (4) The Rain Forest Ecology Section of the Division of Plant Industry, CSIRO, is responsible for studies of rainforest ecosystems. Further details may be obtained from the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs. (5) Although there is no legislation specifically intended to protect rainforests, all States have legislation which can be used for this purpose. Under their respective conservation legislation all States and the Australian Government have the power to set aside areas of rainforest in national parks or other reserves and to protect individual plant species including some rainforest species. includes a wide range of forest Some Forestry Acts also carry provisions to enable areas of forest to be protected from exploitation. Although the security of tenure of such reserves is less than that of national parks they nevertheless protect substantial areas of rainforest. available the table is based (6) Many national parks and other reserves in Australia contain rainforest vegetation. Specht et al have prepared an assessment of the conservation status of structural formations and alliances in each State of Australia. The assessment for rainforest (Closed-forest) is given in Table 2. According to this table approximately 39 per cent of rainforest alliances are not recorded in or are poorly represented in the existing reserve system.

283,Mr WHITLAM,CONSERVATION STATUS OF STRUCTURAL,"In answering a question this morning from the Right Honourable the Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony), I referred to Premiers being given advance notice of the 'Budget' and Budget papers. I meant of course that Premiers are given details of matters of direct interest to them affecting their own responsibUities which are about to be announced in the Budget Speech and Budget papers. There are some areas-suc h as general revenue assistance-wher e detaUs may be settled with the States at a Premiers' Conference in advance of the Budget and the States have knowledge of funds that will be coming to them through the Budget in such cases. There are other areas where the Budget contains allocations of funds to the States for particular programs which they may not be aware of. It is a matter of courtesy to advise the States in advance of matters of that kind. It is a practice that I have followed. It is entirely proper that Premiers should be given advance notice on matters of that kind. Petroleum Exploration",82

285,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: Between 8 August 1975, when the Variable Deposit Ratio was reduced from 25 per cent to 5 per cent, and 30 September 1975, the latest date for which information is available, applications approved under exchange control to bring in funds from abroad specifically to finance exploration programs for oil (including natural gas) totalled $21.8m. Of this sum, $ 10.5m was approved in the period from 8 August to 10 November 1974 (when the VDR was 5 per cent) and the remaining $11.3m was approved after the variable deposit requirement scheme was suspended with effect from 11 November 1974. These figures do not include funds brought to Australia under 'general' authorities issued under the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations.

The records of these inflows are not classified in a way that allows information of the kind sought to be specifically identified. Mineral Exploration (Question No. 2630) Mr Hyde asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Are overseas money drafts to mining companies vetted to ascertain whether the miner is seeking an Australian (Question No. 2S30) equity in the lease upon which the money in question is to be spent.

The Government's policy in respect of foreign participation in mineral outlined in detail by the Prime Minister in Press Statement No. 564 on 24 September 1975. Australian Assistance Plan Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Manufacturing Industry, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that a grant of $5,900 has been made by the Minister for Social Security under the Australian Assistance Plan to the South-West Sydney Regional Social Development Council for a centre for mothers supporting a child or children.

(2) In view of the recent collapse of this company and the Comresultant hardship inflicted on people in Australia, will he why take up immediately with the States Attorneys-General the necessity for legislation providing for the establishment of defendants' funds to pay claims against failed insurance compames in relation to (a) third pany motor vehicle insurance and (b) workers' compensation insurance. (3) Has his attention been drawn to a statement in the Australian of 12 August 1975 by its Financial Editor that the New South Wales Government has adopted a strange attitude in the case of workers' compensation claims against the failed insurance company Northumberland Insurance Co Ltd.

291,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable the member's question is as follows: (1) (a),(b),(c)and(d)Yes. (2) I am advised that in most States pames writing compulsory third party motor vehicle and workers' compensation insurance policies have gone into liquidation, special retrospective legislation has been enacted to provide funds to meet policy owners' claims under such poUcies. In South Australia there is general provision in the Motor Vehicles Act for claims to be made against the nominal defendant where a third party insurer has gone into liquidation. It is also relevant that, pany being placed in liquidation, the deposit lodged Treasurer under the Insurance (Deposits) Act 1932-1973 available to pay the company's claims Uquidation would, of course, be handled under the relevant State or Territory law and it would be necessary owner who has a claim against an insurer, to debt with the Uquidator appointed under that law.

Government Advertising Mr Fraser asked the Minister for the Media, upon notice: (1) How much money has his Department spent on adveropened tising of Government poUcy. (2) What proportion of this Government Minister concerned. (3) What areas of poUcy were promoted in this way.",84
292,Dr CASS,AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No funds appropriated to my Depanment have been spent to advertise Government poUcy. Advertising expenditure by my Depanment has, however, attimesbeen incurred to gain pubUc awareness aboutrightsand entitlements available to the public arising from Government policy. In the 1973-74financialyear for example, $1,250,000 from my Department's 'Machinery of Government' vote was expended on an advertising campaign which included advertisements on the workings of Parliament and on community/Government joint responsibUities in areas such as migrant assimUation and pollution of the environment.
