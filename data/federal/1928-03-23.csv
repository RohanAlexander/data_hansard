1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Littleton Groom) took the chair at 11 a.m., and read prayers. COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENTLINE OF STEAMERS.",13
2,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"In reply to a question I asked yesterday the Prime Minister stated that the tenders for the purchase of the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers would he made available ta the House as soon as that could be done without prejudicing public interest in regard to the sale. In view of the newspaper statements that some tenderers have included conditions other than those specified by the shipping board, will the. right honourable gentleman give an undertaking that before any tender is accepted, the House will be afforded an opportunity to discuss the matter?",13
3,Mr ERTJCE,Unknown,I cannot give such an undertaking. It will be the responsibility of the Government to consider' the - tenders and arrive at a decision in accordance with the policy I announced to.this House last year. It would be impracticceived able to make these tenders the subject a debate in the House before coming to a decision upon them. NA SUPPLY.,13
4,Mr GREGORY,CANBERRA ELECTRIC POWER,"The statement has appeared in the press that the Commonwealth Government is to contribute a sum of money towards the cost of bringing electric power from the Burrinjuck scheme in New South Wales to Canberra. I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government is committed to expenditure of that nature; if so, what inquiries preceded the Government's decision, and out of what fund will the money be provided ?",14
5,Mr BRUCE,CANBERRA ELECTRIC POWER,"An electric power generating plant has been establislied in connection with the Burrinjuck reservoir and irrigation scheme, and it is considered that current from that source could be provided for ordinary purposes in Canberra at cheaper rates than would be possible by any other system. Negotiations have taken place with the New South Wales Government with regard to the erection of a line for the transmission of current from Burrinjuck to Canberra. The State Government has suggested that the Commonwealth should provide the necessary capital, but the Commonwealth Government contends that that obligation properly belongs to the State. No arrangement has yet been made. DUTIES ON TEXTILES.",14
6,Mr LISTER,CANBERRA ELECTRIC POWER,"I have received advices from my electorate"" that unless the duties on textiles are revised at an early date, between 1,200 and 1,500 persons now engaged in mills at Geelong may be thrown out of employment. Will the Prime Minister inform the House when the requests of another place in regard to the Customs Tariff Bill will be considered in this chamber ?",14
7,Mr BRUCE,CANBERRA ELECTRIC POWER,It is proposed that the requests of another place shall be dealt with before the Easter adjournment. SOLOMON ISLAND MURDERS.,14
8,Mr COLEMAN,CANBERRA ELECTRIC POWER,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been directed to the following serious statement which reconsiderable prominence in the of Sydney Sun of 21st March:ISLAND TRAGEDY. HORRIBLE CAMP BUNGLE. Seven Natives Die. Big bodies move slowly. Two officials were murdered at Sinaranga, in the Solomon Islands on October 4 last. At the instance of the British Government the Australian cruiser Adelaide was despatched to help discover and catch the murderers. One hundred and seventy tribesmen were finally surrounded in the forests and marched to the coast to await trial. They have been deprived of their liberty, and corralled in a hastily and faulty constructed camp ever since. One of the ringleaders who actually attacked the official has repeatedly remarked, "" M e killed him : why no hang V"" But British justice will not function so expeditiously. The natives have' been held for trial, and meantime the price of blundering has to be paid. Word has reached Sydney that, owing to woefully insanitary surroundings, dysentery has broken out in the prisoners' camp. More than 40 have fallen prey to the disease, and already seven have died. F i j i proudly announces that a magistrate has been selected, and is on his way to conduct the case. But meantime natives who may never be convicted"" of association with the crime are dying because someone has blundered. The Commonwealth Government, having participated in the disciplinary expedition, must share some of the odium which will follow from what is happening. Possibly it has some explanation which will clear Australia of any responsibility in this luckless adventure. Having regard to the fact that Australia's reputation and prestige are involved as much as those of Great Britain, and quite apart from considerations of humanity, will the Prime Miuister accept the newspaper's invitation to make fi statement, particularly in regard to the unfortunate and apparently unwarranted delay in dealing with the prisoners ?",14
9,Mr BRUCE,CANBERRA ELECTRIC POWER,"There is no warrant for the suggestion that Australia is in any way responsible for the events that have happened in the Solomon Islands. I am unable to accept the newspaper's statement of the circumstances. It is undesirable that honourable members should make reflections of this character upon Australia and try to saddle our country with responsibilities that certainly do not belong to it. Last year owing to a lamentable tragedy in which the lives of two officials and other persons were lost, the Commonwealth Government, at the invitation of the British Government, sent the cruiser Adelaide to the Islands to assist in restoring order and in bringing the murderers to justice. The Adelaide returned from the Islands two months ago. The Solomon Islands are under British jurisdiction and the responsibility for occurrences there rests with the British Government. UNEMPLOYMENT IN CANBERRA. Mr E. RILEY - Will the Minister for Home and Territories indicate to the House what works are likely to be put in hand in the Federal Capital Territory at an early date, so that those who are unemployed may know the prospects of work being provided for them?",14
10,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CANBERRA ELECTRIC POWER,- I shall give the matter careful consideration. SHIPPING FREIGHTS.,15
11,Mr THEODORE,CANBERRA ELECTRIC POWER,"When may I expect a reply to the question I addressed to the Prime Minister about three weeks upon noticeago regarding the approximate amount of money saved to the primary producers by the reductions made in freights at the £48,917 instance of the Commonwealth Shipping Board? Mr Bruce . ^ I shall ascertain if the information is yet available. NA AUSTRALIA.",15

13,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,UNEMPLOYMENT IN NORTH,I shall consider the matter. I have been in munication with the honourable member for some days with regard to the difficult situation that has arisen in North Australia. NAVA L TRAINEES. AGE QUALIFICATION.,15
14,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,UNEMPLOYMENT IN NORTH,"On the 22nd March the honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) asked the folthe lowing questions:1. Is it the intention of the Government to review the question of the age qualification of naval trainees, topermit of lads below the age of nineteen years being eligible for admission into the Naval Training Schools? 2. Will the Government consider the advisability of providing a suitable ship for training purposes, to replace the Tingira, in order that portion of the trainees' time shall be served under actual nautical conditions of naval service? I am now in a position to furnish the following replies:1. Youths of seventeen years of age are eligible for admission to the Wavy. The entry of boys below the age of seventeen has been suspended temporarily. 2. Naval opinion favours the training of boys in a shore establishment in preference to a training ship. The provision' of a Boys' Training' School on shore to replace the Tingira will receive consideration as soon as the financial situation permits. WAR SERVICE HMS. AKCHITECTS' EEES.",15

19,Dr NOTT,UNEMPLOYMENT IN NORTH,"the Minister for Home and Territories, upon notice I. Whether there was any law in force in Territory for the Seat of Government on 12th December, 1924, 9th April, 1926, and 29th April, 1927, fixing the liability for the cost of kerbing, guttering, and footpaths; if so, what was that law and what was its effect? 2. When did the law which purports to impose the liability for part of such cost upon leaseholders come into operation? 3. Does the law of New South Wales or Victoria empower a local government authority to recover any portion of the cost of kerbing, guttering, and footpaths, from a leaseholder of land in either of these States; if so, under what circumstances? 4. Is there any State of the Commonwealth the law of which imposes the liability for any part of the cost of kerbing and guttering and footpaths upon lessees of land; and, if so. which State, and under what circumstances can the liability be enforced? 5. Is it a uniform principle of the law of all the States of the Commonwealth that the liability for kerbing, guttering, and footpaths, to the extent to which it is not borne by the local government authority, shall be borne by the owner, of the freehold of the land or the person or persons entitled to the rents and profits thereof ? 6. Would it be reasonable for the lessee purchasing leases at the sale conducted on 12th December, 1924, to assume, quite apart from any assurance that may have been given on behalf of the Government, that the law of New South Wales then in force in relation to this matter would govern the condition of his leases, and that burdensome obligations would not be imposed by subsequent legislation?",15
20,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,UNEMPLOYMENT IN NORTH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. There was no law in force in the Territory fixing the actual liability for the cost of kerbing, guttering, and footpaths on the date mentioned. The Building and Services Ordinance 1924-1925, which, came into force on the 10th October, 1924, however, empowers the Commission to make provision for the supply of water, electricity, and other services, and also to make regulations to prescribe the charge to be made for services supplied in pursuance of the ordinance. These regulations have been made from time to time as the services became chargeable, the last having relation to kerbing, guttering, and footpaths. 2. The Roads and Footpaths Regulations made under the Building and Services Ordinance 1924-1925 were gazetted on the 10th November, 1927, and took effect on and from that date. 3. 4, and 5 - It cannot be stated without special investigation what are the provisions of the law of New South Wales and Victoria regarding the recovery of the cost of kerbing, guttering, and footpaths from a leaseholder in those States. There is no proper analogy, however, between city area leaseholders in the Territory and leaseholders in other States. To avoid confusion, the conditions in regard to services affecting city leases in the Federal Capital Territory must be compared with those relating to freehold tenure in other States. No good purpose is 'therefore served by examining the question of the liability of lessees in otlier States of the Commonwealth for contribution 'to the cost of keTbing and ; guttering. 6. No. There was no law of New South Wales in force in the Territory in respect to the matter, as the operation of the New South Wales law had been expressly excluded by the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1909. Furthermore, the Building and Services Ordinance 1924-1925 came into force in the Territory on 10th October, 1924, prior to the first auction sale of leases. TRACTORS. USE AS ROAD ROLLERS. Mr MoGRATH asked the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice 1. Is it a fact that many of the tractors imported duty free from Great Britain are immediately converted into road rollers? 2. If so, will he take the necessary action to prevent this serious injury to the Australian manufacturers of road rollers?  - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :- 7 1. By adding other adjuncts it is quite practicable to use a tractor in the construction of a road roller, but it is not ascertainable to what extent this has been done. 2. If when imported the article is a tractor there is no option but to charge duty applicable to tractors. The Commonwealth cannot control the subsequent use made of the tractor. ARBITRATION COURT.",16

26,Mr HILL,EXCISE ON FORTIFYING SPIRIT,"Echuca - Minister for Works ancl Railways) [11.19] - I move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1921, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work, which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, and on which the committee has duly reported to this House the result of its inquiries:-Establishmen t of an automatic telephone exchange at Box Hill , Victoria. The Attorney-General, for His Excellency the Governor General, approved in Council of the reference of this proposal to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 6th July, 1927. It is proposed to establish an automatic telephone exchange at Box Hill on the existing site at the corner of Whitehorse Road and Station Street. The proposed automatic telephone exchange will be located at the rear of the existing manual magneto exchange. The existing exchange, which it is proposed shall be replaced by the proposed automatic exchange, will reach the limit of its capacity by about 1928, and, owing to the limitations of the existing building, cannot be extended therein. It is_ proposed, therefore, to instal, in a new building an automatic telephone switching system, having an initial equipment for 1,700 subscribers' lines, aud capable of extension to a capacity of ""approximately 5,200 subscribers' lines. The proposal has been examined by the Public - Works Committee, which recommended in its report, dated the 12th October, 1927, that the work be proceeded with. The estimated cost of the project is:Site (already acquired) .. 241 Building .. . . . 0,000 Air-conditioning plant, &c. .. 3,750 Exchange equipment (including that necessary at other exchanges) .. .. 30,075 Sub-station equipment . . 0,291 Line plant (diversion) ISO Sundries .. .. 448 Total £40,985 Question resolved in the affirmative. PAPER. POSTAL WORKSHOPS, SYDENHAM.",17
27,Mr HILL,EXCISE ON FORTIFYING SPIRIT,"Echuca - Minister for 14th Works and Railways) [11.211 - I move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1921, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work, which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, and on which the committee has duly reported to this House the result of its investigations:-Sydenham , New South Wales - Erectio n of postal workshops. This proposal, which was referred to the Parliamentary Works Committee by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, is to erect on land at Sydenham, New South Wales, the property of the Commonwealth, a workshop building for the accommodation of the sections of the Postmaster-General's Department that are engaged in the manufacture and maintenance repair work of telegraph and telephone apparatus used in the department's operations. At the present time, workshop activities are carried on in leased premises in Pier-street, Sydney, These premises were designed for use as a warehouse, ancl are reported to be unsuitable for their present purpose. The accommodation is insufficient for requirements, and does not permit of economical working. Moreover, the rental is very high, and the inflammable nature of the structure necessitates considerable watching expense. The proposed building, which has been designed to permit of extensions being made when necessary, is to have a frontage of 124 feet and a depth of 370 feet, and is to be mainly a single-storey structure,' except for two sections about 58 feet long at front and rear respectively, which will be of two storeys. Construction will be of brick, with reinforced concrete foundations and galvanized iron roof. It is proposed to cement the front of the building to the height of the twostoried portion, the remainder being of plain brick. The ground floor is intended for use as a general workshop, with a machine shop, tool store, &c, while the accommodation on the first floor will consist of offices, laboratory, storeroom, luncheon, and retiring rooms. The estimated cost of the building, including the necessary ground work, water, and sewerage services, and provision against fire is £43,000 Question resolved in the affirmative. NA EXCHANGE, MAROUBRA.",17
28,Mr HILL,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Echuca-Minister . for Works and Railways) [11.24] - I move:That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public ""Works Committee Act 1913-1921, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work, which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, and on which the committee has duly reported to this House the result of its inquiries:-Establishmen t of an automatic telephone exchange at Maroubra, New South Wales. The proposal submitted for the consideration of the Public Works Committee was the erection, on certain Commonwealth property in Storey-street, Maroubra, of a building in which would be installed an automatic telephone switching system having an initial equipment for 1,400 subscribers' lines, and an ultimate capacity of approximately 7,000 subscribers' lines. It is proposed that the initial equipment shall be capable of extension to the ultimate capacity named, and thus enable requirements in the proposed automatic exchange area to be met for twenty years after the date of opening. The area that would be served by the automatic exchange suggested, comprises the southern portion of the present Randwick exchange area, and a small portion of the adjacent Ascot exchange area. The new exchange is said to be necessary in order to meet the rapid development due to the sale of Crown lands in the locality, and to avoid further unnecessarily high expenditure on external plant. It is claimed that the installation of the proposed exchange will enable the department to provide a cheaper and more efficient service to subscribers in the extreme limits of the areas * mentioned. The estimated immediate cost of the work, as submitted to the Public Works Committee, is set down at:Site (already acquired) £700 Building .. .. 8.050 Air conditioning plant, &c. .. .. 3,750 Exchange equipment (including that necessary at other exchanges) 28,671 Sub-station equipment . . . 148 Line plant .. 10,800 Sundries .. '>>..'- 70 Total .. £52.249 The time fixed for the completion of the work is about teu months from the date of commencement. The site proposed is situated in Storey-street, Maroubra, adjoining the public school, and forms portion of what was, at one time, the Randwick rifle range. This land was handed over to the Commonwealth as a "" transferred property,"" but owing to the closing of the range, it has since been retransferred to the State, with the exception of about 201 acres retained for the Small Arms School, and this block has been retained for telephone exchange purposes. The proposed exchange site has a frontage of 100 feet to Storeystreet, by a depth of 200 feet, and is level land of a sandy nature. It is reported to be a good building site, and the telephone officials state that after careful survey, it is found to be as near as practicable to the telephonic centre of the proposed automatic exchange area. Inquiries were made by the Public Works Oommittee as to whether it would not be possible to locate the proposed exchange on portion of the land now partially occupied by the Maroubra Post Office in ANZAC-parade. It was stated in evidence, however, that this was not advisable for the reasons that the unoccupied portion of the post office area would not be large enough to accommodate the proposed exchange as a single storey building. is quite possible that with the increased development of the district an extension of the post office premises themselves may be ""necessary. The theoretical telephonic centre of the district is situated approximately at the site chosen for the exchange; and to establish the exchange on the post office property would mean greater expenditure in cabling, which could not be justified. It was stated in evidence that the total annual charges, including interest and depreciation for the proposed automatic system as at the date of establishment, namely, '31st December, 1929, are estimated at £11,-739, and five years later at £19,-018. estimated revenue at 31st December., 1929, is .set down at £ i l ^ 2 S , and years later at £2S,7SS. The assets, that will become spare, if .the automatic - system is installed on the 31st December, 1929, are estimated to have a recoverable - value iof £3,264. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [11.28]. - I understand that ten months are allowed for the completion of the building after the acceptance of the tender. When does the Government intend to proceed with the erection of this exchange? A number of works_, the - construction of which has already been recommended fey - the 'committee, have been held up. This - exchange - will be located in my electorate, and as I am familiar with the - rapid growth in the district, I urge the Minister to have .the building proceeded with as soon as possible. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA EXCHANGE, OAKLEIGH.",18

32,Mr HILL,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Echuca-Minister for Works and Railways) [11.38] - I move That, in accordance with the provisions of Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act, 1913-21, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work, which was referred an to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Works, and on which the committee has duly reported to this House the result of investigations:-Erectio n of Commonwealth Brisbane. In 1922 the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works recomthat a first section of this building should be erected on the valuable city n the site held by the Commonwealth in To give effect to the comrecoinmendation, all preparations been made to call tenders for the erection of the bnilding, but action was suspended as a result of local representations which were made to the Acting Prime that a further donation of porof the. site^ additional to the portion appreviously promised, should be made The towards: a civic improvement scheme, consisting of a public square, incorwith it a site for a soldiers' memorial, intended to be erected by This request led to extended negotiations b.etween; the Federal and State Governments, the 1 Brisbane Mimieipal Council, and the 4,750 Returned Soldiers' Association, until 2,680 finally an improvement scheme was evolved on lines agreeable toall these interested parties. Asi a contribution to 0,600 this last scheme, the Cabinet, upon the 400 Minister's recommendation,, agreed to the 250 surrender of an addaticmal 12. f t . 6> ir*. frontage of the Commonwealth landy £49,191 which, with, the* previous donation of 34 feet, represents, a. total frontage of 46 f t . 6 in. The building proposed was necesup sarily; altered, by the new dimensions of 1 the site, and since the Works Committee's previous investigations, conditions affecting the future occupation of the building, and aspects of it connected with other public interests concerned in the improvement scheme, have also changed. The proposal was again referred to the committee by His Excellency the Governor General in Council. The building now proposed is of seven storeys, to be constructed of steel and concrete with a granite base, with stone facings for two storeys high and above that brick or concrete plastered to imitate stone. The building will provide effective office space for Commonwealth departments in Brisbane of 96,730 square feet. The estimated cost is £170,464. Practically all the space has been allocated either to the Commonwealth or State departments, including 12,000 square feet applied for by the Commonwealth Savings Bank.",20
33,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Hunter) [11.40] We have passed a number of proposals, half a dozen in all, involving an expenditure of over £300,000. I take no exception to that, because I think that the works are necessary, but I desire to impress upon the Minister the urgency for undertaking these projects at the earliest possible moment. Unfortunately, there are thousands of unemployed throughout the Commonwealth, and everything possible should be done to alleviate the position, especially in view of the fact that winter is approaching. The Minister made the remark that one of these works would be completed ten months after commencement. We are concerned, not so much with the date of completion, as with the date of commencement. We wish this work to be started immediately, and I hope that the Minister will take the necessary action to have it done.",21
34,Mr MACKAY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Lilley) [11.41] - I feel certain that if the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Cameron) were present this morning he would congratulate the Government on its decision to proceed with the erection of the Commonwealth offices at Brisbane. It is well known that the various Commonwealth departments are scattered all over Brisbane, and are housed under any but decent conditions. The erection of these buildings has also an important bearing on the construction of ANZAC Square. Thousands of pounds have been collected from the public in Brisbane for the purpose of erecting a handsome memorial on this square, but the Greater Brisbane Council and the Mayor of Brisbane have complained frequently of the delay which has been caused by the failure to erect the Commonwealth offices, thus holding up the development of the square. Apart from this, I hope that the work will be proceeded with, so that employment may be found for those now out of work. I trust that the Minister will not allow anything to delay the calling of tenders, and the commencement'of construction.",21
35,Mr MCGRATH,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Ballarat) [11.42] I am surprised that the Minister has not replied to the remarks of the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Watson) and' South Sydney (E.» Eiley). I have"" good reason to believe that the Cottesloe exchange is not to be gone on with, and that further protracted delays will occur. One would imagine from reading this list of new works that something is to be done to provide additional employment, but unless the Minister mends his ways the work will remain a long time inabeyance. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) spoke about the work which it was proposed to carry out at Brisbane, but I remind the House that the Public Works Committee reported many months ago in favour of the erection of Commonwealth offices in Sydney. The Commonwealth is losing money through having its offices scattered all over the city. It has been proposed that all the staffs should be brought together, so that they might enjoy better conditions, and economies might be effected. I wish to know when this work is likely to be commenced. We are passing through the worse period of unemployment which we have ever experienced, and we are now entering upon the winter season, when distress from unemployment is likely to be accentuated. This work has been recommended by a responsible committee of Parliament as one of urgency, and I hope that it will be commenced without delay.",21
36,Mr DUNCAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"HUGHES (Boothby) [11.43] - I should like to draw attention to the fact that the work which is to be done under these proposals is fairly well distributed over Australia, or over certain parts of Australia. Two of the proposals refer to New South Wales, two to Yictoria, and one each to Queensland and Western Australia. I make no particular protest because there is no postal work here for my own State. "" It may he that all the work there has already been done. It does appear strange to me, however, that it should be necessary to erect Commonwealth offices in Brisbane at the present time of financial stringency, when, on. the other hand, it has been deemed advisable 'to cut out the Bed Hill way line in South Australia. Whatever opinions may he held about the construction of that line, I think the honourable member for Gray (Mr Lacey) will agree with me that this is a line in whioh South Australia is very greatly concerned. I can see no reason why it should have to give way, owing to financial stringency, while Commonwealth offices are to he erected at Brisbane. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [11.44],- I wish to supplement the remarks of other honourable memproceeded hers in regard to the necessity of date; proceeding with the erection of the Commonwealth offices in Sydney. The Government has purchased a valuable block of land there with a view to erectcarried, ing buildings in which all the Oommonunder wealth staffs may be housed. Tho plans have been drawn for the buildings, and considerable expense has already been incurred. The Commonwealth is paying heavy rents in other parts of the city office accommodation, and this is a work, which carried putj will save the Governreported, ment a considerable amount of money. I cannot understand the > policy; of Government,; because the Public Works Committee has already taken evidence this matter, and recommended that the work be undertaken. ' I understand that the Minister for Markets and Migration has leased a. building in Melbourne seven years, instead of bringing the partment to Canberra. What, then, are we to. conclude is the policy of the vernment? The Prime Minister should make an announcement in connection with this matter before the House rises, at Eftster. fl53] . Mr Bruce (Flinders-Prime MiiuV ter and Minister for 'External Affairs) [11.45],- I assure honourable members that the Government desires to proceed with all the works that 'have been the subject of motions this morning. Five of them concern postal .buildings and equipment, and the sixth, 'the erection of Commonwealth offices in ' Brisbane. During this financial year about £4,000,000 has been spent on postal work and we hope to be able to spend a similar amount next year. In the last five years considerable progress has been made with the provision of postal, telegraphic and telerailphonic facilities. Our object is to make these. services as efficient as. possible. But the amount of money that can be spent is limited to the amount that is available on terms whioh are acceptable to a first dags, borrower. It must be remembered also that the money borrowed mnst be allocated between the Commonwealth and State Governments, in such a way that their works programmes may be continued. I give my assurance that so far as possible, all the proposals that have been submitted to honourable members this morning will be with at the earliest possible",21
37,Mr LACEY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Grey) [11.48] - It appears to me that the motions that we have as well as that which is now consideration, are so much camouflage. But whether that is' so or not I point out that there appears to be no intention on the part of the Government to proceed with the construction of for a number of other works upon which the Public Works Committee haa favourably although many of them are even more necessary than those to which the we have been given our attention this morning - Unfortunately, the Governun ment bas stopped some important public works which it has had in hand in south Australia. I contend that such works should be put in hand as will provide for the greatest amount or employment for deour people. The construction of the works which have been under consideraGotion this morning '\ypl require a good deal of machinery btft will not give a very large amount oif''employment - In the circumstances iii'- which Australia finds herself at present'""the Government would be well advised to resume at the ballasting of the transcontinental railway, the completion - of which highly desirable for the economic workexchanges,, ing of the liri^. In consideration certain public works, having' been effective favourably reported upon .by the Public Works Oommitte&, many workers in South Australia''are anticipating that they will be pf2t .in band, and are actually waiting?for. employment upon them, I trusffhat the Government will bear this in mind and give firstattention work - to undertaking's which will provide the largest amount of employment.",22
38,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Lang) ' £11.51] - I should be glad if the Minisplant ter for Works and Railways- .(Mr Hill) would, in his reply, indicate the present position in connection with the proposal to erect Commonwealth offices in Sydney for the purpose''of which a valuable site was acquired a considerable time ago. The work has been approved 'by the Public Works Gommittee, but I do not think that it has been put in hand. land on which the building is to be erected is at present partially occupied garages and 'Other constructions, and is, suppose yielding a small revenue, but the Commonwealth Government is paying considerable sumsin rentals for office commodation in .Sydney, I submit the erection of the buildings should undertaken as early as possible. I should also like the Minister to intimate whether the Government proposes lo put in at an early date the erection of the workshops at Sydenham.",23
39,Mr YATES,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Adelaide) {11.68] - Th remarks which the Prime Minister mode a few moments ago showed - quite clearly that the motions .that we have been conI sidering are only eo much eye-wash. office The Tight honourable gentleman said i effect that the Govermnent had no money available to proceed with the proposed works. Mr BSLX. - He said - nothing - of kind.,23
40,Mr YATES,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"That - is certainly what I understood him - W'-say. At any rate problem. be indicated that-There was no serious intention to tackle the unemployment problem. It is urged that a government is ' always justified in raising money to undertake reprooffices once ductive ' works. Surely the projects that we have had under consideration can - is be placed in that category. Telephone at least, should be'reproducof tive. I - am. afraid that, nothingvery will be done in Australia to cope with unemployment until there is- .a change of government. I draw the attenv tion of the Government to the fact that, although, in accordance with a reso- hition similar, to those which - haye been carried this .morning, certain was put in hand at. the rear of the Adelaide General Post Office three or four .years ago, it is still uncompleted, and is an eye-Borein .the «ity. Derricks were erected, a good deal of .assembled on the site, and a certain ' amount of work done, but practically all activities there have now .ceased, and the plant is falling into disrepair. Certain temporary, premises were erected when this undertaking was first put in hand to relieve the congestion at the Adelaide General Post Office. At the time that work was being done, I asked one of the workThe men, whom I knew intimately, what he was doing. He said, ""We are putting by Tip some temporary accommodation for thf» I post office."" I said, "" They appear to be as fairly substantial for temporary premises/' He replied, "" Do not worry, old acman, these buildings will be here long after that I am gone."" It appears as though his be prophecy will be fulfilled. I ask the Government to complete the Adelaide work before it undertakes any new projects hand of the kind. I have gleaned from the postal Postmaster-General { Mr Gibson) that the Adelaide buildings are urgently required to give the telephone, exchange e extra accommodation, although it was not intended when they were put in hand that they should be used for that purpose. t is i-frgenSfy necessary that a new post should - be built m ihe - east-end of n Adelaide to handle the business which is vow being conducted in an ordinary' shop in Bundle-street. "" The construction of this building is. long overdue. I''trust the that the Government will reconsider its programme and try to make some more effective plans to meet the unemployment Mr BAY'LEY (Oxley) [11.57] - I . congratulate the Government upon having decided to construct the Commonwealth in Brisbane. The accommodation which they will provide is sorely needed. The new building, in addition to beautifying the locality in which it will be erected, will make possible the construction of the ANZAC Square in Brisbane, a project that has been held up now for a number of years. I urge the Government to make it a condition when tenders are being called for this work that as far as possible, local material shall be used. Some of the-finest granite in Australia is available in the ranges near Brisbane, but it appears to be 'almost impossible to get the Public ""Works Department to nse it.",23
41,Mr THEODORE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The granite used in the construction, of the Brisbane automatic telephone exchange was brought from New South ""Wales.",24
42,Mr BAYLEY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,That is so. I trust that a similar mistake will not be made in building the Commonwealth offices there.,24
43,Mr COOK,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Indi) [12.0] - I trust that the Minister, in his reply, will indicate that, as far as possible, his department will get tenders for these public works, and that he will see that we obtain something approaching value for the money spent. Our existing unemployment is to be regretted,, and we' would all'like to publio works proceeded with to provide employment. But when we have an incident such as that, which occurred dt Ouyen, where the actual cost was about double the estimated cost, a doubt exists as to advisability of using public money for such work. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will' see that adequate value is obtained for the money expended. Mr MARRS. (Wentworth)' [12.1] 1 regret to have to mention^ this matter as I recognize that the Po^tipastpr-General' (Mr Gibson) usually does his best for all concerned: Fifteen years ago my predecessor, the Honprable W. BL Kelly, endeavoured .to obtain better postal faciliwbich. ties at Edgecliffe, in the Woollahra district. That is a huge district,, whioh has expanded enormously in recent years. I ' took the matter up about nine years ago andj iii a soft-moment, the then Treasurer -^-now Sir Joseph Cook-place d npon die estimates an amount of £60,000 for the .erection of a new post office and an automatic exchange at Edgecliffo. The government has carefully' refrained from action in the matter since then.. Almost weekly, I receive communications from the Woollahra council asking me if any furtheraction has been taken, and I have frequently written to the Postmaster General on the subject. My letters have not received'any reply £or the last month. During a recent electrical storm in the Woollahra district 4.Q0,,, telephones, - including my own, wereput out of order. It would be impossible-, and. perhaps impolitic, to 'send on to the. Postmaster General all of the complaints that I have since received. If there is one public utility that is more reproductive than another, it is the public telephone. Judging by the number of doubtful calls that one bas to pay, that branch of the service must be generously reproductive. On that score alone I enter a strong appeal (on behalf of the Woollan'ra Oouncil, and the hundreds using telephones in that district, urging that action be taken to facilitate the provision of adequate and up-to-date telephonic facilities in the locality.",24
44,Mr FORDE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Capricornia) [12.3] T shall not congratulate the Government. I impress upon the Postmaster-General (Mr Gibson), and the Minister for see Works and Bailways (Mr Hill ) , that practically all of the public works now being carried out are for the big cities of Australia. I represent a country electorate and for some time have been endeavouring to persuade the Government to erect an automatictelephone exchange at Eockhampton. Nothing has been done, possibly because Rockhampton happens to be out of the category of capital cities.. I do not object to the activities of the department in the capital cities, but it is prone to overlook places that are remote from a metropolis. For several years, this particular matter has been under the'notice of the department, has indulged in-a policy of procrastination. Some ojf the Commonwealth buildings in Bundaberg and 'Rockhampton are in a disgraceful condition,, and need urgent attention. For some time a request bas been before the - t'ostmaster-General for a.jfejnforced concrete or brick post office at Gladstone. That town is growing rapidly, and has a magnificent, harbour, which appealed to-jtbe aesthetic and nautical' predilections of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mi'. Marks) when he visited the port. There is no guarantee that there will be any result ffcom the resolutions before this House. No doubt We shall have to wait, until we have a Labour parly representative as Mindown ister for Works; and Railways and Postmaster-Genial before the country districts receive^ proper aicenuon. big cities haw .numerous advocates but remote areas are neglected. ' Telephone lines and small exchanges are refused when applied for on the ground that money is available and that the proposition is not a sound commercial one. I urge the Government not to niggardly in its provision of new changes for country districts. I wish to bringibefore the notice of Minister for Works and Railways the cellent building material which is .availcountry able in Queensland - In my electorate there is one of the finest deposits of marble to be found in Australia, the Ulam marble quarries, near Bajool, proximately 18,000,000 tons of marble iB in sight. Samples of that excellent marble may be seen covering the tables in our refreshment rooms. Yet marble was required for use in Brisbane the Government searched elsewhere, and in .many cases used imported Italian marble. At another time. I shall have something to say as to the necessity for increasing the auty on Italian marbb. Such a procedure would make it possible to extend the activities of our local ries, so giving^ employment to hundreds of men. Again, I remind the Minister that in Central Queensland we have one of the finest deposits of granite to found. Yet that granite bas been used by the Commonwealth but rarely wealth., for public works in Queensland or ings the southern States: Enterprising people have invested thousands of _ pounds in a plant to quarry that granite, and they should receive encouragement. There are also splendid deposits of sandgreat stone in my electorate which have been entirely overlooked by the Commonwealth Government. I askrltbe Minister to a special note of .these things and sist that preference is given to Queenswith land materials when his department erecting publiciibuildings in Brisbane elsewhere in Queensland. Ur. Forde. .  draw attention to the fact that, thougb the Port Augusta to Red Hill railway now work has been approved by the Public Works Committee, the bill dealing with it has now been placed a long way on the business paper. Unfortunately a great deal of unemployment now exists in Australia, mostly affecting unThe skilled workers, and the Government would do well, on this account, to proceed, at an early date, with the Port Augusta . to Red Hill railway. I appeal to the no Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Hill) to begin that work if money is : available. Contrary' to the experibe ence of the honourable member for exCapricornia (Mr Eorde) I have found that the policy of the Postmaster-General tha (Mr Gibson) is entirely - favourable to extbe construction of necessary works in districts, and I place on record my thanks to the honourable member and his (department for the many facilities provided in my electorate, particularly where apin the Mallee district. Mr MAKDSr (Hindmarsh) [12.11] I desire to tender a word of advice to the when Postmaster-General and the Government. When public works are being constructed it should.be the endeavour of the department to build something that will be a' credit to the Commonwealth. Of recent years there has been a tendency to erect a class of. building of which one certainly cannot feel proud. Recently the quarCommonwealth Government erected a block of buildings in Adelaide, in a back street, buildings that are merely ugly masses of tiles and cement - Included in be the works which are before ns this morning fori discussion is a block of Common(offices for Brisbane. Those buildare to serve, partly, as a soldiers' memorial. Brisbane has many beautiful buildings, and I congratulate its municipal authorities' for having had the foresight to build a splendid town ball, which is now nearing completion. It would be most regrettable if the Commake monwealth buildings about to be conto instructed in Brisbane did not conform the excellent standard of many of is the other buildings in that city. The or building now contemplated needs to be dignified, artistic, and substantial. Last week I had the privilege to open, officially, the new post office at Port Adelaide. The residents have waited sixteen years for that post office and, although a considerable sum of money has been spent on the building, I felt very disappointed with the type of architecture selected and with the materials* used. It is nothing but an ugly slab of cement, and it is not a credit to the Commonwealth. The design and construction of Commonwealth'buildings should be .of such a nature as to add to the prestige of the Commonwealth, and not, as many of them are today, inconvenient temporary structures.",24
45,Mr A GREEN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Kalgoorlie) [12.16] I wish to direct the attention of the Minister for ""Works and Eailways (Mr Hill ), and; incidentally, that of the Postmaster General (Mr Gibson), to the lack of efficient post office buildings in the newly developed areas of ""Western Australia. Before federation took place most of the States had erected substantial buildings; but as 'Western Australia was one of the last to be developed, little had been done in that direction there. Last year the population of that State increased at the rate of 4 per .cent., the average increase for Australia being 2 per cent. Furthermore, the increase in that State has taken place, not in the - capital cities as in ether States, but in the country. In the out-back farming districts the post offices are anything but efficient. The office in one large agricultural area-Wango n Hills-is a disgrace. After all, the post offices in the country districts are the only evidences of federation, and where those buildings are of a makeshift character-man y of them merely sheds-the settlers cafrnot help but develop a wrong impression; of the' Commonwealth Administration. When the splendid work of installing telephone trunk lines throughout the country is completed, I trust that the Postmaster-General 'nail devote his efforts to the erection of suitable, post offices to meet the growing needs of the country districts. Mr GREGORY fSwan) [12.18] - I have listened attentively to the explanation of the difficulties* in the way of the construction of various works, and I should Uke to suggest to the Prime Minister that it might be possible to mortgage our adverse trade balance in order to raise the funds required. Some new loan policy is essential if we are to carry out these works. I offer that suggestion as a means to relieve the-anxiety of honourable members who have spoken this morning. 'ijs",26
46,Mr HILL,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Ecktioa-Minister for Works and Railways) [12.19] - The Prime Minister has fully explained the position, and, therefore, there is no need for me to add to his remarks. The honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) referred to the Commonwealth building at Sydney, and I would inform bim that that work will be constructed so Boon as funds are available. The honourable member for Gray (Mr Lacey) referred to the stoppage of work in connection with the ballasting of the EastWest railway.. I am''sorry that it was necessary to cease that work; but I can assure the honourable member that it will be resumed the moment that funds are available. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Bayley) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) bave drawn my attention to the fact that Queensland granite is not being used extensively in the construction of Commonwealth buildings ih Brisbane. There is a reason for that. Although the granite quarries are rigbt at the' doors of Brisbane,' the same quality stone from New South Wales can be delivered there at a lower cost. When the price of the Queens^ land stone compares favourably with that of the New South Wales stone the Government will give consideration to its nse in Commonwealth buildings in Brisbane. Question resolved in the affirmative. DRIED FRUITS BILL .  That he have leave to bring in a bill for an act relating to trade and commerce with otlier countries and among the States in certain dried fruits.",26
47,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Hunter) [12.20] - I think that the Minister might, in fairness to honourable members, give some information as to the.upurpose of the bill. A few words would be sufficient. We on this side usually raisS no opposition to motions for leave to introduce bills, and, on one or two occasions lately we have found that the measuresi'have not been to our liking. Mi. PATEBSON (Gippsland-Minister for Markets and Migration) [12.21],.1 would remind the Leader of the Opposition that I am not moving the first reading of the bill. I believe that it is rather unusual to discuss measures until after that stage has beettrpassed. The Government proposes to,-,-bring down a bill to some extent on the,'lines suggested by the various States. .""Honourable members will recollect the difficulty in wbicb the dried fruits industry has been placed because of a certain High Court judgment, which laid down that the State boards were using powers which could not be granted' - to them by the State legislatures. The Gommonwealth Government, therefore, proposes to bring in.ft measure to rectify the position. Question resolved in the affirmative. EXCISE TABLET BILL. Bill returned from the Senate without request. NA Bill returned from the Senate without request. WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL. SECOND READIWO. Debate resumed from 9th March (vide  soirThat the bill be now read a second time.",26
48,Mr SCULLIN,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"Yarra) [12.23] - This bill bas come before the House much sooner than we anticipated. It will be remembered that the Wine Export Bounty Act was passed 'in 1924, and it provided for a bounty of 4s. a gallon on exported wine. This was done in order to relieve the growers of doradillo grapes. It was pointed out by the Prime Minister at that time that a large inorease in the"" , .acreage of doradillo grapes had taken'place because of the settlement of soldiers upon the land. Previously prices had' been bigb' and the prospects of the industry good; but a slump bad occurrea abroad and there was a surplus of winfe for export. The prices paid for doradillo grapes Were consequently low, anu, to relieve the position,' the Government provided a bounty of 4s: a gallon on wine for export. To that proposal the House unanimously agreed. There was, I believe, at the back of the minds of a number of honourable members' the idea that there would subsequently be a proposal brought down to relieve the position of the dried fruits industry, - but that up to date has not been done. I repeat what I emphasized pre vionsly, that the argument justifying the growers of doradillo grapes and the giving of relief to wine industry generally could have been applied with equal force to the dried fruits industry. The position of that industry was exactly' the same as that of the wine industry. In pursuance of the policy of soldier settlement, large areas of land were thrown open for the production, of dried fruits, with the result that a huge surplus, up to 70 per cent, of the total production, had to be sent overseas. Tbat market became unprofitable, and the claim for a bounty on the export of dried fruits was in 1924 as strong as that for a bounty on wine for export. Last year BILL. when it was proposed to rednce the bounty by Is. a gallon, I took up the same attitude as I took previously. I placed before the House the view, I think, of my own party, that we bad reached a serious position by not giving consideration to the dried fruits industry. Tho bounty on wine for export was an incentive to growers of grapes to send to wineries and distilleries fruit which otherwise would bave been marketed as dried fruit. I am not blaming the growers for that, because they are entitled to obtain the best prices offering.",27
49,Mr CHARLTON,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"The market for dried fruits was falling. Mr.i SCULLIN - The market was unprofitable, and the growers found a better market at the wineries' and distilleries, with the result that there was on extraordinary increase in the quantity of wine produced for export. This .accentuated the position which obtained in 1924, and today the condition of the wine industry is serious indeed. I suggest that the Government in assisting only one branch of the industry has ,done injury toboth branches, with a consequent loss to Australia. None of the proposals for export bounties can 'be regarded as permanent; they are merely expedients. I am not finding'fault with the action of the Government in assisting the wine industry, because' that in turn helped the soldier settlers. But we have left one branch of the industry unprotected, and in consequence created a problem that will be difficult to solve. The bounty cannot be regarded as permanent. It was introduced simply to tide the industry over a critical period.",27
50,Mr MAXWELL,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,Shoul d not that apply to all protective duties ?,28
51,Mr SCULLIN,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"No , and I shall explain the difference. The imposition of protective duties, and the - payment of bounties to establish any industry, primary or secondary, in the markets of Australia, is a permanent policy. I , and, I believe, my party, favour giving to the primary industries the same assistance, by way of bounties, or protective duties,' as we give to secondary industries, so that they may snocesfully compete in the Australian market, and pay adequate wages to those engaged in them. But I would never advocate the building up of a manufacturing industry by protective duties, and then payment of a bounty upon the surplus production exported. Such a policy would be economically unsound. I am also prepared to give temporary relief in the form of a bounty to those engaged in an industry, as we are doing in connection with the wine industry, and I have, urged frequently that that policy should be extended to the producers of dried fruits. The proposal contained in the bill is to reduce the bounty upon wine exported by 9d. per gallon, because, it is said, a certain change has taken place in the overseas market. But I suggest that the reason for the proposed reduction when only six months of the three[yearsj> has expired, is that the Government has become alarmed at the amount of money which the bounty has involved. In the Prime Minister's speech, in which he announced the intention of the Government to pay a bounty on exported wine, I can find no definite statement as* to the amount which the Government estimated this assistance would cost. But I infer from his remarks that he did not expect the bounty in the first three years to reach £250,000. In 1924-25, which was the first year of thethree-year, period for which the bounty was to operate, the actual payment was .£28,417. In - the next year it rose to £217,109. Por the year 1926-27the Treasurer estimated that the disbursement would be £150,000, but. the amount actually .paidwas £442,410. To the 30th June last, the total amount, of' bounty waa £687,936. In his budgetstatement, the Treasurer estimated that the payment for 1927-28 would be £250,000, but for. the first two months of the financial y$Hit amounted to £358,237, making the 'total payment to the end of. the first bounty period at 4s. per gallon, £1,046,174. The amount of excise paid on the spirit used in fortifying the wine was £325,722, making the net bounty £720,452. Since that, time the net bounty has been reduced to Is. 9d., and the amount paid under it at that rate is £104,212/ making the total net bounty to date after deducting the Is. 3d. peigallon excise duty, £824,664. Tie quantity of wine produced in the first three-year period was 5,211,562 gallons, and estimating 80 gallons of fortified wine to a ton of grapes,' the gross bounty waa equal to £16 per ton of grapes used. The excise would amount to £5 per ton, leaving a net bounty of £11 a ton, whilst the fixed price paid to the growers was £6 10s. per ton. Honourable members may remind me that the fixed prices for some grapes is higher than £6 10s.; that is so, but as the production of wine per ton would bo greater from them, the bounty would bo proportionately greater. Wby did the bounty from the end of June to the end of August, 1927, amount to so large a sum as £358,237? The reason is that the wine was rushed abroad in order to take advantage of the bounty of'4s. per gallon, as at the end of August, period the rate was to be. reduced to 3s. Tbo question arose whether the vignerons would be permitted to export the immature wine of the 1927 vintage. I understand that they received permission to. export 25 per cent, of the vintage, but if honourable members will - peruse the figures they will come to the conclusion that the quantity exported exceeded that proportion. The hurrying of that wine overseas assisted to oreatr ,a glut in the London market and, as a, result, a serious position has developeci^here. The argument advanced by the wine makers in support of their request to be allowed to export the 1927 vintage and take advantage of the 4s. bounty was that they bad paid for the grapes from which the wine was madepthe prices fixed by the Government for .that season's crop. Tbat is true, but it is offset by the fact that in the first operation of the bounty, they received 4s. perjigallon on the wine exported, althoughcik considerable quantity of it was produced from grapes purchased before't'the fixed price came into operation, at Broinp rates as low as £3 per ton. I am not arguing for or against the wine-making industry, but I desire honourable members to bave a clear perception of what bas been happening. Unquestionably, the bounty was intended by Parliament for the benefit of the growers; that was emphasized when the Prime Minister Vfirst introduced it to the House. But an examination of the facts shows that the full benefit bas not been enjoyed by them. Tbat it bas been of some good to tbem is indisputable; no one will deny that the growers of doradillo grapes were saved from bankruptcy by the increased price they received as a result of the bounty. But the growers bave not bad the advantage that Parliament intended, and it is not easy to calculate what proportion of the bounty bas gone into the coffers of the wineries and distilleries. The Development and M i gration Commission has reported that cooperative distilleries.return from £1 10s. to £2 10s. per ton more to the growers than the price fixed by the Minister. The commission statedEvidence shows that the growers in South Australia receive a much higher return Irom the co-operative distilleries than is received from private wine and spirit manufacturers. The difference in 1927 amounted to 30s. to £2 10B. a ton. Tho wine bounty is not the samo advantage to the wine-growers where they have to send their fruit to private distilleries as when.it is processed co-operatively. That clearly shows that the wineries and distilleries get some share of the bounty that was intended lor the growers alone. During the fourteen months ended 31st August; 1927, 4,000,000 gallons of wine was - exported frofe^Australia, out of a totalexport fortbe three years of 5*200,000 gallons.""' The total paid during that fourteen per. gallon wasr£800,000 out of the total ilr. Soullin for the three years of £1,000,000. It is clear that four times as much wine was exported and four times the amount of wine bounty paid in the last fourteen months as in tire previous 22 months. - Mr THEODOBE - What brought about that position?",28
52,Mr SCULLIN,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"I shall explain that. According to the Tariff Board's report, 30 gallons of fortifying spirit or 130 gallons of unfortified wine is obtained from one ton of grapes. In other words, 160 gallons of fortified wine is obtained from two tons of grapes, equal to 80 gallons of fortified wine to the ton. It may be suggested that SO gallons is rather a low figure, but if a higher figure wei-o allowed, my argument would be strengthened. Calculating 80 gallons of fortified wine to the ton of grapes, the bounty at 4s. per gallon represents £16 per ton of. fresh grapes; at 3s., £12' per ton; and at 2s. 3d., £9 per ton. Allowing for the drawback of excise duty at Is. 3d. per gallon, the net bounty at 4s. works out at £11 net per ton of grapes; at 3s., £7 per ton; and at 2s. 3d., £4 per ton. It is estimated that three and a half - tons of fresh grapes will produce one ton of dried fruits, so that the wine net bounty of 2s. 9d. per gallon was equal to £38 10s. per ton'of dried fruits; the net bounty of Is. 9d. to £24 10s., and the net bounty of Is. to £14 per ton.",29
53,Unknown,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"Sitting suspended from 1245 to 2.15 p.m. Mr SOULLIK' - When the bounty was reviewed in March, 1927, I made this comment:If the wine bounty has the effect of diverting to wineries and distilleries each year increased quantities of grapes that would otherwise be dried, the time will come when the bounty will be discontinued. Only a year , has gone by, and, although the bounty bas not been discontinued, it has been reduced substantially. Last year it was reduced by Is. per gallon, and now, six months later, the proposal is to reduce it further by 9d. per gallon. I am satisfied that this reduction is to be made more because of the cost of the bounty to the Treasui-y than for '.any other reason, and I am going to show that that cost is attributable to the manner bounty in wbicb the Government bas bandied the ti months at 4s.' Whole - matter:' The growers ought not to,.be penalized, on that account. The' report of the Tariff Board, at page 23, states-It was certainly not intended"" result of the wine bounty that it should cause on extensive diversion to the manufacture of - wine and spirit of grapes ordinarily grown for the dried fruit industry. It was stated in that report that some 20,000 tons of fresh grapes had the been so diverted. The Development and Migration Commission, referring to the 1927 crop, states on page 9 of its reportAs a result of the trine bounty, 25,000 of fresh grapes of drying varieties were deket tliere. livered to wineries and distilleries the year 1026, 21,000 tons were converted into wine and spirit. I invite honourable members to examine cost of production. the facts of the case. I bave just shown that, in 1926, 21,000 tons of fresh grapes of drying varieties, and in 1927, 25,000 tons were diverted to wineries and disGovernment tilleries, a total of 46,000 tons for two years. That quantity of fresh fruit produced 3,680,000 gallons of fortified wine, and the bounty payable upon of that, at 4s. per gallon, would amount £736,000. Deducting the excise amounton ing to £230,000, there would be a bounty of £506,000 payable on that 46,000 tons of grapes which, prior introduction of the wine bounty, were dried. It is' estimated that the quantity costs of the two bounties. of surplus Australian wino in bond in London at the present time' is 3,000,000 gallons.",29
54,Mr THEODOBE,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,The result of a hideto ous blunder..,30
55,Mr SCTJLLIN,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"Yes , because a glut was caused. Let us consider what would"" bave been the position if the Govern1924 ment, when it brought in the wine bounty, 1925 . bad simultaneously introduced an export 1926 bounty of £10 a ton on dried fruits. That 46,000 tons of grapes would bave been converted into. dried fruit, and would 1926 have produced 13,000 tons of that com1927 modity. A £10 a ton export bounty upon it would bave cost the country £130,000 ; but, by the diversion of that fresh fruit to wineries and distilleries, the bounty only; cost the taxpayers £506,000, an increase of £376,000. Even if we take the reduced bounty provided for in this bill, that 46,000 tons wonld have produced 3,608,000 gallons of wine, the bounty on which would have amounted to £184,000 as against £130,000 on dried fruit.  dried frui t have been sold? California to be the is full of it. Mr S CULLEN"" - There is an ample market for our dried fruit, at a price. The same remark applies to wine; but there is not the same*imarket today for wine, even at a pjice, that there is for dried fruit. Great Britain is a heavy importer of dried f r u i ty and if we can make the price right, and'profitable to the tons Australian growers, we bave a good marFor",30
56,Mr SEABROOK,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"We cannot make the n price profitable, in view of the present,",30
57,Mr SCULLIN,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"I agree that we cannot sell our dried fruits abroad at a profitable price at the present time without assistance'j'but the growers the state that with a £10 a ton bounty they could do so. I am pointing out that we could have saved this country hundreds - thousands of pounds by paying an exto port bounty on die dried fruit instead of the wine. The question then arises net whether, after granting, a bounty, we could find a market for the fruit. I do to the notthink that honourable members can challenge my figures as to the relative I am not speaking of lexias and currants used for ' wine making in the ordinary way. The following _ particulars of recent imports the United Kingdom are interesting:- ' RAISINS. (INCLUDE SULTANAS & LKXXAS). Total.

Mr Scullin"" - M v figures relate to currants and raisins, ^understand that during 1927 there was ,an enormous export of sultanas to Great, Britain, alone.",30
58,Mr MAXWELL,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,What:wa s the reason for the remarkable falling off?,30
59,Mr SCULLIN,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"The explanation giveu'in the report of the Development nnd Migration Commission as follows:Tha fulling off 'Ik due to the greater ties being sent to) dist'tleries as a result of the wine bounty una line increased preference in Ctrcnt Britain oa Australiau sweet wine.' On the question wuctnev Australia could 'seli this dsied tjt'liit. I refer honourable members to n repjy given by the Minister  last year, showing that fruit unsold in overseas markets on 10th November, 1926, amounted to 4,413 tons cf currants, and 54. tons of lexias. On the i?0tb April, wbieh is the eud of the selling season, all that fruit hud baei: sold. On the 10th November, 1927, the unsold currants amounted to culy 10 tons, aud the unsold lexias to, 75 tons, although only half the'selling, season nnd passed. The conversion of this frui t into wine and spirit has cost the country three times as much in bounty LS it would have cos: had a £10 a ton bounty been given ou the dried fruit . The bill proposes that the bounty ou wine should be reduced by 9d. a gallon. The justification for that, we are told, is contained in a statement by the Minister for Trade and Customs when be introduced the bill to renew the bounty in March of last year. The first bounty provided for a three years' period ended the 31st August, 1927. Last March, a bill was introduced to renew the bounty as from the 1st September last, and to continue it for a further three years. That is a renewal nt the rate of Is. 9d. a gallon net, payable after allowing a drawback of ls. 3d. a gallon for excise; duty. To prove that there is' no repudiation of the contract, the Government relies upou a statement appearing in the speech of the Minister for Trade and Gustoms in March last; although the undertaking then given does not appear in any portion of the bill.1 / the British ""Government gives additional preference, the Government reserves the right to reduce the bcun'.y. Oil the strength 0$' that statement, it is claimed thrit as'additional preference has been given to""'<J Australian wine, the bounty hus b'eftii'sreduced. I ask honourable members;$0' examine (be facts. If . in: prepared to say. that,'in effect,, additional preference has not been given to Australian wino, wben we tako all the circumstances into consideration. While I conquantidemn the aotion of the Government in granting a wine bounty alone, instead of putting it into operaticu simultaneously wish a bounty on dried fruit, I point out, in the first place, that the bounty Las cost the country infinitely more than a bounty paid on dried frui t would have cost, The second count of my indictment is that we have not helped the dried fruits industry i;s much as we should have done. Moreover, the reduction of the bounty is now coming in the middle-* of the vintage, six mouths after the date on which the existing arrangement was entered iuio. The peopio wbo are going to be penalized because of this bungling are' the fruit-growers of Australia. Money has been wasted because the Government Las not grappled with the problem as a whole. Tbat. however, does not justify the repudiation of a contract entered into with the wine-makers and grape-growers. It was unauimously agreed by this Parliament in 1927 that a certain bounty fhoulc be paid to the growers. We entered into that obligation, and we should honour it - We said to the growers that, .for a period of three years, a wine bounty of ls. 9d. a gallon would be paid, and we said to the wine-makers that they must pay a certain fixed price for the grapes, Tbey have paid that price, and now it is proposed that there should be a redr.ction in the bounty c-u the wine which they have made from those'grapes, and which they are ready to export. This will seriously injure the grape-growers. There are 3,000,000 gallons of wino in bond in London, lying unsold right in the middle of this year's vintage, while the growers are picking their' drop. The wine manufacturers will simply make a declaration that they will not buy any more grapes this ' yearfor wine-making for export. They will not then be bound to pay any fixed price. The grapes will be forced into the market at any -;rice, and the reduction of the bounty will thus react on the growers. Let us examine the case as presented by the Minister. He justified the reduction on the ground that there had beeu a substantial improvement in the Britisb preference.",31
60,Mr MAXWELL,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"""Was that provided for in the bill!",32
61,Mr SCULLIN,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"Not so far as I can see. There was' no proviso except in the speech of the Minister. No proviso was inserted in the act that the bounty would bereduced if certain things happened, and that is where, from a legal point of view, it may be said that there has been repudiation. I do not say that there is justification for that view, if it can be shown that Australian wines occupy a better position on the London market now than this time twelve months ago. The Minister said that, during the - currency of the first bounty-tb e 4s. bounty, or, as it is now called, the 2s. 9d. net bounty - tb e f.o.b, price, of Australian wine was ls. lOd. a gallon. Now be says that the average f.o.b. ' price is 3s. 4d. .agallon, or ls. 6d. more than in the early period. Tbat statement has been challenged; but, even if we accept it as true, what is the reason for reducing the bounty by ls. 9d. a gallon? That leaves the wine manufacturers in the position of being 3d. a gallon worse off than they were before, and 3d. a gallon represents something over 20s. a ton to the growers. It is admitted by those in the industry, and I have seen a considerable amount of correspondence in support of the view, that six months ago the f.o.b. price for Australian wine was 3s. 4d. a gallon; but it is denied that that price is obtainable now. The industry has challeged the Minister to show that recent sales of wine bave been at 3s. 4d. a gallon f.o'.b. Personally I know nothing about that aspect of the matter except what I bave learned from half a dozen letters wbicb bave come from""' London by the last mail. Those aro cobfidental business letters, but they indicate that the position is not as stated by the Minister. Por the information of honourable members. I shall indicate the changes which bave taken place during the last few years in the Britisb preference. In 1924, the duty on Australian wine was 4s. a gallon, and on foreign wine 6s. a gallon, making a preference for Australian wine of 2s. a gallon. In 1925, after the first bounty was given, that preference was increased by a reduction of the duty against Australian wine by 2s. a gallon, so that the duties were' then 2s. a gallon on Australian wine, and. 6s. ,pn foreign wine,' making a preference of''4s. a gallon on Australian wine. In 1027 there was a change, and the duty on both foreign and Australian wines was increased by 2s. a gallon on wiije's of over 30 per cent, strength. Therefore, in 1927, the duty on Australian wine ..was 4s., and on foreign wine 8s. a gallon, representing a preference of 4s. a gallon. Honourable members will see, however, that there is a vast difference between a preference of 4s. wben the respective duties on Australian and foreign wines' are 2s. and 6s. a gallon, and the same preference of 4s; wben the respective duties are 4s. and 8s. a gallon. The proference"". of 4s. re-' mains the same, it is'tnie, but the percentage preference in the one case is very much greater than in the other. The effect of this all-round increase in dnty was that wines were blended in large quantities in England. Low grade wines, wbicb were admitted at the low duty, were imported, together with the neces-sary quantities of very high strength wine, which would not pay any more duty than that provided for wines of the maximum strength as laid down in the schedule. Tbese wines were blended in England, and sold to the .public, with the result that - the increased preference to Australian wines was largely nullified.. The Minister made one point which has to be considered, namely, the alteration of the dividing line between bigb and low strength wines. Formerly, all wines of 30 degrees strength paid the higher duty, while those below that strength paid the lower duty. Australian wines mast have a strength of 34 per cent., because they have to be fortified to enable-tbem to carry through the tropics. The result of this decision was that foreign wines, of 29 degrees strength could be brought r) into Great Britain, 'anclsold in competition with Australian wines of 34 per cent, strength, while evading the payment of the higner duty. ' Then the dividing line' was lowered from 80 per cent, to 25 per : cent.', so that the foreigners would have to bring in the lower strength wine which would not compete successfully with tralian wine. There is much in the ment of the Minister that this constituted a very great advantage to the Australian industry, and from information which have, been able .to. obtain, I believe the preference given'in Britain to Ausbounty tralian wines is substantial, and the dustry bas greatly benefited as a result the alteration of. the dividing line. There is another point, rh'owever, and a very portant one, which the Minister entirely ignored. Another competitor of the tralian wine-makers bas arisen, and is the manufacturer of what are called British wines. Tbis wine is made in Britain from imported grape juice bought from Spain and Prance. is also made from cheap grade currants imported frpm Greece. The juice is be imported,,^ an unfermented state so that no duty is paid ofi - it, while on the factured wine an - excise duty of only a gallon is levied. Tbis wine bas been on the market for some time, but formerly it had not a very great sale because Australian wines were fairly cheap. ""Wben the Britisb Government raised the duty by 2s. all round, making that Australiau wines 4s. a gallon and that on foreign wines 8s. a gallon, the was to stimulate the manufacture British wines, until today tbese have largely succeeded in capturing the market formerly held by Australian Tbese facts indioate that all is not well with the Australian wine industry, especially as there is a slump in the sales of Australian wine abroad. I do not say that that slump is due entirely to the reasons I bave indicated; it is due, some extent, to the way in which wine was rushed overseas last year. Neverthewe less, I submit that the Minister has not proved that there baa been a substantial improvement in the position occupied by Australian wines as a result of British preference, and until be does, be cangrower not justify the repudiation of a contract entered into witbv&he growers six months ago. The onus of' proof is on the Govaud ernment, and unless it can establish a better reason for reducing the bounty six months after the .agreement was made, honourable members'!, who stand by principle of honouring agreements ought to reject the billiwhich is now before the Ur. Scullin. AusHouse. Parliament, whether rightly or - arguwrongly, entered into an"" agreement to pay a bounty for three years, fixing the price of grapes on the basis of that i bounty. The wine makers bought grapes that on' that basis, believing that the wonld last for three years if the inthen existing conditions continued. Now of the Government proposes to repudiate its contract with tbese people. The Governimment cannot justify that - action unless it can produce proof to the effect that the Ausposition of Australian wine on the Engtbat lish market bas improved to the extent of the proposed reduction in the bounty. Mr .MAXWELL - Would that be a It justification ?",32
62,Mr SCULLIN,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"I think that it would a moral justification, if not a legal one. If the Government can show that certain manuconditions bave come about, as provided Is. for in the speech of the Minister wben the last bill was introduced, I think thut it would be morally justified in following the lines which it then indicated as a possibility, of the future. Though this proviso was not included in that bill, it on was well known to the trade. However, from what I can gather, the trade is effect worse off now than it was wben the of bounty waB introduced. Far from the very price being, as stated, 3s. 4d. a gallon f.o.b., it is, I am informed, not more wines. than 2s. 8d. f.o.b. I take the stand I have adopted, not because I believe that the wine bounty is economically soundI consider its imposition one of the most unsound things that bas ever been done to assist an industry. It would bave been to justifiable if it bad been granted to dried fruit as well as wine because owe an obligation to the people wbo bave planted large areas of grapes, and because we owe an obligation to the returned soldier grape growers, at least as great as that which we. owed to the of doradillo grapes. I bave been through the Mildura settlement, and also the large tract of country-around Merbein Red Cliffs which is settled by returned soldiers. I am told that Bed Cliffs is the largest soldier settlement of its kind in the world. The settlers there the were encouraged by Commonwealth and State governments to grow grapes at a time when the market price was good,"" but even at that period we 'were producing all the fruit that we required to supply our own market, and it was known that the great bulk of the fruit grown in these new areas would have to be exported in one form or another. The world market, as everybody knows, is precarious for such products. Whilst I do not condemn the Government for the mistake that was made in the first case in regard to this matter, for no one foresaw what was likely to happen, I do think that when it was learned that in 1926 20,000 tons of good fruit were diverted from the drying sheds and sent to the distilleries, the tion should have been seized and an effort made to prevent such diversion. In the next year 25,000 tons of good fruit were diverted from the drying sheds and sent to the distilleries. It would almost seem as if the growers were encouraged to send their fruit to the distilleries instead of to dry it. The increased tonnage of grapes sent to the distilleries and wineries in Renmark and Berri in South Australia was so great that the co-operative distillery at Berri spent £60,000 in extending its plant to enable it to haudle the additional business. It appears to me that a colossal blunder has been committed, but the growers should not have to suffer for it, for they were not responsible. There is no justification at this stage for repudiating a contract that was unanimously entered into by this Parliament. It is grossly unfair to the growers that such a proposal should be introduced in the middle of the vintage, for now the growers have no guarantee whatever that they will be able to sell their fruit. They are all right, of course, in respect of the portion of their crop that can be consumed locally, but they are in a most unfortunate position in regard to that portion of it which must be dealt with for export. This is not a small matter. A large number of persons are employed in Australia in growing this fruit, and they deserve assistance to market it successfully. We are spending millions of pounds on water conservation schemes along the Murray Valley, and if we agree to this proposal we shall undoubtedly undo much of the good that we have done. The successful development of the Murray Valley depends largely upon fruit-growing and marketing. Irrespective of the view I hold as to the unsoundness of the action that was taken in the first instance, I shall refuse to repudiate a contract made by this Parliament.",33
63,Mr FOSTER,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"Wakefield) [2.50] - I regret that a matter of such importance, involving such immense issues as this does, should have been precipitated upon us with so little notice, and that the  should have provided u!s with such inadequate information to dfeal with it. The Minister cannot justify'ihimself by saying that he spoke on the. spur of the situamoment, for he read practically every word of his speech. The introduction of this measure has caused consternation throughout South Australia, the greater part of Victoria, and part of New South Wales. We were building up our wine industry very satisfactorily under the existing bounty. We had accomplished more in the three years than even the most sanguine of us had expected to accomplish in three times that period. But it seems that we are about to nullify all the good that has been done. The Prime Minister may, at a later stage in the debate, submit information to the House which will change the whole outlook; but we should not be treated like children. We should be given the fullest possible information at the initiation of a debate of this character. Although it may be distasteful to the Government I feel bound to say that this measure has been introduced in a most brutal manner. The whips have already been round. The country should know that this is the manner in which some of the business of this Parliament is being done in Canberra.",34
64,Mr LISTER,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,The whips have not been to every member.,34
65,Mr FOSTER,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"I say deliberately that they have been round, and that the numbers have gone up.",34
66,Mr LISTER,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,I have not been approached.,34
67,Mr FOSTER,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"I know that some honourable members have not been approached, nor are the$- likely to be. A r happening of this kind could hardly have occurred in Melbourne. So far as I have been able to ascertain, the wine industry had not the slightest indication that this alteration was toj be made in the bounty. It is shameful/,that the proposal. sliould have been introduced after four-fifths of the grape crop had been gathered. I have never heard of such a thing happening before. In the interests of deliberate and reasonable discussion, honourable members sh'puld not be placed in the position in which they find themselves today in dealing .with this subject. intend to make statements of this kind outside of this chamber, but they ought first to be made ""here. I had the opportunity of spending a week in South Australia by absenting myself from only two sittings of the House, and I took it and went right into the country. When I returned to Adelaide I found that a situation tragic to the wine industry and calamitous to the returned soldiers settled in our grape-growing districts had arisen, If this bill is passed, many distilleries which, have been encouraged by a sympathetic* Government and Parliament to extend their business will bpmost seriously affected, and the industry will be reduced to a state of chaos. have obtained the fullest information on this subject that is available in the bestinformed quarters in South Australia. I propose to read a"" letter which I have received from Mr Leslie Salter, a mau of high reputation and character, who holds, and has always held, an honored position in this industry. He writesReferring to our conversation of this afternoon. The original hounty which came into operation on the 1st of September, 1924, provided for a payment of 4s. per gallon on wine exported from Australia provided it contained not less than 34 per cent, of proof spirit, and was of good merchantable quality. The act provided that the payment of bounty should expire on the 31st of August, 1927. About April, 1927, an amending act was passed by Parliament which provided that the bounty should be reduced to ls. 9d. per gallon. Ex, porters, however, were entitled to collect Is. 3d. drawback, this with the ls. 9d. bounty making a total of 3s. as against 4s. provided in the original act. Payment of the bounty under the amending act was made conditional on exporters having paid certain prices for grapes and fortifyin g spirit, these prices to be fixed by the Minister. We claim, that all 1927 and older wines made in compliance with the prices and conditions fixed by the Minister is fairl y entitled to the ls. 9d. bounty., gThat is provided fii the contract, and I do not suppose that the Government would dream of .dishonoring it. On the ilr. Foster. other hand, I take it that it will be fulfilled in both the spirit and the letter. Mr Salter proceeds as followsConsiderable quantities of wine of 1927 vintage and older are held by winemakers for export, and it is obviously unfair that they should be compelled to accept 9d. per gallon less for it . The Ministry has expressed the I opinion that the best quality wine should be sent to England. Winemakers who have held stocks for maturation with a view of complying with the wishes of the Ministry now find themselves penalized to the extent of 9d. per gallon. In regard to 1928 vintage - We had no idea whatever that it was the intention of the Government to reduce the amount of the boimty. We had entered into contracts for the purchase of both grapes and spirit on the basis of prices to be fixed by the Government. We now find we are bound by these contracts for the purchase of our material, but the selling value of the resultant wine is reduced by 9d. per gallon. W it h regard to the competition which we are now meeting in England - The selling values of the various types of wine similar in class to those exported from Australia are as follows: I Per gallon. Australian .. 9s. 3d. Tarragona and Lisbon . . 8s. Od. to 8s. 6d. "" British "" wine . . 5s. Od. That is the sort of stuff that comes from foreign countries, which honourable members declare with much vigour when tariff matters are under consideration that we should not trade with in any way. The letter continuesWhat enables us to secure a higher price for our wine than those obtainedfor Tarragona and Lisbon wines is probably the additonal spirit content of our wine, although superior quality may also be a factor. The fact, however, remains that the above prices clearly indicate we are getting full value for our produce on the English market. It was stated  Reduction Bill on 9th March, that the competition of foreign blended wines which we have to meet in London is a bogey. There is no authority for this statement, and, undoubtedly, it is a very easy matter for the Spanish and Portugese shippers to make this blend. Sweet wine not exceeding 42 per cent, of spirit (dutiable at 8s. per gallon) and dry wines N.E. 25 per cent, (dutiable at 3s. per gallon) can with absolute safety be imported into England and blended after payment of customs duty. If equal parts be blended the resultant blend will show from 32 to 33 degrees of proof spirit, and the average duty per gallon will be 5s. Cd. Our own wines pay 4s. per gallon, so that we only have an effective protection of ls. 6d. "" B r it is h "" Wines - Thes e are made from imported grape juice, principally produced in Greece from surplus currant production. There is no customs duty on the grape juice, but there is an excise duty of ls. per gallon on the wine. This wine as mentioned above is sold at os. per gallon duty paid, as against 9s. 3d. for Australian wine also duty paid. It should be borne in mind that, prior to the last British budget, Australian sweet wines paid 2s. per gallon duty on entering England, while "" British "" wines paid no excise duty at all. Under existing circumstances, Australian wines have lost ls. in bounty here, and pay 4s. per gallon (instead of 2s.) ou entering England, so that the loss of Is. bounty here and the additional 2s. duty in England put our wines 3s. worse off than they were under the old conditions. On the other hand, "" British"" wines which previously paid no duty, now pay ls. per gallon excise. To sum up, Australian wines are now 2s. per gallon worse off in competing with "" British "" wines than they were under the 4s. bounty here, and the old British tariff. Mr Coombe, of the Benmark Growers Distillery, informs me that, with the reduction of 9d. per gallon bounty, his company cannot pay the prices fixed for grapes by the Government. This being the case, how much worse off will be the proprietary companies who, in addition to paying the prices fixed by the Government, expect to show a profit on their operations. I shall be pleased to see you on Sunday at your home if there should be any further information you may require. That letter is an accurate statement, and shows clearly the disastrous effect that a decrease in the bounty will have on the Australian wine industry. When in Adelaide I saw a cablegram from London regarding a consignment that was to be shipped that day. The shippers asked the shipping company-Elde r Smith & Oompany Limited-to hold over the cargo until the remaining cargo had been loaded; but the company took the risk of loading i.t. Later a further cable was read confirming the previour advice, and as a result the shipping company had to remove 150,000 tons of cargo from the ship's hold before it could withdraw the consignment of wine. The morning that I left Adelaide I saw another cablegram from a .gentleman, who is, perhaps, the biggest wine-grower in the world, to the effect that, if the bounty were reduced, all orders were to be .cancelled. Those orders were large, because that same firm shipped a considerable portion of the 3,00Q,000 gallons of wine that is now in London waiting to be - placed on the market and to be consumed. The following is a copy of a cablegram that was given to me today"":Have"" cabled Bruce as' follows:-We are of opinion that proposed"" reduction bounty on fortified wines from ls. 9d. to ls. a gallon will seriously jeopardize future of Australian wines this market. Proposed reduction will enable Tarragona and Lisbon wines at 30 degrees to be sold at 2s. a gallon lower than Australian 34 degrees. Large shipment Australian wines last year ,may lead to false conclusions as 3,023,000 gallons lying in bond here 31st January. What this market wants is stability of price to consolidate spade work of last two years. Any change now will have n tragic results for Australian wine industry (Sgd.) DOMINION WISE MEBCHANTS ASSOCIATION, 'd That cablegram is very ""emphatic, and it confirms my statement 'that we should continue the spade work, because the unexpected success of our wine exports during the last six months has staggered everybody. We have during that period placed on the Luadon market more wine than has auy other country. The spade work has been tremendous; but its effort w i ll be wasted now that the botihty is to be reduced. The Minister for Trade and  the. wine-producers. We must judge the Minister by his own words, and those clearly show that he has failed the growers in their time of need. I cannot, believe that he will leave the industry in its present position. I have placed the facts before the Prime Minister, and I hope that, even at this late hour, he will make a statement that will be. entirely satisfactory to the wine-producers. I know the industry fro m beginning to end. A f t e r the Chaffey brothers started in Australia, a fine class of men came from Scotland and England to settle in this country. They were fro m splendid families at Home, and they launched out in the wine industry. During the war they were successful; but since then they have met with difficulties and suffered loss. The perilous position of the industry is seriously affecting the soldier settlersLetters from soldiers at all the settlements along the M u r r ay Valley have reached; me and not one cavils at the profits made by the wine-makers. Those soldier settlers are tragically anxious about this reduction in the bounty, and well they may be ",34
68,Mr SEABROOK,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,Are they worse off than the apple-growers?,36
69,Mr FOSTEE,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"There can be no comparison between them! The Prime M in ister knows what the.;soldier settlers endured in the immediate past, and the House knows that the Commonwealth and the States in association have already spent £5,000,000 in conserving the waters of the Murray, and only a few days ago made themselves jointly responsible for the expenditure Of a further £3,000,000. It was recognized by all who gathered at the conference in Canberra to consider the future of the Murray river waters scheme that something would have to be done to increase"" the utilization of the water in order Jo ""secure a return on the huge capital outlay. Fruit-growing and wine-making will be the paramount industries along that waterway if they are properly treated, but now, when the wine industry is on the verge of greatness, its progress is to be arrested and those engaged in it are to be discouraged. Many of the growers have barely recovered from their recent hardships. The soldier settlers own the Berri distillery and are large shareholders in the Renmark distillery. The Government has a moral responsibility to stand by those men. I cannot believe that it will refuse to our its obligations in regard to the wine available for export from the previous season. I have said that the spade work in connection with the export trade has been done. Now we are about to build upwards. A lot of wine is being held in Australia so that it may mature before being put on the London market. I do not expect that the inferior types of wine will yield a great profit. The greatest success will be achieved by wines of the best type, and I know that some vignerons are preparing to put on the London market wines that will make a very favourable impression. We must cultivate that market, and look to the future of this trade. I am not alarmed because 3,000,000 gallons of Australian wine is stored in London. It will soon be consumed wben the British people recover from the present bad times and have a little money to spend, but our aim should be to send to the United Kingdom, wine of such a character that the foreign article will be driven off the market. The reduction of this bounty is of great consequence to South Australia. Men of all classes in Adelaide, merchants, commercial men, and even ""the man in the street,"" were amazed at the Government's announcement of its policy and could Mr Foster. scarce given credence to it. The Government may be in possession of reports from the Development and Migration Comniission and various experts; if it has any information which justifies the reduction of the bounty without notice, it is treating this Parliament with disrespect when it asks it to pass this bill without having complete information as to what it. means. If the Government has auy justification for its action, we should insist upon knowing it before we vote for the bill. The soldiers are dependent upon private members as much as upon the Government, and they have not uttered one word of complaint about the wine exporters. All who know the conditions along the Murray Valley are perturbed by the Government's action, particularly having regard to the devastating frosts which ruined many of the crops this year. One section of the community cannot be ruined without the whole community being affected. When the bounty was first introduced, the hon- vignerons along the Murray Valley had experienced a very bad time, but they set to work courageously to prepare for a new order of things. Some of them had never exported a barrel of wine; a few had been in .the export trade to a limited .extent for the last 50 or 60 years, but they had to prepare for a new development, and they started with a mighty enthusiasm, that was contagious. They scraped together every shilling of capital they could get in order not to be caught napping when the London market was responding to their call. The distilleries enlarged their plants; one of them, which is owned entirely by the soldiers and is operated co-operatively, is the biggest in the world. A visit to it will convince any honourable member of the present magnitude of the wine trade and its future possibilities.",36
70,Mr MAKIN,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,It is the growers about whom we are concerned.,37
71,Mr FOSTER,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,The growers alone have made the representations I am putting before the House. Not one winemaker appears in connection with this appeal.,37
72,Mr MAKIN,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,The honourable member . will not deny that the wine-makers have benefited by the bounty.,37
73,Mr FOSTER,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"Of course they have. Have I uot said that some of them have doubled and trebled their plants? The whole enterprise has been a wonderful success, but I do not believe that fortunes, or even abnormal profits, have been made out of it . The development in this trade is unparalleled in the commercial history of Australia, and we should do nothing that will injure such a promising growth. If the Prime Minister has evidence that the wine-makers and distillers are getting an unfair proportion of the bounty, let that position be dealt with calmly and leisurely, but do not precipitate a crisis by legislation of this character. 1 know that many members are opposed to the wine-makers waxing f at on the bounty, but give them a chance; let the Government put all its cards on the tableand let us know upon what information it is acting. What has the bounty cost the Treasury? Every penny that has been paid out has been provided by the growers and wine-makers, who have wrought night and day, and faced hardships and difficulties in a fashion that marks them as heroes. themselves created the f u n d from which the bounty is paid. When the excise duty was first imposed, it was 4d. per gallon, as it was intended to cover only the cost of supervision by the excise officers. It was increased to 8d. a gallon, and later to ls . a gallon. Then the war occurred, bringing financial troubles in its wake, and although the excise was increased to 4s., 5s., and, I believe, even 6s. a gallon, the producers never murmured. Did any part of Australia contribute a greater number of men to the fighting forces in proportion to its population than did South Australia? That State must have spent, millions of pounds on the repatriation of its returned soldiers. It does not make a practice of coming, cap in hand, to the Commonwealth Parliament. It likes to be independent. But it also appreciates a little consideration. The industry has been remarkably successful, and if we had not grown f r u it along the river Murray, what could we have done for the development of those fertile areas?

74,Mr LATHAM,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [ 3 . 3 5 ] - I move That any amendment made in the schedule of the bill by the committee shall have effect on and after the day following the day the amendment is made, excepting where the committee otherwise decides, or the contrary intention appears. 'This is the usual motion that is submitted in order to safeguard the revenue, and to secure the imposition of duties according to the will of the committee. Question resolved in the affirmative.

75,Mr LATHAM,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [3.36] - I m o v e That the requested amendments be made. The first request relates to the change made by this committee in the duty on coffee. The proposal originally before us covered reductions of duty on coffee under the British preferential and intermediate tariff, and it was further provided that raw and kiln-dried coffee produced in any part of the British' Empire should he admitted free of duty. During the debate in this chamber and in another place, and subsequently, representations were made to the Government with respect to the effect of this concession upon the trade between Australia and Java, more particularly having regard to the circumstance that the Australian products exported to the Dutch East Indies are generally such as are obtainable elsewhere by the inhabitants of those countries, whereas the articles imported from those countries by Australia are not readily and conveniently obtainable by Australia elsewhere. Further, it has been pointed out that, when any distinct preference is given to a part of the Empire, it is usually embodied in a treaty upon the basis of reciprocity. The request of the Senate is that the item should be restored to its original unamended condition, and that, therefore, the duty on coffee should be as before, and not remitted in favour of Empire-grown coffee. Honourable members will recognize that this is not a very important item in itself. The committee is asked to agree to this request, and also to the second, third and fourth requests, which apply to the same item.",38
76,Mr GEEGORY,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"Swan) [3.39] - I am very pleased that the alteration has been accepted by the Government. particular attention to the fact that the Dutch Government has treated Australia remarkably well, particularly in allowing us to compete in the Java market on the same footing a3 its own people. A result of this generous action on the part of the Netherlands is that Australia has obtained a remarkable market in Java for butter, and a good outlet also for biscuits, bacon, and many other products. Had the first intention of the Government to give special consideration to India been carried out, it would almost certainly have resulted in the Netherlands Government introducing counteracting legislation. Motion agreed to. Item 105 (Piece Goods). Sena-te'i requestInsert after sub-item (E ) the following:""By omitting paragraph (1) of sub-item (rV and inserting in its stead the following paragraph:1. Piece goods, woollen, or containing wool (but not including flannel), ordinarily used in the manufacture of outer clothing for human wear and weighing more tlian six ounces per square yard; per square yard, British, Is.; intermediate, ls. Od.; general, 2s.; and ad val., British, 30 per cent.; intermediate, 40 per cent.; general, 45 per cent.",39
77,Mr LATHAM,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [3.40] - I move That the requested amendment be made. The effect of the amendment asked for is to reduce the weight of the cloth mentioned in this item from 6£ oz. to 6 oz. per square yard, and to delete the words "" the invoiced selling price of which does not exceed the equivalent of 3s. 4d. per square yard."" In 1925, the Tariff Board made a comprehensive inquiry into an application for increased duties on woollen piece goods, and the result was that the 1926 tariff included the item to which I have referred, under which these duties were imposed upon woollen piece goods ordinarily used in the manufacture of outer clothing for human wear, where the weight was more than 6-J oz. per square yard, and the invoiced selling price not more than 3s. 4d. per square yard. These are woollen goods, such as worsteds, used for ordinary suitings. The weight limit was inserted in order that light-weight women's woollen dress I draw goods, that are not manufactured to any great extent in the Commonwealth, should not be liable to the composite rates. This weight limit was acceptable to Australian weavers, it being considered . that a weight of 6^ oz per square yard drew a fair line of demarcation between goods manufactured in Australia and those that were not manufactured in this country upon a commercial scale, or to any substantial extent. It was also considered that the sale pf woollen piece goods weighing over 6'^ oz. per square yard, at 3s. 4d. or under per square yard was detrimentally affecting the Australiau industry, but that it was able to compete with imported goods invoiced at prices exceeding 3s. 4d. per square yard with only a slight increase in the tariff, o the rates being made 35 per cent. British preferential,. 45 per. cent, intermediate, and 50 per cent, general. Experience of the working of these duties shows that they have not been sufficiently effective, that Australian weavers are not receiving sufficient orders to keep the mills working full time, and that have been forced to put off a large number of operatives. amended. In some cases it has been found that the weight of woollen piece goods imported has been reduced to just under 6£ oz., and that reduction in weight removes them from this item. It has been found, also, that worsted goods have been sold in Australia at prices with which it is impossible for the Australian manufacturers to compete. Large quantities of goods of this description are being brought in at the present time, and the increase in importations may be judged by a comparison of the figures relating to the importation of men's suiting during the six months ended 31st December,' 1926, and that during the six months ended 31st December, 1927. In men's worsted suitings the increase was from £154,000 to £266,000; men's suitings, wholly woollen, from £223,000 to £440,000; and men's suitings, woollen mixed with cotton, from £136,000 to £328,000. The result is that the tariff, in its present form, is ineffective for the purposes for which it was introduced. The Australian wool industry is of very great importance to Australia. It is highly desirable that our wool should be worked up into the' completed product in this country as far as possible. Australian manufacturers are able to do this work, and do it well; but the present duties are ineffective because of the 6£ oz. condition, and the 3s. 4d. a square yard condition. It is therefore proposed to omit reference to the price, and to alter 6£ oz. to 6 oz.",39
78,Mr FOSTER,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"Wakefield) [3.48] These goods have been made up here for the last 60 years, and they can be up here today.

81,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"Swan) [3.50] - I ask the Attorney-General to allow progress to be reported now. He has given us a great deal of information which he may have supposed honourable members had before them, but he unfortunately neglected to tell the committee that this was an entirely new item. He quoted figures comparing the trade for six months of last year with that of six months of the previous year, but this tariff schedule was brought in last year, and this information was not previously available to honourable members. The Attorney-General, of course, has the original tariff in his possession. We, however, have not the tariff schedule, but only the amendment which was brought before us recently, and which was passed by this chamber, and sent on to the Senate. It is impossible to determine the effect of this amendment from the information which we have at our disposal now. I do not wish to delay the tariff, but I urge honourable members not to agree to this item today, even though we approve of the others. The alteration of this duty was not considered by the committee when we were dealing with the tariff previously, and I know of no recommendation having been made on the matter by the Tariff Board. I ask the Attorney-General whether it is possible to report progress now?",40
82,Mr LATHAM,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"It is desired to put this item through this afternoon if it is at all possible, because I can assure honourable members that this is an urgent matter. made Since the amendment was made m another place, large quantities of goods in have been removed, and are still being industrial removed, from bond.",40
83,Mr GEEGOEY,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"I wisb to oppose this alteration very strongly. The Attorney General has spoken of woollen mills which, he says, are unable to carry on. our The competition is so keen, he says, and would be a very grave matter if this big industry were not adequately proCan he tell us of one big, substantial firm in Australia which has applied for more protection? Take firms like Eoy and Gibson; there has been no appeal for assistance from them. There are shoddy firms which are always begging for assistance; but the substantial establishments are carrying on, and doing magnificently. I have here a letter from a big firm in Melbourne, in which a protest is made against the introduction of a new item to the tariff schedule. No honourable member knows anything about this proposal, except that we are increasing the cost of clothing to the people, and are pvitting extra dividends into the pockets of the manufacturers. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. GOVERNMENT BUSINESSUNEMPLOYMENT .",40
84,Mr BRUCE,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.53] - I move That the House do now adjourn. I wish to point out to honourable members that the moving of this motion means that the House will sit on Tuesday next, because this is provided for in a sessional order. On Tuesday next we shall go on with the Wine Bounty Bill, and that will probably be followed by the Customs Tariff Bill. It is hoped that the four small bills which follow on the notice paper, none of which is of a contentious nature, may be dealt with before the end of next week. The only other matter which will be brought up will be certain appropriations in respect to the allocation of last year's surplus. It is merely an appropriation, and does not introduce any new matter. It is also possible that there will be two second-reading speeches delivered, one in regard to dried fruits, and the other dealing with the proposed national exhibition.",41
85,Mr CHARLTON,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"Hunter) [3.57] - I wish to draw the attention of the House again to the position in regard to unemployment. This matter was discussed here recently; but since then the trouble has grown greater, and will, it appears, become more acute as the winter approaches. To-day we dealt with a number of proposals for new works which, if carried into effect, will give relief in some of the bigger centres. From the remarks of the Prime Minister this morning, however, I doubt very much whether these works will be gone on with for some time, because, he says, they depend on the Government being able to raise the necessary money. The conditions which exist in practically every centre are deplorable; but in no place are they worse than in Newcastle aud South Maitland. In those districts, not only are there some thousands of men unemployed, but many more are only partially employed. In some cases meu have not averaged more than five and a half days work a fortnight for the last two years. I have here a letter from the Trades and Labour Council, touching on the subject of unemployment, .in which it is asked that some of the tents of which the Government is disposing might be made available for the use of the unemployed. I do not know just to what tents the letter refers, except that in the past the Defence Department has disposed of military tents. I have asked the Minister for information, and he is making inquiries. If it is proposed to dispose of military tents, we should make some of them available to the unemployed, some of whom have no place to lay their heads. They are compelled to go into railway carriages to sleep, and often they are prosecuted for taking shelter there. The letter continues!The trade unions here view with alarm the deplorable conditions surrounding a large army of unemployed here and in other centres of the country, and to ask that the Federal Government be requested to ^hold in abeyance the statute, under which assisted nominated immigrants arc enabled to land here, till such time as the unemployed are provided with employment of a constant nature, and to ask that action be taken at once to relieve the distress which exists among the unemployed in all centres. We discussed that matter recently, and I do not want to go into it again at the moment, but the position is becoming graver every day. The immigrants who are coming to Australia are not all being absorbed in rural areas; many of them are displacing Australian workers in industrial centres. It does an immense amount of injury to Australia to have any migrants coming here and remaining unemployed. This matter is serious, and I urge the Government to give earnest consideration to it. If we cannot provide some big public work to give employment to our workless people we could, at least, suspend migration until the people already bere can secure employment. Mr IISTEB, (Corio) [4.3] - I trust that the Prime Minister will reconsider the order of business for Tuesday. As I intimated this morning while asking a question, there are many persons unemployed in my electorate on account of the insufficient protection we afford to the woollen industry. The Wine Export Bounty Bill is important, - but I hardly think it is so important as the tariff matters that are awaiting our attention, and I trust that the Prime Minister will give the tariff business precedence on Tuesday.",41
86,Dr MALONEY,CUSTOMS TABIFF VALIDATIO N,"Melbourne) [4.4] Our blunt, bluff friend, the High Commissioner, Sir Granville Ryrie, bas made a statement to the effect that there is room for 100,000 domestic servants in Australia. Yesterday I received a letter from a lady wbo keeps a guest-house at St. Kilda, in which she informed me that 40 persons had replied in one morning to a small advertisement which she bad inserted in the daily press for a domestic servant. She also said they complained-that there were so many of them out of work. The Prime Minister will remember that the elder of the Gracchus in describing conditions in ancient Borne said that the birds of the air bad nests, and the beasts of the field lairs to wbicb they could go, but that the soldiers of Borne were left without a resting place, and had to starve when the wars were over. We do not desire that kind of thing to happen in Australia. During the last 39 years I bave been connected with every unemployed movement in Melbourne, and 1I have never before known conditions to be so serious at this time of the year as they are now. I thank God that there is a Salvation Army to provide homes for the homeless and food for the hungry. I do not accuse the Government of lack of sympathy with the distressed section of our community, but I ask it to try to do something to relieve the position. There is something radically wrong in Australia for this kind of thing to occur. In Western Australia new migrants are displacing Australians to a great extent. I inquired into this matter towards the end of last year, and both my son and his partner, who are on the land there, assured me that they received frequent applications for work from new arrivals. That is not a fair thing. I sbould be as delighted as any one to welcome migrants from the four kingdoms if we had work for tbem, or could place them on the land, but we cannot do it. It bas been frequently pointed out that whenever Crown lands are thrown open for application by the people there are many more applicants than there are blocks available. In Queensland there were over 1,000 applicants for one block. Many sons of Australian farmers have been disappointed at their inability to obtain land. The number of unemployed in England is very large, and a certain stigma has been cast upon them for accepting what is called the dole. I point out that it is not a dole, nor a charitable gift, but a fund to which employees as well as employers and the Government contribute. This matter will have to be investigatedIsooncr or later, and we should look.into it at once. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.10 p.m.",42
