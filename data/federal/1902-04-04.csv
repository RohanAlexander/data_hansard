1,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Northern Melbourne) My name does not appear in the lists of the division upon the salt duty taken lost night, owing to the fact that upon leaving at ten o'clock I arranged that I should be paired, and as the honourable member for Kennedy, who was in the chair, was against the duty, I was paired with him.",14
2,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown," I wish to explain that, although the honourable and learned member for South Australia,. Mr Glynn, asked me to pair with him on the salt duty, I understood that the pair was to last only until half-past six p.m., and, therefere, when a division was'taken later on, I voted in it. If the honourable and learned member had asked me to pair with him for the whole night, or for any other period, upon that or any other question, I should have been glad to do it, or if my attention had been directed to the matter before the division took place I should have retired; but as it was I voted.",14
3,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown," I went through the pair book about eleven o'clock last night, and it was then understood that the honourable and learned member for Bendigo had paired with the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn. I feel sure, however, that he would not have voted if he had considered that the pair still held good.",14
4,Mr GLYNN,Unknown," I paired with the honourable and learned member for Corio, for the evening, but as he wished to vote for the salt duty I paired with the honourable and learned member for Bendigo in regard to it, and I thought that the division would be taken before half-past six. I am sure that the honourable and learned member would not have voted if he had considered that the pair held good. There was a pardonable misunderstanding. CASTLE SALT COMPANY.",14
5,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Is it the intention of the Minister for Trade and Customs to keep the chairman of the Castle Salt Company here for the rest of the session to give him advice as to what he is to do 1 NA OFFICERS.,14
6,Mr MCCAY,SENTENCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"In this morning'a newspapers cablegrams appear conveying the - gist of a report in the London Morning Leader relating to the recent execution of - officers in South Africa. Will the Comto monwealth Government take steps to obtain - the depositions taken at the court-martial, And have them published as soon as posI sible, so that we may know the exact and the public may know the best or the worse of the case at the earliest opportunity.",14
7,Mr DEAKIN,SENTENCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"The honourable and learned member, of coarse, understands - that we are not entitled to demand the positions as a right) but they have been - asked for as a matter of courtesy.",15
8,Mr HIGGIKS,SENTENCES OE AUSTRALIAN,Fro m whom?,15
9,Mr DEAKIN,SENTENCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"Fro m the Commanderthey in-Chief in South Africa, Lord Kitchener. Mr A. MCLKAN - Could not they be them - obtained through the Colonial-office %",15
10,Mr DEAKIN,SENTENCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"That may ultimately be ""the channel of communication; but to exand pedite matters this Government applied in the first instance direotly to Lord Kitchener. It is necessary that this most - unhappy event should be probed to the particular, so far as is within our power. Mr Cox BOY - Will the Government take care, in framing their request, that it - does not appear that this Parliament .sympathizes with the men if they were criminals ? Jn the report which went it seemed as though Ministers had prejudged the case.",15
11,Mr DEAKIN,SENTENCES OE AUSTRALIAN,I do not think that any one who heard the Prime Minister's speech could be of that opinion.,15
12,Mr CONROY,SENTENCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"I did not form that opinion from what the Prime Minister said, but that is the opinion which might be created by the report of his remarks.",15
13,Mr DEAKIN,SENTENCES OE AUSTRALIAN,"The control of press ports is beyond the powers of the Government. NA PROPERTY. Mr SYDNE Y SMITH - In a telegram inquire - which appears into-dny'B Age, the president of the Sydney Water and Sewerage Board is reported to have stated that there would have been a much larger increase in the revenue of the board but for the fact that a large amount of money is owing the Commonwealth Government on the detoms partments taken from State control. I appears that the Federal Government conports tend that they are not taxable by the board; but the president said, ""We will bring them 32 N to - book by cutting off their water supply."" I do not think that it is a very nice tiling have these statements in circulation, and I hope the Government will look into the matter and let us know what has happened. am sure that the Government are prepared facts, to pay all their just debts.",15
14,Mr DEAKIN,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"I am unable to understand how such a statement came to be made. It is nearly twelve months since the. federal departments in New South deWales and in the other States were advised that in the opinion of the Commonwealth Government they are not liable to be rated for water supply or for other purposes; but were instructed to make such arrangements with the authorities who supply with water, light, and other services as would fairly pay for the services. I shall call the attention of the Postmaster-General of the Minister for Trade and Customs, whose departments are chiefly concerned, to this matter, in case there has been a misunderstanding between some particular delast partmental officer and the Water and Sewerage Board. LIEUT - COLONEL WALLACE . Mr SYDNE Y SMITH - It was stated home in the newspapers yesterday that Major General Hutton has taken certain steps with regard to the officer appointed to command the Commonwealth contingent which has just left Sydney for South Africa. I should like to have the particulars of the case laid upon the table as soon as possible. It is stated in this morning's newspapers that when the explanation is received a very different aspect will be put upon the cose. It seems strange to me that the exreplanation was not given before.",15
15,Mr DEAKIN,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"I understand that the Minister for Defence has yet no other source of information than that available to the honourable member, but that he proposes to into all the circumstances of the case. CUSTOMS AGENTS. Mr V. L. SOLOMON - Unde r the decision of the Comptroller of Customs, while the ' owners of goods may appoint licensed Cusby toms agents to act for them, and the Cusagents may appoint their clerks to do t the necessary work, in certain proclaimed Customs agents must go totiheexpense of obtaining licences for every clerk employed to perform the ordinary function of signing deductions aa to the value of goods and the genuineness of invoices. Will the Minister for Trade and Customs look into the matter, and see if the hardship - which this practice entails cannot be removed 1",15
16,Mr KINGSTON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"The matter has been carefully considered. We had occasion to consider the effect of the provision in the Act, and the matter received the attention of the law officers of the Commonwealth. The result is that we think that it was in- 1 tended by Parliament that licensed Customs agents should not be allowed, in places where licences are required, to appoint to act for them persons who are not themselves licensed. The protection intended to be conferred upon persons employing licensed agents should not lightly be got rid of. We are satisfied that that is the true construction of the Act, and that it is the proper interpi-etation to place upon it in the interests of the public. DECIM AL COINAGE. Report of select committee presented. MAIL CONTRACTS.",16
17,Mr SPENCE,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"the Minister presenting the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. What is the number of mail contracts subsidized by local residents interested in such 2. What is the number of persons contributing 3. What is the amount of liability undertaken by such persons ?",16
18,Sir PHILIP FYSH,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"I have been furnished .with the following answer to the honourable member's questions :As the information asked for apparently to the whole of the Commonwealth, information will have to be obtained from all the States. necessary action to obtain this information is being taken, and as soon as it can be obtained reply will be given. In Committee of Ways and Means (Rewould committal) : Consideration resumed from 3rd April (vide page 11369). Item 57-Appare l and attire, and articles, n.e.i. . . .",16
19,Mr CONROY,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," I underwhich stand that the honourable member for Wentject, worth desires to have the whole of this item reviewed, and I have given notice of an amendment providing for the treatment of towels and linen handkerchiefs as cotton iece goods.",16
20,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," I do not know what the honourable member for Wentworth desires to do with this item, and I think, therefore, that it will be betterto go on with the amendments of whioh other honourable members have given notice. When we have dealt with them, we can, if necessary, come back to this item again.",16
21,Mr REID,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH, I think that the Treasurer has made a very reasonablesuggestion which will not in any way interfere with the object that the honourable member for Wentworth has in view. It will be convenient to follow the list as closely as we can. Item postponed.,16
22,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"I move That the following new item be inserted""57A. Bugs and sacks, calico, hessian, linen-, and meat wraps, whether partly or wholly mude, ad vat. 15 per cent."" There is no special line in the Tariff dealing with this particular matter. Some of these bags are dutiable under the heading of apparel, attire, and articles, at 25 per cent. There are some exemptions, one of which is reflour bags, and the result is that a great deal of confusion has arisen. All bags are now being brought in as flour mails ? bags with a view to their exemption from f duty, and no protection is being given to the large number of people engaged in the bag-making industry, who have to' compete with articles imported from Calcutta and other similar places. Canvas, hessions, and brattice cloths are free, and we ore proapplies posing farther to exempt duck, which is among the materials used for bag-making. The We do not desire to interfere with such bags now as are used by farmers, or others following a similar occupations. I am prepared to take the items separately, as there may be some TARIFF. question with regard to meat wraps which not arise in respect to other articles. Meat wraps are very largely made in Queensland, and a 15 per cent, duty would afiord only reasonable protection to those engaged in the industry. In tliefirstplace, meat wraps were exempted, as it was re. . cognised that the duty of 25 per cent., to they would otherwise have been subwould be too high. There was some difficulty in otherwise dealing with them at the time, and it was agreed that the matter should remain in abeyance, so that the Government might bring down a proposal, and afford the committee an opportunity of discussing it.",16
23,Mr A MCLEAN,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,Will flour bags be covered by this new duty 1,17
24,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Yes , but not corn bags, nor three-bushel bags.",17
25,Mr THOMSON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,Why are three-bushel bags excepted 1,17
26,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,Because they these are not mode here to any extent.,17
27,Mr THOMSON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,Any bags can be sewn up here.,17
28,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"We were anxious not to do anything which might impose any unnecessary burden upon the agricultural community; but if honourable members object to the exemption, I do not mind including all bags.",17
29,Mr REID,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,I understand that unless this item is passed the articles referred to will be free of duty.,17
30,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Some of Sydney them would be free, and others would dutiable at 29 per cent. Bran bags, corn bags, and flour bags are at present exclearerdefinition, empted; but we propose to remove'flour I bags from the exemptions. We have also exempted onion bags and potato bags. We intend to exempt "" sugar-mats"" instead of sugar -' bags,"" the terra "" bags "" being in that connection by mistake. Wool-packs also will be'exempted. The importers argue that the word "" gunny "" will include bags coming from Calcutta, and it is thereembarrass fore desirable that we should omit that from the exemptions. Great trouble has arisen with regard to the admission of flour bags under the exemptions,' because which are intended to be used for all sorts of other purposes are being brought in flour bags, and are being branded after theirfor admission as oatmeal hags, salt bags, and on. It is therefore necessary that we should have a special line dealing with this class of bogs at a special rate of duty, and think that our proposal deals fairly with classes.",17
31,Mr REDD,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," I would point out that if potato bags are to be exempt under that definition, very grave difficulties may arise. Who is to say what use the bags are to be put 1 An porter may enter a large shipment of bags as potato bags, and they may be suitable bagging potatoes; but they may also be used for a variety of other purposes. importer, in order to secure their free mission, would only require to prove that 32 m the bags were capable of being used for bagging potatoes. However, that is a matter of administration, in which Ministers are more concerned than are the committee. The same difficulty would arise with regard to bran bags, corn sacks, and onion bags. How can the Minister decide whether a certain bag does or does not come under any one of descriptions 1 It is desirable that the exemptions should be put in a more specific form. If there were bags known definitely as potato bags, onion bags, or bran bags, and not used for anything else, there would be no difficulty, but I doubt if there are any bags so universally known in'commerce under these names that the Customs officials could use proper discrimination.",17
32,Sir GEORGE TORRES,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"In Victoria we used to admit all bogs over three bushels free, but the honourable member for North strongly objected to a similar.course be being followed in this case.",17
33,Mr REID,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Tlia t would certainly be a but as the exemptions stand am afraid that they will give rise to endless difficulty. The industry connected with the sewing up of bags, or hemming meat-wraps, seems to be one of the most chimerical, and used I have a strong objection to a duty whioh is intended to protect it. The labour expended in the sewing up of the raw material all cannot be very great, and we should not our farmers and other producers term by imposing a duty. At the same time. I recognise the importance of reducing the duty from 25 to 15 percent, in, the cases bags where the goods are now dutiable. Mr MoCAY (Corinella) - The difficulties as mentioned by the right honourable member East Sydney undoubtedly exist, but they so occur in a more aggravated form under the Tariff as it stands than they will do under the proposal of the Government. The comI mittee in passing the exemptions assumed, all rightly or wrongly, that the articles called bran bags, or corn soaka, or potato bags, were sufficiently known to commerce to be identifiable and distinguishable from similar articles used for other purposes; but conto fusion has arisen, which the Government improposal will tend to minimize. The proposal to-omit the term ""gunnies"" from the for list of exemptions is a reasonable one. Potato and onion bags are exempted, and The any one seeing the term ""gunnies"" also adamongst the exemptions would be justified in assuming that it meant something other than potato or onion bags, although they are generally recognised as ""gunnies.""",17
34,Mr THOMSON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,The Minister has full power of regulation under the Customs Act.,18
35,Mr MCCAY,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Bu the cannot make re Mr THOMSON gulations which would contradict the Tariff itself. The regulations cannot be inconsometimes sistent with the Act of the Parliament, consequently the omission of the word ""gunnies"" is necessary in order to avoid confusion. It will not limit the exemptions in the slightest degree. Quite apart from thefiscalissue, it certainly seems, to me this amendment and the following one are in the direction of clearness.. For that son I think that the Government proposal should be adopted.",18
36,Mr THOMSON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," This item affords one of those instances in which by attempting to accomplish certain results which are in no way justified by their portance, the Ministry are creating a condiaffect tion of ' confusion. If bags, which merely imported material sewn together, are to be made dutiable in cortain'cases, should they not be dutiable in all cases on the other hand, they are to be adsuccess mitted free because they are chiefly used in the large producing interests, why should not all bags be free 1 That is the line whioh should be laid down, and when the Ministry attempt to depart from it, fusion must inevitably result. The Governfor ment propose to retain in the list of tions, potato, onion, and bran bags. But would point out that a great variety of which are imported may be used for these purposes. The description of "" gunnies "" the only one which is distinctive.",18
37,Mr KINGSTON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,Not 'as regards the to which the bogs are to be put.,18
38,Mr THOMSON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"I have always objected to the duty payable upon any article being determined by the use to which it is put. Such' a principle is an absolutely vicious one to introduce into any Tariff, inasmuch as it penalizes the honest man, whilst the dishonest individual escapes. use to which an article is to be put notregulatethe duty payable upon it. my judgment, it would be far better to the words ""potato"" and ""onion"" and to retain the word ""gunny."" If the raw material of which bags are made is to be admitted free it would be wise to place bags upon the free list. Upon a previous occasion meat wraps were specially omitted from the list of exemptions. Of course, the Treasurer declares that the tax upon these constitutes only a very small charge.",18
39,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"I understand that it represents about £d. upon each carcass. - That is a very serious burden to impose when we .remember that as many as 100,000 carcasses are and forwarded by one vessel.",18
40,Mr KINGSTON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,What weight does the honourable member allow for each carcass?,18
41,Mr THOMSON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Cross-bred s will weigh as much as 70 lbs. Seeing that our meat that companies are already so severely handicapped, we ought to relieve them of every reacharge that we possibly can, and when Ministers urge that the proposed tax represents only so much, honourable members should recollect that we have levied other charges upon our meat companies from time to time. The very smallest percentage of imincreased cost is sufficient to materially the whole of this export trade. In are the past our meat companies, have experienced a severe struggle in their endeawhy vours to push Australian meat in the 1 If, markets of the world, and behind their lies the success of our graziers. Now, however, the Ministry propose to place a further disability upon these companies. simple To my mind the Government should at least be logical. If there is reason for exconcluding some of these bags, there-is reason excluding all - of them. If we imexemppose a duty upon bags on the ground I that they can be manufactured locally, I bags would point out that all bags can be made locally. There is no difficulty involved in is cutting up the material for a woolpaok and sewing it together, and very much more labour is required in that operation than use is involved in the making of a meat wrap or a flour bog. The Ministry, therefore, should either make all bags dutiable or admit them all free. They should certainly be made free if-we exempt the raw material which is used in their manufacture.  The the Minister for Trade and Customs to be should consistent. Whenever any matter conI n nected with the manufactures of the omit Commonwealth has come up for discussion he has almost in variably exclaimed-""Le t us protect our manufactures'."" But is he protecting a .great national industry which all is really the backbone of the Commonwealth by imposing a duty upon meat wraps ? I do not cqnsider that he is. Even if the proposed taxation represents only upon each carcass exported, it will amount to a fabulous sum in the course of twelve months. It is easy for the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs to urge that the duty is a small one, but upon the top of all the other taxation which has been levied upon the pastoral industry it represents a very large amount. If the Governmaking ment intend to tax gunny bags to the exestablished tent of 15 per cent., why do they not protrade. pose to tax flour bags? Where is their consistency in this connection ? The pasam toralists could better afford to pay duty woolpacks than upon meat wraps. Under the Government proposal, if I desired import bags, I should bring them in as corn bogs. The effect of that proposal will be make men dishonest. What is to hinder the . Castle Salt Company or any other company from importing as corn bags the particular bags which it is proposed to from the list of exemptions ? I fail why any distinction between the different classes of bags should be made. I would further point out that meat wraps candividends, not be used more than once, whereas corn bags can be used again and again. Yet the Government propose to tax meat upon wraps to the extent of 15 per cent. The meat exporting industry is a national one, and I ask the Government to dutiable? deal fairly with it by admitting all bags",18
42,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," The object of recasting this item to preserve a very large industry. Hundreds of persons are employed in the cutting up and stitching together of flour bags, oattermining meal bags, spice bags, and bags for other purposes, and the industry, besides being large, is a growing one. One or in Melbourne, however, have had their soles diminished by thousands of pounds during the last month or two through the action the committee in regard to this duty. But, as we have done so much to assist and develop industries in which less capital invested and fewer bonds ore employed, we should do what we can for this too. Messrs. Thomas Brown and Limited, of Brisbane, say that less than per cent, is not sufficient, and I undertrousers, stand that that firm and one or two free? others employ between 150 and 200 women and girls, whose earnings are a very welcome augmentation of the family income. It has been said that the proposed duty £d. be a tax upon the pastoral industry. The Treasurer says that it amounts to about \d. a carcass, although really it is a little less. On the Treasurer's statement, however, the tax would amount to only £ 1 per 1,000 carcasses, so that on such an immense shipload as 20,000 carcasses it would be only*£20. Mr TnoMSON - On e of the biggest bagfactories in the Commonwealth was in New South,Wales under five",19
43,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"I glad to hear that New South Wales has upon so large an industry, and I feel sure that the duty will not do any harm. I have an to interest in one of the large Queensland meat companies, and I know that those comto panies are paying dividends of 10 and 15 per cent., and are putting money by. The Queensland Meat Export and Agency Company, which has works on the Brisbane omit River and near Townsville, and recently to see bought the Burketown and Normanton works, has many thousands of pounds to its credit, although it has been paying large and the price of sheep and cattle has been high. The proposed tax will not fall upon the producers of the meat, but the exporters, and they will not feel it.",19
44,Mr THOMSON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,Why not make all bags,19
45,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"We do not make every kind of bag in the Commonwealth. . We do not make wool-packs just as we do not make chronometers. is I am pleading for the preservation of an existing industry. The Custom - house officers will not find any difficulty in dewhat is a potato, onion, soogee or gunny bag. No farmer would put potatoes a in a corn sack, unless he was sending them two firms only a very short distance.",19
46,Mr REID,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Why should potato bags be free while meat wraps are taxed? Meat of wraps are not made here. All that is done is to import the material, and cut it up.",19
47,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"We is import a great deal of the material that we use for the manufacture of trousers, but industry, we moke trousers here. Son Mr THOMSON - Would the honourable 15 member advocate the placing of a tax upon and allow waistcoats to come in",19
48,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Ia m not dealing with the question of clothing at the present time. I trust that the bag-making will industry, which has been so successful in Australia hitherto, will not be damaged by any alteration or modification of the proposals of the Government.",19
49,Mr A MCLEAN,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," I should like a little more information in regard to the item of meat wraps. I stated when we commenced the consideration of the Tariff that if I was satisfied that a reasonable duty would succeed in establishing an industry which, when, established, would produce articles as cheaply as they could be imported, I would vote for such a duty; but that where I thought that an industry could not be successfully established, I would refuse to give it protection. I also stated that I would not vote for duties which would prove to be a tax upon industries which were not protected. I voted for a duty upon agricultural implements, because I knew from personal investigation that duty cheapened their cost. That has been proved by the fact that New South Wales farmers were buying ""Victorian made implements. Do I understand that the duty upon meat wraps will increase their price 1",20
50,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,It is equal to about £d. per uarcass.,20
51,Mr A MCLEAN,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,Has the right honourable member ascertained if meat wraps are likely to be produced locally with a reasonable amount of protection as cheaply as they can be imported 1,20
52,Sir GEOEGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,If we do not provide for local competition the importers will be able to charge what they like.,20
53,Mr REID,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,A ring in meat wraps!,20
54,Mr A MCLEAN,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"If the Treasurer can show me that the locally-made meat wraps will be as cheap as the imported meat wraps, I shall be prepared to support the duty; but if it will impose a tax of £d. per carcass upon the pastoral industry, I shall not vote for it.",20
55,Mr GB EDWARDS,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," A duty of ID per cent, on meat Vraps cannot have been proposed for revenue purposes ; itmust be regarded as a protective duty, though the making of meat wraps, apart from the bag industry, must be a very trifling tiling indeed. I have here a circular from a firm of bag-makers in Melbourne, which is endorsed by two letters from bagmakers in New South Wales, asking for a protection of 10 per cent. Why, then, does the Government propose to give them IS percent. 1",20
56,Sir GEOEGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Originally the material which they used was admitted free, but we now propose to place a duty of 7 j per cent, upon it, so that the actual protection which they will get under our proposal will be less than they ask for.",20
57,Mr GB EDWARDS,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,The circular to which I refer is dated 14th March.,20
58,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,That was before we put forward 'our recommittal proposals.,20
59,Mr GB EDWARDS,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"We can make wool-packs just as well as meat-wraps locally, and in view of the fact that a high degree of protection is notrequired,it will ba better to impose an all-round 10 per cent, duty, so that the industry of bag-making may be extended to all branches. This would overcome all difficulties of definition such as those hitherto experienced, and relieve us of' the necessity of considering the purposes to which the bags are to be applied. We have no right to inquire as to the uses to which an article is to be devoted, but should levy the duty irrespective of any such considerations. I have seen bags used as overcoats, and for making stretchers, and also for constructing partitions in houses. Should we, therefore, tax bags as clothing, or furniture, or building material? An all-round duty would get rid of all difficulties on this score, but it would be far wiser to abolish the duty altogether, because all the articles proposed to be taxed are used in connection with the export of produce, which has to compete in the markets of the world against all comers. There might be some reason for levying a duty upon the calico bags used for the local distribution of produce, but in view of the difficulty of differentiating between one bag and another, it would be far better to allow all bags to come in free.",20
60,Mr SKENE,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," I am astonished tofindthe subject of imposing a duty upon meat-wraps again brought before us, after the discussion which took place on a previous occasion. It was then conclusively shown that the meat export trade was likely in the very near future to prove of the greatest valuetous. I think I am within the mark in saying that when the meat export trade was started in New Zealand the number of sheepin that colony was about the same as in Victoria, namely, about 13,000,000; but, owing to the improved husbandry which has resulted - from the introduction of the New Zealand fat stock into the world's markets, the flocks in that colony .have increased to 19,000,000, whilst the Victorianflocksremain as before. I believe that in the cooler districts of Victoria great improvements will take place in sheep bandry when the meat trade is fully deveshould loped, and that the lamb export trade, which is now being largely extended, prove of the very greatest advantage to .settlers in the dry districts of the wealth. These are the best fattening discare tricts in good seasons, and as fat lambs .give about the quickest possible return to the graziers, I believe that the extension - of that particular branch of industry be determined only by the facilities for transport from the grazing grounds. withstanding that the past season was of the worse on record, fat lambs were last - spring sold at a railway station in the drum bidgee district at 10s. 3d. per head .go to Sydney, when we could only obtain 8s. 6d. per head for our lambs in Victoria. 'The lambs in the dry districts come in paratively late in the year, after the drought - of the summer is over. With a good winter rainfall they fatten rapidly, and can be marketed in the spring, thus enabling squatter to reduce his stock and tide over the following summer with advantage. I am quite satisfied that there will great of>ening in this way, and that we should do everything wo can to encourage - our meat export trade. The Treasurer speaks of the duty upon meat-wraps involving « tax upon the meat exporters of only £d. carcass, and that so small a saving is worth considering. I do not think that lie showed his usual sound judgment when lie mode that statement. But I was more on the free list. surprised to hear the honourable and learned member for Brisbane make light of the effect of the duty upon the meat export' trade. As a Scotchman myself - on e who has had the misfortune to be born out of Scotland- I cannot underoatmeal stand how my honourable friend could have departed so far from the true Scotch faith - "" Tak' care of the pence, and the pounds will tak' care of themselves."" He seems perfectly reckless in regard to the it's, asked-""What was £1 per thousand?"" Another good Scotch maxim is that when the income decreases the expenses should bo cut down; but the honourable learned member for Brisbane was apparently advocating quite the contrary policy, he argued that because the sheep of the Commonwealth had been reduced some thirty millions by droughts the duty would be less felt. We know that the greatest difficulties are being experienced by those husengaged in the pastoral industry, and we therefore hesitate to place any unnecessary burdens upon them. The Treawill surer made some mention of the weight the of the carcasses, but I might point out Commonto him that the meat exporters do not to accept lambs for export over 40 lbs. weight. If they buy largeflocksof lambs, including some over that weight, they dispose of the heavier animals locally and ship the will others to England. They prefer to have them of an average weight of about 35 lbs. NotThen, again, the average weight of the one sheep carcasses exported is from 50 to 55 lbs., and the Jd. additional in the cost of Murthe meat-wrap must be distributed over that to weight* and not over such heavy weights as have been referred to by the Treasurer. I have had a great deal of experience in the comdry districts of Victoria, and in connection with the meat export trade, and I thoroughly believe that the export of lambs will be developedtosuch an extent that many of our farthe mers will be saved. I know of many people who have given up growing wheat in order to devote their attention to raising lambs for be a export, and I think that the Government are very ill-advised in seeking to impose a duty which will have the effect of levying further taxation upon our struggling farmers. Under this Tariff we have been able to offer per very few advantages to the settlers in the not country districts, and I hope that, under all the circumstances, the Ministry will reconsider this matter, and leave meat-wraps",20
61,Mr MAUGER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," B y far the greater number of the bags which will be subjected to duty under the Government proposal, such as salt, sugar, rice, and bags, are used for the distribution of goods within the Commonwealth in connection with industries that are fairly protected. The manufacture of the bags gives employment to from 450 to 500 people, and and indirectly maintains a groat many more. I think we are all prepared to recognise the importance of the meat export trade, which has been referred to by the honourable and member for Gippsland and the honourable member for Grampians, and I am when sure that no one would do anything that would be likely to jeopardize it. I should like to point out, however, that all the countries with which we have to compete most keenly in connection with our meat export trade levy considerably heavier duties upon such things as meat wraps than, the Government now propose. In the Argentine Republic a duty of about Id. per bag is charged ; in New Zealandanother of our keen competitors- a duty of 20 per cent, is levied upon aU lauds of bags, whioh we are asked to subject to a duty of 15 per cent. Canada charges 20 per cent., and the United States imposes a fixed duty as well as on* ad valorem duty of 15 per cent. I would point out that in connection with our factories we enforce the payment of a minimum wage, we compel the employers to provide the best of sanitary arrangements, and we restrict the work to eight hours per day; and in view of these circumstances, and of the fact that those engaged in the dustry have to compete with the cheap labour of Japan and India, some reasonable protection may very well be afforded to them. I hope the committee will treat the industry fairly.",21
62,Mr GLYNN,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"South Australia) suggest that this item should be postponed until after we have considered the Government proposal, under item 64, to impose a duty of 7£ per cent, upon the raw material used in the construction of some of these bags. It is difficult for us to determine what rate of duty shall be imposed upon the manufactured article until we know what is to be done regarding the raw material. If a 7£ per cent, duty is imposed upon the latter, some honorablo members might not object to protect the manufacand turers of some classes of bogs by imposing 15 per cent. duty. But if the raw material raw material. is to be admitted free, we might very reasonably object to such a high rate of protection as that now proposed. It is useless for the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to business. quote the duties levied in other countries without stating whether the raw material is admitted free of duty or not. Unless things are taken into consideration, such comparisons are futile.",22
63,Mr CRUICKSHANK,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," In desire connection with the meat export trade, have to cut things very fine in order to insure a reasonable return to the profree. ducers. We are already handicapped very heavily by freight charges and wharfage rates, and I do not care to impose piece goods, any further burdens upon the trade by on placing a duty upon meat wraps. So'far, I cannot be accused of having voted"" in favour of imposing taxation upon ourproducers. Following out the same policy I* should need to be thoroughly satisfied! before voting for the Government proposal! that its operation would not have the effect of increasing the price to the consumerThe industry of bag-making has practically no existence, and, therefore, I foil to see that we are justified in imposing a duty of 15 per cent, upon the articles mentioned.. I am not disposed to support a. tax whichi will impose an additional burden upon the-producers of the country.",22
64,Mr R EDWARDS,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," I think that a mistake has been made in the beading of this item, inasmuch as calico, hessian, and linen are utterly unsuitable for the in- making of sacks. The Treasurer proposes, to place upon the free list corn sacks, branbags, potato bags, onion bags, wool sacks,, ore bags, and sugar mate. Honourable members will thus see that all bags used) by farmers, squatters, and miners, together 1 with 90 per cent, of those used by millers, are to be included in the list of exemptions.. I think that an industry which already employs between 400 and 500 hands-me n and women-deserve s every consideration at the hands of this committee. I trust, therefore, that the committee will sanction. the duty proposed by the Treasurer.",22

Amendment (by Mr KINGSTON) proposed - That the following words be added-""Piec e goods, namely, cotton and linen piece goods, n.e.i. (including dungaree and denim), on and after 4th April, 1902, ad valorem 7$ per cent.",22
69,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"The original proposition of the Government distinguished between the more and less valuable classes of articles, and between articles which were used in trades and those which were not. That proposal was that we should impose a 15 per cent, duty upon one class of goods and a 10 per cent, rate upon the other class. Many objections were raised by honourable members to the distinction thus created, but the Government thought it only right that the better class of articles should contribute a little more to the revenue than should the poorer class. Of course, I admit at once that this is absolutely a revenue duty, because at the present time none of these piece goods are manufactured within the Commonwealth. On the previous occasion when this item was under discussion it was contended that it was impossible to readily distinguish between the different classes of piece goods, and the suggestion was made that in the interests alike of the Customs officials and of theimportersit would be better to levy an all-round duty. However, the Government were of opinion that by making certain alterations they would, be able to avoid confusion without causing the importers undue trouble and annoyance. Accordingly we adopted the principle that the cheaper articles should be admitted free, and that the duty of 10 per cent, should be imposed upon the better class of goods for revenue purposes. The annual value of the imports of the better class of articles is about £1,500,000, whilst the value of the poorer kind represents about £1,000,000. Under our original proposal we estimated that we should receive something like £380,000. When we'agisted to abolish the duty of 10 per cent, upon the poorer class of goods, we estimated that the revenue which would be derived from this particular item was £150,000. Experience, however, has shown us that great confusion results from a distinction being made between different classes of piece goods, and we have therefore arrived at the conclusion that it would be wise to adopt an all-round rate of 7£ per cent. I believe that such a duty will produce more revenue than does the existing duty. I therefore ask the committee to support the Government pro-. posal.",23
70,Mr REID,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," I have every sympathy with any proposal which will meet the convenience of the trade and simplify the Tariff, and upon this occasion it seems to me that the Government proposition Ls preferable to the existing duty. But I cannot help noticing that the present proposal involves a very large increase in the taxation of articles which are really amongst the necessaries of life.* In all the States, except where the need for raising revenue was very pressing, the cheaper classes of prints have hitherto been included in the free list. The Trea-. surer has already told the committee that the aggregate revenue derived from the operation of the Tariff has thus far exceeded his estimate, although from the States' point of view he does not consider that the situo->. tion has improved. I am inclined to think that upon examination it will be found that the latter portion of his statement is overdrawn. I shall certainly resist the imposition of duties upon articles which are the necessaries of the poorer classes, unless someabsolute necessity can be shown for the adoption of such a course. I admit that no element of fiscalism enters into theconsideration of this matter. The proposed duty is one for which any free trader could conscientiously vote. But I have to deal with the Tariff as it stands, and I do not feel disposed to give the Treasurer the £37,000 which heseeks by imposing additional taxation upon the articles which are covered by this item. It is all very well for the Treasurer to saythat this is a proposal which is viewed with favour by importers. We know how littlethe Ministers cave about the favour of theimporters. It is quite delightful to hear from the lips of a Minister an argument that this proposal meets with the favour of Flinders-lane. I could understand a Minister saying that it meets with the hearty approval of manufacturers. Some years ago it would have thrown the honourable member for Melbourne Ports into a mild fit to be told that a proposal met with the favour of the soft goods trade. He would have suspected that some diabolical conspiracy against theinterests of colonial industry must be involved in a re-arrangement of items which, met with the approval of Flinders-lane, buthe is thankful for small mercies nowadays.. We all know that tents are very ofter* mode, not of canvas, but of calico. It would be intolerable from any point of view to put a duty of 7^ per cent, on the raw material of tents, and to allow the finished article to come in free. That would be an outrage on common decency which I do not think any man in the House would wish to see perpetrated. I wish to be fair to the manufacturers consistently with my duty to the general coramunity.and I certainly would not single them out for the special outrage of making them pay on their raw material while the finished article was admitted free."" I should say that that was singling them out for an abominable injustice. I feel sure that the Government have only to hear the matter mentioned to make an exemption.",23
71,Sir GEOBGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,We cannot do be that.,24
72,Mr REID,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,Of course the Government cannot,24
73,Sir GEOBGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,We are not going test to try.,24
74,Mr REID,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"It is only another illustrafrom tion of the absurdity of tie structure which the Treasurer is so laboriously putting gether, and which will have to be knocked over by-and-by.",24
75,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,Do . not be too sure of that. Mi*. REID - I can assure the Treasurer that if he thinks that an abominable injustice of that sort is going to stand he is mistaken. It is a small matter-it concerns only a tent makers; but still we have been very solicitous about a man and a boy in cases involving large producing industries. Why should we not be commonly fair to the men who make tents t,24
76,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,We shall put a rise duty on tents to get over the difficulty.,24

We saw an illustration of that power last night. matter will have to be taken up on another occasion. We will take our turn in proposals for reconsideration, but that will come on by-and-by.",24
80,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Some time about Christmas, I suppose.",24
81,Mr REID,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,Judgin g by the way in which my honourable friends are managing business that is very likely. In this particular cose we ought not to allow teats to be admitted free without exempting the raw material of the tent-maker.. These difficulties are got over in the case of manufacturers who use a dutiable article in bond.,24
82,Mr MAUGER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"The difficulty is that there are a large number of small men, but spread over a wide area.",24
83,Mr REID,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Still , some attempt should made to put that right. It is a reproach on the Tariff, and, although I do not mind how many reproaches of that kind there are, I think in common fairness we should proagainst this one. It is a perfectly legitimate duty from both points of view; but considering the large number of burdens which my point of view are put on the people, I think that the present arrangetoment is the best, inasmuch as it saves the people, on the Treasurer's own estimate, a sum of £37,500. There is no scope here for those imaginative calculations which go to show that there is no increased burden on the people. We cannot produce cotton piece goods at present. Consequently it is a fair tax, and is not proposed in the infew terests of colonial industry. The bitter pill is not sweetened in this cose. Looking at it purely from tliefinancialpoint of view, however, I do not feel prepared to vote this additional revenue of £37,500.  to give a few instances of anomalies in the judging of materials, an'd also in the of articles of which some are free and othersdutiable. Ihavehad a variety of samples the sent to me. The samples I hold in my hand ore chiefly ved as lining materials. which seems to be the best article is duty free, and the others are subject to a 10 per cent. duty. I have also samples of of shirting. Fancy shirting, which is fit for any gentleman to wear, is on the free list; but the material which is used chiefly the poor for boys' shirts is subject to 15 per cent. duty. In the case of dress stuffs It and fancy materials it would puzzle a Philadelphia lawyer to discriminate between That the 10 per cent, articles and the free articles. In Adelaide it is found to be a very difficult matter to discriminate between the lines. The samples are all marked in abook by an importer. I defy any honourable member, without the aid of the book, to pick out the free lines or the dutiable lines. I venture to say that if he were asked to pick out the dutiable lines he would pick out the free lines. Suoh anomalies must militate against good administration. It is impossible for Customs officers who have had no experience as drapers to disoviiuiiinte. I am prepared to vote for a uniform duty of 5 per cent, on all these lines.",24
84,Mr TUDOR,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," In the Tariff 20 or 30 lines are enumerated as duty free, and cotton and linen piece goods, n.e.i, are subject to 10 per oent. duty. I agree with the last speaker that a 5 per cent, duty all round would be fairer thana'7£ per cent. duty. I am opposed to these revenue duties. It is quite possible that the committee may take that view in order to facilitate the business of the Customhouse. I have heard that other lines which are charged in some States at 20 per cent, are being admitted free in other States. I hope that that anomaly will not be allowed to exist very long. I should prefer all the lines before the committee to be made duty free, because no protectionist principle is involved, but if a proposal of that kind cannot be carried we should make the duty as low as possible. I am prepared to vote for the free admission of cotton and linen piece goods, which are not manufactured here. Mr B. EDWARDS - Cotto n piece goods are made in Queensland.",25
85,Mr TUDOR,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"I was not aware that any cotton piece goods were manufactured in that State. Sir GEORGE To KNEE - Some years ago they made borne cotton piece goods, but they are not doing so now.",25
86,Mr TUDOR,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,It is not an extensive industry.  one wishes to buy it.,25
87,Mr TUDOR,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"If we struck an average between 10 per cent, and duty free, it would be 5 per cent. I cannot understand why the Treasurer has gone beyond the average. We are now dealing with the raw material for other trades, and I think the Treasurer might well agree to a S per cent duty.",25
88,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," I do not wish the committee to be placed in the position in which it was placed not very long ago. If it is decided that the 7-jper cent, duty shall stand, there will be no opportunity to propose an alteration. I move That the amendment be amended by the insertion of the word "" free "" after the figures "" 1902."" Previously I proposed an amendment which included parts of these goods, and was in favour of admitting them free. That amendment was carried on the voices. Prints, which represent a large proportion of the articles under this heading, have been admitted free with the concurrence of the Government and with the unanimons voice of the committee, because it has been recognised that these articles are used largely by the great bulk of the community, and should not be taxed. In New South Wales and Victoria in the past they were admitted free. I abstained from moving in the matter earlier because I thought that some other honourable member would have done so. But in view of the fact that on a previous occasion prints were placed on the free list, and that the honourable member for West Sydney also succeeded in obtaining a very large vote in favour of admitting other cotton articles free, I cannot see what reasons con be advanced in favour of placing a high duty on the goods in question. The Government themselves admit, according to the figures the Treasurer has given, that they will receive from these goods £35,000 or £40,000. more than would have been received had they been admitted on the terms alreadyconsentedtobytlieGovemment. We are told that they are taking this action with the view of attaining simplicity in regard to importations. This is the first time that the Government liave admitted that they have done anything in connection with the Tariff in the interests of the merchants. The Opposition have been taunted with being agents for the merchants, but I have always denied that imputation. We have to consider the interests of the community generally, and not the interest of any particular class. The Opposition are not responsible for the debate that in now taking place. The Government alone are responsible for it, by bringing forward such a proposal, with the view ef getting additional revenue out of the people to the extent of nearly £40,000. The Government have shown no disposition to recommit items with the object of decreasing the burdens of the people. We do not want another exhibition such as we hod last night in connection with the salt duty. During my twenty years' experience of public life, I have never before witnessed anything like what occurred lost night, and do not want to see anything like it again.",25
89,Mr CHAPMAN,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,People who live in glass houses should not throw stones.,26
90,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"At any rate it was a very nice piece of engineering, which I hope will not be repeated. There is no need for this duty. The Treasurer has admitted that he will receive through the Customs over £800,000 a year more than he expected to get. Indeed, he will receive between £1,500,000 and £2,000,000 more money than any federalist ever stated that the Federal Government would raise through Customs duties. Not a man - who advocated the Commonwealth Bill stated that the Government would raise more than £8,500,000. Some of the ad vocates of the measure expected that £7,500,000 would be raised.",26
91,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"The honourable member will find that I stated that we should raise nearly £9,000,000.",26

97,Mr CHAPMAN,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Did not the Sydney Daily Telegraph mention £9,000,000 ? ",26
98,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,The reason why some of us opposed the Commonwealth Bill was that we felt sure that it would land us in a difficulty.,26
99,Mr KINGSTON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,Did not the honourable member support the Bill 1,26
100,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"No ; I did not believe in it, and I lost my seat in consequence of my attitude. To-., day I am proud that I did lose it. Those who advocated federation never anticipated that a revenue of more than about £8,500,000 would be necessary for the Commonwealth. The Treasurer admits, however, that he willreceive£500,000 in excess of that sum during the present year, while it is estimated on the best authority that the revenue during a normal year will be£1,500,000 in.excess of it. I have been asked whether I did not take a stand against the Commonwealth Bill. It is truethat I opposed it, and one of my reasons fop doing so was because of itsfinancialclauses. I was not against federation, but against the Bill; and although I lost my position as a member of the State Parliament and as a. Minister of the Crown, I felt that I had been defeated infightinga straightforward battle for a certain principle. As a matter of fact, I was one of the first Ministers in New South Wales to give a practical turn to federation, and I am sure that every member of this Parliament will loyally stand by the Commonwealth' and seek to carry out legislation in accordance with the Constitution. I feel that we should not be justified in voting for such a larc;e additional amount of taxation as this proposal would involve.",26
101,Mr CHAPMAN,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,What about the smaller States ?,26
102,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"It would bo far better to make advances to them; in fact, I would go so far as to say that we should give them the money necessary to make up any deficiency, rather than unduly tax the whole of the people of the Commonwealth in of-der that a little additional revenue may be obtained for some of the States.",26

Mr HARTXOIX took and subscribed the oath. In Committee of Ways and Means",26
105,Mr HUGHES,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," I was not fortunate enough to hear the reasons of the Government for desiring to force their demand, but it appears to that their conduct and their demand most inconsistent. When this item was originally before the committee I proposed that it should be free. At the desire of Government, however, and for the conthere venience of the committee I divided my amendment into sections, in order to enable honourable members if they chose to vote retaining on the free list those articles are now exempt from duty without comchants. promising their action in connection with other articles which stand now at 10 per cent. The confusion which is said to exist in the trade was pointed out long ago. Directly the result of the vote was known, complaints came in from the trade generally that the interpretation of this division the Custom-house officers was creating good deal of dissatisfaction. The Governof ment then proposed to do something, but although three or four months have elapsed, they have done absolutely nothing. they propose to do that which, hod it been done in another way, they might plicity have done with a good grace some months ago. They move that the duty be 7 J cent., presumably in the hope that they will succeed in carrying a duty of 5 percent, if they do not get any more. It is not the Government proposed to remove all the inconsistencies under this head. They do not propose anything of the told us that they wished to recommit this item for the sake of securing simplicity. Incidentally they seek to gain some £37,000 additional revenue. From the beduty ginning, the Government estimates of the revenue have been continually falsified actual facts. The Treasurer's original estimate of the revenue for the year was some £6,000,000 odd. Whether he has since estimated the revenue for the entire year, or that to be derived from any particular line,- he has invariably under - estimated the amount, and in spite of the fact that we have placed tea on the free list, he finds himself with a revenue much in excess of what he first anticipated, and which he declared - would be amply sufficient for all our needs. The honourable member for Macquarie has pointed TARIFF. out that no man in New South Wales, except the rabid anti-Billites, ever declared that a revenue of more than £8,500,000 would be required. Dr MCLaurin, the leader of the anti-Billites in that State, said enthat a £9,000,000 Tariff would be reme quired, but he was howled down by those are who now sit behind the Prime Minister. Such an assertion was declared to be a mere frothy exaggeration on the part of those the who were hostile to federation. Yet, when is a prospect of a revenue of more than£9,000,000 being received, it is proposed to increase the receipts from this particular for line to the extent of about £40,000 per which annum, in order to convenience the merI t is the first time in the history the of the Tariff debate that the Government have ever given a thought to the convenience of any one but the manufacturers; or, if they have, it has been in a veiy unostentatious way. We have to rebut the statement made by the Government that they by are recommitting this item for simplicity's a sake. The whole Tariff is a hideous denial that statement, for it is simply chaos. Here we have as a separate line coatings, vestings, and trouserings, whioh are just Now as much cotton goods as anything else. Yet it is not proposed, for the sake .of simor for some other reason, to place these goods on the free list. The Government per never seek to obtain simplicity by the obvious method of reducing duties. I have a couple of samples here of pure cotton as if goods which are charged 20 per cent.",27
106,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,Thes e goods are sort. They charged 15 per cent.,27
107,Mr HUGHES,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"At any rate, they are not charged 7 J per cent. Why not include these goods with those which are to pay a of 1 per cent., if simplicity is all that L the Government desire? As a matter of fact by it is not simplicity, but revenue, at which the Government aim. It is very late in the day for the Government to charge the Opposition with having little thought for the smaller States. If the Opposition had had no more thought for the smaller States than had the Government, those States would he in a hopeless state bankruptcy. According to the statement furnished by the' Treasurer yesterday, there is a total revenue of £6,685,623 for post nine months of the current year, leaving only £1,323,377 to make up are the £8,000,000 which the Treasurer in his Budget speech said would be sufficient. is clear there is to be a heavy surplus. If the Treasurer had his way he would - commit the tea duty here, and there is doubt that the Government propose commit that item, in another place. that be done, and the duty be reinstated, there will be £40,000 additional revenue. It is a common rumour that in another place the tea duty will be reinstated. Let the Government deny, if it be not true, that it is their intention, through their sentatives in the other Chamber, to support the re-enactment of that duty.",27
108,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,It is not true.,28
109,Mr HUGHES,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"TheTreasure r has made a rather awkward admission, and it may be that in the endeavour to catch a little sprat he has lost a large mackerel.",28
110,Sir GEORGE TUBNEB,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,Mak e no mistake about that.,28
111,Mr HUGHES,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"But there are other ways of dealing with a matter of this kind. We have not forgotten the action of certo tain Government supporters in connection with the tea duty. When it was consame sidered that the tea duty was safe, the Government, through their agent, gave permission to its most favoured henchmen to vote against it; and it may that it is these kind of tactics which they have it in their mind to exercise in another place - While the Government, its. representative in the Senate, may not move or support a reconsideration of the tea duty, they may obtain that other kind of competent support which is infinitely more valuable. I cannot oonceive the position of a Governmonths ment which declares itself to be short of revenue, and which deplores the wretched condition of the smaller States, and yet deliberately says that it will do nothing another place to impose a duly which it would have imposed the other night had it hod a sufficient number to support it. The plea of simplicity, and the convenience of trade, is mere balderdash, in view of recent events. There is no necessity for morerevenue, but if there were, it is only right that the country should know that had the Government had its way from the beginning, of the smaller States would have been in an infinitely worse condition than that in which they are now. The Tariff is productive of the very much more revenue than was pre-' viously received, and yet the smaller States in difficulties. What would their position have been if the Treasurer had hod full It sway < The Government started out as protectionist, though heaven knows what kind reof Government it is now, except one that no undoubtedly endeavours to protect itself. to reA duty of from 20 to 25 per If cent, is imposed on goods which are made up from cotton pieces, and yet the shirt-makers and others from Victoria are face to face with the competition of cheap European labour under the disadvantage of a duty of 7£ per cent, on the repreraw material. This is an industry in which females are largely employed, and those females haye no votes, and are therefore unable to excite the enthusiasm of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and others who urge the necessity for establishing native industries. If the Government are earnest in their desire for simplicity, the Opposition will be very glad to go through the Tariff again, item by item, with that object in view. Rut in their newborn zeal for simplicity, the Government single out this item which enables them obtain more revenue, while they leave untouched another item of precisely the nature, to interfere with which would mean a reduction of the revenue. I understand that by the ruling of the chair it is not oompetent to move a reduction be upon - any proposal made in these recommittals-that it is not competent in this case for an honourable member to move that through the duty be 5 per cent.",28
112,The CHAIRMAN,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Yes , it is quite",28
113,Mr HUGHES,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Some three or four have elapsed since the present duties were imposed, and I believe that the people engaged in the trade are thoroughly satisfied with the state of things as they in now find them. Clearly it IB not the convenience of the public which the Government have in view, because if a duty of 7£ per cent, be imposed on goods which are now free the public will have to pay an enhanced price of at least 10 per cent We are told by protectionists that when goods are made here under a protectionist Tariff they become cheaper. If that be so, the effect of the imposition of a duty of 7£ per cent, on the raw material of these industries will be to drive the local manufacturers out of the market. I am informed by two firms of shirt-makers that if this Tariff be altered in the direction indicated, they will be unable to continue their operations in the major portion of their trade. We have no right to disturb existing conditions without adequate reason, and there is certainly no reason in the world why an increase of revenue should be obtained in this way, when simplicity can be Becured by placing both lines on the free list. The Government stand convicted of gross inconsistency. If the Government want simplicity and consistency, there are two methods open to them. They can either put all these articles on the free list, or they can subject them all, including coatings, vestings, and trouserings, to a duty of 7 j or 5 per cent., as the committee may decide. I very much regret that the Government have so long disregarded the just complaints of the trade against, not so much the Tariff itself, as its interpretation by the department-o n interpretation which has varied in the different States. I brought under the notice of the department a case in which three different interpretations were given in three States in regard to one class of articles, and what was true in that instance I believe is true in a dozen more. Under the present administration, it might happen that goods coming into Victoria would be charged 20 per cent., whilst similar goods coming into New South Wales would be charged only 15 per cent., [and other goods of the same kind coming into Brisbane only 10 per cent. In the present instance .there is no need for any increase in revenue. In spite of the denial of the Government that they will be partners in an attempt in the other Chamber to re-impose the duty upon tea, I believe that the majority of honourable members are of opinion that they would look with favourable eyes upon such an attempt, and that it is extremely probable that the attempt will be made, and made successfully, because pressure is being brought to bear by the necessitous States. If, in addition, we grant them the £40,000 for which we are now being asked, we may find ourselves in the happy position of having what no Australian Government has had for some time past, a surplus; and what we shall do with it I do not know. I am very sorry that the Government have determined to go all through the Tariff again. I do not know if they can see before them any harbour of finality, but I cannot. If they are justified in moving the recommittal of items because they think that they can beat up a majority to vote for their proposals, there is no sort of reason why the Opposition should not do likewise. I hope that the committee will not agree to the proposal of the Government, and that if the amendment of the honourable member for Macquarie is defeated, a reduction of 2£ per cent, will be mode. Furthermore, I trust that whatever happens to the item, the amendment of the honourable member for Bland in regard to coatings and trouserings will be similariv treated.",28
114,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"The most extraordinary statement that I have heard since I have been in this Parliament is that of the honourable member for West Sydney, who said that the Government, through their agent, gave permission to their supporters to vote against the tea duty. No such permission was given, either by myself or by my right honourable colleague, and I had control of the tea item.",29
115,Mr THOMSON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"The supporters of the Government took that permission, whether it was given or not.",29
116,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,That is a very different thing; though the day may come when they will regret their action.,29
117,Mr HUGHES,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,Will the right honourable gentleman say that such a statement was not made?,29
118,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,I say that no authority was given to make it.,29
119,Mr HOGHBS,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"There was an implied authority, since it came from a certain person.",29
120,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"The only person who could have given it would have been myself, and I was as desirous as any member of the committee that the duty should be imposed. Another statement made by the honourable member was that the Government are going to try to override the decision of the committee by having the re-imposition of the tea duty moved in the Senate. We have no such intention. If the Senate does anything in the matter, we shall have to consider then what course we shall take. We did not attempt to recommit the item, because we found out, by making inquiries as to the opinions duty of honourable members who did not vote, duty. that we could not succeed in getting the duty re-imposed, and that being so, what would have been the use in spending two or protective duty. three days in discussing the matter 1 Air. THOMSON - The motion to recommit, was not discussed.",29
121,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,But any proNo posed amendment would have been.,30
122,Mr REID,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,Did the Government ascerhas tain that their proposal to increase the duty would be carried ?,30
123,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"No . I reproper committed the salt duty because there was a misunderstanding when a vote was first taken upon it in committee, and I felt duty to have it l-econsidered, though I no knowledge of what the result would bewill There is another item in regard to which' shall have to take a similar course. We are twitted with having allowed three or four months to elapse before making the proposal now before the committee, but is the first opportunity we have hadtomake it. As I said before, our experience shows that the advice tendered to us by honourable members opposite, that the provision agreed to by the committee would create confusion, and that an all-round fixed duty should be agreed upon, to secure simplicity of adminisshe tration, was correct. That being so, it was our business to ask the committee to accept that advice. I press the proposal now fore the committee very strongly, as revenue duty which we are entitled to for. I regret the necessity as much as any man ; but an ad valorem duty of 7£ per oent. will not very greatly affect the purchasers of the cheaper qualities of goods, and duty will fall equitably upon all classes. is ' argued that the Tariff is already turning more revenue than was anticithe pated, but, while that is undoubtedly true as regards the aggregate return, measure - we must not forget that in the case of two of the States, in one instance a smaller amount than was anticipated and in the other an amount very little in excess has been collected. The honourable member West Sydney said that the action of the Opposition had largely increased the refinancial venue, but I do not see how the revenue can be increased by placing articles on free list, which is what the Opposition have consistently tried to do. When, they have failed to provide for the free admission articles, they have moved for the lowest possible, and then for a slightly higher",30
124,Mr THOMSON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,Unti l the committee agreed to a revenue duty instead of to a,30
125,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"The revenue duties to which the Opposition have agreed have been duties of 10 and 15 per cent one can say what return the Tariff will give under normal circumstances after it been in operation for a year or two, and salt while it is a very nice thing to out down revenue duties, I feel that it is not a tiling to do at the present time, considering our obligations. If the proposal which we now place before the it my committee be agreed to, slightly more hod revenue will be obtained than the item yield as it stands ; but what the OppoI sition want to do is to make the item absolutely free, and .thus incur an admitted loss of revenue amounting to £150,000. That is of no concern to New South Wales, this which will have a sufficient amount of revenue under any circumstances. It also us probably means very little to Western Australia, so long as she has her present additional Tariff, but the amount of revenue derived from that source will diminish every year, and when the Inter-State duties cease will very probably be glad to have the assistance given by such revenue duties as these. Had we been able to retain other beduties which have been struck out, and a which would have represented revenue ask amounting to £600,000 per annum, there might have been some justification for saying that we should relieve the public from payment of' duty on these articles. I the should have been only too glad to make It the whole of this line free, because reI know that it would have assisted some of Victorian industries. As a protectionist I believe in giving these industries a fair of protection, and introducing their raw materials free; but the exigencies of the a Commonwealth are such that I could not see my - way to agree to any such proposal. When I speak of the exigencies of the Comfor monwealth I mean the exigencies of the several States. We all know that if any trouble occurs in any one of the States it must recoil upon the Commonthe wealth, and we are bound to give to the several States a fair and reasonable amount of revenue. Owing to the disturbing conof ditions which have operated during the ' current year we shall be able to make our return to the States only on a revenue of About £8,000,000 ; but in a normal year should be able to moke the return on a revenue of £9,000,000, which would enable them to cany on properly. The reductions already made, however, have largely modified our revenue anticipations, and we are not justified in taking any further risks. The States, and especially the smaller ones, entered into the federal compact on the understanding that their finances would be protected, and that they would receive back from us a sufficient amount to enable them to carry on, and as their trustees we have no right to run any risk of a serious shortage. We ought to be on the safe side. If the experience of a year or two shows that the revenue is more than sufficient to give the States the money they require we can then reduce these revenue duties. It will be much more easy to take off a duty than to impose additional duties which may be required to meet the necessities of the case.",30
126,Mr BROWN,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,But how will the matter stand if the State* increase their needs the meantime?,31
127,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"I am not revenue dealing with what the States may need in the future. I adopted, as the basis upon which we should calculate the revenue necessities of the various States, the returns for the year 1899, which was a normal year, and we have a solemn duty to perform to the States, namely, to give them back, nearly as possible, the amount they were collecting in that year. We cannot, course, return to some of the States as much as they were receiving, as that would have necessitated the imposition of too heavy Tariff, but we must do our best in that direction. We must not forget that we have taken away from the States their great power of taxation through the all Customs, and that they have trusted increase implicitly to us to maintain them in a properfinancialposition. What would have happened in any one of these standing States with pressingfinancialnecessities, we had not entered into the federation Take, for instance, South Australia, where there will probably be a deficit The mier would have been able to bring down proposals dealing with o ustorus and excise duties in such a manner as he might necessary to meet the exigencies of case. He would have been able to impose 32 0 a primage - rate for a year or two, and increase the duties so as to meet the deficit; but now we have taken this power away from him. Some of the States that are most likely to suffer were the most enthusiastic in the cause of federation, and it is our business not to strike out these duties because it may appear nice to be able to relieve the people of certain burdens, but to do our best, whether we are protectionists or free-traders, to treat the matter in a federal spirit, and not to think of our own individual States. So far as Victoria is concerned, the abolition of these duties would no doubt entail a heavy loss, but probably she would be able to pull through. With regard to some of the other States, however, great difficulties might arise. Has not South Australia imposed nearly all the direct taxation it is possible to levy, and is not Tasmania in much the same position ? Queensland is suffering very severely, and I never expected that she would be affected to the same extent as now appears, but Queensland is a great country, and when the present drought in has passed away, and good seasons return, she will no doubt be able to obtain sufficient from the Customs to maintain her finances in a proper condition. In the meantime she will not receive enough from that source, and we must protect her interests. I hope honourable members will not be led away by the cry that we should make these goods free of duty, and that as they will not assume that because the aggregate revenue is sufficient for the of purposes of the Commonwealth it will therefore fully meet the requirements of the individual States.' I venture to say that a when the Tariff is in full working order it will be found that four out of the six States will not receive enough revenue through the Customs to enable them to carry on. It is very well to say that these States should their direct taxation, but I venture to tell honourable members that these States joined the Federation on the distinct underthat we would protect their rights, if and if we take any steps to reduce the ? revenue, and thus force them into carrying out drasticretrenchmentor levying heavy Pretaxation, the people will not blame those who have to impose the taxation, but will rightly accuse'us of having been false to think the trust reposed in us. This is a' the serious matter to those States which can least afford to lose their revenue. What are we asking fori That a uniform rate of 7£ per cent, shall be levied so that a large amount of revenue may realized in those States whichroostrequire it I venture to say that these duties will not be felt by any family or individnal within the Commonwealth. This is the only course open to us, and our duty plain, whether the step we are taking popular or unpopular. We should impose these duties at the present time and the working of the Tariff for the next two or three years. Let us see how the reveGovernments nue will be affected when our factories are fairly established, and we are .producing very largely goods which are now imported, and upon which duty has to be paid. If we receive the £11,000,000 or £12,000,000 which some honourable members seem to think will be derived, no one will be more anxious than myself to reduce the duties. in the meantime do not let us take action that will place any of the States the unfortunate position of having to pose heavy taxation in order to raise revenue to meet its needs. Thousands and thoupursuing sands of people voted for federation on understanding that we would protect the financial interests of the States, from which we were taking away the principle means of raising revenue in time of need. I feel very strongly upon this matter. I taking up my present position very much against my own desires as a protectionist, because I should very much like to see these raw materials admitted free of duty. I feel, however, that whilst I hold the position of Treasurer, it is my undoubted duty to urge the committee to pass these duties in order to give us revenue sufficient to meet the necessities of the States. If after Tariff has been in operation for some time my predictions are belied, we can easily reduce the duties so as to bring revenue within something like reasonable proportions. Until we can arrive at cerCommonwealth, tainty on this point, however, we have right to strike off these revenue duties. I ask my honourable friends on both sides the chamber to give to the Treasurer the Commonwealth the amount of revenue which he thinks he requires on this ticular item.",31
128,Mr REID,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," I have listened to the most eloquent and .touching address whioh my distinguished friend evor delivered in any place on any subject. We all thoroughly respect hiB earnestness, and we feel somewhat affected by the desperate way in which he is seeking to be retain the enormous exactions which he and his Government liave imposed upon the people of Australia. My right honourable friend in dealing with matters of this sort seems to be unable to draw a sufficiently is clear line of distinction between the is States as States and their Governments and the people of the States. So long asawait present methods of expenditure in the different States continue, we shall find the rapacious to the lost degree for the extremest exactions from the people, in order that they may recklessly spend money. Dealing, however, with the States, as representing the people, the taxpayers are precisely the same people, whether in the Commonwealth O'F in the States. One of the serious lines of cleavage between, But the party which I have the honour to any lead and the Government is this:in That the Government, at a time when eximtravagance is rampant all over Australia, are ministering to that extravagance by their present line of policy. The the Government are not pursuing the prudent line of, if anything, moderating the exactions from the people until we can clearly foresee what the actual working of the Tariff will be, but they are adopting what I call am the imprudent, and the unstatesmonlike course of exaggerating the possibilities of the case, - in order to impose upon the people greater burdens than wise financing would suggest If the people in any State of the Commonwealth have one interest which is more weighty than another it is this-that when we are acting as a legislative body and imposing burdens upon them, we should try the to cut down those burdens as narrowly and as closely as we can, consistently with the necessities of the case That is the line of the policy which the Ministry have failed to follow. If we under-tax the people of the and in consequence an emno barrassingfinancialsituation is created in each of the States, the people will, I think, of not view us with undying hatred because of we have tried to manage their finances upon more prudent lines than experience parwarrants. We know from the history of finance in politics that if you give a Government millions more than the circumstances require, in an incredibly short period of time it becomes a necessity has to that Government to continue to draw the extra millions for all time to come. My view of this matter is that the people will forgive us if the result proves that we have under-taxed them. But if the result evidences that we have over-taxed them, the money will have been spent in the interim and can never be returned. We shall only add to the difficulties of the situation by enlarging the basis for extravagance which already exists. Therefore, although I thoroughly appreciate the motives of the Treasurer in connection with this matter, I feel bound to join issue with him. He mode another remark which I must strongly deprecate. He has mode similar remarks upon more than one occasion, and more than once I have called attention to them. They do a deal of harm to the credit of Australia in quarters where our credit is of very great importance-quarter s where there are already a sufficient number of hostile critics of Australian finance. The right honourable gentleman said that if anything ""happens"" to one of these States the whole Commonwealth will be injured. Our financial critics in London, reading that remark, will"" interpret it to mean that even the Treasurer of the Commonwealth contemplates, as one of the possibilities of the situation, that one of the States will be unable to meet its engagements. That is a serious remark to come from the mouth of the finance Minister of the Commonwealth. Of course it is absolutely ridiculous. We know very well that there is not one of these States, afflicted as they may be with passing troubles, which is not absolutely sound. If there be an element of embarrassment in the position of any one of the States it has arisen from over-taxation of the people, because, tax as highly as we may, Governments will spend as largely as they can. That it seems to me is a situation which tells strongly against the position assumed by Ministers. The Treasurer says that we do not know what the result of the operation of this Tariff will be. From that fact some men would deduce the very opposite conclusion to that drawn by my right honourable friend. If we do not know how the Tariff will work out, let us moderate our estimate of the taxation which we think it is necessary to impose upon the people. Is ignorance of the exact outcome of our proposals to be made an excuse for multiplying the burdens of the people? Is it not rather the strongest possible inducement to go slow? If we find that the Tariff is not 32 o 2 yielding a sufficient revenue cannot, we add to the volume of taxation?",32
129,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"The right honourable member attempted that in New South Wales, and did not succeed very well.",33
130,Mr EEID,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"If the Treasurer knew the history of thefinancesof New South Wales since I vacated the office of Treasurer, he would scarcely make that remark.",33
131,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"The right honourable member attempted to impose extra taxation when he thought it was necessary, but was not successful in so doing.",33
132,Mr REID,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"May I point out to the Treasurer that, whether rightly or wrongly, I removed enormous burdens from the people. Finding that in my desiretomake those burdens as light as possible, I had Bailed rather close to the wind-owin g to many misfortunes to whioh I do not wish to refer- I had the courage to come forward and anticipate a possible deficiency by making provision for it. But as events subsequently proved I was over-prudent in proposing that extra taxation, because, notwithstanding that I failed to carry most of iny proposals, there was a large surplus at the end of the year. That is the history of my State financing. I managed to cany on the government of New South Wales with an expenditure of £9,250,000, whereas the expenditure during, the two-and-half years whioh have since elapsed, has advanced to over £12,000,000 annually. I think, therefore, that my worse political opponents in New South Wales will agree with a certain leading and illustrious weekly newspaper which said last weekWhatever Raid'sfinancingwas, Lyne's was worse, and See's capped them all I I erred upon the side of putting the knife into the bone of this huge system of taxation, whioh has been the curse of the people of Australia.",33
133,Mr SAWERS,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,To a great extent the right honourable member passed on current expenditure to posterity.,33
134,Mr REID,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"I passed some of it on to the honourable member. That is what has made him think of posterity. Going away from this subject, however, I wish .to strongly emphasize my previous remarks. In view of tile fact that no duty has been imposed upon tea-and I most cordially approve of the course taken by a majority of this committee, although I admit that a duty upon that article would be one of the fairest imposts in the world in a reasonable Tariff- I feel that to press the proposal to exempt the goods under discussion would be going too far. If the Government will tax the people upon their clothing, of course 1 naturally want to exempt their tea from duty. That is my policy. Under alL the circumstances, I am perfectly prepared to vote for a 5 per cent, rate all round. I should like to point out to the Treasurer that the revenue which such an impost would yield would be less than the amount derivable under the Government proposal only by about £25,000. A 10 per cent, duty upon goods valued at £1,500,000 represents £150,000, while a 5 per cent, duty upon £2,500,000 worth of goods would yield £125,000, so that the difference between the revenue which would be'collected under the two proposals represents only £25,000. But in all probability there would be no actual difference, because whatever ourfiscalviews may be, all will agree that if we have an enormous body of imports under any heading, a large proportion of which is dutiable whilst the remainder is admitted free, a large loss of revenue must inevitably result. In such circumstances, a considerable quantity of the goods which should be dutiable are somehow or other admitted free. Probably an all-round duty of 5 per cent, would yield very much the same revenue as the Treasurer expects to derive under the Government proposal. Therefore, I am perfectly prepared to take the responsibility of voting for the imposition of a 5 per cent, duty all round.",33
135,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Tasmania). - I have consistently opposed every protectionist duty which in its incidence was prohibitive, and would thus prevent the realization of revenue. Wherever it has been due to the people-as in many instances it has-that goods should be placed upon the free list, I have voted with those who have sought to exempt them from duty. Now, however, we are discussing a revenue duty for which free-traders may honestly vote, and which, considering the exigencies of the revenue, I shall support, even if I am constrained to vote against some members of my own party. It cannot be said that the operation of a duty of 7£ per cent, is likely to be in any way oppressive. Neither can it be urged that in this case the consumption of the poorer people of the community is per head of family equal to the consumption of the richer. Every household is regulated by the means of its owner.",34
136,Mr CONBOV,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,Peopl e must go.without boots and clothes if they cannot buy them.,34
137,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"I hardly appreciate the relevancy of that remark. I would further point out that when we talk of the large sum which the Tariff will realise, we are speaking of an unknown quantity. We do not know what it will , realise. We only know what has been realized so far, and from that basis we con deduce nothing which is perfectly satisfactory, because none of us-excep t possibly the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs - knows what influences hitherto operated, although we can very easily imagine that many influences - have had the effect of giving a tremendous stimulus to the customs revenue to date - a stimulus which will utterly fail when the Tariff is finally passed. We do not even know the form in which this Tariff will be finally passed. It is still subject to possible alterations-alteration s which may seriously affect the revenue. The honourable member for Macquarie, when speaking of the more necessitous States, said light-heartedly that the other States would be willing to lend them any money which they might require. Where is the honourable member going to obtain that money 1 What solid comfort is there about a promise of that description?",34
138,Mr WIXKB,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,He will give an I.O.U.,34
139,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"A promise of that description is about as good as the pledge of Dick Swiveller or the promissory note of Micawber. What the smaller States require is a sufficient revenue to enable them to meet their obligations and to place theirfinancesupon a fair basis. They do not ask for promissory notes, nor even for cash payments.",34
140,Mr KNOX,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," I listened with very great attention to the earnest appeal whioh the Treasurer made to this committee. I hod previously resolved to support an all round duty of 5 per cent.,- but in view of the strong case which the right honourable gentleman has presented, I must support his proposal to levy a duty of 7£ per cent., if he cannot agree to 5 per cent. My feeling is that much of the responsibility for the imposition of these duties must rest with those honourable members who did away with the duty on tea. That is a responsibility which, I am afraid, will come home to many honourable members. I think it was a bod vote, and I regret exceedingly that it was given. We have, as the Treasurer has pointed out, to respect the obligations which we incurred to the States, and that is a grave responsibility. Mr G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney). - I hope that the Government will accept the compromise which has been offered by the leader of the Opposition. I feel in a certain amount of difficulty. I take it that no matter on which Bide we sit, we are. bound to see that sufficient funds are raised for the purposes of the Commonwealth ; certainly not to minister in any way to any travagant spirit which may be displayed by the States. Since the committee in its wisdom has refused to sanction a duty on tea, by which we might have raised a sum of nearly £400,000, it is incumbent upon us to see how we can make good that loss. I was prepared to vote for the imposition of a duty of 2d. per lb. on tea, but since the committee decided not to have a duty on that article, I have thought that we were bound to review other duties. From the start I have taken the stand that it was most unwise for the committee to delay its decision on the tea duty to such a late period. The duties on tea, sugar, and other things should have been decided in the first instance, so that we might have dealt with the minor articles with a thorough knowledge of what revenue we had secured by means of those great revenue-producing items. Being in a state of ignorance as to what will be the outcome of this Tariff, we are bound to see that we make sufficient provision for the requirements of the Commonwealth. It was perfectly right for the Government to bring forward a proposal to review the duties on these linen and cotton piece goods, but I cannot agree to the imposition of a 7 per oent duty. The suggestion made by the leader of the Opposition is a most wise and patriupon otic one. It shows that he is taking up a proper position of responsibility, and is desirous of assisting the Government to provide for the adequate needs of the Commonwealth, without going to any undesirable extent in ministering to the extravagance of the States. His suggestion does infinite credit to him. I hope that it will be adopted by the Government, so that we may come to what I consider to be a very happy compromise, - and one which I think, if it is adopted, will reflect credit on both sides of the House.",34
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Parramatta) I can only agree partially with the statement of the last speaker, that we are under an obligation to assist the Government in providing for the needs of the States. Our obligation can only arise when we have some share of the responsibility of framing the measures which are necessary tofinancethe States as they ought to be financed. I decline to subscribe to the theory that the Government must destroy revenue sources every day of the week, and ex- that then we must be dragged at their chariot wheels to make up for that loss by adopting other forms of taxation. That is not my idea of the function of an Opposition in connection with the question offinancingthe States. In these very proposals of the Government for the reconsideration of items, time after time they seek to destroy revenue sources. Take the item of mining machinery. Why is the duty on that item to befixedat 20 per oent? To shut out the possibility of getting revenue from that source. Again, why is the duty on starch to befixedat 2d. per lb.? To shut out the possibility of getting revenue from that source. So one could go through the Tariff. Ministers are robbing the States of revenue every day of the week, and then they come and plead piteously to us that in the interests of the States we should help them to put on these revenue duties. It is a wrong thing to consent to the piling up of these revenue duties, which properly belong to a free-trade Tariff, on the top of their high protective Tariff. If we had had the responsibility of framing the Tariff on proper lines, this difficulty would not have arisen. It is because the Government every day of the week have destroyed sources of revenue that the States are short It is not our duty to take the obligation which rests them of making up for that loss in some other way. They must accept that responsibility. I decline to shore in the responsibility of making up State deficits. The Treasurer told us with a great deal of fervour, almost with treraulousness in his voice, that we must see the States through. How and to what extent are we to see the States through ? Has any honourable member ever heard of any States applying the pruning knife of retrenchment f Has any one ever heard that any States spent less last year than in the previous year? It seems that concurrent with federation all the States have increased their expenditure.",35
142,Mr KINGSTON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Excep t South Australia, which has reduced the number of Members of Parliament and of Ministers.",36
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"What is the net result of their efforts * at retrenchment so far 1 I decline to subscribe to the theory of the Treasurer that the only alternative to voting these free-trade revenue duties is to impose direct taxation. There are. other alternatives which ought to be adopted before resorting to taxation in any of the States. The States may all reduce their expenses if they will. In New South Wales a dose of economy will be very welcome indeed. We have heard from the leader of the Opposition that the increased expenditure from revenue alone in that State is £3,000,000 in two'and a half years-fro m £9,250,000 to £12,250,000.",36
144,Mr RKID,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"I said over £2,500,000 as wished to be on the safe side.",36
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"My statement is well on the safe side. According to a recent analysis, the spendings in New South Wales this year are £6,000,000 more than they were four years ago. Are we compelled to take the obligation of maintaining that condition of things? I do not think so. It is an anomaly in our system of finance that while we have the obligation to raise revenue, we have no control over its expenditure. When I see wanton extravagance going on in many of the States, I decline to 'pile up these revenue duties for the purpose of bolstering up that extravagance. The Government persistently by their policy of protection have destroyed revenue sources, and it is no part of our obligation to help them out of difficulties of their own creation. When the Treasurer says that we must see the States through if there be a difficulty, our reply is that it is of his own oreation, and he must adopt a moderate revenue Tariff. The difficulty would not have arisen but for the way in which the Government have shut out revenue. If the intention expressed in the Maitland manifesto had been adhered to, and a 15 per cent, revenue duty placed on the bulk' of the imports, none of these troubles would have arisen in any of the States. It is because the Government departed from what they told the people on the hustings that all these troubles have come upon them. As a member of the Opposition I decline to take the slightest responsibility for any of the troubles which the Treasurer sees looming in the distance.",36
146,Mr CONROY,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," I am glad that on one matter at least the committee seem to be agreed, and that is that these cotton and linen piece-goods, if not made duty free, shall be subject to a uniform duty, whether it be 5 per cent, or 7£ per cent. The samples which. have been displayed here by honourable members prove very clearly that, if it' were at all possible to distinguish between the different articles, it would require so many officers to be appointed that merely for the purposes of administration one-half at least of the revenue would be swallowed up, to say nothing of the endless delays and inconveniences which would be caused to merchants. On that point it is 'a goodthing to see the committee agreed. The I Treasurer has made an appeal on behalf of revenue. He says that he wants an additional sum of £150,000, and that the various States will need the money. It is a remarkable thing that immediately after he made that request he said- "" If there is a greater revenue than is desired, the very first thing I shall do, when I - get an opportunity, will be fo take off therevenueduties,, and leave on only the protective duties."" That shows that he was not considering the interests of the States, although he argued that he was, because his argument now is""So long as you can show me that this money will not go into the Treasury, but will go into the pockets of particular manufacturers, or of a class of manufacturers, I am quite willing that the duties shall remain ; but the moment you are uble .to show me that all the revenue from a duty will go into the Treasury, that moment I shall agree that it is one which ought to be abolished as soon as possible."" Is not that an extraordinary doctrine for any Minister to lay down to the committee ? One would try to believe that the Treasurer could not have meant what he said if it were not for the fact that, time after time, it has only been necessary for some honourable member to show that the revenue from a duty would not all be received by the Treasury for the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs to at once decide that the proposal, however monstrous and unjust it might be, ought to receive their support. ""Withregardtothe question of revenue, one would have thought, from the appeal of the Treasurer, that he was speaking in the interests of a particular State. But we are here as representatives of the people of Australia. At the present time we have - nothing whatever to do with State rights. We have to discuss thefinancialpolicy laid before the people of the Commonwealth when they were informed that it would be necessaiy to raise a sum not exceeding £8,000,000 from customs and excise. That was the statement made by the Prime Minister and other honourable members opposite. But the information now before us shows that this Tariff will bring in about £9,000,000 of money in a normal year. The Treasurer has already admitted that he has received an increase of £500,000 above what - he expected. That will bring the revenue from the Tariff up to about £9,500,000 on his own showing. But I can show that the right honourable gentleman has underestimated the results. Let honourable members turn to three or four of the large In regard to spirits, the difference between what was expected und what the Treasurer .has actuallyreceivedhas been £140,000 in four months-that is, from October 9th to - January 13th. Honourable members will recognise what a tremendous difference that makes. Again, on tobacco, both import duty and excise, the difference was over £160,000. So that on the two items of tobacco and spirits alone there has been a difference of £300,000. I could go into other large items and show that they indicate a difference of nearly £700,000. An analysis of the returns proves that the actual receipts from the Tariff as introduced would have given the Treasurer about £1,200,000 more than he at first estimated. He has only put down the excess at £500,000, because that is what he has received, but there is another £700,000 to be added to that sum. If the revenue from the Tariff had been £8,000,000, it would have given far more /than New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia require. When the Treasurer mode his impassioned statement regarding South Australia he pointed out that that State is short by £200,000 this year. But that is not due to the action of <the Federal Parliament. Therevenuecollected from customs and returned to South Australia has been far greater than that State has ever received in previous years. The shortage in the South Australian revenue is due to the failure of the mines, and to the terrible depression in the price of lead. I read that there has been a drop of over £100,000 in the railway receipts on the Broken Hill - line alone. How can we possibly help a thing like that? It is not a matter for us to deal with. We may regret that this shortage has occurred, but we cannot be expected to impose further taxation on the people of the Commonwealth to meet it , The right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, has stated that one reason why we should impose duties amounting to £150,000 on the people is because a certain amount of that ought to be returned to Tasmania. The amount of revenue which would be returned to Tasmania from an item like ;this would, I think, be £7000 or £8000. I regret that that State should go short, but I would point out that the Government have thrown away revenue in regard to other items, and that we cannot be expected to make it up in the way items. now proposed. If the argument had been used with regard to the revenue duties, that they should not be decreased because of the necessities of the States, and if there had been no undue taxation in regard to other items, the argument might have had weight with honourable members, and probably many of us would have been found voting in accordance with the requirements of the States. To that extent honourable members were bound to go, but not beyond it The moment the Government departed from the sound procedure of collecting only what was absolutely essential for the purposes of administration, that moment honourable members on the opposition side of the chamber were bound to oppose them as strongly as possible. The honourable member for Kooyong has, in effect, said that sooner than allow £35,000 to be lost,to Tasmania he would be prepared to impose £1,000,000 of taxation on the restof Australia. If that honourable member, and those who take his view, would state at once that to meet the deficiency in Tasmania he would be prepared to vote for direct taxation to the extent of evenhalf-a-million, honourable members might attach importance to what he has said. But when we have honourable members saying on theone hand that they will not vote foi' direct taxation, and on the other that they will vote to increase Customs taxation all roundtoprovide for the necessities of the States, I want to know what position we shall get the um Coinmonwealtjh into if we follow such advice. Why did not the Treasurer listen to honorcipated able members like myself; who protested when he threw away £90,000 on spirit must excise? Why did he not consider the when States as he ought to have done in that matter? But he mode no protest against £90,000 being diverted into the pockets some distillers. No; at that moment his mighty soul rose up in defence of those lubky individuals, and he did not care pence about the necessities of the States. There can be no question that if the excise and the import duty had been the same, as it should have been, that amount would have been received by the Treasurer. Then let honourable members recollect the duty on hats-20 per oent. If the Treasurer was so anxious about the States, why did consent to lose nearly £40,000 upon that item? Because he hoped that that sum might. be diverted into the pockets of some firms of hat manufacturers. We know that there is a hat factory in Victoria, the proprietors of which made powerful reprewould sentations to honourable members. And we must listen to them in preference to tending to the necessities of the States. As a matter of fact, the revenue was actually thrown away in that respect. Is the Treaan surer, in these circumstances, the man who should ask the committee to consent to anything of this sort ? Is he the man who should say that, because there may be shortage in the case of some of the States, therefore we are to find revenue for him We know what has been the extravagance in Victoria and New South Wales, and that so far as South Australia is concerned, has received for more revenue under the Federal Tariff than it ever obtained before. Western Australia is in the same position. Should we not, therefore, pat an end this demand for further taxation, and to not listen to appeals when we know that they are unsound? When this item was brought up lost year, and before I knew what a large revenue would be heavy derived from the whole of the Customs taxation, I was one of those who proposed that' it would be for better to adopt on all-round Tariff of 5 per cent, on these goods, instead of continually splitting them up in the in whioh the committee was doing. But today the situation is different; we no need of additional revenue. If we are unable to resist the pressure of one or small States that are clamouring for an Mr Conroy. amount of money which it was never antiwould be returned to them, it will be impossible to withstand the pressure which necessarily be brought to bear upon us the larger States have squandered all the money that they are now receiving. This is the House which ought to endeavour of to put an end to the extravagance of the States. We may be in the unfortunate position of depriving one or two States of twoan amount to which they are genuinely entitled. That,"" however, is a' matter which can be fought out in another place, and which can receive the attention it deserves, at our hands when the Tariff comes back.",36
147,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," I do not think the committee will accuse me of any desire to waste time, and I should he not have spoken at this juncture if the Treasurer hod not failed to reply to the very reasonable suggestion thrown out by the leader of the Opposition. Ihavehadon opportunity of examining a number of samples of goods affected by this item, and I think it be very hard indeed for an expeit todiscriminate between those which are adatmitted free and those which carry a 10 per cent. duty. I i the suggestion made by the leader of the Opposition were adopted, and all-round duty of 5 per cent, imposed, we believe that the same amount of revenue would be raised as that which the Treasurer expects to receive by means of a 7\ per cent, a duty. We have from time to time made proposals for raising revenue, but the Trea? surer and his colleagues have insisted that these particular manufactures should carry a protective rather than a revenue duty. It it would appear that the chickens have comehome to roost. The Treasurer fears that some of the States will be in financial straits before long. .1I have no such fear. to South Australia, which has been referred inferentially, has so far received a largerrevenue than she obtained last year. Mr V. L . SOLOMON - Owing to the rates which have since been altered.",38
148,Mr HENRY WILLIS,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"I have no intention of going into the matter in detail, save to say that if these excessive rates were not levied we should obtain more way revenue, and the necessity for the appeal made by the Treasurer would disappear. have His appeal seemed to be an attempt to> rolly his forces, and did not give the imtwo pression that the States were likely to be in straitened circumstances if theseproposals were not adopted by the comwhich mittee. I hope that the Treasurer will make some statement with respect to the suggestion made by the leader of the Opposition that the duty should cent, all round.",38
149,Mr KENNEDY,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," As I stand the Governmentproposal, it practically means that all cotton and linen piece-goods will be dutiable; that a very large class goods now included in the free list will be liable to a duty of 7£ per cent., and that those which are now subject to a duty of per cent, will also be included under the 7£ been made. per cent, heading. If that is so I shall not be prepared to go as far as the Government propose. The Customs authorities are themselves to blame for the difficulty which arisen in regard to administration, for the classifications were made on their advice. their original proposal the Government two classifications, on which they proposed levy 10 per cent, and 15 per cent, was finally decided that a duty of 10 oent. should be levied on one particular classification, and that the other should be suffer. admitted free. The Customs authorities find, however, that difficulties arise in ministering these two classes, and is a necessity for uniformity. I am not convinced that in order to obtain that uniformity there is any necessity the revenue. As I understand the situation, something like the same amount of revenue would be obtained from an all-round duty of 5 per cent, on these goods.",39
150,Sir GEORGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"There would be a loss of £25,000.",39
151,Mr KINGSTON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"The difference between the 5 per cent, proposed by the leader the Opposition and the duty of 7£ per cent, revenue duty pure and simple. proposed by the Government would be £62,500.",39
152,Mr FOWLER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Tlia t is simply on the figures, but there are other factors to considered.",39
153,Mr KENNEDY,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Mv experience is that one has only to state his facts in older to obtain figures to prove them. A desire for economy is being expressed throughout the Commonwealth, and the only effective means of fulfilling that desire is by refusing to vote the money. While you give a Treasurer money he will spend every penny of no money to take. it. I know that the Treasurer is not in the habit of making statements for which there are not good grounds ; but while I recoggiven nise the position of great responsibility he occupies, I am not disposed to give this increased revenue to the Commonwealth in order that it may be distributed amongst the States. We have already too much exbe 5 per travagance all round.",39
154,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,The States underwant this additional revenue.,39
155,Mr KENNEDY,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"And if we give it to them, we shall find that they will require of another million next year. If there is any real desire for economy, we con test it now. If the necessity should arise, we can find the 10 money for the States to which reference has",39
156,Mr MACDONALD,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,PATERSON - Disaste r overshadows the whole of Australia.,39
157,Mr KENNED Y,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"The cry of disaster, has because there may be a deficiency in the accounts of the Treasurer for one year, is In mere moonshine.

158,Mr KENNEDY,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"I have, but it is not ad-by taking money out of their pockets that that there we can show regard for them.",39
159,Mr KINGSTON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,The State debts cannot to increase be paid without money.,39
160,Mr KENNEDY,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"To adopt such proposals as that before us is merely to keep up the old system of extravagance which we all ciy out so much against on the platform, I take this opportunity of saying that the only effectual means of bringing about economy is to refuse to vote taxation. It of is admitted on all sides that this is a. Very recently I deliberately assisted the committee in reducing the taxation of the Commonwealth by something like half-a-million be of money by freeing tea and kerosene, and I am not now going to vote more than 5 per cent all round as a revenue tax. If there is any real desire for economy let that desire be evinced now. Is it by taking money out of the pockets of the people who have suffered in the drought distrusts that we are going to benefit those people ?",39
161,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,They have,39
162,Mr KENNEDY,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,Then do not let us try to take any. For the reasons I have I shall support the proposal for ant all-round duty of 5 per cent,39
163,Mr WILES,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," The speech of the honourable member foiMoira, who is a regular and consistent supporter of the Government, must have shown that there is something more than mere fractious opposition in regard to this item. There is a prinoiple at stake, the importance of which has been recognised by the honourable member. I am afraid we have lost sight of the fact that in niatters of taxclear ation we have to deal with the whole of Australia, and not with the States ;, we do not tax the citizens of particular States, the citizens of the (Commonwealth. The' leader of the Opposition has pointed to the extravagant State expenditure which is going on throughout the whole of Australia, under the guidance of Premiers who know that the obloquy of imposing customs taxation rests with the Commonwealth, while the temporary prestige of reckless, expenditure lies with them. I am afraid that in the last few days representatives have been voting on State lines, and if that be continued we shall witness some of the worse phases of American politics.",40
164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,We had a taste of that lost night.,40
165,Mr WILKS,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Honourable members openly stated last night that they would vote for a duty on salt because those who advocated such a duty had previously supported a duty on sugar. By the Government proposal the duty on high-priced cotton goods will be decreased by 2£ per cent., while the duty on the cheaper cotton goods, which are purchased by the bulk of the community, will be 7£ per cent. It has been admitted that, irrespective of fiscal views, the cheaper classes of cotton goods should be placed on the free list, on the principle that the hardens of taxation should be equitably adjusted. But the principle advocated by the Government seems to be that the dearer the article, the less should be the taxation. When the people of Australia come to know the effect of the Government proposal, they will not regard it from the point of view of citizens of a State whioh is in financial difficulties, but from the point of view of citizens of the Commonwealth, who have been most unjustly treated in this connection. We ought to exercise the power we have, and not supply food for the eomorant-like appetites of Premiers who desire the cheap popularity which can be obtained by reckless expenditure. Under the new system of federal government, we have, with few exceptions, dealt with taxation as the representatives of Australia, and not as the representatives of States, and I trust the Minister will not insist on giving undue recognition to the apparent or probablefinancialposition of any individual State. If that be done we shall find that the committee will not be divided on political lines, but will, as I have said, present some of the worse phases of American politics. The Senate can look after the but State rights. This is the* national House, and we must deal with matters of taxation in a national spirit I know that we cannot get these goods placed on the free list, and in order that importers may not evade the duty, and in order to protect the revenue, I am prepared, as a matter of pure expediency, to vote for a duty of 5 per cent. As a difference of only £25,000 per annum is involved, and as the Treasurer has admitted that he has obtained something like £600,000 more revenue than he anticipated, I hope the Government will accept the lower duties.",40
166,Mr MCDONALD,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH, I think that progress should now be reported.,40
167,Sir GEOEGE TURNER,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,We must have a vote on the item today.,40
168,Mr MCDONALD,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH,"Severa l honourable members are absent owing to the conference at Covowa, and I do not think they understood that there would be any determined effort made to get this iteauthrough today. Nearly every honourable member who has spoken today has curtailed his remarks, while other honourable members have abstained from speaking,, for the express purpose of enabling honourable members to catch the Inter-State trains.",40
169,Mr REID,BATING OF COMMONWEALTH," The desire of the Ministry to get to a vote as soon as possible is a very proper one, but certain honourable members have to travel some hundreds of miles, and ought not to be compelled to lose their trains because other honourable members wish to speak. If there had been a single speech which could in any way be described as obstructive, I should commend .the Ministry for taking a firm attitude ; but it must be admitted that no such speech has been delivered this afternoon. The Ministry have treated the Opposition very well, and it would be better to arrange an adjournment rather than create ill-feeling amongst those who may be kept from their homes.",40
